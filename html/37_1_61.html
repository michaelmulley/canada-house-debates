<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP)</B> moved that Bill 
C-203, an act to amend the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (unpaid 
wages to rank first in priority in distribution) be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I would like to say at the outset what a 
rare and wonderful thing it is for an opposition backbencher to 
be given the opportunity to bring forward one of his or her own 
private member's bills for debate in the House.  I think most 
members would agree that one of the most satisfying aspects of 
our job is when we can actually shape the course of the debate 
for at least one hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most private members' bills that are brought forward are very 
thoughtful and very well researched and seek to address a very 
important subject brought to the member's attention, usually by 
people in his riding or across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am very disappointed and I begin the debate with a 
certain element of sadness.  My private member's bill seeks to 
right an historic wrong but was not deemed to be votable by the 
ad hoc committee that meets regularly to deal with private 
members' business.  This is a criticism we in the House should 
observe and it is something that should be rectified.  When a 
private member, no matter what party he or she belongs to, 
opposition or government, brings forward an important issue on 
behalf of their constituents we should be giving it a bit more 
consideration and allow the issue to get to committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In speaking to Bill C-203, a bill to amend the bankruptcy act, I 
want to dedicate the effort we made to bring this issue to debate 
to the workers at the Giant mine in Yellowknife.  As members may 
know, the history of the Giant mine has been a tragic one.  It 
has involved a great deal of labour unrest.  Many workers have 
suffered at the hands of an absentee landlord, namely foreign 
ownership.  Nine people died in an explosion at the mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As if the employees and the citizens of Yellowknife have not 
gone through enough inconvenience, Royal Oak-Giant mine has 
declared bankruptcy.  The workers, after years of working in the 
mine, have been left with back wages owing to them as well as 
pension contributions and severance pay.  The bill seeks to 
address those problems.  In the event that any enterprise goes 
insolvent or bankrupt, the current law has workers' wages ranked 
down on the list of priorities as to who will divide up the 
assets of the enterprise.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go into the details of the bill, let me say that the 
employers do not really resist this type of amendment to the act 
because by the time an enterprise declares bankruptcy the few 
assets that are left over are of little consequence to the owners 
of the company.  They would not oppose this sort of activity.  In 
the interest of basic fairness we would want to believe they 
would want the interests of their employees addressed and 
prioritized in terms of dividing the few assets that are left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to explain some of the rationale behind putting the 
interests of the employees ahead of the interests of the other 
creditors or bankers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very special relationship exists between an employer and an 
employee.  It is a contract of sorts or a tacit agreement between 
the employer and the employee.  It is not enshrined in a written 
document, such as a collective agreement, but it is recognized in 
law.  The relationship is very simple.  The employee provides a 
basic service or a service the employer wants and the employer 
pays a set wage or a remuneration for the service.  That exists 
and is recognized in common law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both parties have certain obligations.  The obligation of the 
employee is to do their duties in a diligent fashion and to be 
loyal to the employer.  There are many cases in common law that 
the duty of loyalty of the employee to the employer goes beyond 
the workplace.  The employee is not even allowed to trash the 
employer in his private life.  Certainly that relationship is 
recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employer has an historic obligation to recognize the debt to 
the employee for services rendered.  One of the reasons common 
law is usually sympathetic to the employee in situations like 
this is that there is an historic out of balance in the 
relationship.  The employer holds all the cards while the 
employee holds very few.  The employee is really at the mercy of 
the whims of the employer, which is where it becomes very much a 
trust relationship.  It actually goes further than that.  The 
trust of the employee for the employer to pay him or her is 
usually far more serious.  If the employer reneges on the 
obligation to pay the wages, the impact on the employee is much 
more serious than if the employer had chosen not to pay back the 
debt to one of the banks or lending institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that when the lending institutions loan money to a 
company they know full well the risks that might be involved in 
that enterprise.  They even get compensated for that risk by 
charging interest on the loan.  Usually by the time a company 
goes bankrupt the loan has been repaid, at least in part. The 
bank or lending institution will be compensated for at least some 
of the risk it puts into the venture, either through interest 
payments or payments to the principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact on the employee, however, is far more serious.  We 
are talking about a person's day to day income.  It may mean the 
loss of their home.  It may mean a huge impact on their family or 
huge impact on an employee's spending power which influences 
small businesses in given areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the relative weight of a debt to an employee versus 
a debt not paid to one of the banks or secured creditors, the 
impact, I would argue, is far greater, which is why common law 
has been a little more sympathetic to the employee in that case. 
However, that sympathy has not been translated into legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1975 my research shows that this issue has been before the 
House of Commons to be remedied to varying degrees of success 
four times.  There was always a basic recognition that the 
employees, because of the imbalance in the power relationship, 
needed the authority of legislation to look after their interests 
more than the banks needed the legislative authority of 
parliament to look after theirs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should be our primary concern in the House?  Whose 
interests should we be here advocating?  What should be primacy 
in terms of the relative priority of who is more at risk and who 
deserves our support more? 
I would argue that it is the people of Canada, the working people 
of Canada, who sent us here to advocate on their behalf.  They 
are the ones who need representation.  I would argue further that 
chartered banks or lending institutions are far more able to 
absorb the impact of a debt gone bad than working people. They do 
not frankly need our help.  The people who voted for us need our 
help.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-203 results from extensive research on various mechanisms 
and the instruments we could put in place that would give some 
relief to employees in a situation like this one.  We looked at 
various models from around the world because Canada is not alone 
in realizing that employees need more protection through 
legislation.  We looked at a few options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, Australia put in place a wage guarantee scheme 
which is a little different from what I would put in place with 
my bill.  It contemplates putting together a pool of funding 
through the government.  Through either general revenue or some 
payroll tax the government would actually be responsible for the 
back wages owed to employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am critical of this model, even though it is working quite 
well in Australia.  It is better than nothing, in that at least 
there is some avenue of recourse and some satisfaction that 
employees can achieve.  However it also raises problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the debate in Australia to put in place its wage scheme 
the spectre of a moral hazard was raised.  If employers knew that 
there was a fallback position for employees they might be more 
likely to leave the employees dangling or to fail to clean up 
whatever mess has been made in terms of back wages prior to the 
bankruptcy situation.  I caution it is probably not the right 
route to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak later to how various boards and task forces in 
Canada arrived at recommending a wage scheme rather than at what 
I am recommending in my bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another alternative which comes up now and then is giving a 
special status to employees, the preferred creditor status.  This 
as well has its shortcomings and shortfalls.  I advise it is not 
the best way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are recommending giving a super priority to the back wages 
owed to employees.  In the event of a bankruptcy employees would 
be first in line for any back wages, back contributions to 
pensions and severance pay.  In the event of self-employed 
people, travelling salesmen for instance, they would be in line 
for any costs they might have incurred.  In other words, any 
wages or compensation owed to employees should be cleared up 
first out of the assets remaining in bankrupt companies and the 
others can get in line to divide whatever is left over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an issue of basic fairness.  It is an issue that 
recognizes the historic imbalance between employers and employees 
and the imbalance between the ability of employees to recoup any 
back wages versus the authority of the banks or any other lenders 
or creditors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the history of what the House of Commons has tried to 
do to deal with this issue over the years, I note the Canada 
Business Corporations Act looks at the issue of unpaid wages and 
the liability on corporate directors.  At least it was 
contemplated in that act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liability for wages can be assigned to the directors in certain 
situations.  Directors can be sued personally.  If an individual 
employee wants to go after the board of directors, the directors 
can be liable.  There is a section in the act which covers the 
liability of directors and makes it very rare for employees to be 
able to sue directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 123(4) exonerates directors from any liability if 
they were acting in good faith on the information given to them 
through the financial information of the company.  In other words 
the onus would be on employees to prove that directors were 
acting in bad faith and were not dealing properly with the 
information given to them. 
It is a huge burden to put on employees.  If average employees 
went after a few thousand dollars worth of back wages they would 
never be successful in this challenge.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could trace the efforts to amend the bankruptcy law back to 
Bill C-60 in 1975 when an effort was made to introduce the idea 
of a super priority status for employees.  The Landry committee 
in 1981 gave it an effort.  The Colter advisory committee in 1985 
made a series of recommendations to change the Bankruptcy Act for 
just this reason, to give employees a super status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee recommended that a fund should be established, 
which is not exactly what I recommend, and believed that it 
should be paid for by contributions from employers and employees. 
My argument would be why should employees have to pay some sort 
of a premium to buy insurance to guarantee that their wages would 
be paid.  That is patently unfair and goes in the wrong 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this is an act whose time has come.  I am very 
disappointed that it was not given the votability it deserves.  I 
point to the incidence of bankruptcy in Canada.  If I had more 
time I would go through the details.  Last year alone there were 
10,500 bankruptcies, leaving a total liability of $2.5 billion. 
In 1999 there were 10,800 bankruptcies, leaving a liability of $2 
billion.  The same was true in 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year approximately 10,000 companies go out of business and 
every year employees are left dangling on the hook for back 
wages, back pension contributions, severance pay and other 
compensation to which they were entitled.  I appeal to members of 
the House of Commons today to recognize that the wages of workers 
should stand first in line in terms of priority whenever a 
company goes bankrupt. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I begin my remarks let me 
acknowledge the concern of the member for Winnipeg Centre for 
employees in bankruptcy company situations.   When he speaks to 
this issue he is very sincere about it, but the issue of unpaid 
wages and pension contributions when a firm goes bankrupt is one 
considered by the House several times in the past.  The member 
also alluded to that.  I am confident members on all sides would 
like to see the most equitable solution possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years different governments, as was stated earlier, 
considered many different options for wage earner protection that 
would be good for the economy and for workers.  This is not a 
partisan issue.  It is not an easy issue at all.  Each option has 
its trade-offs and several times parliament has been unable to 
agree on the fairest course of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry Canada, which is responsible for the Bankruptcy and 
Insolvency Act, is aware of the need to protect wage earners 
whose employers face bankruptcy.  As recently as 1992 parliament 
amended the act to extend the protection of unpaid wages.  In 
particular, parliament found it appropriate to increase the 
protection for wages earned up to six months prior to bankruptcy. 
This represents a doubling of the previous length of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992 parliament also quadrupled the maximum amount that could 
be claimed from $500 to $2,000.  Further review of this important 
issue is currently under way.  I am pleased to bring members up 
to date on the plans of Industry Canada to strengthen the 
Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the department expects to release in the next couple of 
months a discussion paper which addresses wage earner protection. 
Second, Industry Canada officials will be undertaking 
cross-Canada consultations with stakeholders to help identify a 
fair solution.  Third, the act will be referred to the 
parliamentary committee for review in the next year.  The results 
of the consultations and the whole question of wage earner 
protection will likely be examined during the parliamentary 
review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding, I certainly realize that wage earners sometimes 
face special difficulties when their employers go bankrupt, 
leaving their wages and pension contributions unpaid.  They are 
vulnerable creditors that often cannot afford such losses and 
usually lack the information to assess the risk that their 
employers may not pay them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>To protect employees the current act gives preferred status of 
up to $2,000 in wage claims for services provided in the six 
months immediately before the employer's bankruptcy.  It also 
protects up to $1,000 in disbursements for sales people, as 
mentioned earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the preferred ranking, wage claims are given priority over 
claims of ordinary creditors but wage claims rank behind those of 
secured creditors.  Protection for pension contributions is 
provided in federal and provincial pension legislation, much of 
which gives secured creditors status to claim unpaid pension 
contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very few people would argue against the principle of protecting 
the claims of wage earners.  Fairness weighs in favour of 
protecting them.  In practical terms wage earners are more likely 
to have their unpaid wages claims satisfied than ordinary 
creditors because of their preferred status.  In some 
circumstances as well, secured creditors may allow trustees to 
pay accrued wages to which the employees are not entitled, 
strictly speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue raised by the member for Winnipeg Centre in Bill C-203 
is apparently straightforward.  The bill provides for a kind of 
super priority for wage claims and payments in respect of 
pensions.  As we know from extensive past discussions on 
bankruptcy law, super priority, as with other options, raises 
various issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A difficult issue and one in which earlier proposals have 
foundered is that super priority could affect the availability of 
credit to companies.  It could become an important factor in the 
risk assessment of commercial lenders, leading to a reduced 
amount of credit being available.  The consequences could 
adversely affect the employment and interest of workers 
generally.  Commercial bankruptcy law has an important role in 
the allocation of these credit market risks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask hon. members not to misunderstand what I am saying.  I am 
not saying that super priority should be rejected as a way of 
handling wage and pension contribution claims in bankruptcies, 
but I am stressing it is a complex issue that has a long history 
and involves certain trade-offs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic principle of wage earner protection was established 50 
years ago in the Bankruptcy Act, 1949.  Since that time five 
committees have reported the possible changes:  the Tassé study 
committee in 1970, the Landry committee in 1981, the Colter 
advisory committee in 1986, the advisory committee on adjustments 
in 1989, and the bankruptcy and insolvency advisory committee in 
1994.  None of their recommendations for wage earner protection 
were implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past quarter century no fewer than eight bills have 
been introduced in the House and in the other place to amend the 
act.  Only one of these bills subsequently altered the provisions 
for wage earner protection, the bill involving the 1992 
amendments to the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These committees and bills proposed or analyzed a wide range of 
approaches including wage earner protection funds financed by 
contributions from employers, from employers and employees, or by 
the government through general revenues.  Some bills proposed 
super priority protection for wage claims.  Some bills proposed 
raising the ranking of wage and pension contribution claims among 
preferred creditors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a great deal of divergence on who should pay for the 
cost of wage and pension contribution claims.  It was nearly 
impossible to obtain a consensus on better ways to proceed than 
what is currently in the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.  That is 
why the protection of wage earners requires further examination 
and consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have sketched out these details to suggest various available 
points to my colleagues on all sides, and specifically the hon. 
member for Winnipeg Centre.  There is great interest in the whole 
question of wage earner protection following bankruptcies, but 
finding a fairer solution than what is now available would 
require a good deal of hard and thoughtful work during the 
forthcoming parliamentary review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in my opening remarks, this is not a partisan issue. 
Several different governments have already grappled with the 
question.  Each option for wage earner protection has its 
advantages and disadvantages.  Industry Canada currently is 
working to identify a fair solution.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak on the bill of the hon. member 
from the New Democratic Party regarding the Bankruptcy and 
Insolvency Act.  Unfortunately we cannot support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we in our party look at the idea that it would double the 
compensation from $2,000 to $5,000 for wages to employees and for 
increasing commissions and so on, we see that the cost in a 
bankruptcy to pay these commitments would far outweigh the 
benefits that accrue from leaving it as it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to think of situations where businesses are ill equipped 
or finding it difficult to pay their bills, and their creditors 
are hounding them.  A business in that situation may ask the bank 
to lend it some money.  If the company has 100 employees, the 
amount to be given for wages and commissions would multiplied by 
that.  If the company goes bankrupt the bank would be unable to 
collect the loan given to help that company though its difficult 
times even if the bank took security.  Therefore it is going to 
cause more businesses to go bankrupt rather than get close to 
bankruptcy and survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have thought that the NDP would be far more interested 
in protecting and preserving jobs rather than forcing businesses 
into bankruptcy because they cannot raise the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to recognize today that banks lend money in the 
anticipation of getting it back.  If they do not feel they will 
get it back, they will not lend the money.  Even if they take 
security, that security would then be in jeopardy in regard to 
accounts receivable and so on because according to this bill the 
money would have to be paid out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only that, but banks charge interest based on what they 
perceive to be the risk involved.  If they think it is possible 
to lend the money but the risk is higher they will charge more 
interest.  Interest rates would therefore rise, which again would 
make the business more vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in the bill that suggests amending the 
bankruptcy act would be beneficial to the economy or in 
protecting jobs or providing ongoing value to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was involved in the debate about 10 years ago when the 
bankruptcy act was last rewritten.  I argued for various changes 
to ensure that as far as possible matters involving creditors, 
employees and others owed money by businesses experiencing 
financial difficulties were wound up quickly and efficiently to 
ensure that the maximum amount of money was available to be 
distributed to creditors, which of course includes the employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to try to ensure a viable economy in these difficult 
times so that businesses in difficulty can, if possible, borrow 
money.  I cannot understand why the NDP wants to put into the 
bankruptcy act that the first claim on the assets of the 
organization should be payments for arrears in wages and 
commissions.  Can it not see that would jeopardize the potential 
to keep the business afloat?  I cannot understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have thought that jobs were of ultimate importance to 
the NDP, to us and to Canada's economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Jobs with no wages? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, they seem a little upset 
down there.  I would just like them to think about it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Any business can stay open if they do not 
pay their wages.  It is not that tough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I hear the comment that 
any business can stay open if it does not pay wages.  We have 
laws that require businesses to pay wages.  We have laws that 
require them to pay their source deductions to the government. 
There are times, for reasons that are out of the control of the 
organization, that the money is not there.  They may have 
accounts receivable that they cannot collect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of a well run small business that I knew of a number of 
years ago in my constituency.  It had one of their major accounts 
receivable companies disappear overnight.  It went bust, 
bankrupt.  The small business was left with no cash coming in and 
no wages to pay out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through that difficult time the bank carried the small business. 
The bank saw that the management was good and had faith in the 
owner and carried him through.  The bank was able to lend money 
to pay for the wages because the bank thought there was some 
capacity of maintaining the business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the situation being proposed by this member, the bank would 
never have lent money under these circumstances.  Therefore the 
business would have failed.  I cannot understand why the NDP 
finds it more important to stand on this principle of every last 
penny of wages having to be paid while other creditors, even if 
they are secured creditors, are without recourse to their 
security.  Putting this up as number one on the list of order of 
creditors being paid when a company goes bankrupt means that 
secured creditors may lose the value of their security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banks take a mortgage on a piece of property.  That mortgage 
may not be as valuable as it was because the cash has to be used 
to pay the wages.  Surely the fundamental thing is to protect the 
jobs of Canadians.  The fundamental thing is to build a viable 
economy.  There are times, unfortunately, when businesses go 
bankrupt through no fault of their own.  I would expect that 
surely the NDP would be willing to put forth creative ideas to 
help these kinds of business protect the jobs of their employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not it.  This is a preconceived concept that the 
business has run off with the cash and left the employees high 
and dry.  I was an accountant before I got into the political 
game and I saw businesses fail where that failure had nothing to 
do with bad management.  I gave one example where the large 
accounts receivable company went broke and the small business was 
left high and dry.  The owner was left high and dry.  The owner 
stood to lose every penny he had invested in the business and 
through no fault of his own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we always think that the businessman has taken advantage 
of the employee?  The businessman has provided opportunities for 
employment for the employees for as long as he has been in 
business.  It would not likely be his desire, assuming no 
criminal intent, to see his own assets disappear and his own 
business disappear.  What would he do?  He does not get 
unemployment insurance or anything like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be practical.  Let us look at opportunities to ensure 
that if businesses find themselves in difficult times we do not 
guarantee that they are going to fail.  Let us provide the 
opportunity for them to get through the difficult times by 
ensuring that the banks do not say businesses are too high a risk 
so the bank is not going to deal with them.  We must ensure that 
the banks do not say that the risk is so high they are going to 
charge an exorbitant rate of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us work for the benefit of all Canadians.  Let us not split 
this issue into employees who are at the mercy of an employer and 
employers who the NDP thinks are ripping off the employees.  Let 
us work together.  Bankruptcies are tough times for employers.  I 
have seen it.  I have counselled them.  I know how difficult it 
is and this would not help the situation one bit.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I must 
say that I feel the previous speaker from the Canadian Alliance 
has really skewed the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is not whether we are for or against job protection 
and creation; we are all in favour of job creation prior to 
bankruptcy. Once bankruptcy has been declared, however, there is 
no more discussion of job creation.  The question instead is how 
the liquidated assets are going to be divided between the banks 
and the workers, between those who are making record profits that 
are even an embarrassment, even to shareholders, and those in 
need of money quite simply to support their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question has been skewed, and the response the hon. member 
for Winnipeg Centre was seeking has not been obtained.  I 
congratulate him for introducing this bill and share his regret 
that it is not a votable item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will pay owing to workers have precedence over the financial 
institutions, or will it not?  The Bloc Quebecois' answer to 
this is yes.  We agree with Bill C-203 that the order of creditor 
priority must be changed when a business goes bankrupt, so that 
pay to salaried and other employees takes top priority when 
assets are being divided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my eight years as secretary general of the Confédération des 
syndicats nationaux I heard of many sad cases. 
I will name three only: the bankruptcy of the Coopérants, the 
bankruptcy of Crowne Plaza, on the west side of Sherbrooke 
Street; there are two Crowne Plazas in Montreal, the other one is 
on the east side of Sherbrooke; and the bankruptcy of Papiers 
Saint-Raymond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In each case, workers who had devoted much of their life to 
developing the business ended up penalized because, with the 
liquidation of its assets, the company was unable to meet its 
salary and pension obligations, in particular.  These were 
unionized workers.  The CSN spent time and energy pursuing the 
company directors under Quebec and federal laws in order to 
recover some money.  It took time.  At times we were unable to 
obtain everything due them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, these unionized workers are still a minority in 
the labour force.  In the case of Quebec, only 40% of the labour 
force is unionized and in Canada, the figure is a little less 
than 35%.  Legislation is needed to re-establish a balance, if 
I can put it that way, so that workers, the employees of the 
company, are the first to be paid when assets are liquidated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should they be paid first?  Because they are often the 
victims of the errors made by employer and directors. 
Unfortunately in Canada and Quebec we are still not entitled to 
economic information that will help employees.  They are, in the 
end, at the mercy of a decision that may have been made in all 
good faith.  I do not doubt that. I do not think many employers, 
I have known some who did it for anti-union motives, but they are 
the exception, made a conscious decision to lead their business 
to bankruptcy, but it can happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Workers are adversely affected by these errors in judgment in 
that they lose their jobs. If they also lose the salaries owed to 
them, it is a double whammy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the ability to shoulder the loss of income.  As I 
said earlier and I will say it again, banks make profits which, 
in my opinion, are obscene. These profits are made at the expense 
of both businesses and consumers. The Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business complains about the treatment that its 
members are getting from major Canadian banks and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given their record profits and the instruments they have at 
their disposal, banks are able to put up with losses that workers 
cannot shoulder, because it is the future of their families and 
their own retirement which are at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In theory, I underline in theory, when financial institutions 
lend money, they take a risk. Their payoff for that risk is the 
rate of interest they charge. Interest rates are very real and 
they are still too high. Banks have the means to assess the risk. 
These financial institutions take risks and it would only be 
normal that they come after the workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-203, it is not guaranteed, as the hon. member rightly 
pointed out, that all the debts owed to workers would be paid 
back.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect, Canada should follow up on convention 173 of 
the International Labour Organization and sign this convention 
adopted in 1992, precisely to protect, just as Bill C-203 seeks 
to do, the debts owed to workers, to ensure that they are 
compensated for their salaries, pensions and other types of 
benefits, following a bankruptcy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Convention 173 also proposes the creation of an independent fund 
to which all employers would contribute so as to ensure that not 
only would workers head the list of creditors, but should an 
insolvent employer be unable to pay their wages and pensions by 
liquidating its assets, the fund could be used to ensure that 
workers were not penalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Quebec's labour unions, the CSN, the FTQ, the CSD and the 
CSQ, are in agreement with the principle of Bill C-203.  As a 
representative of the Quebec people and of their interests, I 
have an obligation to support this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very hard for me to understand why the government members 
keep telling us about the extremely generous values to which 
Canada subscribes when the country is refusing to sign ILO 
convention 173. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It always seems to be the same old story with the present 
federal government, the Liberal government. It always has its 
left turn signal on, but it always turns right.  At least with 
the Alliance, things are clear:  always a right turn signal and 
always headed to the right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had enough of this hypocrisy, and I want to assure this 
parliament that, in the interest of the Quebec people, in the 
interest of the workers of Quebec and Canada, we are always going 
to support measures of the sort found in Bill C-203.  Once again, 
I congratulate the member for Winnipeg Centre on his initiative. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise to speak to Bill C-203.  I commend the 
hon. member from the New Democratic Party who presented it today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like so many private members' motions and bills, the bill should 
be votable.  We should have an opportunity as private members to 
raise issues of importance and then to have the level of 
importance and focus put on them that are deserved as initiatives 
led by individual members of parliament.  Many pieces of 
thoughtful legislation are not provided with that opportunity 
because the Liberals are not interested in significant 
parliamentary reform.  Reform could begin by enabling private 
members to present legislation which is votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first glance, when one looks at amending the Bankruptcy Act 
to protect employees, it seems very positive to ensure that in 
cases of bankruptcy employees end up ultimately receiving the pay 
owed to them.  I have some concerns relative to the unintended 
consequences that may follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Banks are not always the only creditors.  It is very easy to 
point to large financial institutions and say that they do not 
necessarily need the money.  If it is a question between the 
interests of large chartered banks and that of employees, the 
onus should be on paying employees in such circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In most bankruptcies the banks are prominent creditors, as are a 
lot of other businesses.  Many are small businesses in an 
accounts receivable or trade credit situation.  I know this as 
someone who started my first business when I was 19 and continued 
to participate in small and medium size business during that 
period until I actually ran for parliament at the age of 29.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that period I saw many companies with which I was doing 
business end up in circumstances where they were not able to pay 
their bills.  I saw and experienced firsthand what that did to 
other companies.  It can create a chain reaction which can result 
in not just one company going bankrupt.  It is important to 
realize that it can potentially lead to threatening the existence 
of several companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a different dynamic between larger and smaller 
corporate entities.  I believe the hon. member also recognizes 
the difference.  In many cases, for instance, the owners are 
people who have not taken pay for extended periods of time.  They 
have made significant sacrifices.  In terms of establishing a 
sense of unity between goals and objectives, there is probably a 
greater amount of commonality of interest between employer and 
employees in the small business environment than in most other 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have some concerns about how it might impact in a 
perverse way.  I am certain the hon. member would not intend this 
to be the case, but it could unintentionally result in a 
reduction in lending money to small businesses.  If this were 
implemented we could expect it not just in terms of banks but 
also in terms of trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were a small business person and I had an opportunity to 
sell products to another small business and part of the 
consideration in terms of extending credit was associated risks, 
it would reduce the likelihood of repayment. In a bigger 
corporate setting that is not as likely the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perversely smaller companies would be judged in some cases more 
negatively from a credit risk perspective if the legislation were 
introduced than larger companies for which the wages would not 
form as large a percentage of their actual accounts payable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if we look at a restaurant, a store or a small 
business, the degree to which wages form the lion's share of 
expenses on a week to week basis is less capital intensive and 
more labour intensive.  It might have a very negative impact on 
the service industry, small retailers or small restaurants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the provisions of the legislation any business with a 
higher focus in terms of cost structure on pay or labour costs as 
opposed to capital expenditures would be disproportionately 
discriminated against in the eyes of lending institutions or 
other businesses extending trade credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of us in the House would agree with what the hon. member is 
trying to achieve: greater protection for workers in the event of 
bankruptcy.  Clearly people employed with a firm, a store or 
whatever do not have the upside potential of great profits if the 
business succeeds and in some cases have a significant loss when 
a company goes broke.  It would be unfair if workers did not 
receive pay that was owed to them for the labour they provided. 
It is the contract between an employer and an employee which 
indicates that an employee is to be paid by the hour or by 
project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One model I am sure the hon. member is familiar with is the 
Australian model whereby various levels of government work 
together in a sort of employment insurance type guaranteed scheme 
which costs Australian taxpayers $100 million per year.  Given 
the multibillion dollar size of the government EI surplus, that 
might be a rational approach to take a look at.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would be far better off if we achieved what the hon. member 
is trying to achieve, better protection for employees in the case 
of bankruptcy.  If we can avoid the negatives of potentially 
increasing the risks associated with lending to small business 
and business in general, which is certainly not something we want 
to see, we would be far better off.  An appropriate way to 
proceed is by investigating some of these other alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that we are not seeing enough lending to small 
businesses.  We have seen some improvement but not enough. 
Lending to small businesses is a real challenge in Atlantic 
Canada.  It is much easier to get the money if it is not needed. 
It is a real catch-22 for small businesses.  I would not want to 
do anything that would further reduce the chances of small 
businesses getting that money.  That being the case, we can 
achieve the same result through different means which would 
spread out the risk a little further and provide greater 
protection for employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another point to realize.  I am sure the hon. member 
would agree that incidents where employers have tried to create 
or manipulate circumstances in such a way as not to meet payments 
to employees are not widespread.  However when it does occur it 
is unacceptable.  If employers go out of their way to create 
circumstances in which employees do not get paid, it is 
egregious, offensive and immoral to all involved. However I 
believe it is a fairly rare circumstance when it occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are developing public policy that can be very broad and 
sweeping in its impact we have to consider how pervasive the 
actual situation is that we are addressing.  We have to be very 
cautious in this regard.  I would be interested in further 
debating the Australian model and other best practices in other 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  There are approximately six minutes

hon. member for Kelowna want to speak.  If it would be agreeable 
to the House, I would be prepared to take a three minute 
intervention from both members and then go to the member for

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have three minutes to speak to the bill of my 
colleague from Winnipeg Centre.  The bill in question is Bill 
C-203, an act to amend the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, unpaid 
wages to rank first in priority in distribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP members seem to be the only ones prepared to fight for 
the workers.  They work for an employer. We are telling that 
employer that if he goes bankrupt, he must look out for the 
employees, at least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not opposed to the employers, if that is the impression 
the other members seem to have.  We are not against them. 
However, employers who go bankrupt have to remember who it was 
that generated the company's profits: the workers with the sweat 
of their brows.  Then, one fine day, the employer announces “It's 
over.  I can't keep the company going any longer.  I am filing 
for bankruptcy”.  The ones punished are the workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance members say that the banks will not make 
loans to these companies.  If they are not prepared to make 
loans, the banks should close up shop.  Is the sole purpose of a 
bank to make huge profits and then tell workers “tough luck”? 
The Conservative member said the same thing for small and medium 
size business, that the banks did not want to lend them money.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does our country operate only through bankruptcy?  Does the 
decision to lend money hang on whether the employees will be paid 
last? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the human element?  An employee who gets up in the 
morning and goes to work deserves to be paid.  I know of 
instances in which employers have gone bankrupt, while some 
people were at sea, for example, for months without being paid. 
When they returned to land, they got a fine cheque for $1, 
because the company had gone bankrupt, yet its employees had 
worked for months without pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So who goes bankrupt at that point?  It is the employees who are 
unable to pay for their homes, their cars and food to feed their 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is a very logical question.  In Ontario, the 
premier at the time, Bob Rae, introduced legislation on 
bankruptcy.  This did not prevent companies from having money in 
the bank.  There is no record to this effect. I am therefore 
prepared to say it is not true.  The banks will have to get used 
to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who should have priority are the workers, who bring 
in company profits. This is why it is unfortunate that the bill 
is not votable. Hopefully, the House will later decide 
unanimously that it is. It is important for the workers of this 
country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member from the New 
Democratic Party for bringing this private member's bill to our 
attention.  He ought to be congratulated for taking the side of 
the workers.  His bill seeks to increase the amount of money 
payable to employees as a result of a bankruptcy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to register two additional important points. 
First, whenever a bankruptcy occurs everybody loses.  I am sure 
the hon. member recognizes that only too well.  A bankruptcy 
situation is not something anybody looks forward to or wishes to 
pursue, but it is something that happens.  Nobody likes it and 
everybody gets hurt.  It is a question of distributing the hurt 
that takes place among the people involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The order that exists in the Bankruptcy Act puts the employee at 
the bottom of the list.  The assumption on the part of the hon. 
member who presented the bill seems to be that by having 
employees last on the list this somehow puts them in a position 
of suffering more than all the others.  I do not think that is 
necessarily the case.  When an honest trustee brings a situation 
like this to a head, the hurt experienced by various creditors, 
suppliers and other people is distributed among them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was directly involved in some cases where the trustee decided 
to make a settlement of 50% of the debt that was owed.  The 
assets were divided and the employees were paid.  Roughly 
everybody suffered at the same rate.  That is a reasonable point 
to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I would like to register is that we want to 
encourage entrepreneurship.  When we encourage entrepreneurship, 
we also encourage risk taking.  People employed by new innovative 
industries know they are in a risk situation. People lending 
money to these industries also know that.  The person putting the 
capital forward is also in a risk situation.  My hon. colleague 
opposite says the employees build up the business.  Of course 
they do.  However it is also true that a risk is borne by 
everyone from the employees to the person who provided the 
capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us keep this issue in perspective and balance it out.  I am 
sure the hon. member from Winnipeg knows very well that is really 
what he had in mind. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad to have a chance to summarize some of what I have heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind all those who spoke on this bill that 10,055 
companies went bankrupt last year.  That figure does not include 
another 10,000 companies that made application for some form of 
protection under the Bankruptcy Act. 
Therefore it is an urgent problem.  Many workers are involved. 
There is a great difference between the liabilities of the 
company and the assets of the company, and usually a very great 
shortfall.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we heard from the Liberals is that they wanted more 
examination and to revisit the issue.  I would argue we have 
visited the issue a total of seven times in the last twenty years 
and we have been unable to come to any kind of resolve to give 
satisfaction to the working people of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Acadie—Bathurst pointed out that the province 
of Ontario in 1991 did not want to wait any longer.  It put in 
place a wage protection scheme.  Unfortunately it lasted only 
until Mike Harris and the Tories came in and took it out.  At 
least somebody did not let the obstacles and the barriers get in 
the way of doing what was right for working people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance Party, the great grassroots party, seems to be 
demonstrating some kind of a wilful blindness to what the real 
issues are.  It seems to have grasped the idea to be able to make 
the debate that we should somehow privatize the profits in a 
business and then socialize the losses in a business.  In other 
words, when a bankruptcy comes along we should all share in the 
pain and all of us should bear the burden of the failure of the 
company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I pointed out in my earlier speech, there is an imbalance in 
the relationship between the employer and the employee.  The 
employer who assumed a loss also assumed all the profits when the 
company was going well.  The employee is the one who stands to 
lose.  I do not think it is an equal weigh scale as the Alliance 
tries to portray. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the members from the Bloc Quebecois for at least having 
the courtesy to read the bill and to understand the arguments we 
were making, and of course their ultimate position that they 
believe that workers should stand first in line in terms of 
creditors in the event of a bankruptcy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tories seemed to miss the boat all together too, although it 
is always a pleasure to see a creative wordsmith speak on both 
sides of the issue and right down the middle all at the same 
time.  It is a real gift.  What they fail to see is the type of 
compensation package they contemplated, like the Australian 
model, creates a moral hazard.  That is the way it is put in our 
research papers.  The moral hazard is that companies knowing full 
well there is a fall back position for the employees may be less 
likely to do the honourable thing and make sure the employees are 
paid up to date.  In other words, it is building in an exit ramp, 
or an excuse or an avenue for the employer to try to take 
advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will summarize my arguments in a few words.  The employees 
usually do not have the same opportunity to protect themselves 
when the employer is in a precarious financial situation.  They 
do not have nearly the opportunities that the employer does. 
Unlike the secured creditors, like the financial institutions, 
the employees do not have the same ability or the opportunity to 
either read the risks of being involved with the employer or to 
absorb the loss that an employer or financial institution has. 
Nor do they have the ability to pass on that loss to future 
customers.  In other words, there is an imbalance there as well. 
Employees need the protection of legislation.  The banks, the 
financial institutions and the other creditors know the risk when 
they were going in and they have a better ability to deal with 
any losses that might come out of it.  Therefore they do not need 
the protection of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be advocating for the employees not the financial 
institutions in the House of Commons.  I wish we could have 
convinced the other members on this issue.  I look forward to 
debating it again some day in the House.

Bill C-22, an act to amend the Income Tax Act, the Income Tax 
Application Rules, certain acts related to the Income Tax Act,

Speaker,  as we know, the Minister of Finance has reduced income 
taxes by a few hundred pages and a few hundred million dollars. 
Perhaps it will help the hon. member with his private member's 
bill.  By reducing the tax and burden on businesses, hopefully 
they will not go bankrupt so fast.  That is the spinoff.  All 
things considered there are benefits here and there are benefits 
there. 
However not everything is good in Bill C-22.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance stood up last fall, a couple of days 
before the election, and brought down a budget to tell us the 
good news about all the tax breaks.  We could not understand why 
he wanted to do that in October.  When he first came to power he 
said he would send the finance committee right across the country 
for prebudget consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It costs the House of Commons and taxpayers of Canada 
approximately $400,000 to send the finance committee across the 
country to hear from about 500 different people and institutions 
and so on to find out what they want in the budget.  It is a 
great big process the Minister of Finance put in place so that 
every year in February he can stand in this place and say he has 
listened to Canadians and this is what the government will do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However with the election in the offing, he decided not to worry 
about consulting Canadians and came out with a bunch of goodies 
to buy the votes of Canadians to win the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may recall that he introduced in that budget a payment 
of $125 to everyone who qualified for the GST tax rebate to 
reduce the cost of their heating fuel.  There was no analysis. 
This was strictly an election goodie.  Tens of thousands of 
payments at $125, the bulk of the money for a total cost of $1.3 
billion, went to people who did not have a heating fuel bill to 
pay.  A large percentage of the lower income people lived in 
rented accommodation.  They lived in apartments.  Did they pay 
heating fuel?  No, the landlord did.  Did he get a cheque for 
$125?  No, but all his tenants did.  There was no real benefit 
other than it was a great election goodie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party went around the countryside.  It gave all low 
income people a chance to reduce the cost of their heating fuel 
but it never said how.  Money went to people in prison, in 
graveyards and to people who did not qualify for a variety of 
reasons.   Many had never seen a heating fuel bill in their lives. 
Kids living with their parents got the heating fuel rebate 
but the parents who paid the bills did not get a penny.  Then to 
top it all off, there was some questionable legality to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $125 payment was a grant and fell under the definition of a 
grant.  Grants had to be published.  The name and address of 
everybody who received a grant from the Government of Canada was 
public knowledge and therefore should have been published.  The 
information was derived from the Income Tax Act.  Everybody who 
filled out a tax return and qualified for the GST tax rebate was 
on the list, and as we know tax returns are confidential.  So the 
government was in a quandary.  It came to the public accounts 
committee and asked for an exemption from publishing the names of 
people because the Income Tax Act said it should be private and 
rules covering grants said it should be public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, section 241 of the Income Tax Act, which 
guarantees and protects the privacy of income tax returns by 
Canadians, did not give the Minister of Finance the authority to 
get these names in order to pay the $125 to these people who 
qualified by virtue of being a recipient of the GST rebate.  I 
did not think they qualified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue came up at the public accounts committee.  One Liberal 
member suggested a legal opinion was needed prior to giving them 
the authority.  Another Liberal member did not think a legal 
opinion was needed, that they could hold their noses and pass it.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have serious questions about the legality of paying $125 to 
those people just so the Liberal government could run around the 
countryside last October and say that it was giving people money 
to reduce their heating bills regardless of whether it was money 
wasted, which it was.  It was perhaps illegal but no one seems to 
care.  The Liberals won the election, so who cares? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We play by certain rules in Canada, and one is that the rule of 
law is sacrosanct.  I am not a lawyer and we never got a legal 
opinion, but I have serious questions about the legality of that 
payment.  By its own admission, the government was in a quandary. 
The Income Tax Act says that we must keep everything 
confidential but grants and contributions rules say that we must 
make things public.  The fact that the government was in a 
quandary should tell us there was a serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other issues.  We in the Canadian Alliance have long 
pointed out the disparity between two income families and one 
income families.  One income families pay more tax than two 
income families that earn the same amount of money.  The family 
that decides a spouse will stay home to raise the kids rather 
than pass them along to a babysitter does not get a tax 
deduction.  Who better in the world to raise children than 
mothers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We celebrated Mother's Day yesterday.  Unfortunately, far too 
many parents must put their kids in daycare rather than stay at 
home because the tax act discriminates.  It discriminates against 
families that want to keep a parent at home to raise kids.  How 
can that be?  Our most precious resource is children.  We 
discriminate against parents who love their kids and want to 
raise them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am splitting my time with the member for Kelowna.  I forgot to 
mention that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that we discriminate against families. Why do we 
tolerate that?  I hope Canadians recognize this in the next 
election and are not dazzled by payments, tax breaks and so on, 
some of which are of questionable legality.  Canadians should 
vote for a party which says that it will stop discriminating 
against parents who want to raise their own children.  That must 
be a fundamental right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a big day yesterday for millions of Canadians across the 
country who took time to recognize their mothers and the great 
contribution they have made to their well-being, their nurturing 
and their growing up.  They took time to recognize the wiping of 
tears, the hugs and the commitment that mothers and parents have 
for their children.  However, the government discriminates 
against families.  We collectively in this place are being asked 
to vote on a tax bill that would continue the discrimination. 
Surely that must be addressed and redressed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to 
comment on the remarks by the member for St. Albert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite talked about families.  In listening to him 
I wondered if he had actually read the budget and economic 
statement that the Minister of Finance delivered last October. If 
I may, let me summarize it and the member could perhaps check his 
notes again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the member talked about a one earner family of four 
earning, say, $40,000.  This year that family will pay about 
$1,100 less in taxes, a saving of 32%. 
That will increase to 59% of federal taxes saved by the year 
2004.  This is a one earner family of four earning $40,000, so I 
am not sure where the member gets his information. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may indulge the House for a moment, a two earner family of 
four earning $60,000 paid about $5,700 in federal income taxes. 
This year it will pay $1,000 less or 18% less.  By the year 2004 
it will pay 34% less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should consult his notes again.  I am sure he will 
retract his statements about the budget and economic statement 
being biased against the family because the evidence is 
absolutely to the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is typical bafflegab 
by the government.  I was talking about discrimination and the 
fact that single families pay more than two income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talks about tax reduction.  I did not dispute that 
there was a reduction in tax.  I said that discrimination 
continues to exist.  That surely was the point I raised.  I could 
not be more explicit and definitive than that, but the member 
tried to avoid the subject by talking about tax reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government finally balanced the budget because of pressure 
put on it by the Canadian Alliance Party not to continue running 
deficits.  The government finally, by virtue of economic growth 
and not by virtue of economic policy, balanced the budget and is 
now returning only some of the money to the taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister said that the government would be balanced. 
He said that it would keep half the extra cash to spend as it 
wanted and give half back to the taxpayer.  I would like to see 
it all go back to the taxpayer.  It was and still is the 
taxpayers' money.  The government does not have a right to that 
money except to provide programs for the benefit of the country 
and not for the whim of the Prime Minister.  Therein lies a 
significant difference. 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the member for raising the issue of taxation of the family. 
As the member will know, the finance committee appointed a 
subcommittee on the issue during the 6th parliament.  I would 
refer him to its report which points out very clearly that it is 
inappropriate to compare a two income family with an aggregate 
income of $60,000 to a one income family making $60,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real comparison is this:  What is the tax burden on a two 
income family in which one person decides to withdraw from the 
workforce?  This would result in a real drop in net take home 
pay.  The issue is about comparing a family to itself with two 
options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member may be familiar with the fact that the United States 
has joint filing.  Would the member support a move toward 
recognizing the family unit by taxing the family but with a 
separate rate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad the member 
brought up the issue of joint filing in the United States. 
Unfortunately, given the way the government defines family, I am 
a bit apprehensive about going down that road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point again is that families get a tax break for sending 
children down the street to daycare but get no tax break for 
looking after the children themselves.  I cannot understand why 
we still have that rule. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we need to make a couple of points on the legislation to 
amend the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into the more detailed parts of the bill, I need to 
register some things, particularly for the benefit of the 
listeners.  In looking at the situation I asked myself what 
exactly was happening here in terms of physical terms.  A copy of 
the Income Tax Act was delivered to my office this morning. 
The Income Tax Act has about 1,000 pages.  It is a very 
significant act.  The paper is very fine; it is almost rice 
paper.  It is a substantial volume.  It illustrates how 
complicated the Income Tax Act—

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I note that the member is not reading from the document but 
rather using it as a prop.  He has been somewhat less than 
forthright with the House since it includes corporate tax— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair is not involved in the 
debate and will not get involved in the debate.  However, if we 
are talking about income tax and the member has an income tax 
document I am hard pressed to call that a prop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, you are not only a 
fairminded person but you have demonstrated a tremendous sense of 
humour.  I respect and appreciate both qualities very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the hon. member's benefit, I have marked the section in the 
act dealing with capital gains.  It begins on page 263 and ends 
approximately at page 372.  The section deals specifically with 
capital gains.  Later on, when the act refers to taxes on 
inheritance, capital gains come up again.  The capital gains 
section of the act is over 100 pages long and there is additional 
reference to capital gains later in the act.  That is the Income 
Tax Act as we know it currently.  Another 514 pages of amendments 
to the act have now been brought to our attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the parliamentary secretary's statement that there 
have been tremendous tax reductions over the last while.  The 
Minister of Finance has indicated several times how significant 
and large the cuts have been.  He says that they amount to around 
$100 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when he makes that statement he does not tell us how 
many increases there were.  We need to look at that, particularly 
in terms of payroll taxes.  There has been a tremendous increase 
in the amount paid to CPP.  That must be considered an increase 
in taxes.  The $100 billion the minister refers to is not really 
the total amount.  The net cut is considerably less than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The child benefit program is administered through tax benefits 
but it is really a spending program so it cannot be considered a 
tax cut.  It is important that we recognize exactly what is going 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will make another point regarding the proposed statement the 
Minister of Finance will deliver on Thursday of this week, if the 
reports we have heard are correct.  It will be very significant. 
The mini budget last fall indicated some of the things we have 
talked about here this morning.  It looks like the new projection 
will tell us what to expect in terms of expenditures, revenues 
and the general state of the economy in Canada.  The projection, 
at least at the moment, is that it will be for two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer the House to a statement made last week by the chief 
economist of the Toronto Dominion Bank, supported by a number of 
other economists, which suggested that two years is a misleading 
time period.  Why?  It is pretty clear to everyone that within 
the next two years we will still have a surplus and revenues will 
exceed expenditures.  However, in the third year, because of 
programs that have been promised and programs that have begun, 
demands on the budget will create a deficit.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage the Minister of Finance not to fall into the 
trap of dealing only with the next two years, but rather that he 
give us a balanced position and say to Canadians that for the 
next two years we will have a surplus but in the third year, 
because of the things he plans to do, there will be a deficit. 
That would be an honest statement to make and I would encourage 
him to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now come back to some of the specific provisions within 
the amendments of Bill C-22.  I want to refer primarily to one 
section regarding capital gains tax, which I have referred to 
already.  I will read one paragraph for the benefit of listeners. 
It is an amendment to the existing provisions for capital gains. 
I would like people to listen very carefully and see if they 
understand the paragraph.  It reads: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(o) where an amount is designated under subsection 104(21) of the 
Act in respect of a beneficiary by a trust in respect of the net 
taxable capital gains of the trust for a taxation year of the 
trust and the trust does not elect under paragraph 104(21.4)(d) 
of the Act, as enacted by subsection 78(23), for the year, the 
deemed gains of the beneficiary referred to in subsection 
104(21.4) of the Act, as enacted by subsection 78(23), are deemed 
to have been realized in each period in the year in a proportion 
that is equal to the same proportion that the net capital gains 
of the trust realized by the trust in that period is of all the 
net capital gains realized by the trust in the year, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(p) where in the course of administering the estate of a 
deceased taxpayer, a capital loss from a disposition of property 
by the legal representative of a deceased taxpayer is deemed 
under paragraph 164(6)(c) of the Act to be a capital loss of the 
deceased taxpayer from the disposition of property by the 
taxpayer in the taxpayer's last taxation year and not to be a 
capital loss of the estate, the capital loss is deemed to be from 
the disposition of a property by the taxpayer immediately before 
the taxpayer's death— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would challenge all of our listeners to understand exactly 
what has happened here.  It is very significant that we 
understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the whole issue of capital gains, I would like to 
refer again to the Income Tax Act that exists at present.  There 
is complex set of formulae in the act, not only the formula I 
have just read but a whole host of other ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of the amendment I just referred to in Bill C-22 has to do 
with the reduction of the capital gains tax from two-thirds to 
50%.  I do not think that is great.  I think we should reduce 
capital gains tax considerably.  I would like to see it reduced 
considerably below the present one, and the ideal, from my point 
of view, would be to eliminate capital gains tax entirely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I think that?  First, it is critical that we have risk 
capital involved when providing capital for the establishment of 
enterprises to develop innovations, to apply new technology, new 
science and new understandings.  People who risk their capital 
ought to be able to benefit from the profits that arise.  In many 
instances these highly innovative projects, while they have the 
potential for tremendous gain, also have the potential for loss 
of a major part or all of the capital.  We need to reward people 
who are prepared to risk their assets, their talents and their 
abilities so that they can be rewarded when they apply them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member referred to the page number, so on that slight 
technicality, showing the 1,000 page document, I was listing some 
of the things that are in there, including the corporate tax 
segments, the schedules for capital cost allowance, all of the 
things that have to do with trusts, family trusts and survivor 
trusts, and the non-resident taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The document contains a substantial number of things that have 
nothing to do with personal income taxation.  I can tell the 
member that of that 1,000 page document there are only about 10 
pages that are applicable to about 80% of Canadian taxpayers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question has to do with the capital gains side.  The member 
noted that there are a number of provisions.  Most of those are 
there because of history, such as the $100,000 capital gains 
exemption, changes to the effective rate, list of personal 
property and a whole host of historic aspects of capital gains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the member did say that he would support eliminating 
capital gains tax.  Let us take something as simple as the 
investment in the stock market.  Shares obviously are valued on 
the basis of their after tax return.  Capital gains tax would be 
taken into account to determine the return on investment, similar 
to taking into account the dividend policy with regard to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member is correct when he says that the policy should be 
to eliminate the tax, he probably should know that doing so would 
affect the ability of the companies that have capital gains 
history to attract capital.  In fact it would penalize companies 
that have high dividend payouts and lower capital gain because 
they do not withhold money for reinvestment in the company.  They 
are paying out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member suggested that we lower or eliminate the capital gain 
so that companies that have low dividend payouts and high 
expansion get a benefit ahead of those who in fact pay out higher 
levels of dividend yield to their shareholders.  Is this what the 
member is trying to say?  Is he saying less money for ordinary 
investors in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member was a 
chartered accountant in a previous life and should understand 
what he was saying and should also understand what the act says. 
He probably has a pretty good understanding of capital gains. 
There are a number of different ways in which we can talk about 
capital gains.  I have to also refer back to his idea that there 
are only about 10 pages on income tax in there.  That is amazing. 
We should then throw this thing away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  On personal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Capital gains is very personal. 
There are over 100 pages of capital gains in there and that is 
very personal.  The hon. member had better do his arithmetic a 
little better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming back to capital gains, the issue of dividends may or may 
not be related to capital gains.  It could be but I doubt that 
very much, particularly when it comes to the area of innovations 
and people who want to establish a brand new company, such as the 
angels, for example, who work with small businesses and put a lot 
of venture capital on the table.  Generally these companies do 
not pay dividends at all.  They are risking the total amount of 
the capital they put on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to encourage that kind of innovation, we want to make 
sure that money is there and these people can get their rewards 
from their investment.  That is really what I am talking about. 
We do want to encourage that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada there have been some tremendous innovative ideas, but 
we have discouraged much of the risk capital and many of the 
venture capitalists from investing here simply because of the 
high burden of capital gains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, is the hon. member aware of 
the fact that in RRSPs, in which a large number of Canadians 
invest, capitals gains on investments that are purchased inside 
an RRSP are treated like straight income and would not benefit 
from eliminating capital gains tax? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very well aware of 
that.  I would like to remind the hon. member that within the 
RRSP no tax is paid on the interest that is borne or on dividends 
either.

mini budget or economic statement from the fall.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting thing is that the Liberal government has yet to 
produce a budget that will outline its priorities, both for 
taking in government revenues and spending them.  It is 
inexcusable that we should be meandering through the wilderness 
of the economic difficulties of these days, where leading 
corporations like Nortel are laying off major portions of its 
total workforce.  That involved something like 6,000 Canadian 
jobs.  As well, we are watching the U.S. economy slow down.  For 
the first time in many years, the U.S. unemployment rate is 
actually rising.  All of this is going on while the finance 
minister's policy is based on last year's election spending 
spree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Canadian dollar is continuing to slide.  I 
remember talking about this issue a few months ago.  At that time 
we watched the dollar slide up and down above and below 67 cents 
U.S.  Today it is down to anywhere from 63 cents to 65 cents 
U.S., which means that our dollar has lost about 16% of its value 
in the last eight years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our weak dollar is like a national pay cut for everybody.  It 
means that the value of our money and the value of everything we 
own in Canadian dollars has been reduced.  Canadians' savings 
have been reduced.  Customers are forced to pay more for imported 
goods in a global economy where almost everything we buy is made, 
at least partly, somewhere outside Canada, while the Liberal 
government merely continues its trend of spending and of ignoring 
the need for real tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 20th century in the United States there were three 
episodes of significant tax rate reductions.  These reductions 
occurred in the 1920s under U.S. presidents Harding and Coolidge. 
They happened again in the 1960s under President Kennedy and in 
the 1980s under President Ronald Reagan.  In each case the 
Canadian Liberal government of the day predicted that tax cuts 
would only reduce revenues and benefit the affluent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are always worried about the affluent benefiting.  This 
morning we heard a number of speeches in private members' 
business and now under this bill that show the government is 
worrying that the rich will get richer.  However, if the people 
who have the money do not invest, we know what will happen to 
everyone else.  No jobs will be available for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In each case the Liberal government of the day decided that it 
would increase taxes and spend its way out of the problem.  Each 
time the United States avoided an economic crisis but Canada ran 
head on into it.  We see this happening again today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>President Bush is calling for massive tax cuts.  He recognizes 
that the global economy is slowing.  He recognizes that his 
country is heading for a recession.  He also recognizes that 
swift and significant tax cuts are necessary to stimulate the 
economy of his country.  President Bush is showing leadership by 
working to avoid a crisis.  The Bush administration has proposed 
tax cutting measures that would reduce taxes by as much as $1.6 
trillion over the next 10 years.  Both Republicans and Democrats 
have introduced tax measures in congress that would see tax 
relief of up to $160 billion retroactive to January of this year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is our government doing?  What is the Liberal solution to 
stop the economic bleeding and to avoid a crisis?  Its approach 
is quite unique.  Last week it announced a $500 million spending 
spree for arts groups.  The arts are important in Canada, but 
jobs for Canadians are perhaps more important at this time when 
our economy is in crisis.  Where would the money come from? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has announced tax increases through the CPP.  It 
has erased any modest gains that might have been made through 
personal tax cuts.  It refuses to lower taxes, issue a budget, 
follow the American example and bring in an across the board tax 
reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we talk about capital gains taxes we go into the nuts and 
bolts and the minutia of them when all the while the government 
is trying to avoid the necessity of reducing taxes for Canadians 
so that they would have more money in their pockets to make the 
economy work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent report by the Institute for Research on Public Policy shows the 
human costs of the government's refusal to lower taxes.  It 
studied the migration habits of Canadians leaving for the United 
States.  The results should come as no surprise. Canadians are 
flocking to the United States because the taxes are lower there. 
Their buying power increases and they have more money in their 
wallets.  Every year thousands of Canadians go to the United 
States for better pay, better tax rates and better opportunities 
to secure their future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was watching a TV show the other day in which Canadian 
hospitals were trying to bring Canadian nurses back from the 
United States.  Goodness knows we need them.  However the 
response from the nurses who were going to the job fairs was that 
the pay and working conditions here were not as good, taxes were 
too high, and their spouses who were in the United States with 
them could not find jobs if they came back to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The alarming number of Canadians heading to the United States is 
increasing.  Despite the Prime Minister sticking his head in the 
sand and pretending that there is no brain drain, the numbers 
tell the story.  In 1968 the number of people leaving Canada for 
the U.S. was 17,000.  In 1997 that number rose to 98,000.  In 
1986 only 3% of Canada's natural scientists left for the United 
States.  In 1997 that number rose to 11%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a brain drain crisis.  Our best and brightest are going 
south.  Doctors, nurses, scientists and computer programmers are 
among the many heading for lower taxes and better wages.  We have 
to deal with this problem.  High Canadian taxes is the most 
urgent task facing parliament.  Thus far our economy has had a 
free ride on the United States, but we are now seeing the results 
of government policy or lack thereof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the government having a far more serious problem by not 
producing a budget that Canadians can see and work with.  We need 
a budget that we can hew to, not a general economic statement 
prepared for a national election and justified through 
legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in listening to the member 
opposite I wondered how he could stand in the House to talk about 
how the government has been inactive in cutting taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last fall the government introduced the largest tax cuts in 
Canadian history of $100 billion.  Those tax cuts which took 
effect on January 1, coupled with the tax cuts at some provincial 
government levels, are having a huge effect on the economy.  It 
is about 2% or better in terms of percentage points related to 
the gross domestic product.  Most economists understand the 
significance of that and are saying that it is having a very 
stimulative effect.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All economists are saying that the timing could not have been 
better.  Hon. members opposite often cite the Americans. They 
seem to be enraptured by them.  However the Americans are still 
debating their tax cuts.  Our tax cuts came into effect on 
January 1.  We have to do more and we will do more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member opposite talked about spending.  He selected 
some items that have been developed and addressed as a priority 
by the government.  Included in that was an important initiative 
of half a billion dollars for farmers which I guess just slipped 
his mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he selects those spending items, has he actually looked at 
the other items?  I know he will say that it was not enough, 
because we could always do more.  Does he not support the half 
billion dollars that was topped up to give farmers some relief? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree that it is not 
a matter of what the government spends in the necessary areas. 
For example, we need more spending in health care.  We need to 
maintain our social programs.  We are not talking about the 
urgent needs of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The child benefit is a spending program delivered through the 
tax system.  I would like to touch on the point the hon. member 
mentioned about $100 billion in tax relief.  There is some 
sleight of hand in this number if we take all the minuses into 
account: the minus $3.2 billion for social spending over five 
years, the minus $29.5 billion over five years for increased CPP 
premium hikes; and the minus $20.7 billion over five years for 
cancelled tax hikes in indexation.  What do we come up with?  Not 
$100 billion tax relief but something just over $53 billion. That 
is a little more than half what the government is talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to have the numbers on the table so that we know where 
we stand in both the income and the spending of the government, 
not the kind of sleight of hand that it uses to win an election. 
That is what the bill is about.  It is to implement something 
that was put in place as an election strategy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member briefly referred to CPP tax increases.  He knows that 
the funds invested by Canadians through their premiums in the 
Canada pension plan are segregated funds.  They are not 
government money for spending.  They are there for the benefit of 
Canadians in terms of their future pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, with the baby boomer demographics today we have 
something like five workers for every one retiree.  With the 
large number of baby boomers who will be retiring we will be 
reducing that number to three workers for every retiree.  Less 
workers will be required to fund the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member prefer to scrap the CPP and leave 
everybody to fend for themselves at retirement, or does he 
support the amendments made to the Canada pension plan, including 
increasing the premiums over a period of time to ensure it is 
there for all Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to see a 
clear picture of our spending.  The hon. member mentioned CPP as 
being designated.  What guarantee do we have if there is no 
surplus in the fund, as in the case of the employment insurance 
fund?  The government could not capture the revenue for itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing is sacred and segregated to the government.  If the 
government wants it, it will take it.  We cannot look at CPP as 
anything but a tax because the government handles it as 
government revenue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to speak to 
Bill C-22.  It is certainly a complex bill.   Thousands of people 
in Canada, and a good many in my constituency, fall into the 
situation that I am about to describe in terms of exemptions and 
qualifications.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to what happens to a young father who finds himself in a 
divorce situation.  I draw the attention of the House to two such 
cases as they relate directly to the exemptions in the Income Tax 
Act.  Dan and Valerie were married for 12 years.  I do not know 
what led up to the divorce but they went through a divorce.  The 
responsibility, and rightly so, is for Dan to support the 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not accept for a moment, as is generally thought across 
Canada, that all these men are deadbeat dads.  Dan agreed to pay 
his wife $1,000 a month for the upkeep of his children.  At the 
end of the year that upkeep costs him $1,200 a month. Aside from 
the cost of the divorce and the loss of his house, he does not 
get to claim that $1,200 as an exemption.  His wife does not have 
to claim it as income and receives a tax credit.  That is wrong. 
No matter which way the cake is cut, it is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have other examples on file.  We do not know why suicides come 
about, but all these dads are not deadbeats.  Many of them work 
overtime to make ends meet, only to have to pay more money.  They 
are finding it more difficult to pay up each month.  They want to 
carry on their responsibilities, but the situation is getting 
worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last example I have on file is a shocker.  John married a 
girl by the name of Janet and she had one child from her previous 
marriage.  He accepted that child and together they had two more 
children.  That union divorced and, believe it or not, Janet 
married her former husband.  The oldest child from the former 
husband then went back to the original parents.  John was ordered 
by the court to pay support for three children, even though the 
one child he assumed from the previous marriage was back with the 
original parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on.  All kinds of people have written to me 
from across Canada.  In many cases there is no fight between the 
former wife and husband, but in many cases these young men simply 
cannot make it.  What I am saying is that the monthly support 
payment should be an absolute deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We seem to say at the present time that all divorces are the 
fault of the men.  There is no question about that.  One only has 
to look at the tax laws and the exemption entitlements.  Hundreds 
of young men under 40 escape by running away, by taking on new 
names, and some by committing suicide.  We sit here and allow it 
go on year in and year out.  No one has the stamina and the 
courage to say that it is wrong. 
If members ever talk to some of these young people, they should 
talk to a man of 38 years of age who lost his professional job 
through no fault of his own.  Watch the tears roll down his face 
because he cannot meet those obligations, and he was never 
credited for it as a tax deduction in all those years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the House and I say to all Canadians, it is time we 
faced up to this.  It is time that we said no, that not everyone 
is a deadbeat dad.  If we look at the statistics most of them are 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have dealt with many cases individually where men have had to 
suffer extreme hardships in order to meet the requirements of the 
courts.  Then the income tax comes, they make a huge payment and 
have no deductions whatsoever.  Their income tax is deducted at 
source because they are once again a single parent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish that somehow the finance committee could sit down with 
the other departments involved in this to bring this atrocity to 
an end, to bring some fairness to the situation and to bring some 
fairness to what happens with a court ruling.  Maybe they will. 
However if they do not, there will be more and more young men who 
will mysteriously disappear from the landscape and we will not 
know the reason for their deaths.

is a second residence to be paid for.  That means the disposable 
income of a family usually is eroded substantially because of 
that.  On top of that should they be unfortunate enough to have 
to go through litigation of some sort, the lawyers take a 
substantial portion.  The member will well know that in a number 
of cases it will wipe out the family's savings totally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member, in the case he used, raised the question about a 
spouse not being able to deduct child support payments.  He 
should know that child support payments have never been 
deductible by anybody.  The issue is where is the income taxed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member may recall the Thibaudeau case where Mrs. 
Thibaudeau went to the court.  She said she received child 
support payments and that she did not want pay tax on it.  She 
wanted her husband to pay all the tax on his income and not 
transfer that income to hers.  What the member was describing and 
what he disagreed with was the court judgment on the Thibaudeau 
case.  Maybe he wanted to suggest that we look at the Thibaudeau 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said, that, I tend to agree with him that the Thibaudeau 
case actually exacerbated a situation in terms of the disposable 
income of those two people.  The fact that a high income earner 
pays a higher rate of tax on marginal income and all of sudden 
this additional income for the spouse with a lower level of 
income probably is taxed at a lower rate.  However it is not the 
same for all situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make this as a comment.  Maybe the member would like to offer 
his comments with regard to the importance of all of us working a 
little harder to make sure our families stay intact because 
everybody loses, particularly children, when there is divorce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, of course I agree.  There is 
no one in the House more firmly convinced that the best 
institution, our oldest institution has to be maintained.  That 
is to strengthen the family in every way possible.  The previous 
speaker mentioned that very fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter which way we want to cut the cake, when there is an 
expenditure in child rearing it should be considered.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I know of a case in Toronto where the individual is paying 
$20,000 a month with two children.  I know other case where the 
father is trying to put up $2,000 a month.  Not only is he going 
bankrupt, he will lose the his house because of what happened to 
his income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be a $12,000 a year deduction at source for that 
parent.  There is no one in the House or outside it who can 
successfully argue that it should not be an income tax deduction. 
Maybe we are past the days of being all deadbeat dads when we 
hung it on the men and gave women more liberty.  I hope those 
days are gone forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes after divorce, even though the money goes to the wife 
in support of children, she then continues to work and pay income 
tax.  She includes the children and does not have to count the 
money.  There is something wrong there.  I think everybody on 
that side of the House knows it.  Everybody in Canada once it is 
explained knows it, and it is up to the government to make the 
changes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in debate on Bill C-22.  I 
spoke at the initial reading before the House.  I would like to 
reiterate in closing the debate the opposition of the official 
opposition to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often we are criticized of opposing for the sake of opposition. 
In fact I think we have a record of supporting about half of the 
government bills which are introduced, those which we think are 
sensible and lend incremental improvements to public policy. 
Bill C-22 falls far short of that standard in many respects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It purports to legislate tax changes announced in the economic 
statement of last October.  The economic statement, which was 
hurriedly put together by the finance minister on the behest of 
the Prime Minister immediately before an election, did not take 
into account the new economic circumstances in which we now find 
ourselves.  At that time the finance minister was projecting a 
nominal GDP growth rate or real growth of 3.5%.  It is now 
evident that given the downturn in which we now find ourselves, 
that economic growth for the current calendar year will be more 
like 2.5% or perhaps lower.  It undoubtedly will have a 
substantial affect on the government's fiscal situation and the 
revenues available to it.  It will also place an upward pressure 
on spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the face of this new economic uncertainty in which we now 
find ourselves, the government has not responded at all.  It has 
acted irresponsibly.  The last full budget we had was in 
February, 2000.  It now appears likely that there will not be a 
full budget presented to the House until February 2002.  This 
would constitute the longest stretch of a budget not having been 
presented to parliament in the history of the Dominion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time of economic uncertainty, when we see the United States 
continuing to go into possibly a technical recession, we see our 
third largest trading partner, Japan, in the midst of an economic 
and fiscal crisis.  We see the possibility of Latin America 
veering off its economic course.  Let us be objective and 
realistic about this, not pessimistic.  Objectively there is the 
very real potential for more troubled economic times within the 
foreseeable future, yet we have no budget to take that into 
account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister will apparently make one of his smoke and 
mirrors presentations with video charts and focused group 
language tested by his friends at Earnscliffe consulting at 
considerable taxpayer expense.  He will that on Thursday. However 
it will not be a serious economic budget.  It will not take into 
account the new circumstances.  It certainly will not deal with 
the very serious corrosive problem of runaway Liberal spending 
which is now setting into the fiscal status of the federal 
government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the fiscal year just ended, 2000-01, it appears that the 
total program spending will have grown by about 7.1%.  This is a 
huge increase at a time when inflation plus population is growing 
at a rate of just under 3%.  In other words, spending under the 
government is growing more than twice as fast as the population 
and inflation.  It is doubling the need for growth set by our 
economy, our inflation and our growth of the population.  The 
projection for the foreseeable future is that spending growth 
will continue at a rate of at least 5%.  We think it will likely 
be substantially higher than that given the track record of the 
government to date.  This is simply not sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had in the last fiscal year $11.1 billion in supplementary 
estimates above and beyond what was originally projected by the 
government a year ago in its main estimates.  We had money which 
was been announced and not properly authorized or put through the 
estimates process in advance.  We had the phenomenon known as 
March madness where the government spent as much as 70% more in 
the last month of the fiscal year than it did in any other month 
of the year.  There was much as $16 billion in spending this past 
March. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The warning bells are ringing that spending is growing out of 
control.  I can understand the political dynamic within which the 
Finance Minister must operate.  I suspect he has tried his best 
to maintain the big spending old style Liberal habits of his 
colleagues and is simply losing that debate around the cabinet 
table in the caucus room now.  The special interests in his 
caucus, the Minister of Canadian Heritage and the Minister of 
Industry and their big spending friends, continue to grapple for 
millions more taxpayer dollars.  We see this in the fiscal bottom 
line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that every additional dollar in discretionary, 
unnecessary and wasteful spending that is committed by the 
government is a dollar taken away from perspective tax relief for 
working families to create new and better jobs.  It is a dollar 
taken away from debt reduction to secure our long term economic 
future and pay down our still enormous national mortgage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues opposite will say that the bill before us gives 
effect to tax changes and therefore there is still room for new 
spending.  This ignores the economic reality in which we find 
ourselves.  The reality is the bill purports to authorize $100 
billion in tax reductions which is just complete nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we clear away the smoke, the mirrors and the fudge it 
budgeting, when we take out the spending increase in the child 
tax benefit which is an entitlement program, it is a spending 
program not a tax cut, when we net out the $29 billion Canada 
pension plan premium increase, the largest single tax increase in 
Canadian history, an increase which has caused most Canadians so 
far in this calendar year to see their tax level go up after 
advertised tax cut and when the impact is taken out of 
de-indexing the tax system which is not a tax cut it is just a 
non-increase, we find that the real net tax cut over the ensuing 
five years is less than $50 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals do not increase taxes but all of a sudden they want to 
take credit for that as a tax cut.  I am afraid it simply does 
not wash.  If we tried that kind of accounting as a CFO at a 
company, we would end up making licence plates in a provincial 
institution.  The net tax relief is half of what is advertised in 
the bill.  That does very little to correct the significant 
disadvantage we continue to face vis-à-vis our major competitors 
and trading partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada continues today to have the highest personal income tax 
to GDP ratio in the G-7.  In laymen terms that means we have the 
highest income taxes of any major country in the world; 14.1% of 
GDP.  Even if we take the Finance Minister's bogus $100 billion 
figure and subtract that from our current tax burden, we still 
end up with Canada at a PIT to GDP ratio of 12.4%, the highest in 
the G-7.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is substantially higher than that of the United States even 
today. Our major trading partner will be cutting taxes by at 
least $1.35 trillion U.S., not Canadian dollarettes, over the 
next 11 years, thus rendering the Canadian tax system even less 
competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would not be a problem if it did not have an effect on our 
standard of living, but it does and very substantially.  Canada 
continues to see its rate of growth in labour productivity, an 
absolute key indicator of growth in our standard of living, at 
one-third the level of the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have raised this issue in the House during question period. 
The finance minister says our productivity is growing.  Yes, it 
is, barely, by roughly 1.5% a year, while we see productivity 
gains in the United States of 4%.  That means the U.S. is 
producing more and doing it more efficiently.  It is creating 
more wealth which is shared by more people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why?  It is not because Canadians are not hard working.  They 
are hard working and well educated.  It is because we penalize 
too many Canadians for working hard, taking risks and investing 
and saving.  The very economic behaviours which create wealth and 
raise our standard of living are penalized by our punishing tax 
regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's bill would raise the basic personal exemption 
level to $8,000 under which a taxpayer would not pay taxes.  The 
government claims this is a great act of progressivity.  However 
it falls far short of what it ought to be doing to rescue low 
income Canadians forced on to the tax rolls by bracket creep. The 
government has benefited from this tax on inflation during the 
last eight years of its mandate.  The government has put an 
additional 1.9 million low income people on to the tax rolls by 
way of bracket creep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance proposes to raise the basic personal 
exemption to $10,000 and match it with a $10,000 spousal 
equivalent.  We would no longer have second class citizens when 
it comes to the tax code.  Stay at home parents would no longer 
be regarded as having less economic value than their income 
earning spouses.  We would also have a $3,000 per child tax 
credit, which would mean that a family of four under our system 
would face zero taxes on their first $26,000 of income.  That 
would remove at least 1.4 million low income Canadians from the 
tax rolls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it galling to see Liberals pat themselves on the back 
about how progressive they are and how they favour the poor when 
in fact they oppose measures like this one, measures which would 
give real relief to the working poor and people on fixed incomes. 
That is another reason we oppose the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not just penalizing people at the low end of the scale. 
Through the bill and in its economic statement of October the 
government would raise income thresholds at which people are 
taxed at higher levels at marginal rates.  That is a baby step in 
the right direction but we are still miles from the threshold 
levels for marginal rates as set in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People do not enter the highest tax bracket in the United States 
until they earn over $250,000 U.S., or well over $350,000 
Canadian, whereas one enters that bracket in Canada upon earning 
$100,000 Canadian.  Bright young entrepreneurs who work hard, 
succeed and get ahead are penalized by the government the moment 
they break into six figures, but people in the United States earn 
three to four times that before being hit by the highest marginal 
rate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can feel my Liberal colleagues' soak the rich, politics of 
envy gene kicking in.  They want to stand and say that the rich 
should pay their share.  Successful Canadians do pay their share. 
The top 10% of income earners earn about one-third of the income 
in the country and pay about half the income taxes.  The top 1% 
of income earners earn about 9% of the income and pay about 20% 
of taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who create the most wealth and are successful pay a hugely 
disproportionate share of taxes.  I am not necessarily arguing 
with that.  However they would create more wealth, invest more, 
take more risks and ultimately create more jobs if we raised the 
income thresholds for the marginal rates substantially higher as 
is the case for many of our competitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance Party thinks the optimum tax policy is not 
to penalize people for working hard.  We would adopt the generous 
exemptions I have outlined plus eventually a single rate which is 
progressive.  We propose a rate of 17%.  That would mean a family 
of four with $26,000 in income, given the generous credits we 
have proposed, would pay zero taxes.  A family of four with 
$52,000 of income would pay 17% on only the taxable half of its 
income.  It would pay an effective rate of 8.5%.   A family of 
four with a multimillion dollar income would effectively pay 17%. 
My colleague from Toronto—Danforth who is the principal 
advocate of this idea knows full well that it is progressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have serious concerns about the inability of the government 
to get tax policy right.  Not only are we falling behind in terms 
of productivity growth.  We are doing so in terms of 
competitiveness.  We are not keeping up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not keeping up on corporate taxes.  According to a major 
study done by KPMG that appeared in the <I>Economist</I> last 
month, we have the highest corporate income taxes in the OECD at 
42.1%.  Our personal income tax burden, relatively speaking, is 
at least 21% higher than in the United States.  In terms of 
competitiveness we are now ranked seventh by the World Economic 
Forum compared to the first place United States.  Ireland, which 
is now in fifth place, has leap frogged over us.  We have fallen 
behind in standard of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is reflected in the value of our currency which is hovering 
at an all time low.  Our currency has lost 25% of its value 
during the tenure of the Liberal government.  It has a value of 
65, 64 and sometimes 63 U.S. cents.  That is an embarrassment and 
a reflection of the impoverishment of this nation under the 
policies of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We oppose the bill and call upon the government to control 
spending.  It must stop these crazy 7% annual increases in 
spending and allow it to remain constant.  Spending must grow in 
relation to population and inflation growth so that we do not 
have net cuts in spending.  We could let it grow at a gentle 
curve commensurate with the size of the country and the level of 
inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Doing that during the five year period outlined in the finance 
minister's statement would mean an additional $58 billion for tax 
relief for working families, for job creation and for debt 
reduction to secure our long term future.  That was the $58 
billion missed opportunity of the finance minister's statement of 
last fall which he will reiterate on Thursday.  It was a missed 
opportunity to create more wealth and pay down the huge national 
mortgage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often when we talk about the debt the finance minister jumps up 
and says we have reduced it.  That is not true.  The debt is 
about $60 billion higher today than when the finance minister 
took office in 1993. 
He has increased the debt.  He has not paid it down.  Public 
sector financial liabilities total about 106% of our gross 
domestic product.  That is the third highest in the G-7 and the 
OECD.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says we can afford to increase spending by 5%, 6% 
or 7% a year and ignore the debt.  However private sector 
economists have projected that we will be in a planning deficit 
by fiscal year 2004-05. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean?  It means that in order to finance these 
reckless increases we will need to eat into the government's 
emergency reserves, the so-called prudence and contingency 
reserves.  Those moneys are not supposed to be spent by reckless 
members of the Liberal cabinet.  They are supposed to be set 
aside in case the economy shrinks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are already eating into the contingency reserve of 
2004 based on very optimistic economic growth projections.  If 
the economy turns down, the surplus that taxpayers have worked so 
hard to obtain will disappear and the promised tax relief will go 
down the sinkhole with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here today ringing alarm bells about the government's 
return to fiscal irresponsibility.  We plead with it to look not 
just at the next two years but at four or five years down the 
road and what will happen if spending continues on its current 
trajectory.  Therefore I move:

<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there was a program that my 
friends and I used to watch in the 1950s and 1960s.  It was 
called <I>The Twilight Zone</I>.  The member for Calgary Southeast 
probably never had a chance to watch it, but he sounded very much 
like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not where to begin but I will focus on a couple of areas. 
The hon. member talks about the debt.  The government is paying 
down debt faster than any other industrialized nation.  The 
member conveniently forgets that one cannot attack the debt until 
one eliminates the deficit, which we did.  We started that as 
soon as we came into office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member knows that federal government spending is at the 
lowest level in terms of GDP since the early 1950s.  We will 
continue that moderating approach.  The member talks about 
possible deficits.  There is no evidence of any deficits.  The 
Minister of Finance has budgeted and planned so that we have 
fiscal cushions to absorb changes in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What got me the most was when the member said Canadians were not 
really getting a tax cut.  He said the $100 billion tax cut would 
not be a tax cut for most Canadians.  He said part of it would, I 
admit that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give some examples.  We will ask Canadians if they think 
this is a tax cut.  One earner families of four earning $40,000 
paid about $3,325 in federal income taxes last year.  This year 
they will pay about $1,100 less.  That is a 32% saving.  The 
saving will increase to 59% by the year 2004.  I ask the hon. 
member if that is not a tax saving.  I think it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year two earner families of four earning $60,000 paid about 
$5,700 in federal income taxes.  Next year they will pay over 
$1,000 less, a tax saving of 18%. 
Those savings would increase to 34% by the year 2004.  I take 
that as a tax decrease.  In other words, Canadians will pay a lot 
less tax as a result of the October 2000 economic and fiscal 
update.  I challenge the member to refute that those are not tax 
savings.  Those members talk about re-indexation until they are 
blue in the face.  They ask why we did not re-index the tax 
system.  We have done that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about the Canada pension plan.  He knows full 
well that the Canadian pension plan is a contribution based 
pension scheme and that those funds do not go anywhere near 
consolidated revenue.  He knows that and yet he continues to talk 
about it as being a tax.  Would the member reconsider his 
statements and come clean with Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary 
secretary is in the twilight zone.   He has to defend the highest 
personal income tax burden in the developed world.  It is a tough 
job to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the parliamentary secretary talked about the so-called tax 
savings he was including new spending transfers like the child 
tax benefit.  The government will be sending out cheques to 
people and calling them the child tax benefit.  That is fine but 
it is a spending increase and he is calling it a tax cut.  That 
is not honest bookkeeping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary wants us to ignore the $29 billion 
CPP tax grab.  He says that is off-budget.  It is in an Al 
Goresque lock box or something.  That is nonsense.  Those moneys 
have always been fungible.  We know that money going into the CPP 
has been spent as though it were in general revenues.  It is a 
tax that must be paid by Canadians mandated by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the parliamentary secretary really misses is the fact that 
even with some modest steps forward on the tax front, the 
government is allowing $58 billion to be gobbled up by new 
spending above and beyond the rate of growth in population and 
inflation.  That is a missed opportunity of $58 billion which can 
and should be delivered to working families in the form of far 
more dramatic tax relief.  This would enable us to increase our 
productivity and our standard of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money could go toward the national debt but he did not even 
talk about that.  He said that we could not reduce the debt until 
the deficit was eliminated.  He is right.  The government took 
four years to eliminate the deficit.  According to Dale Orr of 
WEFA, Don Drummond of the Toronto-Dominion Bank, a former 
associate deputy minister of finance and the member's own 
colleague from Markham, we are now going back into a deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last October his colleague said that there could be as much as a 
$2.6 billion planning deficit.  He did not address the fact that 
we are at risk of going back into deficit territory in the out 
years of the current fiscal plan because spending is not under 
control.  That is the challenge and that is the question the 
government needs to answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is the House ready for the question?

<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (for the Minister of Finance)</B> 
moved that Bill C-17, an act to amend the Budget Implementation 
Act, 1997 and the Financial Administration Act, be read the third 
time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to 
address the House today at third reading of Bill C-17, an act to 
amend the Budget Implementation Act, 1997, including the 
provision of additional funding to the Canada foundation for 
innovation, and to amend the Financial Administration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by discussing the increased funding for the Canada 
foundation for innovation.   The CFI was established in the 1997 
budget and remains high on the government's list of funding 
priorities for university research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will recall that the foundation, an independent 
corporation operating at arm's length from government, was 
established to provide support for modernizing research 
infrastructure at universities, research hospitals and not for 
profit research institutions in the areas of health, environment, 
science and engineering. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1997 budget provided for an initial upfront federal 
investment of $800 million.  An additional $200 million followed 
in the 1999 budget.  Without the extra funding, the foundation's 
awards would have ended in 2001. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A further $900 million was subsequently announced in the 2000 
budget and support for the CFI was extended until 2005.  To date 
the foundation's activities have been well received by its 
partners, groups like universities, research hospitals, business, 
the voluntary sector, individuals and provincial governments also 
provide funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces, for example, strongly support the participation 
of their research institutions in CFI programs, either by 
contributing to CFI supported projects or by establishing 
complementary funding programs of their own.  Quebec and Ontario, 
for example, provide matching funds for CFI awards. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CFI provides up to 40% of funding to support research 
infrastructure projects, all of which helps universities and 
research hospitals acquire the laboratories and equipment they 
need for state of the art research. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far the CFI has supported 95 research organizations across 
Canada, including 65 universities, 18 colleges and 12 research 
hospitals.  Bill C-17 legislates an additional $1.25 billion in 
funding in 2000-01 to the Canada foundation for innovation and 
extends its activities to the year 2010.  The amount includes 
$500 million from the October 2000 economic statement and budget 
update, and a further $750 million that was announced on March 6 
by the Ministers of Finance and Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $500 million announced in last October's economic statement 
will be invested in two ways.  First, $400 million will allow the 
foundation to contribute to the operating costs of new awards. 
The remaining $100 million will help support the participation of 
Canadian researchers in leading edge international research 
projects and facilities that offer significant research benefits 
to Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The additional $750 million announced in March for the CFI will 
build on this funding by providing additional stability to 
universities as they plan their future research priorities. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CFI needs the additional funding to help it support the 
operating costs of new awards and the participation of Canadian 
researchers in international research projects.  Further, 
additional funding for the CFI would help the federal government 
to reach its goal of at least doubling its current investment in 
R and D by the year 2010, a commitment that was made in the 
Speech from the Throne in January.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-17 also amends the Financial Administration Act.  It is a 
statute that encompasses the financial administration of the 
Government of Canada, the establishment and maintenance of its 
accounts, and the control of crown corporations.  The act also 
sets out the statutory framework under which the government can 
borrow money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-17 would improve the operation of the Financial 
Administration Act.  It would reinstate the Canada Pension Plan 
Investment Board as one of the crown corporations exempted from 
divisions I to IV of part X of the Financial Administration Act. 
The exemption would protect the independence of the board while 
the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board legislation would 
provide a strong accountability regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendments to the Canadian Wheat Board Act in 1998 inadvertently 
deleted the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board from subsection 
85(1) of the Financial Administration Act, meaning that the board 
was subject to various crown corporation control provisions under 
the Financial Administration Act, which put it in conflict with 
its own mandate.  Clearly it was neither wanted nor intended and 
Bill C-17 would correct that error.  This change would be 
retroactive to December 1998 to ensure that the Canada Pension 
Plan Investment Board had always operated within the laws of 
Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second amendment reinforces the authority of parliament over 
any borrowing by or on behalf of the crown.  It provides for 
greater certainty that it is parliament that must specifically 
authorize borrowings made on behalf of Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measure would also provide clarification and consistency 
respecting the role of the Minister of Finance ensuring 
appropriate management of government indebtedness.  Bill C-17 
would ensure that all borrowings, not just the borrowing of 
money, are subject to the supervision by the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, the amendments to the Financial Administration Act 
would improve its operation.  The changes to the Budget 
Implementation Act, 1997 that would provide additional funding to 
the Canada foundation for innovation and extend its activities to 
the year 2010 are consistent with the government's commitment to 
at least doubling its current investment in R and D by the year 
2010. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada foundation for innovation is deserving of this 
increased funding so that it can continue to promote research in 
Canada and inspire young new Canadian researchers. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that my colleagues in the House support investment in 
education, research and innovation.  I encourage them to pass the 
legislation later this day. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I seek unanimous consent to split the balance of my 
time with my hon. colleague from St. Albert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  In this case the second party to get 
the floor in this debate would have 40 minutes.  Does the member 
from Calgary Southeast have the consent of the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise at 
third reading of Bill C-17, an act to amend the Budget 
Implementation Act, 1997 and the Financial Administration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two parts to the bill.  I will emphasize the aspects 
related to the Budget Implementation Act, 1997.  My colleague, 
the chair of the public accounts committee and chief critic for 
the treasury board, will address the amendments to the Financial 
Administration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill seeks to increase funding for research and development 
through the Canada foundation for innovation by some $750 million 
over an undefined period of 10 years.  This follows quite 
logically the remarks I just delivered on Bill C-22 when I 
discussed at length the irresponsible approach the government was 
taking to program spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke about how in the fiscal year just ended program spending 
had grown by 7.1%, how the government had overspent its budgeted 
amount every fiscal year, and how for the next four years the 
government was estimated to average spending increases of about 
5%.  I expect it would be substantially more than that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT33"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT33"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1345

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also talked about the phenomenon known as March madness where 
ministers make spending announcements without proper 
authorization.  I talked about how in April 2001, the last month 
of the fiscal year, we spent some $16 billion or 70% more than 
the average monthly amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is of relevance to the bill before us.  The government is 
proposing that we authorize an additional $750 million for the 
Canada foundation for innovation.  Let me say at the outset that 
the official opposition, the Canadian Alliance, supports in 
principle an appropriate and responsible level of funding for 
research, development and innovation in academia which can be of 
economic value to the country.  We believe government can play an 
appropriate role in that respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However such funding must be limited by the available resources. 
We are concerned that the $750 million funding envelope has no 
defined time period or parameters.  It is not limited.   The 
government says it may be spent over the next 10 years or so, or 
perhaps not.  That is not a responsible approach.  For a spending 
program like this the government has an obligation to come before 
us and detail where it expects to come up with the money and in 
which years and to book the money as spent in each of those 
fiscal years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has not only criticized the ongoing practice 
of March madness as inherently inefficient.  He has repeatedly 
criticized the practice of booking future expenditures in one 
year as the government did with the famous millennium scholarship 
program and as it is doing now with the Canada foundation for 
innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This accounting practice would not be accepted in the private 
sector.  The government is ignoring its own rules and the 
recommendations of the auditor general in the way it is managing 
the moneys it seeks to authorize through the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern is that the government does not have a clear 
framework for financing science or research and development.  We 
are dealing with major scientific and R and D projects on a case 
by case, piecemeal basis.  My colleague from Calgary Southwest, 
our science and technology critic, has made and will continue to 
make important remarks on the subject.  We need very clear 
criteria for the allocation of money for science, technology, 
research and development.  Throwing the money into a big envelope 
and saying it will somehow be distributed on an equitable and 
meaningful basis is not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we adjudicate the relative economic and social value of a 
cyclotron project in British Columbia versus a nuclear research 
facility in Ontario versus a research program for astronomy?  All 
these things come before us.  Each has merits in and of itself 
but parliamentarians have no overall objective criteria by which 
to judge the value of competing R and D demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason our party platform proposes that parliament 
appoint a chief scientist, a position which exists in many other 
national governments.  Such a person would be the principal 
adviser to both the government and the legislature on scientific 
questions.  He or she could help develop a clear framework to 
priorize the many competing demands related to R and D, science 
and technology.  This would not require a large or expensive 
bureaucracy and it would be helpful to have such objective, 
external advice.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are our concerns regarding the first part of the bill.  I 
will briefly outline our concerns regarding the amendments to the 
Financial Administration Act, concerns my colleague for St. 
Albert will elaborate further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clause seeks to clarify that parliament must provide 
explicit authority to departments, agencies, boards and 
commissions of the government in order to incur debt.  That is 
very interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was briefed on the bill by officials from the Department of 
Finance who explained that the clause came about because of one 
of the government's innumerable legislative drafting errors.  The 
error allows the Financial Administration Act to be interpreted 
in a way that permits departments and agencies to incur debt on 
their own authority without explicit authorization from 
parliament delegated to the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past couple of years the Department of National Defence 
has been in a pitched quasi-legal battle with the Department of 
Finance over this question.  The DND has sought independent 
borrowing authority not delegated by parliament which of course 
has the power of the purse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore support the aspect of the amendment regarding 
borrowing authority.  However it begs the question:  How can the 
government consistently bring forth legislation with such 
significant drafting errors which parliament must then spend 
valuable legislative time rectifying?  That is a serious concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In bill after bill, as finance critic, I deal with all sorts of 
tax amendments which seek to amend errors in bills originally 
presented by the government.  We must accept to a certain extent 
the bona fides of departmental officials and the government, the 
ministers who bring these bills to parliament, that they are 
technically correct.  However too often they are not, as in this 
instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment also deals with certain regulations surrounding 
the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board because of another 
drafting error.  When the government made amendments to the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act it forgot to include the Canada Pension 
Plan Investment Board.  The CPP investment board is therefore 
subject to intervention by the finance minister.  He can go into 
the CPP investment fund and strip cash out of it, contrary to 
assurances given at the time of passage of Bill C-2 in the last 
parliament which created the CPP investment board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However because of a drafting error the finance minister, 
contrary to every assurance granted us, can go into the Canada 
Pension Plan Investment Board and fire personnel, trash or write 
his own business plan, and strip cash out of the fund.  This 
loophole needs to be plugged.  It should never have occurred in 
the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will therefore be opposing the legislation.  We will urge the 
government to take a much closer look at bills of this nature to 
ensure they do not create future problems which we must then go 
back and solve. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as my hon. colleague from Calgary Southeast indicated, I 
will be speaking to certain aspects of the bill.  One aspect on 
which I will focus is the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board 
and the fact that it is retroactively being exempted from large 
sections of the Financial Administration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Financial Administration Act is a very thick document that 
governs and dictates how the government manages its internal 
finances.  A large number of agencies, boards and so on must 
conform to the Financial Administration Act to ensure their 
finances are handled appropriately.  Why would they not be? 
However this clause would exempt the Canada Pension Plan 
Investment Board from the FAA. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1355"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also it is backdated to December 31, 1998.  I understand from 
the government it is the old housekeeping rule that somewhere 
along the line it was originally exempt from the Financial 
Administration Act.  When somebody was doing some drafting of 
another piece of legislation they inadvertently omitted to keep 
the exemption there, but it slipped back in, that they were 
subject to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there is a fundamental principle that legislation cannot 
be backdated.  It is never retroactive.  Why is it in this case? 
If we go to some particular piece of legislation and read some 
fine arcane little rule, it says that where the government makes 
a mistake it can backdate it if it so desires.  Do we live in a 
real democratic country or do we not?  That is what it is coming 
to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, when we were discussing Bill C-22 and 
the $125 grant to all Canadians who qualified for the GST tax 
credit, I questioned the legality of the information being taken 
from the Income Tax Act.  The act guarantees the confidentiality 
of income tax returns.  The government dipped into it just so it 
could send out cheques for $125.  The Income Tax Act does not 
give the government the legal authority to get the information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again we are having legislation backdated a couple or three 
years just because somebody did not do their homework properly or 
inadvertently made a mistake.  The net result is that the 
Liberals are imposing it in the House.  They will use their 
majority.  They will bring out the whip.  They will lash people 
into submission, to say this is good stuff.  In a democratic 
country it is not good stuff when they have to backdate 
legislation.  It cannot be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government actually doing with the backdating of 
legislation?  It is exempting the board from being examined by 
the Auditor General of Canada, the watchdog of Canadians.  What 
is the AG being prevented from examining?  He is being prevented 
from looking at the $40 billion or more of money Canadians have 
set aside for their retirement.  It is being held in trust by the 
government and being managed by the particular board.  The 
auditor general cannot, by virtue of the legislation, go in there 
to take a look and assure Canadians that all is well. The 
government does not want that.  It does not want these kind of 
questions to be asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say as a Canadian that the people in my riding of St. Albert, 
and I am sure I speak for all Canadians, would like to know that 
the pension plan is being managed properly, securely, safely, 
prudently and so on.  They will never know that.  They will never 
be allowed to ask that question because the auditor general will 
never be allowed to ask that question by virtue of clause 6 in 
Bill C-17.  It is absolutely despicable.  Therefore I move: 
<A NAME="LINK35">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the 
word “That” and substituting the following therefor: 
</UL><UL><UL>

desirability of hearing from the Auditor General relating to his 
concern about the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board”.

Canadian artist who painted this portrait. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Brenda Bury was born, educated and trained in England.  She took 
an honours degree in fine art at the University of Reading where 
she studied under Anthony Betts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Bury travelled to Canada for just over a year where she 
painted portraits, beginning with the then prime minister, John 
Diefenbaker.  She left Canada after a short period and returned 
to England where she thought England's strong tradition for 
portraiture would improve her skills.  In 1964 she painted Lord 
Mountbatten of Burma and it was he who later arranged for her to 
paint the Queen herself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Bury returned to Canada in the 1980s and set up a studio in 
Toronto.  Very shortly after her return, she found herself back 
in England at number 10 Downing Street to paint a lifesize 
portrait of Prime Minister Thatcher and her advisors in the 
Falklands conflict.  Ms. Bury has also painted the Right Hon. 
Jeanne Sauvé, a speaker of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I myself have had the privilege of sitting for Brenda Bury.  I 
will never forget the magic and amazement the first time I saw my 
likeness revealed on the canvass.  I am thrilled that her talent 
and skills are being recognized by the people of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the motive forces behind our economy and prosperity. 
The figures cannot lie: 319,000 full time jobs were created, 
taking the unemployment figures to the lowest level since 1974. 
We also attracted $93 billion in direct foreign investments, 
which indicates a massive vote of confidence in our economic 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian trade and investment have attained new record levels in 
2000 for the ninth consecutive year of economic growth; this is 
the longest and most stable period of expansion since the 1960s.

that will serve the interests of all Canadians.

parliament for Berthier—Montcalm, along with actor Marc Beaupré, 
launched a tour of Quebec with the theme “At least give us a 
chance”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main objective of this undertaking is to express aloud what 
everyone in Quebec is thinking.  All stakeholders in Quebec are 
opposed to this reform, judging it to be pointless and even 
dangerous, as far as its anticipated effects on reducing crime in 
the long term are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present young offender legislation works very well in 
Quebec. Proof of this is that the youth crime rate in Quebec has 
dropped 23% and this legislation has made it possible for Quebec 
to record the lowest rate in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why Quebec says no to a piece of legislation that is 
focused more on repression than rehabilitation.  It says no to 
Bill C-7.  Consequently, we are asking the federal government to 
allow Quebec to opt out of application of Bill C-7 and to allow 
us to continue to apply the current legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of the Environment and has to do 
with remarks that the Prime Minister made in Atlanta, Georgia, 
with respect to the export of bulk water.  The Prime Minister is 
reported to have not entirely ruled out Premier Roger Grimes' 
proposal to harvest 13 billion gallons of water from Gisborne 
Lake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the fact that the Minister of the Environment has spoken 
so critically of this proposal in the past, could he explain what 
the Prime Minister was up to?  Is the government still opposed to 
the particular project, or is the Prime Minister indicating an 
openness to the project that was not there before? 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  The 
government's position remains clear.  We oppose bulk water 
removals.  This is an environmentally sound strategy.  It 
respects provincial jurisdiction and is trade consistent.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, government spending is running out of control.  In 
the last fiscal year program spending was up by over 7% and the 
government projects to see program spending increase by at least 
5% a year, which is nearly twice the combined level of inflation 
plus population growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were simply to restrain spending at the rate of inflation 
and population growth there would be an additional $58 billion 
available for additional tax relief and debt reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the finance minister.  Why has he bowed to 
pressure from his big spending cabinet colleagues rather than 
doing the responsible thing, holding the line and providing 
Canadians with more of their own hard earned money? 
<P><A NAME="LINK100"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member's numbers simply do not hold water, but 
there is no doubt there has been increases in certain areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would simply like to ask him:  Given that the majority of 
those increases have taken place in the transfers to provinces 
for health, that they have taken place in terms of increases in 
elderly benefits and that they have taken place in the increase 
in equalization, perhaps the hon. member would tell me which of 
those three programs he would cut. 
<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, there is a growing consensus that the government is 
headed for a planning deficit within four fiscal years.  Even the 
member for Markham and the former ADM of finance have said that a 
planning deficit could occur in the year 2004-05.  That would eat 
into the so-called contingency reserves which are supposed to be 
there to handle unexpected emergencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the finance minister commit to the House here and now that 
he will not delve into the contingency reserves except for 
emergencies?  Will he commit that he will not finance regular

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime

the declaration changes absolutely nothing in NAFTA and does not 
preclude the bulk export of water in any way.

</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to Bow River water quality below Lake Louise,

comprehensively evaluated; (<I>i</I>) based on the cumulative effects 
of proposed development community development and

what are the potential adverse impacts on the ecological 
integrity of the Bow River? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> (a) 
The potential cumulative impact of development and increased 
visitor use at Lake Louise is to discharge more wastewater 
effluent into the Bow River. If this caused an increase in 
nutrients to this nutrient poor river, it could stimulate the 
growth of algae and a shift in the diversity and abundance of 
aquatic insects, with pollution tolerant species displacing more 
common species, such as mayflies. Fish are not likely to be 
affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) Water quality monitoring and aquatic studies of the Bow 
River, at Lake Louise and elsewhere on the river, have been 
ongoing since at least 1973. Flow records exist for many decades 
earlier. Some of the studies, such as thesis research, are of 
comparatively short duration but very useful in understanding the 
ecology of the river, possible reaction to effluent and ways to 
avoid adverse effects. The findings of the  recent environmental 
assessment for the proposed upgrade to the Banff wastewater 
treatment plant are especially relevant to the Lake Louise 
situation, as many of the issues are similar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) The studies conducted on the Banff wastewater treatment 
plant dealt with the issue of cumulative effect for communities 
downstream from Lake Louise. The environmental screening for the 
Lake Louise wastewater treatment plant will also address the 
possible downstream effects of effluent produced at Lake Louise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) The Lake Louise wastewater treatment plant is being designed 
to meet both federal and provincial criteria for waste treatment 
plants. In most cases, it will exceed these criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) Potential aesthetic concerns are odour and visual impacts. 
Currently they are not significant. Achieving the effluent 
standards will address aesthetic concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(f) The parameters for describing naturally occurring waters are 
standard measurements of the presence and amounts of chemicals, 
organisms and solids contained in the water column, for example 
phosphorous, coliform bacteria and suspended solids. These are 
measured at one location above Lake Louise and three locations 
downstream from Lake Louise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(g) There is no benchmark for the quantity of effluent 
discharged by the Lake Louise wastewater treatment plant and it 
is not conventional practice to set one. Instead, the performance 
of a wastewater treatment plant is assessed on the quality of the 
effluent, the goal being to avoid having a significant adverse 
effect on the receiving waters. To that end, Parks Canada has 
established and is working toward leadership targets that exceed 
all conventional limits of performance for wastewater treatment 
plants in Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(h) Key strategies for the area include water conservation, 
limiting commercial growth and managing human use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) See (a) above. The changes being contemplated for the 
existing Lake Louise wastewater treatment plant are to improve its 
capacity and effectiveness to ensure the potential cumulative 
effect described in (a) does not occur, even if the quantity of 
effluent discharge does increase as a result of more visitors to 
Lake Louise.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-10, an 
act respecting the national marine conservation areas of Canada, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee, and of the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Lanctôt (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak today before this House, not only as a member of 
parliament, but also as a citizen concerned with protecting the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois, I am in favour of 
legislation aimed at protecting the environment and of measures 
focusing on environments at risk, be they land or water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it necessary to remind this House that the Bloc Quebecois 
supported the bill creating the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine 
park?  Our support, however, is neither blind nor naive.  We will 
continue to support pro-environment bills, but not at any price 
nor in just any way.  Hence our opposition to Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our primary objection is that the federal government's intention 
is to use this bill to appropriate lands that are under 
provincial jurisdiction by making orders concerning the creation 
of marine areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government would contravene section 92(5) of the 
Constitution Act, 1867, which provides that the management and 
sale of public lands are a provincial, not a federal 
jurisdiction. The federal government cannot use an environmental 
protection measure to appropriate provincial lands. It should 
seek the provinces' co-operation, instead of resorting to its 
usual steamrolling and centralizing approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is yet another example of the federal government's 
stubbornness about a process that works well. Again, the 
establishment of the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park is the 
result of co-operation and partnership. Why does the government 
refuse to listen to reason? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the case with the young offenders legislation. The Quebec 
approach, which is based on rehabilitation and reintegration, has 
proven effective, but the federal government continues its push 
for a hard line approach. Today, I realize that the government is 
using the same process with this bill in that it wants to pass it 
first and then look at the issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fear for the future of intergovernmental relations because we 
cannot trust a process that does not respect the public interest 
and, more importantly, because we cannot trust a government that 
does not respect its own departments. The Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans already has a program of marine protection zones in 
place. I stress the fact that this program is already in effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result of all this is a state of confusion, and particularly 
of lack of respect. This is a case where the winner will be the 
one that will manage to gain the upper hand. Within the same 
government, we could end up with a duplication of tasks and 
skills.

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we want duplication?  How can the government justify this 
duplication?  Why is it necessary?  How many levels are required? 
How far will the federal government go in its quest for 
duplication? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What worries me about this scenario is the rivalry that will 
result.  On the one hand, we have the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans, which has expertise in this area. There is the Department 
of the Environment, which also has expertise in this area. On the 
other hand, we have Heritage Canada, which has a mandate to 
promote Canadian unity. Which of them can we trust?  Which of 
them should we trust: Heritage Canada, which uses the environment 
for national unity purposes, or Fisheries and Oceans, which 
manages our marine natural resources?  Can we trust the federal 
government to make the right choice in this case?  Sometimes, I 
wonder whether the government has any judgment left, let alone 
common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My main concern about the bill is the flagrant lack of 
co-operation within the government itself.  I strongly doubt 
whether such behaviour would reassure the other levels of 
government regarding the introduction and enforcement of a bill 
which intentions are noble, but which really boils down to 
unhealthy rivalry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to another question: Who will have the upper hand 
in the event of conflict?  Which department will have the last 
word?  If the federal government answers this, it will be 
tantamount to revealing its true objective and its true nature as 
far as the purpose of this bill goes.  This could easily become a 
two edged sword.  On the one hand, it insists that the 
environment is a priority, while on the other it takes advantage 
of this fine principle to flog national identity, using Heritage 
Canada which, I would remind hon. members, possesses no expertise 
whatsoever as far as the environment is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result is regrettable.  Even if we do not go so far as to 
call it a downright dangerous appropriation of funds and 
resources, there is confusion, total and insurmountable 
confusion. There is such confusion that even those in charge of 
the various departments are lost themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is confusion among the departments, it is easy to 
imagine what confusion there would be among the key stakeholders. 
Which department will be the one to really administer this 
protected zone?  Which one will really administer the 
stakeholders?  Which will penalize those breaking the law?  All 
these questions remain without answers, and no answers will be 
forthcoming, for there is no one capable of answering without 
sinking into a morass of duplicating and overlapping policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this much confusion within the federal government itself, 
it is easy to imagine the confusion there would be at other 
levels of government.  To whom would a provincial government such 
as Quebec go in connection with the administration of a protected 
zone?  I have no idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This confusion gives rise to another problem as well.  The 
problem is a fundamental one.  If the ministers of a government 
cannot work together, how can we expect the provincial 
governments and Quebec to collaborate?  It is understandable why 
the Government of Quebec would refuse to collaborate in this 
project.  The federal government is unable to tell us clearly and 
precisely why this bill comes from Canadian Heritage, when 
Fisheries and Oceans Canada already has a marine area protection 
program.  The Bloc Quebecois cannot but oppose such an incredible 
administrative muddle as this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way this bill is to be implemented is not clear and cannot 
be because of the nature of its objectives.

jurisdictions and in Quebec's jurisdiction, under cover of the 
environment.  How far will the federal government go in taking 
over Quebec's and provincial jurisdictions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate my opposition to Bill C-10 on protected marine areas 
for several reasons, including the overlap of the 
responsibilities of departments and, more particularly, because 
of the indirect approach taken in appropriating jurisdictions 
that belong exclusively to the provinces and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the federal government has chosen to introduce a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member suggested that Bill C-10 interfered in provincial 
jurisdiction.  He also noted that the proposed legislation had 
areas of overlap with provincial legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member advise the House of one example of overlap 
to which he refers? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Lanctôt:</B> Mr. Speaker, the example is simple. These 
are provincial jurisdictions, these are Quebec's jurisdictions. 
The two levels of government co-operated when the agreement on 
the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park was signed. The question 
begs the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Duplication on the government's part will be twofold. It is 
trying to take over lands that belong to Quebec, lands that come 
under provincial jurisdiction, as stated in the Constitution Act, 
1867.  It is duplication to try to take over lands by using such 
a noble piece of legislation, a bill dealing with marine areas 
and wildlife conservation on certain lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been asked to give examples.  Well, it is all the pitiful 
attempts by the government to use the environment to get hold of 
some land. This is unbelievable, in my opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must protect the environment, but through co-operation with 
Quebec and in the respect of existing jurisdictions. The federal 
government did it once. The Quebec government was very 
co-operative and this allowed for the protection of the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine conservation areas. That agreement 
was made possible thanks to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government now putting this in the hands of Heritage 
Canada, when there is overlapping even in that department? We 
wonder about the reasons for such duplication. Just imagine. This 
government already has experts in the Department of the 
Environment and in the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, and 
the sponsor of this bill is the Minister of Canadian Heritage. We 
wonder why. I am asked “Where is the duplication? Where is 
the overlapping?” Nothing could be more obvious.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great pleasure that I take part in the debate on Bill C-10, 
on marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the bill reflects the pan-Canadian vision that is 
characteristic of the present government. History will probably 
remember this government as the champion of centralization, as 
far as the development of this great beautiful Canada is 
concerned, a country that is more and more untied because Ottawa 
wants it to be so, even though it does not necessarily have the 
agreement of the Canadian population. Of course, members 
understand that if I mention the agreement of the Canadian 
population, it is because it is obvious that there are doubts 
about the agreement of the Quebec population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the present federal government, under this 
parliament and under the previous one, has been guided by the 
social union framework agreement, signed in February 1999 by nine 
provinces out of ten. Mr. Bouchard, the head of Quebec state, 
like all his predecessors no matter their party allegiances, 
refused to take part in a scheme aimed at trivializing Quebec by 
refusing to recognize its specificity and the existence of its 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why Premier Lucien Bouchard refused to sign the social 
union framework agreement, which has nonetheless actually been 
implemented. 
It is a tragedy for Quebec and for the people of Quebec to see 
the actions of this institution, which is so pretentiously 
democratic. We saw it recently at the summit of the Americas in 
Quebec City. Canada praised democracy and demanded democracy from 
other countries, even taking a tough stance against the Cuban 
government. This does not ring true when one knows how things 
work in this great Canadian democracy, where returning officers 
are still appointed on a partisan basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the premier of Quebec, the head of the Quebec state, 
refused to sign in 1999, as one of his predecessors refused to 
sign in 1982, the unilateral patriation of the constitution 
under Prime Minister Trudeau, it did not change anything to 
Canadian logic. It did not disturb the federal steam roller, 
which is there to level the provinces. It is there to standardize 
them, which may be necessary. That is one of the constraints of 
globalization to increase efficiency in Canada, but it is a 
tragedy for Quebec to be stripped of its specificity and of its 
distinct character and to be moulded, week after week, month 
after month, into the great Canadian whole with no attention 
being paid to its distinctive features. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No attention is being paid to the fact that Quebec is supposed 
to be, according to the member for Saint-Maurice and Prime 
Minister of Canada, a distinct society. It is the government 
people themselves who invented this concept, following the 
commitments made in Verdun, where Quebecers were told that they 
were a distinct society. Then, without even using that 
expression, commitments were made during the referendum campaign, 
just as Mr. Trudeau had made commitments in 1980. He had said 
that he would put his head on the chopping block if changes were 
not made, although he did not say which changes exactly. 
They put theirs seats on the line for Quebec to be duly 
recognized within the Canadian federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened in the following months? They announced that the 
constitution was being patriated, which happened in 1982 without 
Quebec's consent. This phenomenon occurred again in 1999 with the 
social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is quite a change; the more it changes the more it is the 
same. No efforts were spared, through a shameless propaganda 
campaign to the tune of $1,000 or $2,000, as we say in Quebec 
“The sky is the limit”, to try to convince Quebecers they can be 
good Canadians. They have tried to convince Quebecers slowly and 
carefully of the value of the concept of nations, founding 
nations in particular, and distinct society to mention a few, to 
get back to this one, which was put forward by the Primer 
Minister himself. They never said to which areas distinct society 
would apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it apply to marine conservation areas? No, it would not. 
Would it apply to parental leave? No, it would not. Would it 
apply to the young offenders issue? No, it would not. Would it 
apply to privacy policy, where I dare say Quebec is far ahead of 
Canada as it is in many other areas?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could also mention the personal information issue about which 
the Conseil du patronat as well as the Quebec Bar and the 
Confédération des syndicats nationaux told the government “stay 
out of this. Quebec's legislation is excellent. We do not need 
the strong arm of the federal government interfering in the area 
of personal information. Stay out of this. We have good 
legislation in Quebec”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Distinct society does not apply in this area any more than it 
does with regard to parental leave, marine conservation areas and 
5$ a day care. If the government was consistent, it would say “We 
made commitments during the referendum campaign. 
With all due respect for democracy in Quebec and for the people 
of Quebec, we are going to implement what distinct society means. 
Distinct society means an unconditional right to opt out, 
because Quebecers are distinct, because they have successfully 
handled a particular responsibility of our collective life.  We 
therefore have no need to duplicate what already exists”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, that is asking too much. Why?  Because we know perfectly 
well that, if this government dared to do such a thing openly, 
particularly with the knowledge of the English majority in this 
country, there would be quite an outcry from English Canadians, 
who would once again massively reject, as they did the 
Charlottetown accord, any vague desire by this government to 
recognize that the people of Quebec have distinct rights or 
characteristics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a dead end for Quebec. Slowly but surely, Quebecers are 
coming to the realization that there is no future in this 
country.  There is no future for characteristics specific to 
Quebec or for the normal evolution of the Quebec people in this 
country.  It is two countries in one. It is two different kinds 
of logic:  the Canadian one and the Quebec one.  This was the 
simple description that Marcel Léger, the well known and 
marvellous Parti Quebecois organizer, came up with during the 
constitutional debate.  René Lévesque described it as two 
scorpions in the same bottle.  If we go further back in time, the 
Laurendeau-Dunton commission referred to two solitudes in 1963. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the real Canada, a country in which the provinces are 
all put on the same footing, a country in which the power will be 
inexorably displaced to Ottawa, where decisions from coast to 
coast will be made in Ottawa.  It has no time to lose with 
Quebec, which will be made to fit in and slowly disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People need to be aware that, particularly because Quebec cannot 
control its immigration, some demographers feel that the Island 
of Montreal will be non-francophone within eight, ten or twelve 
years.  People need to be aware that, as a result of immigration 
and the birth rate, Quebec will go from its present 24% of the 
Canadian population to just 21% within 25 years and just 16% 
within 50 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is, therefore, an implacable process under way that will 
end up with Quebec's being trivialized, neutralized, if it 
continues to be part of Canada. Quebec must leave, and the 
necessity of this is illustrated by Bill C-10 on marine areas, in 
which the government announces quite openly that the ownership of 
these will be federal, whereas there is a law in place which 
states that the beds of the rivers, the St. Lawrence and its 
estuary are the property of the government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is confrontation. This is what all these squabbles about 
overlap are, these meetings of public servants who want to 
wage administrative battles to the detriment of the public purse. 
It is the poor old taxpayers who will have to pay through the 
nose for all these multiple meetings, evidence of how conflicted 
this country is, while the federal government ignores the recent 
example of the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park, which offered 
a model of a well administered conservation area. This is 
no longer a model for the new Canada that has been under 
construction since 1999, with social union and all the logic that 
goes with it.  This needs to be understood in future by all 
concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that some hon. members on the other side are unaware 
of the gravity of this situation.

people of vision, who love Quebec and know it.  I am sure they do 
not want Quebec to be minimized and ultimately wiped off the map. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the democratic process mentioned earlier, what are we 
reduced to, if we want some degree of vision?  The people of 
Quebec are reduced to being cut down, and systematically so, and 
will end up looking like Acadia, with all its charming influence. 
Then, the next stage is Louisiana and folklore.  That is the sad 
truth.  It is relentless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues from Quebec sitting opposite must understand what 
machinations they are involved in.  It is abnormal to be so 
negligent, so careless.  Or perhaps they are happy, I do not 
know.  There is one thing, though, there are things to be said 
between Quebecers and between right thinking persons, on the 
evolution of this people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must mention the article by Lysiane Gagnon in <I>La Presse</I> on 
Saturday, which gave rather nasty and cavalier treatment to a 
report on the constitutional position of the Liberal Party of 
Quebec . The report was written by an eminent constitutionalist, 
Benoît Pelletier, from the Outaouais region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a discussion paper for right thinking federalists, those 
who still dream of a Canada where Quebec will be respected, 
something I see as Utopian, a dead end. Ms. Gagnon says, and I 
quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the next round, if there is one, God help us— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As if the problem were resolved. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—all the provinces, all the native nations and all of Canada's 
lobby groups will put their demands on the table, and the effect 
of this would probably move Quebec's position away from the 
status quo. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As if the status quo existed. This is the type of smoke and 
mirrors that we get from these types of individuals, such as Ms. 
Gagnon, and from others in Quebec, but Quebec is caught up in 
Canada's moving ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is somewhat like what the Secretary of State for Amateur 
Sport wrote in his document entitled “Building Canada through 
Sport”, which is a monumental mistake, but which at least is 
transparent. Since February 1999, Canada has been moving ahead, 
it is not the status quo. What we have is a Canada that is moving 
ahead like a steamroller, a Canada that trivializes the role of 
the provinces, something which may be necessary for its own good 
performance, but which is tragic for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Gagnon continues by saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would be achieved, for example, in having enshrined in the 
constitution a specificity that is obvious and that exists in any 
case? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“A specificity that is obvious and that exists in any case”. 
This “that exists in any case” is the type of smoke and mirrors 
used by Quebec federalists; it would exist in any case if it were 
enshrined in Canada's constitution. However Quebec's specificity does 
not exist in writing. According to these people, it is a 
perception, and yet, Quebec exists, the Quebec nation exists, the 
Quebec homeland exists. This is not recognized here and this is 
what is tragic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, this is why Quebecers will not always be able to 
have it both ways. We will lose at one level or at the other. If 
we do not react, as we are being asked to by the Premier of 
Quebec, Bernard Landry, it is going to be a matter of life and 
death for Quebec, in terms of its influence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the influence Quebec has right now. Those who, like us 
MPs, have had the privilege of travelling, of meeting people on 
the international scene, see the planet differently. They see a 
planet with a rather impressive Quebec geographically, a Quebec 
that is home to seven million francophones who have a definite 
role to play and who contribute to humanity, which is unique, 
with its French influences, of course, and its English 
influences, with its important Montreal minority, a minority that 
is very respectable and very rich in every sense of the word, 
and its allophone population, because Quebec is incidentally a 
wonderful destination for immigrants.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the Anglo-Saxon influences, particularly from 
Canada and the United States. We are a truly unique people, which 
is clearly an asset in terms of its contribution to the planet 
and to humanity. One just has to look at the situation from afar 
to realize that the fact that Quebec is not sovereign is a 
complete aberration, Mr. Trudeau would have said that it was a 
crime against humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes one wonder where Canada's social democrats are and why 
they are not leading the fight for Quebec's sovereignty. Quebec 
has things to say. Quebec is different. What Quebec has to say 
would benefit not only Canada, but the international community as 
a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot get over how this great country of Canada has failed to 
grasp that Quebec's sovereignty would benefit everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot get over the naïveté, bad faith or cynicism of which 
Lysiane Gagnon is capable when she writes things like this about 
Quebec's specificity, which exists anyway.  I cannot get over it. 
It is sticking one's head in the sand to reason like this when 
one is aware of the constitutional problem, because there is one. 
There is a constitutional problem in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we must go back to the basics of Quebec-Canada 
relations.  There is something wrong with the course of action 
adopted following the 1995 referendum, which, in my view, 
consisted of three scenarios. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first was the status quo, business as usual. The second 
scenario, driven by English Canadians frightened by the 49.4% of 
votes in favour, and the 60% of francophone votes in favour, and 
I think we are still allowed to say this, was to try to please 
Quebecers.  The government would try to amend the Constitution of 
Canada so that Quebecers would feel comfortable in this country 
moving ahead.  The country would amend its constitution to 
reflect the will of the people, because it had had a real scare, 
because for much of the evening on October 30, 1995, Quebec had 
decided in favour of sovereignty.  As luck would have it, around 
11.30 p.m., that sovereignty slipped out of our grasp. We have 
lived with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that English Canada could have learned something from 
this.  The Liberal government therefore had the choice of making 
the country more welcoming to Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third scenario, which was the one the Liberals adopted, was to 
dig in their heels; let Quebecers do what they liked, let them 
make their own choices, but in Canada, this was the direction 
they were taking. Take it or leave it. They had no time and no 
energy to spare to try to find approaches that would make 
Quebecers happy because they would never be happy anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, they have chosen the hard line. They came up with Plan b 
and they enlisted the ineffable Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs. All of this was part of one big scheme. The style the 
minister has chosen is not conducive to problem solving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They dug in their heels and said that that was the way to go 
and that Quebec could get on board or withdraw. The ball is now 
in Quebec's court. I think this deserves more in depth 
consideration. To help us with our reflection, we have before us 
today a technical bill that is utterly misleading and is part of 
a Canadian centralist vision where the federal government calls 
the shots and the provinces have to yield. In 8, 10, 12, 20, or 
25 years from now, the provinces will be just big regional county 
municipalities.

beautiful follow-up when, after having spoken myself on a bill 
described as technical, I hear a general explanation such as 
the one my hon. colleague from the Bloc Quebecois just made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate today is very important on very important 
legislation about the environment. The government has trivialized 
it, but my colleague really put it into perspective to show how 
important and urgent it is and perhaps show, as we heard, how 
dishonest the government is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for Trois-Rivières was saying, a bill like 
this one is once again an encroachment. This is done so often 
that we are not in a status quo situation any more. We are 
getting into something that might be dangerous for Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can Quebec counter such a bill and all those encroachments 
in its areas of jurisdiction? If such a measure and such 
encroachment on areas of jurisdiction persist, how can the 
Quebecers who are listening today know what will happen and how 
can Quebec counter these attacks? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank my colleague 
from Châteauguay for his question, which is not easy to answer. 
There is no magic way to counter the initiatives, which are to 
some extent illegitimate, of a government like this one, because 
our democratic rules are involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A government can legislate in areas where it believes it is 
legitimate to do so. When this government decides to more or less 
disregard the constitution, particularly where ethics are 
concerned, then the roads are clear, as we say in Quebec. It will 
be up to the voters to make a decision, following a properly 
conducted election campaign with a real debate. Hopefully, if 
there is a referendum, this type of issue will be raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all the more odious that listening to the member for 
Châteauguay, I was reminded that this government, which claims to 
be democratic and boasts about Canadian democracy, acted without 
a mandate, without consultation, without proper debate and 
without a popular verdict, in other words without the support of 
the population and without any referendum, when it decided in 
1982 to repatriate the Constitution and in 1999 to launch the 
social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, the government decided to repatriate and bring 
a major amendment to the constitution by entrenching into it a 
charter of rights, which was a transcendent event in the history 
of Canada, without a referendum, without seeking the opinion of 
the public and without any mandate. The issue was never raised 
during the election of 1980, but that did not stop the 
government. Neither did the government address the issue of 
social union in 1997 as we had. There had been discussions 
between the provinces to try to improve co-operation with Ottawa. 
When the federal government started throwing its weight around to 
impose its point of view, while giving goodies to the provinces 
that had given in, it had no mandate to do so, there had been no 
debate, let alone a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all the more unbearable today that we feel that the 
government is relying on this transcendent event in the history 
of Canada. Some people are talking about the major one, with the 
repatriation of the constitution, and the minor one, with the 
social union, in the evolution of Canada, a Canada that is moving 
ahead.

this kind of bill, which is giving obvious moral authority to the

no legitimacy, as it arises from a people's consensus that would 
have the Canadian government head in that direction. It is thus 
very wrong to act in this way, especially when the federal 
government claims that Canada is a democratic country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if this answers the question of my colleague from 
Châteauguay, but like other measures taken in recent months, this 
bill clearly shows that this is how things are done in Ottawa 
now, and that Quebecers need to take note, because the provinces 
including Quebec will be cut out of the loop.

designated by UNESCO as a world heritage site for its flora and 
fauna. I cannot imagine that the federal government would throw 
its weight around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless the federal government waves its constitutional magic 
wand, pouring in millions of dollars, using the surpluses, money 
from the unemployment insurance fund, pretending to be generous 
with Quebecers and giving them goodies, in our opinion anyway, to 
buy their conscience when they should condemn federal 
intervention and stand their ground. They might instead see it as 
being advantageous to their association or pressure group, making 
it easier money wise, as they would be freed from financial 
constraints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know the flesh is weak. We know the government can be 
forward-looking. We know it, the Privy Council is here to make 
sure of it. Unless the federal government is banking on human 
weakness, I hope that the people, in Quebec at least, will see 
through it and be on their guard for Quebecers' sake.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker,  we are talking about Bill C-10, an 
act respecting the national marine conservation areas of Canada. 
The Canadian Alliance supports sustaining and developing national 
parks and marine conservation areas that exist for the benefit 
and enjoyment of everyone.  The Canadian Alliance also supports 
sustainable development and environmental protection regulations 
that have been fully debated by parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is bad legislation in that it strengthens the power of 
cabinet while diminishing the effectiveness of elected 
representatives.  No valid argument exists at this time for the 
need for the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious the government is not fully committed to the file, 
as legislation has been allowed to die on the order paper at 
least twice previously.  We know it is unnecessary in that the 
regulatory framework already exists to accomplish what the bill 
purports to want to achieve.  To sum it up, it is a power grab by 
the heritage department, and other government departments are not 
saying anything when they should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a living example from when I was in the Atlantic 
provinces last week with the fisheries committee.  There is a 
fisheries department with its set of regulations for marine 
conservation.  There is a lot of offshore oil and gas development 
off the coast of Newfoundland and off the south coast of Nova 
Scotia.  There is a board called the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore 
Petroleum Board which has full representation from the province 
and from the federal government for joint decision making.  Its 
job is to issue the leases for oil and gas development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one thing that would be at complete conflict with 
oil and gas development, it is obviously the creation of a no-go 
marine conservation area.  One would think that would also have 
joint federal and provincial administration and decision making. 
Guess what?  It does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the natural incentive for the province if it is fully 
represented on the offshore petroleum board and unrepresented on 
marine conservation areas as envisioned under the Fisheries Act 
or under the fisheries department and by this legislation? 
Obviously, it sets up a federal-provincial problem and an 
incentive that is unbalanced in favour of offshore oil and gas 
development at the possible expense of the environment.  It is 
hardly a balanced approach to take and an obvious shortcoming of 
this and other marine conservation legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my question to the Bloc member for Trois-Rivières I spoke 
about my concerns regarding knowing where these 29 parks 
contemplated by the marine conservation legislation of the 
Department of Heritage existed.  The legislation should describe 
the location of the parks it intends to create and insert the 
information into the schedule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was lots of time to do it.  If the department did not have 
time when it first submitted the legislation to the last 
parliament, it certainly has had time by now to fill in lots of 
the gaps.  However it does not want to because it might mobilize 
even more people concerned about the legislation.

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now if the government was going to create a land based 
park, a new national park, it would have to bring it to this 
place.  If the bill goes through and it wanted to create a new 
offshore park, order in council or cabinet could make that 
decision.  It never has to come here.  That is totally 
inappropriate.  However, if we ever wanted to reduce or remove 
one of those areas from that status, then it would have to come 
back here.  That is what I call hypocrisy, a double standard and 
any other number of negative terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke on the bill before in its previous form.  It has not 
changed a whole bunch.  There are things that are not well known 
to the public that need to be known.  For example, fishing 
activity, aquaculture or fisheries management, marine navigation, 
marine safety plans are all subject to the approval of the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage under this bill.  That is a power grab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can see there is already difficulty, and I saw examples of 
this last week, between the agenda of the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage and the agenda of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
in terms of which one is the lead agency, which one deals with 
the stakeholders and all that when it comes to offshore oil and 
gas development on the east coast.  We are going to get there on 
the west coast in terms of oil and gas development.  The debate 
and the discussion is going to move forward.  Quite honestly, it 
is a mess.  We do not need this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now it is very clear whose mandate and responsibility some 
of these activities are.  It is going to become diffuse, subject 
to competing agendas.  We are going to see the special interest 
groups and the lobbyists using leverage on various government 
ministers and departments.  They can go to one department and ask 
for their wish list.  If they do not get it, they can threaten, 
cajole or do other things to go to the other department.  They 
can handout their Brownie badges to whoever they think is 
appealing to their special interest, and the greater good gets 
lost.  This is a way to fudge the ability to act in the national 
interest.  It compromises the ability to act in the national 
interest and increases the viability of special interests to win 
the day rather than the greater good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, without any social economic studies, could for example 
prohibit exploration or exploitation of hydrocarbons, minerals, 
aggregates or any other inorganic material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us think about what I just said a few minutes ago.  To set 
up one of these areas which excluded or prohibited fishing, the 
minister of fisheries and the minister of heritage would have to 
say it was okay.  Why would the minister of heritage be asked if 
it was okay for fishing to be allowed some place on the British 
Columbia coast, or off the coast of Nunavut or off the coast of 
Nova Scotia?  This is a problem.  Any stakeholder that has looked 
at the legislation is very concerned about the implications. 
Those are all problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the lead agency?  If we have a marine conservation area, 
which agency? 
With this we would have three federal departments that could set 
up marine conservation areas.  Which department would set it up? 
How would they make that determination?  Which would be the lead 
agency of the three to help chair this discussion?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked those kinds of questions last week in Halifax of 
fisheries officials and others.  There were no answers.  We are 
debating legislation that would change the status quo, which has 
been long contemplated.  Nobody is even trying to respond to this 
kind of request in the public domain.  This is nuts.  The 
government members should be embarrassed at the mess it has 
created on marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a major problem too in that provincial responsibility is 
potentially being completely co-opted by the federal government. 
I already talked about the natural incentive for the provinces 
when it comes to the offshore petroleum board, the Canada-Nova 
Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board.  However it has major 
implications.  Let me talk about west coast oil and gas again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have a new provincial government this week.  The 
election is on Wednesday and I think even the governing party has 
conceded of which is unheard.  So we will have some new 
directions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia worked long and hard and fought the federal 
government over who owned the seabed between Vancouver Island and 
the mainland coast.  It went to the supreme court.  This was a 
very long, detailed, expensive debate and proceeding.  Guess 
what?  The province won, it owns the seabed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in the legislation that excludes the ability of 
the Government of Canada to pre-empt that provincial jurisdiction 
by creating a marine conservation area in that area.  That is a 
very clear conflict of jurisdiction and one that should be 
automatically clarified in the bill but it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the other parts of the coast where the province does not 
own the seabed are still problematic in terms of a federal power 
grab and a federal administration that is largely out of touch, 
particularly with remote coastal concerns on the British Columbia 
coast.  I can speak to that with great authority, so can 
virtually all of the municipal level politicians and many of the 
provincial politicians from that part of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have a major debate and a major initiative on things 
like what we will do on west coast oil and gas development.  We 
do not need this piece of legislation hanging around in the 
current format to muddy that whole debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the heritage department has an agenda, but it will not 
fess up and tell us what it is.  I have already said why it will 
not.  One reason is because it does not want to stir up people 
who would be very upset with the specifics of what it is 
contemplating.  Therefore, it wants to keep it general and broad, 
then it will only have to deal with the large, urban based groups 
that will look at the legislation more as a framework or a legal 
document rather than as something specific that is affecting a 
bunch of stakeholders.  Somebody called it the mushroom syndrome, 
and that is right.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill requires provincial governments to obey it.  The bill 
impinges on provincial jurisdiction in many ways.  It will 
prevent honest fishermen, hardworking oil and gas exploration 
workers, local anglers, recreational boaters and others from 
being able either to earn a livelihood or enjoy themselves, at 
the possible expense of achieving almost nothing.  If this were 
truly going to do something for the environment we would be more 
than happy to support it.  The reality is quite different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did attend some of the heritage committee meetings.  I was 
party to helping bring some witnesses to that committee.  I was 
embarrassed at the treatment they received from some of the 
government members.  The chief of the Campbell River Band was at 
the committee.  The North Coast Oil and Gas Task Force was there. 
West coast fishermen were there.  Rather than hearing the 
committee accept their legitimate face value concerns, what did 
we hear?  We heard a lecture from the chairman of the committee. 
Quite frankly, I was amazed at the treatment meted out to people 
who had travelled so far.  I expressed my great concern at that 
time.  Now, much later, I am still out of sorts about what 
happened on that particular day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a sloppy piece of legislation.  As I said, we would have 
three federal departments that could protect marine areas, two 
being Environment Canada and the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans, and this bill would put Heritage Canada into that picture 
as well.  Any time we have more than one party responsible for 
managing something, we get diffused management and diffused 
objectives and things tend to fall apart.  I learned that during 
my long working career.  I think most Canadians would understand 
that precisely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also we have provincial governments that have legislation. 
Believe it or not, we have had provincial governments far-sighted 
enough to create marine conservation legislation.  I ask members 
to guess what they have done under that legislation.  They have 
actually created marine protection areas.  We have quite a few in 
British Columbia that have been set up under the provincial 
government.  Is that not marvellous, Mr. Speaker? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation does not appear to deal with all of that.  Yes, 
the government has had a very complicit government in British 
Columbia to deal with in the last 10 years.  Hopefully we will 
have a new government in British Columbia that will set some new 
directions and new initiatives in terms of dealing with the 
federal government on a much more equivalent basis rather than in 
terms of the mushroom syndrome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very concerned that we will be pre-empted from an 
opportunity to fully develop industry in British Columbia and in 
other jurisdictions by legislation that blindly creates parks 
without taking a lot of stakeholder interests into account.  It 
is clear from the way this bill has been developed that those 
things have not been taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recommend that the municipal level of government be put into 
this legislation in a meaningful way so that it can have a 
decision making role in whatever these specific areas are that 
municipalities are interested in.  There has been no movement in 
that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, this is a bad bill and we should kill it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thought that was a most enlightening dissertation and 
exposition of legislation now before the House.  I wish to thank 
my hon. colleague for being so specific and thoughtful in his 
analysis and for the thoroughness with which he approached the 
problem with and the difficulties in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was one part of the legislation he hinted at that I think 
we should explore further.  It seems to me that the legislation 
seems to be taking out of parliament the very essence of what 
parliament was created to do for the people of Canada.  The 
difficulty centres around the possibility of an agency other than 
even a government agency actually creating a marine conservation 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that this is particularly dangerous.  It is bad enough if 
parliament gives this kind of power to an individual minister or 
to the cabinet.  However, when the clauses contained in this 
legislation actually make it possible for a special interest 
group to force and to cause to be created a conservation area 
which then does not allow certain kinds of development to take 
place, then not only have we really usurped what the people of 
Canada elected us to do here but we have insulted every single, 
solitary person in the House, including members on the government 
side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member whether he could explain a little 
more clearly whether that in fact could happen under this 
legislation.  If that one provision is there, the bill should be 
scrapped, if for no other reason than that one, because it denies 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes indeed, the legislation 
would pre-empt parliament, and yes indeed, cabinet would be able 
to create these marine conservation areas in a vacuum.  I am very 
concerned about that.  That is reason enough to topple the bill 
as far as I am concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in an age that is cluttered with information and new 
information.  That applies to every trade association, every 
stakeholder group, provincial, federal and municipal levels of 
government and the citizen at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that this or any parliament does is to open a 
window and allow people to catch up to the debate.  It allows 
time for people who have an interest in the specifics to mobilize 
and to offer their input, pro, con and constructive.  Those are 
the essentials of why we need to make that change, not only to 
this legislation but to any legislation.  More and more of the 
legislation in this place is an enabling framework to allow 
either the bureaucracy to enact regulations or the cabinet to 
make decisions that basically are announced the next day by a 
press release or a press conference.  The spin is managed and it 
is a done deal.  That is not, in the long run, what is good for 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Is this a Henry VIII clause? 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
enjoyed listening to the remarks of the member for Vancouver 
Island North.  In fact the member and a group from the fisheries 
committee were just in Nova Scotia.  As he mentioned in his 
speech certainly there were some concerns raised by fishermen 
about the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board and 
decisions it might make that would impact their industry.  There 
also were some concerns raised on marine conservation areas that 
might or might not be proposed in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member would expand a little further on the 
concerns that fishermen expressed to us and others relative to 
those two points, especially as they relate to marine 
conservation areas.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question 
and the comments.  We had some very good submissions to the 
committee dealing with the issues but people were asking 
questions for which they should have been able to get clear 
answers.  One of the things I found most interesting is that we 
did not get a clear answer on whether people are allowed to fish 
in a marine conservation area.  That was one of the questions 
asked.  The official answer was yes, but of course that is not 
really the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members listened to my speech and my analysis they will know 
that people can fish if they make application and it is approved, 
under this legislation, by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
and the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  That is a far different 
answer.  The way it works now in most marine jurisdictions is 
that fishing is open unless it has been closed by the Department 
of Fisheries and Oceans.  Who is managing the fisheries?  It is 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.  The minister of heritage 
is not managing the fishery nor should she be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were also asked, and we in turn asked, who the lead agency is 
when there are multiple jurisdictions looking after marine 
conservation areas.  There was not a clear answer on that 
question either.  There obviously should be.  There has to be. 
There must be.  It might not always be the same agency or 
department.  If we end up with three we may have to zone our 
marine conservation areas as to who is responsible for which ones 
in terms of being the lead.  This is very frustrating to marine 
conservation proponents as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though we had the expertise in the room that we thought was 
appropriate under the circumstances, we did not get clarification 
on the important questions related to the legislation.  There 
should be a whole lot more people getting a whole lot more 
concerned about the legislation.  Part of the problem is that it 
has been around so long that nobody takes it seriously any more. 
One day it is going to be dropped on them and then they will be 
concerned.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise to speak to Bill C-10, which replaces the now defunct 
Bills C-48 and C-8 dealing with the creation of marine areas, 
more specifically 28 marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is not against protecting the environment, 
but it is against Bill C-10 for several reasons I will list now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we are opposed to the bill because the federal government 
is grabbing the power to create marine conservation areas without 
any regard for provincial jurisdictions. Why is the federal 
government not consulting the provinces on this, more 
specifically Quebec, as it did for example with regard to the 
Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park? Why in the case of Bill C-10 
on the establishment of marine conservation areas is it not 
consulting Quebec and working together with it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another example, phase 3 of the St. Lawrence action 
plan. There were consultations. Why is it that when it comes to 
Bill C-10 there was no consultation, which would be desirable and 
would benefit the population? Although it is being said that the 
federal government wants to establish marine conservation areas 
for the benefit of the people and their social life and to help 
the economy, it is ignoring the government of Quebec and 
provincial jurisdictions in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois opposes any attempt to duplicate and 
trivialize Quebec's jurisdictions over the environment, fisheries 
and oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, this goes to show the bad faith of the federal 
government. When Canadian Heritage is involved, not too much 
attention is paid to Quebec's jurisdictions and to shared 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Canadian Heritage has just announced an 
investment of $500 million in culture. It is typical again of 
this department: no consideration for provincial jurisdictions 
and no consultation. It just goes ahead without examining the 
action plan, if only on culture, with Quebec. Here again, in the 
marine conservation areas issue, the federal government's way of

</I></B></P><P align=left>Several witnesses appeared before the committee and said that 
there would be duplication and that there would be a new structure. 
The government wants to duplicate even within its own 
bureaucracy. We are wondering how consistently this bill will be 
applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Department of the 
Environment are both involved in the protection of the 
environment. When I talk about duplication inside the federal 
government, I am referring to these two departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we accept such a bill when several witness have told us 
there will be inconsistencies in the way it will be applied and 
in the management of marine conservation areas? 
A number of witnesses told us that this made no sense.  Among 
those appearing before the Standing Committee on Canadian 
Heritage was the vice-president of the Fisheries Council of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Fisheries Council of Canada is a trade association 
representing provincial fisheries associations in Atlantic 
Canada and Ontario.  He told us: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there's a need for legislation to establish marine 
conservation areas, it is our view that such legislation should 
be incorporated into the recently passed Oceans Act under the 
responsibility of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and 
administered by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. It is 
simply inefficient— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are his words, not mine. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—cumbersome public administration to bring forward this MCA 
initiative in its own act under the responsibility of a separate 
minister and a separate department. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can therefore see that there is duplication, inconsistency 
and inefficiency to come, if Bill C-10 sees the light of day.  He 
goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fishing industry, for example, is working with the Fisheries 
and Oceans minister and Fisheries officials regarding development 
of an oceans strategy for Canada and an approach to the 
introduction of marine-protected areas. These tasks are the 
result of the establishment of the Oceans Act in 1996, an act 
that states that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans shall lead 
and facilitate the development and implementation of a national 
strategy for the management of estuarine, coastal and marine 
ecosystems. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bringing forward this MCA initiative at this time under the 
responsibility of the Minister of Canadian Heritage, to be 
administered by officials of Canadian Heritage, undermines the 
oceans leadership role assigned to the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans under the Oceans Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the challenge for Canadian industry in the milieu of 
globalization is to be streamlined and efficient, we should be 
able to demand government structures that are also focused and 
streamlined. Regardless of the merits of MCAs, of this 
initiative, the manner in which it is brought forward will lead 
to confusion, duplication and conflicts in its implementation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This witness testified at the committee hearings on the defunct 
Bill C-8, and the government has not really made any changes in 
Bill C-10.  This is nearly exactly what was found in C-8.  The witness 
called for the withdrawal of the bill and added: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill should be withdrawn. Discussions should be initiated 
with officials of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans with a 
view to bringing forward an amendment to the Oceans Act to 
specifically provide for the establishment of marine conservation 
areas, where warranted, as part of Canada's oceans strategy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another quote comes from Marc Kielley, the executive director in 
Newfoundland of the Canadian Aquaculture Industry Alliance, in 
February 1999.  This is an association representing the 
interests of regional and sectoral aquaculture associations and 
their members, who raise fish and shellfish.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall, while we respect the need for conservation, we object 
to the bill for a number of fundamental reasons. At issue: The 
coming into force of an act to create the national marine 
conservation areas will result in unnecessary and expensive 
duplication of existing legislation, specifically the Oceans Act, 
1996, as well as the National Parks Act as amended in 1988.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, a witness representing the aquaculture industry felt that 
Bill C-8 should have been withdrawn. Therefore, if Bill C-8 
should have been withdrawn, so should Bill C-10, because it is 
basically headed in the same direction, except for a few changes. 
The French version of the preamble of C-8 provided that marine 
areas had to be “représentatives et protégées”, whereas in the 
new bill, they must be “protégées et représentatives”. This is a 
very cosmetic amendment that does not deal with the core issue, 
namely duplication, overlapping and the ineffectiveness of this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a number of departments, including two in particular, it 
would be hard to be consistent in implementing the law. The 
organization also stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So with regard to the implementation of the integrated 
management plans, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans shall 
develop and implement policies and programs with regard to 
matters assigned by law to the Minister, and shall coordinate 
with other ministers, boards, and agencies of the Government of 
Canada the implementation of policies and programs of the 
government with regard to all activities or measures in or 
affecting coastal waters or marine waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on the foregoing, it is abundantly clear that Bill...is 
redundant legislation and, if passed, would only serve to confuse 
and complicate issues relating to the protection and conservation 
of marine resources and marine ecosystems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To empower the Minister of Canadian Heritage for the MCA 
initiative effectively undermines the authority and mandate of 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans as provided for under the 
provisions of the Oceans Act. This should not be permitted to 
occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the difference between a marine protected area and a 
marine conservation area? How do these two seemingly similar 
elements fit into the overall tapestry of integrated coastal zone 
management? What about marine wildlife areas? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, there are several issues here. It is somewhat in that spirit 
that we can emphasize the inconsistency of such a bill and its 
ineffectiveness. A number of people may have difficulties making 
a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister tells us that this is for the good of people, 
for the good of the community, from an economic, cultural and 
social point of view, we wonder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When credible people, people with a certain amount of expertise 
on the issue, come and testify, we as parliamentarians are there 
to analyze the experience behind and the relevance of their 
recommendations.  We always listen in good faith.  However it is 
always disappointing when we see the government dig in its heels 
with a bill.  The government has gone back to the drawing board 
three times and each time it has come back with a bill that is 
no different.  It has ignored what the witnesses had to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to cite what Tom Lee, the Director General of Parks 
Canada, told the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage.  He 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The marine conservation areas fall under a partnership with 
other federal departments, basically, under the general direction 
of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. Under the Oceans Act, 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans takes leadership in putting 
in place the protective and management measures for Canada's 
oceans. That involves a number of federal departments, and the 
two other major ones are noted here, Environment and Canadian 
Heritage. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, there are doubts about Heritage Canada's 
effectiveness in managing marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have here more testimony, this time by Marlon Quinton, a 
project co-ordinator who appeared before the committee.  He said, 
and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brief is submitted to the House of Commons standing 
committee on behalf of the Bonavista Bay and Notre Dame Bay 
National Marine Conservation Area Advisory Committee Cooperation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a committee, we have held a series of stakeholder meetings to 
exchange information and obtain feedback on the suitability of 
the proposed marine park, to date.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stakeholder workshops have been held on commercial fisheries, 
aquaculture, tourism, and mistrust of government and how to build 
trust.  In our deliberations we have taken a careful look at what 
impact this initiative would have on the Newfoundland people who 
earn a living on the water and at whether Bill C-48 and the 
proposed NMCA could negatively affect traditional and existing 
livelihoods, incomes, property rights, and freedoms. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He added, for another reason: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are mystified as to why Canadian Heritage is attempting to 
run a parallel conservation initiative under a separate piece of 
legislation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were presented with about two pages full of objections in 
connection with Bill C-10, should it ever see the light of day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another. I wonder how all these recommendations came to 
be ignored, when they simply suggested that Bill C-10 be 
withdrawn and not proceeded with, as there were so many witnesses 
who were opposed to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jean-Claude Grégoire, a member of the board of directors of the 
Alliance des pêcheurs professionnels du Québec, also indicated 
the harmful nature of the bill. He spoke of the alliance 
membership, describing them as primarily inshore fishers who 
generally use fixed gear and fish along the coastline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say that, for all manner of reasons, he would: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—not be interested in seeing a marine conservation area as 
intended by the spirit of the law.  This is unlikely to be 
accepted by those industries or communities that depend on the 
sea for their livelihood. It will clearly have to be acceptable 
to stakeholders. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, we see economic concerns expressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the inefficacy Bill C-10 would have, the Bloc 
Quebecois is opposed to going ahead with and supporting, this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the matter of Quebec jurisdiction. 
Why in this bill did they ignore Quebec jurisdiction over marine 
areas?  We find it regrettable that Bill C-10 did not respect the 
integrity of the territory.  Why did we set up the Saguenay 
marine park in consultation with the community, the federal 
government and the Quebec government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park would have been a model 
to follow.  In 1997 the governments of Quebec and Canada agreed 
to pass legislation to create the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine 
park. That legislation established the Saguenay—St. Lawrence 
marine park, the first marine park to be created jointly by the 
federal and Quebec governments, without any transfer of 
territory. Both governments will continue to fulfil their 
respective responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also the St. Lawrence action plan, another example 
the government could have followed. The environment ministers of Quebec and 
of Canada announced phase 3 of the St. Lawrence development plan, 
representing a total bill of $230 million.  How did they manage 
to agree in these two examples, and in the case of Bill C-10, 
which is on the table, and in the establishment of the 28 marine 
conservation areas, the government ignored Quebec's jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also knows that jurisdiction over the environment 
is shared under the Constitution Act, 1867.  The federal and 
Quebec governments share jurisdiction over the environment. Here 
again, we can see the federal government's bad faith in this 
matter. The Constitution Act provides that: “in each province, 
the legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to: 
exploration for non-renewable natural resources in the province, 
development, conservation and management of non-renewable natural 
resources and forestry resources in the province, including laws 
in relation to the rate of primary production therefrom”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see the lack of respect for provincial jurisdictions, 
which pertain to the exploration for natural resources, 
development, conservation and the management of natural 
resources, we see the government is ignoring provincial 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By refusing to use the Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park Act as 
a model and by making title to the territory an essential 
condition for the establishment of marine conservation areas, the 
federal government would be able to establish marine conservation 
areas on submerged lands to which it claims to have title and 
thus bypass Quebec's environmental jurisdictions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very disappointed with what the federal government did 
with the recommendations made by various witnesses, including 
with regard to the protection of provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is more. The witnesses came to tell us that marine 
conservation areas should not be the responsibility of Heritage 
Canada because of duplication within the federal government, with 
Fisheries and Oceans and Environment Canada both having a certain 
role to play with regard to the protection of ecosystems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>National parks come under the responsibility of Canadian 
Heritage, which is not necessarily doing its job. There are 
serious problems in some national parks. I could mention the case 
of Forillon park, where a cliff is threatening to slide and 
collapse. Nothing has been done to reinforce it, which puts the 
life of tourists and workers in danger. In the case of Mingan 
Islands park, money is needed. Several islands are threatened by 
erosion. Witnesses raised several problems in national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does Heritage Canada not fulfil its responsibility in this 
area instead of dealing with problems that are not its concern? 
If it wants to do things right, it should start by doing the 
things for which it is responsible.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Lanctôt (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
been listening to the debate since the beginning of the

issue is being used for other purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowadays, the environment is so important for our future 
generations that we should ensure that it is a primordial issue 
and a priority and that it is not used for other purposes by 
the Department of Canadian Heritage, which wants to manage things 
it has no jurisdiction over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about the environment. We are not talking about 
nationalization or even about propaganda. We do not want this 
issue to be used for unity purposes either. This is about 
management of the environment and of public lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 92(5) of the Constitution Act, 1867, is clear on this 
issue: this is a jurisdiction of Quebec and the other provinces. 
This is a jurisdiction of Quebec, and the federal government is 
trying indirectly to show that it is easy to use such an 
important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member for Québec what she will say 
to her constituents, to the Quebec people, about the infringement 
on provincial jurisdictions, through Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, since 1993, we have indeed 
witnessed considerable interference by the federal government in 
areas under provincial jurisdiction. It did not take into account 
what Quebec had to say concerning areas under its own 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 is a blatant example of the federal government not 
respecting provincial legislation, in this case Quebec's 
environmental legislation. I also think there is a certain 
consensus about this bill.

Quebec but also in the other provinces. This causes people to 
become frustrated instead of establishing a dialogue of creating 
a partnership.

good faith, it must sit down with the other party or parties,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address Bill C-10, 
the marine conservation areas act.  I do so as a supporter of 
parks and marine conservation.  Yet I have serious doubts about 
the bill, as do many people involved in the marine industry in 
British Columbia including environmentalists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a recent conversation with one environmentalist from British 
Columbia it was pointed out to me that the best approach to 
protecting our marine environment was good fisheries management. 
Marine protected areas create little zoos and make us feel good, 
but good fisheries management is the best way to go.  Marine 
protected areas are no substitute for good fisheries management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been discussions in other jurisdictions in the world 
on these marine protected areas.  I would like to read a short 
newspaper article from the February 1999 issue of <I>Fishermen's 
News</I> published in Seattle, entitled “Marine Reserves: Friend 
or Foe”.  It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effectiveness of existing MPAs in the US should be assessed. 
A whole lot of MPAs already exist, particularly in California, 
but nobody knows whether they are having any impact.  A thorough 
and science based review needs to take place of all existing 
marine protected areas and the myriad of already existing 
`no-fishing zones' along the California coast and elsewhere to 
determine their effectiveness for either: (a) providing baseline 
research information; (b) protecting critical marine habitats, 
or, (c) protecting specific marine fish or ecosystems.  This 
review should be undertaken by a panel, including marine 
scientists, appropriate fishery agency representatives, 
knowledgeable commercial and sport fishermen, and knowledgeable 
marine conservation representatives.  This review should include 
a report with recommendations for each existing MPA and 
no-fishing zone as to their effectiveness, whether there should 
be any changes in regulations or boundaries, and whether each 
should be maintained, reduced, expanded or eliminated. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a good recommendation, which our government would have 
done well to follow before it proceeded with the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the object of the bill?  Is it marine conservation or 
merely the creation of marine parks?  I am concerned that it is 
the latter, that it has little to do with conservation and much 
to do with the creation of marine parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that the bill is only a further signal that the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans has given up on marine 
conservation and protection.  Canada does not need a few marine 
zoos with the rest of her marine ecosystem laid waste by a 
failure to manage the marine resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has fundamentally sound legislation to protect the marine 
environment, namely the Fisheries Act.  The government has failed 
to enforce either the letter or spirit of this environmentally 
powerful act.  It is considered one of the best pieces of 
environmental legislation in the world.  Section 35 of the 
Fisheries Act prohibits any activity that results in the harmful 
alteration, disruption or destruction of fish habitat. 
In section 36 it specifically prohibits the deposit of a 
deleterious substance of any kind in water frequented by fish or 
in any place under any conditions where the deleterious substance 
or any other deleterious substance that results from the deposit 
of the deleterious substance may enter any water frequented by 
fish.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At this very moment the minister of fisheries is working to dumb 
down these sections of the Fisheries Act that were designed to 
protect the marine environment.  The minister of fisheries wants 
to make the marine fisheries act aquaculture friendly, forgetting 
that it was designed to protect fish rather than to promote an 
industrial activity that if not carefully regulated could destroy 
the fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week in Halifax the minister's Commissioner for Aquaculture 
Development, Yves Bastien, said that the Fisheries Act and its 
regulations “were not drafted with aquaculture in mind and this 
causes significant problems both for the industry and the 
regulators”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Fisheries Act is not now nor was it ever intended to be an 
aquaculture promotion act.  It causes problems for aquaculture 
because the government refuses to implement siting regulations 
that would prohibit locating farms in areas that would threaten 
productive lobster and other shellfish beds, prohibit locating 
farms near the mouths of fish bearing streams or in the migration 
route of migratory species such as salmon  or would prohibit the 
use of lights at night that attract and disrupt migratory 
species.  Without clear ground rules that are consistent with the 
Fisheries Act, the aquaculture industry will not be sustainable 
either in British Columbia or in the maritime provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has called aquaculture the industry of the 
future.  Until the fin fish aquaculture industry has clear and 
effective rules prohibiting the deposit of deleterious substances 
in waters frequented by fish and can abide by them, it is merely 
another polluting and environmentally destructive industry, an 
industry without a past or a future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want seafood that is safe to eat and clean drinkable 
water.  The two go hand in hand.  Seafood grown without chemicals 
are a food of the future and part of any industry of the future. 
The commercial fishery is an industry of the future with a past 
that reaches back to the earliest days of exploration and 
settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aquaculture will also be an industry of the future when the 
government puts in place regulations consistent with the spirit 
and intent of the Fisheries Act.  We have not arrived there yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only a few months ago the auditor general tabled in parliament a 
report entitled “The Effects of Salmon Farming in British 
Columbia on the Management of Wild Salmon Stocks”.  The auditor 
general advised parliament that the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans and his department were not meeting their legislative 
obligations under the Fisheries Act to protect wild Pacific 
salmon and habitat from the effects of salmon farming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Fisheries and Oceans, the auditor general 
found, was not ensuring that salmon farms were monitored for the 
effects on fish and fish habitat with a view to enforcing the 
Fisheries Act.  “The department”, he said, “is not currently 
monitoring effects on marine habitat or on juvenile or adult 
Pacific salmon in the vicinity of net cages”.  According to the 
auditor general, fisheries and oceans scientists drafted siting 
criteria in 1985 but never enacted them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of Canada's water is neither fit for the survival of fish 
nor for human consumption.  The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
has failed to enforce the Fisheries Act prohibition against 
dumping.  Too often municipalities, industry and forest cutting 
operations have been allowed to undertake activities that have 
led to the destruction of the marine environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Fisheries Act is not designed to protect our drinking water 
but if enforced it makes the job of providing safe drinking water 
to Canadians much easier.  If the Government of Canada were 
serious about protecting the marine environment, its first 
priority would be conservation and protection of our marine 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Setting aside a few marine parks may be well intentioned but it 
is not in itself a serious conservation measure.  We already have 
under the Oceans Act the authority to establish marine protected 
areas.  When such marine protected areas are established the 
first question that must be identified is:  What are we trying to 
protect?  Then, what measures must be undertaken to protect it?

marine conservation areas act is about setting aside large 
so-called representative areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that these areas will become like land based 
national parks, no go areas for fishermen, men and women whose 
livelihood depends on the conservation and protection of the 
marine resource.  Without fishermen on the water in these no fish 
zones there is likely to be rampant poaching, hardly an effective 
conservation measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Abalone fishing has been prohibited for the past decade, but the 
species has not returned because poaching has continued on 
unabated.  One of the most effective measures for knowing the 
state of fishing stocks is to have fishermen fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the parks minister might deny that these marine 
conservations areas will become no take zones for fishermen, Bill 
C-10 appears designed to do just that.  For example, in section 4 
we are told that marine conservation areas are established for 
the purpose of protecting and conserving representative marine 
areas for the benefit, education and enjoyment of the people of 
Canada and the world.  No mention is made of fishermen.  If the 
areas really were intended to be multi-use areas we would see 
specific mention of fishermen in such a section. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parks minister is required in section 10 to consult with the 
provinces, affected coastal communities and aboriginal 
organizations established under a land claims agreement.  No 
reference is made to those whose livelihood depends on the 
resource.  Fishermen are not at the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it were intended that fishing was to continue, fishermen 
would be listed in section 10.  The same is true for section 11 
and so on.  Section 11 requires for each marine conservation area 
that the parks minister establish a management advisory committee 
to advise the minister on the formulation, review and 
implementation of the management plan for the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fishermen have been excluded from the act and I am concerned it 
will not be long before they are excluded from marine 
conservation areas.  If I were convinced the bill would consider 
fishing and fishermen a legitimate activity and recognized 
fishermen's constitutional and common law right to fish, the bill 
would have my enthusiastic support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would support any action that would lead to rigorous 
conservation and protection of the marine resource and recognize 
the objectives of good fisheries management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to a recent series of articles on the advantage of 
marine protected areas in the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> by Larry Pynn, 
it would appear that is the case with the large marine protected 
areas around Australia's Great Barrier Reef.  We are told that 
fishermen there are an integral part of the management regime 
with 95% of the area open to fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the case with our proposed marine parks act.  We 
must have legislation that will require marine protected areas or 
conservation areas to develop reasons and scientifically 
defensible criteria for any and all areas of no-take zones in the 
marine environment which are over and above the regular 
management measures taken by DFO under the fisheries act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-10 fishermen would have no place at the table. 
There is no recognition of their dependence on the resource.  In 
addition if they are shut out of a marine conservation area there 
is no recognition of their financial loss and no recognition that 
they must be compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Parks Canada creates a land based park, there is no 
question that any private owners or crown tenure holders on the 
land are compensated, either a fee simple purchase of the land or 
buying out of the value associated with tenures such as timber or 
traffic.  Just because marine resources are considered by some to 
be a common property resource, as are trees on crown land, does 
not mean that fishermen who have licenses to harvest marine areas 
do not experience an economic loss and are not entitled to 
compensation for that loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fishermen must be compensated for any exclusion from licensed 
harvesting areas resulting from the creation of no take zones in 
marine conservation areas.

This would be unthinkable in a land-based park.  Why is it not 
being considered in the marine environment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parks Canada has identified areas for the establishment of large 
marine conservation areas in the Queen Charlottes and the central 
and south coasts of British Columbia, all areas of significant 
fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me identify several failures of marine conservation 
management.  Let us consider if this bill would deal with these 
problems.  If it did it would have my support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fisheries management failure is often camouflaged as a result 
of climate change, when in fact it is merely a management 
failure. I am thinking of the near collapse of Fraser River 
sockeye stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government ministers and DFO, in particular, blamed the collapse 
of sockeye on climate change that has caused, they said, changes 
in the water temperature and the like in the north Pacific.  An 
internal DFO document reports documented evidence that there had 
been a management failure on the Fraser camouflaged as an 
environmental failure.  Let me refer to the DFO report which, as 
I said, supports my contention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report entitled “Unsanctioned, Partially Monitored First 
Nations Fisheries on the Fraser River: A Conservation Risk”. The 
report warned the department that its failure to account for 
illegal or “unsanctioned fishing represents an egregious affront 
to salmon conservation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report examined DFO's failure to account for the significant 
numbers of sockeye that were illegally caught on the Fraser River 
between Mission and Sawmill Creek.  It said that the department 
had failed in the year 2000 to account for the illegally caught 
fish due to political and budget reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report documented how over the past several years that 
unsanctioned and unquantified in river catch had essentially 
added to the en route mortality account, the estimated number of 
fish that died en route to the spawning grounds from natural 
stress and temporary contact with fishing gear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It came to the startling conclusion that this consistent failure 
to account for illegally caught fish together with the misleading 
practice of lumping them in with en-route mortalities: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—may be wrongly inflating the perceived significance of 
environmental effects on rates of migration mortality (an area 
receiving considerable attention since the 1994 Fraser River 
Public Review Board report). 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall, it is crucial to have a complete picture of catch to 
determine whether realised catch levels (by all user groups) are 
consistent with the achievement of desired spawning escapement 
goals—the fundamental measure of conservation success. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also said that the estimate of total unsanctioned catch 
between Mission and Sawmill Creek on the Fraser for the weeks 
ending June 11th through September 10th was 30,952 sockeye. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report said that Indian bands fishing in the Cheam and Yale 
First Nation areas caught 23,415 of these fish, 76% of the 
unsanctioned catch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It further said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Underestimating catch contributes to an underestimate of stock 
abundance, underestimating rates of exploitation, and difficulty 
validating and improving in-season abundance estimation that are 
crucial for implementing fishing plans and successfully achieving 
spawning escapement goals. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report observed that conservation and protection that 
Officers adopted a more passive policy towards unsanctioned 
sockeye fishing in 2000, seizing fewer nets than previous years, 
especially 1999, despite valid conservation concerns for 
co-migrating species such as coho.  It said that this was true 
especially true in the area fished around the Cheam First Nation 
band. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbians are often presented with a particularly 
confusing picture of salmon stocks, the state of salmon habitat, 
and the health of fish populations generally, according to the 
report.  Reasonable and simple questions about the state of the 
fish and fish habitat in British Columbia are often met with 
contradictory and confusing answers.  Unsanctioned fishing 
activity is unsanctioned expressly because the fishery is closed 
to ensure long run conservation of various migrating fish stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have a right to know about any substantial illegal 
fishing activity by any user group.  Unsanctioned fishing is an 
area that receives little public attention despite the 
potentially serious consequences to the status of some stocks.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>TOBACCO TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 2001 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK243">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-26, an 
act to amend the Customs Act, the Customs Tariff, the Excise Act, 
the Excise Tax Act and the Income Tax Act in respect of tobacco, 
be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to 
address the House at third reading of Bill C-26, the tobacco tax 
amendments act, 2001.  The bill would implement the tax elements 
of the comprehensive new tobacco strategy that was announced on 
April 5 by the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Health and 
the solicitor general. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new strategy is designed to improve the health of Canadians 
by reducing tobacco consumption, especially among youth, which is 
one of the government's national health strategies.  The new 
strategy represents the most comprehensive anti-tobacco program 
in Canadian history. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strategy includes increased spending on tobacco control 
programs as well as tobacco tax increases to discourage smoking. 
Under this strategy, tax increases are linked to a new tobacco 
tax structure designed to reduce the incentive to smuggle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new tobacco tax structure builds on the 1994 national action 
plan to combat smuggling, which has proven to be very effective 
in reducing the level of contraband activity and restoring the 
legitimate market for tobacco sales.  The main element of the new 
tax structure is a replacement of the current tax on exports of 
tobacco products, which was implemented under the 1994 action 
plan, with the new two tiered excise tax on exports of Canadian 
manufactured tobacco products effective April 6, 2001.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new export tax, all exports of Canadians brands of 
tobacco products would be taxed, thereby reducing the incentive 
to smuggle exported products back into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new tax would be two tiered.  A tax of $10 per carton of 
cigarettes would be imposed on exports up to a threshold of 1.5% 
of a manufacturer's annual production.  A refund of tax would be 
provided upon proof of payment of foreign taxes.  This measure 
would help avoid double taxation of these products when they 
enter legitimate foreign markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Exports of Canadian tobacco products over the threshold would be 
subject to the current excise duty on tobacco products and a new 
excise tax which in total would amount to $22 per carton of 
cigarettes.  There would be no refund on the second tier of 
export tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new export tax structure would remove any incentive to bring 
Canadian tobacco products back into Canada illegally and would 
help set the stage for future tobacco tax increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another element of the new tax structure affects people who 
travel.  The government believes that all Canadian brands of 
tobacco products should be taxed regardless of where they are 
sold.  Allowing Canadians who travel to continue to have access 
to low cost, tax free tobacco, either through duty free shops or 
the traveller's exemption, would be inconsistent with the 
government's strategy of raising tobacco taxes domestically to 
achieve the government's health objective of reducing smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the bill, Canadian tobacco products delivered to duty free 
shops and ships' stores, both at home and abroad, would be taxed 
at a rate for cigarettes of $10 per carton effective April 6, 
2001.  Furthermore, the traveller's allowance is being amended to 
ensure that returning residents can no longer bring back tax and 
duty free tobacco products.  Effective October 1, 2001, a new 
duty of $10 per carton of cigarettes would be imposed on these 
products when they are imported by returning residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure that Canadian residents are not subject to double 
taxation when they return with Canadian tobacco products on which 
tax has already paid, neither this duty nor regular excise duties 
and taxes would apply to tobacco products with a Canadian stamp, 
signifying that excise duties and taxes have already been paid. 
Non-residents would not be affected by the change to the 
traveller's exemption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures would help meet the government's goal of reducing 
tobacco use. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasing tobacco taxes is another key component of the new 
strategy to combat the use of tobacco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is increasing taxes, along with the five 
provinces that followed the federal government's lead when it 
reduced tobacco taxes in 1994.  Effective April 6, 2001, combined 
federal and provincial taxes will increase by $4 a carton for 
cigarettes sold in Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia 
and Prince Edward Island. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increases would restore federal excise tax rates to a uniform 
level of $5.35 per carton on cigarettes sold in Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick and P.E.I.  The amount would be equal to the current federal 
excise tax rate in the provinces that did not reduce tobacco 
taxes jointly with the federal government in 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would be the fifth increase in tobacco taxes since 1994 and 
would raise federal revenues from tobacco products by $200 
million annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-26 would also increase the surtax on the profits of tobacco 
manufacturers to 50% from 40% effective April 6, 2001.  This 
surtax currently raises about $70 million annually.  It would now 
raise an additional $15 million each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before closing, I want to mention briefly that the 
government is providing additional resources in the amount of $15 
million the first year and $10 million each year thereafter to 
help federal departments and agencies monitor and assess the 
effectiveness of these new tax measures in reducing smuggling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would implement fundamental changes in our tobacco tax 
system which would enable the government to use higher tobacco 
taxes to reduce smoking.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are here today to 
debate Bill C-26.  The bill has some good qualities and our party 
agrees with some aspects of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would like to suggest that the government look to the 
Senate to study a bill that addresses the real problems of 
tobacco use, particularly with children.  Bill S-15 has gone 
before committee and may soon come before this House. Although 
Bill C-26 has some good qualities, I believe the bill from the 
other place really would be more appropriate.  It targets youth 
and suggests a model for accountability of the delivery of 
government services.  I believe, despite our support for Bill 
C-26, that Bill S-15 deserves more careful scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier in the day we debated Bill C-22 and Bill C-17.  We 
talked about the complexity of the imposition of taxes and the 
tax act.  Taxes in this instance are also extremely complex with 
some 40 pages of legislation and another 50 pages of 
explanations.  My goodness, why does it always have to be so 
difficult for people to understand the government's intentions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the main difficulties in increasing taxes, particularly 
for constituents who have service stations and corner stores, and 
those who are rural merchants, are that their businesses have 
been so caught up in the economic decline of the country, 
particularly where I come from, that the loss of this income in 
tobacco sales is a real difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the bill go forward, I would suggest that there be a 
commensurate reduction of tax on other economic activities that 
are sensitive to price changes.  A reduction of taxes in other 
areas for people who are hit with these increases would be 
appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it may seem equitable to some that the big, bad tobacco 
industry take this on, taxes are not necessarily borne by those 
who have the responsibility to pay those taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think I need to lecture adults about cigarettes and all 
the associated health risks but I do want to talk about why I am 
supporting the bill even though there is much about it with which 
I disagree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the facts.  What needs to be addressed in the bill 
is the central reason for this bill coming into existence.  We 
can argue over the wording of the bill.  Some may call it a 
tobacco recovery levy and some may call it a tax.  What we cannot 
argue about is the fact that the tobacco companies target 
children.  These are the smokers of the future who the tobacco 
industry will depend on for their future income and profits.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people are the most important target for smoking 
prevention activities.  Since most smokers in Canada begin to 
smoke in their adolescence, a major challenge for smoking 
prevention is to counteract the influences of the tobacco 
companies.  Tobacco use among young Canadians must be reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the data say?  What are the numbers?  There are close 
to 6.7 million smokers in Canada.  Smoking among adolescents aged 
15 to 19 has risen from 21% to 29% over the past 10 years, and 
females make up a large percentage of this group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Smoking accounts for about 30% of cancers in Canada and 80% of 
those who suffer from lung cancer are smokers.  Cigarette related 
deaths account for 40,000 deaths in Canada every year. These 
facts speak for themselves.  We must do everything possible to 
stop children from getting involved with this killing habit.  The 
bill is one step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may argue that tobacco farmers would suffer enormous 
economic hardship.  However during the 1980s the number of 
tobacco farmers declined by about 50%.  These farmers began to 
grow other crops and have benefited from assistance programs. 
There are others in the retail end of smoking who suffer as well. 
There must be compensation for those who suffer.  There must be 
an ability for them to continue on but smoking is evil.  It is 
wrong for us to poison our young people and have them sacrifice 
their lives.  This has to be the bottom line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991 consumers spent over $10.1 billion on tobacco products. 
Of that amount about $6.6 billion went to the federal, provincial 
and territorial governments.  There is no denying that this is a 
substantial amount of money but it amounts to less than 2% of 
federal and provincial revenues.  Considering that tobacco taxes 
make up less than 2% of the federal revenue, there is even more 
incentive to reduce the number of children who want to smoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to compare the 2% of federal revenue to the health care 
costs in our public health care system.  With over 40,000 deaths 
directly related to tobacco, the strain on our overburdened 
health care system is enormous.  Those suffering from lung cancer 
as a result of years of tobacco use costs billions of dollars in 
health care costs.  By reducing the number of children smoking, 
we not only save their lives but we can help save billions of 
dollars in health care at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are very important reasons to help stop tobacco use among 
our children.  When people stop smoking completely, the country 
saves money.  In 1993 the societal costs attributed to smoking 
were estimated to be $11 billion, which is far higher than the 
income from tobacco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Cancer Society surveyed thousands of smokers and 
over 85% indicated that they wanted to quit and that they only 
smoked because they were addicted and could not get out of the 
habit.  In 1994 almost 75% of Canadian smokers reported having 
tried to quit at least once. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is needed from the government is leadership on the issue. 
The Minister of Health has taken some small steps to address the 
crisis of smoking among youth but small steps in the past have 
not been enough.  The government needs to put the health of young 
children ahead of partisan politics and show some determination. 
We all must recognize the enormous health risks of tobacco and 
the true costs of allowing this habit to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children are one of the most vulnerable groups in our society 
and that is why aspects of the bill are so important.  The bill 
would create an educational fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-26 would put a levy on tobacco and put the health of 
children ahead of everything else.  By reducing tobacco caused 
illnesses and death through prevention, we are helping society as 
a whole.

The government is the watchdog and the guardian over that which 
would harm our children.  The societal costs of smoking are 
tremendous.

chance. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is my pleasure to speak to Bill C-26, the tobacco tax 
amendments act, 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year as a member of the health committee I listened to a 
lot of testimony from various tobacco producers and sellers.  I 
also listened to many health experts and it became fairly obvious 
after several months of hearings just how damaging tobacco is to 
society and how it impacts on our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it is the heart association or the cancer association, 
all of them bring solid evidence that tobacco kills.  They tell 
us that 45,000 Canadians are killed directly by the use of 
tobacco every year.  They also show figures representing billions 
of dollars taken from our health care system as a result of this 
habit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the last member who spoke I find the most discouraging, 
disappointing and despicable part of the whole tobacco industry 
is the targeting of young people and the various ways that it 
operates around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While in Germany recently I went past a number of schools. 
Adjacent to a school, sometimes on all four corners, there would 
be cigarette machines and advertisements targeting young people. 
We do not have that in Canada because we have progressed a long 
way from that.  However that is the kind of industry we are 
dealing with, one that targets young people even in an advanced 
country like Germany. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the many years that I have travelled to developing 
countries I have seen little 10 packs of cigarettes being given 
to children outside schools.  These children are only 8 and 9 
years old.  Many reports indicate that these cigarettes contain 
many times the nicotine level contained in normal cigarettes.  In 
this fashion, tobacco companies hook them young. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tobacco industry does not want the bill to pass.  It is hard 
for me to agree with the tax increase, but in this case if the 
money is put toward stopping people from using this very 
dangerous product then this tax is reasonable and legitimate, and 
my party will support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hoped, however, that the dollars collected would not be 
like the dollars collected on the gasoline tax.  That money is 
collected but is not put into roads.  I hope this extra money 
would go to the health system and toward stopping our kids from 
smoking.  In supporting the bill I have to say that this 
provision must be included.  The dedication by the government 
must also be there.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our country's health system is deteriorating.  Many experts 
would say that we are 23rd out of the 29 OECD members, the most 
industrialized countries.  That is not something to be proud of. 
Obviously one of the problems, and there are many others, is the 
lack of funding.  Hopefully this funding would help that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also hoped that the tax increase would allow some other 
tax decreases to occur.  The thing that is probably hurting us 
the most and the reason that many of us came to the House was the 
debt of $550 billion of which $43 billion is paid out in interest 
every year.  I imagine what we could do with the $43 billion to 
help our health system, to help kids stop smoking and many other 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has to be remembered that today we are spending $15 billion 
on health.  We spend $12 billion on advanced education and $22 
billion on various other social programs.  If we had $43 billion 
we could probably stamp out the problem that the bill is 
addressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the bill is good for Canada as long as the money 
from it is used in the right way.  It is hoped that it would go a 
long way to stopping young people from wanting to smoke. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I cannot help but begin my portion of the debate on Bill 
C-26 by commenting on developments within the Canadian Alliance 
ranks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not believe we would ever see the day when members of the 
Canadian Alliance would be supporting a tax hike.  However, here 
they are today.  I guess stranger things have been happening over 
the last little while.  It is wonderful to see the transformation 
of Canadian Alliance members.  I say good for them for 
recognizing that the tax system is an important part of shaping 
good public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope they are able to use the logic they have applied to this 
debate in seeing tax increases as playing an important part in 
creating responsible social behaviour.  It is something that 
needs to be extended and looked at in a whole number of areas, 
including conservation of our natural resources, the reduction of 
poverty in our midst and the pursuit of social justice.  That is 
the bottom line in terms of the taxation system and what is 
important for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also tempted at the start of the debate, following 
developments earlier in the House today, to say hello to my mom. 
It is a wonderful opportunity to pay tribute to mothers across 
the land and to make the connection between mother's day and the 
debate we are having today on tobacco control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many times in our history mothers have led the fight to create 
safer communities to protect the health of our young people. They 
have been involved in stopping drinking and driving.  They ensure 
that pregnant women take all the necessary precautionary steps. 
They are also trying to prevent young people from getting 
addicted to the deadly product of tobacco. Women have been doing 
an incredible service for the country in the pursuit of health 
and well-being for all our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have an opportunity to talk about tobacco control and 
to acknowledge the work of the federal Liberal government in 
pursuing one part of a comprehensive strategy to reduce the use 
of tobacco in society and to prevent addiction to cigarettes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge the importance of Bill C-26.  It is a bill that 
would increase taxes on tobacco products.  It would amend a 
number of acts which would result in an increase of $4 on a 
carton of cigarettes.  That is an important development.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the New Democratic Party certainly will support 
Bill C-26 at the final stage of approval by the House.  However, 
I think it is incumbent upon us at this moment with this 
opportunity to look at what else the government could have done 
and to urge it to do more in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to hear the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Finance suggest that this is a beginning, that there 
are more tax increases on the way and that the government 
recognizes there is room to move when it comes to increasing the 
price of cigarettes and still not be worried or pressured because 
of the threat of smuggling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is fair to say that the government is actually making 
up for lost time.  It has perhaps, I hope, seen the error of its 
ways in that devastating decision in 1994 when it caved in to the 
tobacco lobby, rolled back the tax increase on cigarettes and 
actually contributed to the very serious problem of smoking among 
our young people today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has to be acknowledged what that kind of taxation policy does 
and what that kind of caving in to tobacco companies can do in 
terms of our collective pursuit of preventing the use of tobacco 
and stopping addiction to cigarettes among our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the Liberals recognize what they have done and I hope 
today's measure in the form of Bill C-26 is an acknowledgement of 
their past wrongdoings and a determination to right a wrong and 
to move forward, doing everything we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 we had an opportunity to keep the taxes high on 
cigarettes, to keep products out of the hands of young kids and 
to stop a lot of folks from getting addicted.  I think we really 
did a great disservice to this country.  Because of the threat of 
smuggling, we dropped the tax increase and actually caused more 
young people to get addicted to cigarettes.  It is fair to remind 
the House that under the Liberal government, addiction to 
cigarettes among young people has actually increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to refer to the government's own document put 
out by Health Canada, entitled “Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring 
Survey” for February to December, 1999, which points out that 
smoking by teens aged 15 to 19 years, though down significantly 
from 43% in 1981, has increased 21% since 1990 but appears to 
have reached a plateau at around 28% since 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Liberal era, smoking among young people and addiction to 
cigarettes has actually increased significantly.  That has to be 
the direct result of caving in to the tobacco industry in 1994 
around the tax increases and a result of a failure of the 
government to actually implement a fully comprehensive smoking 
cessation program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question for us today is this:  is a $4 increase on the 
price of cigarettes enough?  Could we do more?  The answer is 
clear.  Many groups have said there is all kinds of room to move. 
We know from some of the mapping done by those involved in this 
field that there is still a considerable gap between the price of 
cigarettes in Canadian provinces and the price of cigarettes in 
U.S. border states.  The statistics suggest that we could raise 
cigarettes prices quite a bit more in order to be even closer to 
the price of cigarettes in the United States, so there is no need 
to be leery about the whole issue of smuggling in that context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comments of groups that have pointed out that we have 
overreacted to the threat of smuggling are legitimate.  It is 
very important to remind ourselves that perhaps the government 
got caught up in something that did not necessarily have a basis 
in fact. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point specifically to much work done by the Canadian Cancer 
Society and the Non-Smokers' Rights Association, which over and 
over have reminded the government that it has room to move in 
terms of increasing the price of cigarettes.  In fact, they 
suggest that even if the Canadian government raised tobacco taxes 
by $10 per carton the price gap between Ontario-Quebec tobacco 
and the now much more expensive American cigarettes would only 
close by about 50%.  They said that in a letter and documentation 
put together by those two organizations in March of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The executive directors of those two organizations, Ken Kyle for 
the Canadian Cancer Society and Garfield Mahood for the 
Non-Smokers' Rights Association, stated: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—we believe the fear of smuggling in some quarters has been 
greatly exaggerated.  If the United States can maintain high 
tobacco taxes without significant smuggling, so can Canada. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put that on the record because I take in all seriousness the 
parliamentary secretary's comments about potential future 
increases and indicate to him that there certainly would be no 
opposition from us.  I believe that he would have the support of 
many Canadians if his government chose to do that on an 
expeditious basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another question around this announcement and this 
bill.  Is there enough money for and is Canada doing its part in 
tobacco prevention and cessation?  The announcement that was tied 
to the tax hikes under Bill C-26 indicated that there would be an 
additional $480 million over five years for the tobacco control 
program in Canada.  That is clearly still far below the levels 
that most groups active in this field have called for.  It is 
certainly not much of an increase when we break it down in terms 
of what the government is spending today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's own press release indicates that about $210 
million over five years would be assigned directly for prevention 
of tobacco addiction and for tobacco control programs.  That is 
about $42 million a year.  That is hardly in line with what 
Canada is obligated to spend if we are to deal with the serious 
problem in our society today.  I do not need to repeat the 
figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from the Alliance and other members today about the 6 
million smokers in Canada today, the 45,000 deaths per year, the 
fact that 250,000 young people annually become addicted to 
cigarettes, the fact that 90% of all smokers are addicted before 
the age of 18 and the fact that we spend $3.5 billion annually in 
terms of the health costs associated with smoking.  All of those 
facts should be obvious to the government and should point this 
government clearly in the direction of an increased expenditure 
for smoking prevention and cessation programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is precisely the essence and the purpose of Senator Kenny's 
bill, which has been through this House a couple of times and is 
on its way for the third time.  Bill S-15 is due to arrive in the 
House very shortly.  It follows on the heels of Bill S-20 which 
died on the order paper when the election was called.  That 
followed Bill S-13 which was killed here in this place as a 
result of the government rising on a point of order and 
suggesting that it was out of the bounds of this place to pursue 
a money bill, a tax bill, that came from the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a question for all of us today.  Given everything we 
have learned, given the work by groups on this bill, given the 
clear changes to Bill S-15 to make it compatible with the rules 
of this place, what will this government do in the next couple of 
days when the bill makes its way from the Senate to the House of 
Commons? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that under no circumstances would the government try to 
put the kibosh that bill and suggest that it is not within the 
purview of this place to proceed with a bill that would actually 
raise the price of cigarettes on a much more significant basis 
than the government has been prepared to do to date and would 
ensure that the money is targeted specifically for smoking 
prevention and cessation programs.  We are looking under that 
bill at a fund of approximately $360 million a year to be 
dedicated to smoking cessation and prevention among young people 
and others in our society.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we compare that $360 million a year to the $210 billion that 
the government promises to dispense over five years, we can see 
the huge gap in the proposals and the clear need for Senator 
Kenny's bill.  I would hope that when the bill enters this place 
we would all be united in support of the bill to ensure it is 
allowed for debate so that we can have a meaningful discussion 
about the values of a tobacco control initiative that increases 
the cost of tobacco by another $10 per carton and ensures that 
the money goes into a special fund to be administered by 
non-profit organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would bring us much more in line with other countries that 
are taking the issue seriously.  It is important, for the record 
and for the government today, to be mindful of the fact that 
under the government and the way we administer our programs 
dealing with tobacco prevention, we spend about 66 cents per 
capita on this important endeavour.  Many others have pointed out 
how that compares to other jurisdictions.  For example, $32 per 
capita is spent by the state of Ohio and $16 per capita by 
Massachusetts and so on.  All academic overviews of the issue and 
all analyses by experts on this serious problem in our society 
show that Canada should be spending more like $270 million to 
$720 million a year on dealing with a problem that is growing as 
we speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts that more young people are turning to cigarettes, that 
smoking at an early age leads to a lifelong addiction and that it 
very likely leads to ill health and even death should be enough 
to tell us to get on with the job and do something now.  The old 
expression that a penny of prevention is worth a pound of cure 
suggests that if we invest a little bit now we will save a heck 
of a lot later on if we are serious about this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, as part of a comprehensive strategy dealing with the 
high rate of tobacco and cigarette smoking in society today, we 
must have an increase in the cost of cigarettes, as the 
government is doing in part today.  We must have a clear focus on 
education and prevention, a model of which is provided by Senator 
Kenny's bill coming from the Senate this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also must do more in terms of advertising and restricting 
tobacco companies' attempts to get through to our young people. 
It was just over a month ago that we raised in the House a 
totally destructive ad by du Maurier which ran in dailies across 
the country.  It was a huge colour advertisement that basically 
suggested there was a free trip to the city of New York to be won 
if one was a smoker and over the age of 18.  The ad said “Live 
it up in the city that never sleeps.  Win one of two amazing New 
York experiences”.  It went on to set out the terms and 
conditions for applying for that prize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has done nothing.  We have appealed to the 
government to look at the Tobacco Act and to realize that this is 
contrary to the law.  We have called upon the Minister of Health 
to take action.  I wrote to the Minister of Health on March 23 
and asked him to please take action against du Maurier and do 
something about that deplorable ad.  I have yet to hear from him. 
I am hoping that this is still under advisement and that the 
Minister of Health and the government are prepared to apply the 
full force of the law in regard to this ad by du Maurier, because 
it is contrary to the law.  We have heard clearly from many 
groups about how it violates the law. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring to the Coalition québécoise pour le contrôle du 
tabac, which said, on March 27, “The tobacco industry is thumbing 
its nose at the government and its Tobacco Act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the reaction of the Coalition québécoise pour le 
contrôle du tabac to the new du Maurier ads announcing a contest 
to win a five-day trip to New York.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That organization gave the Minister of Health some very specific 
articles in the tobacco act to pursue in terms of contravention. 
Specifically that organization and others have referred to 
articles 21 and 29 of the tobacco act.  We hope the government 
will take action.  If it is serious, as it indicated today, about 
controlling access to cigarettes by raising the price then surely 
it is prepared to take on tobacco companies when they break the 
law.  Surely the government is prepared to show leadership by 
example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leadership by example would do more than anything to deal with 
this tragic epidemic in society.  I am thinking specifically of 
the government's decision to include tobacco industry 
representatives on the trade mission to China in February. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It struck us and many Canadians as odd that the government would 
show such hypocrisy.  On the one hand it pretends to be 
interested in controlling tobacco use and on the other hand it 
promotes tobacco in a country where there is already an epidemic 
of smokers.  Some 800,000 Chinese people die every year because 
of tobacco addictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is involved in global efforts to control tobacco 
and we commend it for that.  Given the fast flow of goods and 
services around the world, dealing with cigarette addiction and 
coming up with meaningful tobacco control programs must be done 
internationally.  That is precisely where we would like to see 
the government show leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We commend the government for being involved in what is clearly 
an important initiative, one that requires more time and effort 
by all of us.  However it is hard to take seriously the 
government's efforts regarding international tobacco control when 
it is neither showing such leadership domestically nor leading by 
example in terms of ensuring we practise what we preach wherever 
we go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support Bill C-26.  Increasing the price of cigarettes is an 
important and necessary step.  However it falls far short of a 
comprehensive strategy that involves education, prevention, 
advertising restrictions and ever increasing prices on tobacco so 
that it is priced out of reach of our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the House for its attention and urge the government to 
follow these suggestions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a couple of technical points to make before I start. I 
advise the Chair that I will be splitting my time with my 
colleague from Kings—Hants who has not had a cigarette since the 
holiday season. He is setting a example for the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to thank the translation service and the 
interpreters. I find it very hard to stick to my prepared speech. 
I want to thank them for their understanding and for trying to 
follow me. I will try to speak more slowly. They do an absolutely 
remarkable job and I take this opportunity to congratulate and 
thank them for their understanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being said, Bill C-26 is a tax bill, which hopefully will 
change things in the area of health. While I was looking at the 
bill I was thinking “Can a tax bill really save lives?” We 
certainly hope so, and this is the reason why we have been asking 
the government for a long time to put money back into health. The 
government should put more money into health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are willing to levy an additional tax to put warnings on 
cigarette packages alerting young people to the dangers of 
tobacco, if it works, and we hope it will, we should take this 
opportunity to invest massively in transfer payments to the 
provinces so that they can deal with others issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-26 sets this amount at $4 per 
carton of cigarettes. I am a smoker, 
the only one in the Progressive Conservative caucus, and I am 
wondering why $4, why not $3, why not $10? Honestly, I do not 
know why. The government is proceeding cautiously, step by step. 
It claims smuggling is not an issue, yet it is still moving very 
timidly, according to anti-tobacco groups both in Quebec and the 
rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary said that $4 will give us this much 
money. It would have been interesting to know what the impact of 
a tax increase is on cigarettes sales. If people buy less, 
revenues will be lower. 
What are the mathematics? What is the government's objective in 
introducing Bill C-26 as it relates to the reduction of tobacco 
use, particularly among young people? We do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, it is not ethically correct to say that $4 are added 
to the price of a carton of cigarettes. However, we do not know 
what the government's plan in the fight against tobacco is. We 
know that a bill is coming from the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are applauding Bill S-15, except that there is a problem 
with parliamentary tradition. The problem is the fact that a tax 
is asked for by the other place. The House will examine that 
bill. I am not worried about that. If Bill S-15 is not acceptable 
to this House, in accordance with parliamentary tradition, the 
government, if it is serious, will introduce a bill the very next 
day, using the same arguments and the same information and will 
identify it with a C instead of an S. If the government is 
serious about its fight against tobacco, it must arrange to apply 
the principle behind the details in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being said, $4 is one thing, but interestingly, the 
government is controlling something controllable in the fight 
against tobacco. We remember that, when there was a major 
increase in taxes, companies would sell their cigarettes to the 
United States and the cigarettes came back through somewhat 
illegal channels. We would buy Canadian tobacco, but it had made 
a short trip to the United States before coming back here. This 
bill corrects this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We knew that one of the reasons why there was a black market was 
the fact that there was no tax on cigarettes coming out of the 
production plant. It took years to deal with that issue. We were 
aware of the problem and of the legislation, but it took six or 
seven years to make it into an efficient tool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are told that there is no problem anymore. We know that 
the black market is active again, albeit to a lesser degree than 
before, because it is harder now. However as we all know, if there 
is money to be made, criminals are usually quick to get 
involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the Canada—United States agreements, we do not know what 
measure was taken so that both sides would talk to each other. 
The case of duty free shops is interesting. People used to go to 
Old Orchard or elsewhere in the United States for a day or two, 
perhaps a week, and come back with cigarettes that cost a lot 
less. That situation is being corrected. 
This only makes sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, if tobacco products are taxed in Canada because they are 
deemed to be dangerous products, there is no reason to sell them 
for less to Canadians who buy them in duty free shops. We must 
be consistent. The Minister of Finance and his American 
counterpart deserve praise for having taken the necessary steps 
to deal with this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support Bill C-26, but the fact is that according to 
statistics, over 40,000 people die every year because of tobacco. 
If two people die from another cause, the government takes 
immediate action to ban that cause. However tobacco kills 40,000 
people per year, and all it does is increase taxes and tell 
Canadians that it is a dangerous product. I find this a bit 
cynical.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a town called Asbestos.  What is being said around 
the world?  “Asbestos kills. We are banning it”.  If we apply the 
anti-tobacco logic, why not ban tobacco?  Why not say that it is 
a dangerous product and that we are simply banning it.  Why not? 
Because there is a certain degree of social acceptance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that the anti-tobacco program will be aimed not just at 
young people, but at all Canadians.  Smoking must become 
unacceptable.  I am a smoker and I must say that the bylaw 
recently passed by the new city of Ottawa, which will take effect 
August 1, promises to make life difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are talking about increasing the buffer zones, even 
outside.  There will be buffer zones, as there are in hospitals, 
for instance.  When one goes to the hospital, one may not smoke. 
There are even restricted areas at entrances.  We do not have 
this situation in the parliamentary buildings; we have our famous 
smoking urns outside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall being outside smoking a few years ago when the 
temperature was minus 35 Celsius.  Neither cold, nor snow, nor 
sleet, nor rain will stop a smoker.  We are like letter carriers, 
so we go outside to smoke, and the current Deputy Prime Minister 
went by and said: “My God”.  It smelled terrible.  Eventually 
the buffer zones will be enlarged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, it is true that there are people who die 
because of tobacco. An additional $4 per carton will not solve 
everything.  Bill S-15 will not solve everything. What is missing 
in this battle is a united front. The battle does not involve the 
federal, provincial and municipal levels.  They do not talk to 
one another.  This is nothing new on the part of the federal 
government, which acts on its own most of the time, but it ought 
to talk to its partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What other municipality would act like Ottawa?  Does it have the 
support of the provincial and federal governments?  We do not 
know.  Within the information program, will the federal 
government spend money to encourage the provinces and 
municipalities to pass bylaws, as it has with the City of Ottawa? 
If there is a constitutional problem relating to a total ban on 
smoking, will the federal government be prepared to listen to the 
arguments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are logical measures being put forward and we applaud 
them, but taxation measures are not what is going to solve health 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close with the remark that, if it is a good thing to 
address youth smoking by adding more tax and to use those funds 
for awareness and education campaigns, it is surely also a good 
thing to reinvest in the entire health system the necessary funds 
to provide choices to people, not just Quebecers but all 
Canadians, so that they can live healthier lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We applaud Bill C-26 and await Bill S-15, these financial 
legislative measure introduced in this parliament, which make 
sense for the health of those we represent.  The Conservative 
Party will be supporting them.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and may I 
wish you good health.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member asked what the 
government's objective was behind the increase in the tax on 
cigarettes and how it would reduce the incidence of smoking. That 
is a very good question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the last time we raised the tax we saw a lot of 
smuggling.  Many Canadians got cigarettes through the back door 
so it was hard to correlate the increase in tax with the 
decreased incidence of smoking.  However the government is quite 
confident that the new measures, along with the reduction of 
economic incentives to smuggle cigarettes across the border, 
should reduce or eliminate the incidence of contraband. 
Therefore, we will have a much better measure moving forward. 
However there is some good generic data that supports the notion 
that increasing the taxes reduces the consumption, other things 
being equal.  If people can get the cigarettes through the back 
door that will not happen.  I just wanted to make that comment. I 
thank the member for his contribution.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is it exactly.  I thank 
the parliamentary secretary for his remarks.  Indeed, in Canada, 
when there has been a marked, rapid and brutal increase in the 
taxes on tobacco products, the black market has moved in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, the data are available and studies, which are, more 
or less conclusive, have been done.  In the U.S., for example, 
increased taxes on cigarettes had limited effect on the number of 
smokers per age group.  When one state is located in the central 
part of the States, and its partners from the other states have 
similar measures, data are available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-26, the most interesting measures, as I was saying 
earlier, concern a tax on tobacco products at the factory gate. 
This is about what we have.  The old federal taxes we had prior 
to the arrival of the infamous, questionable and questioned GST, 
like the old federal manufacturing tax, resolved part of the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be interesting to see the effectiveness and the impact 
of a tax on health.  There is a study that has nothing to do with 
health.  At one point a curve was developed, which was used 
frequently by Mr. Reagan in the States: the higher the taxes, the 
higher the revenues.  At a certain point, however, revenues drop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be interesting to see what tax on cigarettes will be the 
optimum in discouraging smoking among the young.  I hope that the 
Department of Health will monitor this closely.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise today to speak on Bill C-26.  I thank 
my colleague, the member for Richmond—Arthabaska, for his 
comments and personal reflections on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to realize that smoking is on the rise in 
Canada, particularly among young people.  That is the most 
troubling part of this whole trend relative to smoking.  In 1990 
in the age group between 15 and 19, 21% of that age group was 
smoking.  That rose to 28% by 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at our strategy to combat smoking.  We have seen the 
banning of sponsorship of auto races and cultural events across 
the country.  It is questionable whether or not that ban has 
helped reduce smoking.  What it has done is reduce funding for 
cultural events across Canada.  I question the government's 
strategy on whether or not banning sponsorships of cultural 
activities has made a big difference in reducing smoking.  That 
has been part of the government's strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another one strategy has been these garish, egregious packages 
which have pictures of gangrenous feet and cancerous lungs.  Now 
we have teenagers trading them like playing cards, with one 
teenager saying to another “I'll give you a gangrenous foot for 
a cancerous lung”.  That sort of thing is going on, so I 
sometimes question whether or not that initiative is achieving 
its mark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One jurisdiction that has made a difference in reducing the 
incidences of smoking with young people is California.  We should 
take a serious look at how their best practices achieved that 
reduction in smoking.  Certainly its advertising and promotion 
was very sophisticated.  There was not a banning of sponsorship 
of events by the cigarette companies.  Those have continued. 
The warnings on the cigarette packages are discreet but we have 
seen in recent years a 43% decline in smoking in California.  The 
big difference is the funding of educational programs.

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada the government's latest initiative will result in what 
I think works out to about $2.33 per Canadian per year.  In 
California the amount of funding devoted to smoking cessation or 
anti-smoking initiatives, from a marketing and educational 
perspective, is closer to $5 per person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>California focused on community groups, schools, the education 
system and on trying to avoid the behaviour from being developed 
in the first place.  We really should take a hard look at 
California and other jurisdictions that have been successful in 
this light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has the best of intentions with a lot of these 
initiatives.  That is not to be questioned.  What is more 
important than just having the best of intentions is having great 
results.  We should take a serious look at a more significant 
investment on the education side and working with the provinces 
to ensure that we are doing everything we can to prevent young 
people from smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, I personally question the banning of the sponsorship 
of sports and cultural activities.  I do not think that has had 
an impact.  I stand to be corrected.  I also question the garish 
packages with the pictures on them.  I think that has perversely 
in its own way, through some type of reverse psychology, created 
an attraction to young people who, for some reason that is beyond 
me, are drawn to these sickening packages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether or not the price will affect people's decisions, I can 
only speak in an anecdotal way from constituents who have told me 
that increases in cigarettes prices make a difference.  They make 
a difference in their lives in terms of the affordability.  It is 
intuitive to expect that raising prices will have an impact on 
reducing the actual incidence of smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not smoke any more.  When did I never bought them, I used 
to bum them off my colleague from Richmond—Arthabaska, so the 
price was never a factor for me.  However smoking caused a few 
friendships.  It was my efforts that slowly reduced the incidence 
of smoking in our caucus because none of the other members could 
afford to smoke and give me free ones.  There are reasons why I 
am finance critic.  Parsimony may be one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased that I have quit smoking.  I feel very good 
about that.  I am looking forward to the day when our caucus is 
completely smoke free.  We are nearing that day very quickly.  By 
that I mean I want the member for Richmond—Arthabaska to quit 
smoking, not that I want him to leave caucus.  I see the hon. 
member for Compton—Stanstead opposite and I just wanted to make 
sure that I was being absolutely perfectly clear on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, I commend the government's efforts in this regard. 
It is something of which we have to do more.  I question some of 
the directions and initiatives, but I certainly do not question 
or dispute the positive intentions of the government.  I just 
hope we are doing everything we can to fight this scourge on the 
health of Canadian citizens and to foster a healthier Canada, as 
we have now entered the 21st century.  We have to work together 
to ensure that happens.  As policy-makers and as leaders, we have 
to ensure that we do everything we can to ensure that.  With 
health costs rising, the one way we can make a difference is to 
reduce the incidence of smoking, particularly with young people.

Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, having worked with the member 
for Kings—Hants, I know he does not cheat nor does he run into 
the washroom and grab a quick smoke every now and then.  I 
congratulate him.  I am sure his colleague will see the light of 
way in due course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not blame Canadians for being confused with regard to parts 
of this issue because it is very complicated.  When taxes on 
cigarettes go up, some constituents of mine will say that people 
will start smuggling them.  This gives me an opportunity to 
highlight the difference in this two tier tax structure with a 
non-refundable tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People were smuggling cigarettes into Canada because of the 
price differential.  Cigarettes used to go into the U.S. market 
without the tax.  That created the incentive for people to 
smuggle them back into Canada, which created a very lucrative 
market for them.  Under the present regime, we have a tax which 
in the main says that once cigarettes leave the manufacturers 
plant a non-refundable tax goes on them.  If the economic 
incentive to bring cigarettes back into Canada is taken away, 
then we are going a long way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government understands that people are very creative.  That 
is why we started off with a $4.00 per carton increase. 
Hopefully smuggling will not be an issue.   However we will 
monitor that very carefully.  Some people say the key factor is 
the price of cigarettes in the United States.  However it is the 
differential and the incentive to smuggle Canadian cigarettes 
because Canadians like to smoke Canadian cigarettes.  That is why 
we have to eliminate the economic incentive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate the member on his intervention. 
Would he comment further on those aspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I hope this initiative is 
more successful because of the two tier nature of it in 
preventing the cross border activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His government has done something else which will help reduce 
the incidence of Canadians buying cigarettes from the U.S., and 
that is its very dedicated effort to reduce the value of the 
Canadian dollar.  The government has successfully reduced the 
Canadian dollar by almost 12 cents during its period in office in 
the last eight years.  That in and of itself makes a difference 
in convincing Canadians not to buy cigarettes in the U.S. because 
they cannot afford to pay in U.S. dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps in some perverse way that is part of the long term 
strategy of the government to not only lock Canadians in the 
fiscal prison, that is the low dollar, but also to prevent them 
from being exposed to nasty substances like American cigarettes, 
which are pretty bad by the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish he could comment on that because I was wondering why the 
government was paying so little attention to the precipitous 
decline in the dollar.  However I realized that the government 
was actually trying to protect the health of Canadians by 
reducing the dollar to such a point to reduce in any way, shape 
or form incentives for Canadians to buy cigarettes in the U.S.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in regard to the smuggling aspect of 
tobacco, the House should hear the seriousness of that situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last case I worked on when I was in the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police involved an agent who was paid to get inside the 
organization that was smuggling tobacco.  That agent ended up 
murdered on the side of the road after charges were laid against 
the crooks who were bringing the tobacco across the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anybody in the House or anybody watching thinks that tobacco 
smuggling is not a serious issue with serious consequences for 
this country then I have news for them.  It is organized crime. 
Has the member considered the fact that smuggling is a much 
bigger issue than just the fact that someone is making a few 
dollars from it?

are we doing about funding, particularly for the RCMP in terms of 
dealing with organized crime? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anything we do that creates greater incentives for smuggling and 
organized crime needs to be done in lockstep with better funding 
and resources for the RCMP.  It is of little use to pass laws we 
cannot enforce.  It is of little use to raise taxes if it results 
in smuggling which we cannot police effectively.  I think the 
member's point was that we need to be vigilant in ensuring the 
RCMP has the resources to do what is necessary.  It is a very 
serious issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in the House on February 20 I tried 
to get the Minister of Justice to address the injustice of having 
three and a half million citizens in an RCMP databank called FIP 
or Firearms Interest Police.  All three and a half million are, 
without their knowledge or consent, in direct contravention of 
the Privacy Act of Canada, an act for which the minister herself 
is responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sources in the RCMP and the Sûreté du Québec confirm that there 
is a 50% error rate in the FIP databank.  Sources in the Sûreté 
du Québec advise us that municipal and city police forces do not 
follow section 5 of the Firearms Act when loading personal 
information into the FIP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sûreté du Québec has advised us that it took one 
investigator eight hours to clear the name of one improperly red 
flagged individual.  Is this the culture of safety the minister 
envisioned with her billion dollar error riddled gun registration 
scheme? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister brags that potentially dangerous individuals have 
been blocked from buying guns or have had their firearms licences 
refused or revoked.  How could she brag about a so-called success 
when the same thing could have been done 20 years ago with the 
FAC program?  How could she call the FIP a success when it is 
based on information that is wrong 50% of the time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice says she is fully accountable and 
responsible.  However she looks the other way when the personal 
information of three and a half million Canadians is loaded into 
an RCMP databank that contravenes all seven privacy rights 
guaranteed in the Privacy Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 16 the Privacy Commissioner of Canada wrote me a 
three page letter outlining his concerns about the RCMP's 
Firearms Interest Police database.  Here are the key concerns Mr. 
Radwanski described in his letter.

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the FIP database contains names of individuals that 
should not have been entered and even “contains the names of 
witnesses and victims”.  Second, the police information and the 
FIP leads to investigations based on “unsubstantiated, hearsay 
and incorrect information”.  Third, the police loaded incidents 
in the FIP not relevant to section 5 of the Firearms Act. Fourth, 
the police are conducting unnecessary investigations because the 
FIP file contains information on “cases where the charges have 
been dropped and the individuals have been acquitted”.  Fifth, 
he said that there is no process in place to ensure that 
“improper or duplicate entries in the FIP files are removed or 
corrected”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point that I would like to raise, and these are not 
exhaustive, is that the way the FIP database is set up makes it 
“extraordinarily difficult for individuals to exercise their 
access and correction rights”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government told Canadians that they have nothing to worry 
about if they have done nothing wrong.  The privacy 
commissioner's letter proves that everyone has something to worry 
about, especially the three and a half million citizens in the 
RCMP's FIP file.  When police are kept busy chasing down 
incorrect and unreliable information in this police database, it 
is possible for some criminals and truly violent individuals to 
escape detection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is this:  when will the minister implement the 
privacy commissioner's recommendations and fix this mess? 
<P><A NAME="LINK272"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member opposite seems to believe that the Minister of 
Justice is ignoring the recommendations of the privacy 
commissioner.  In September 1999 the Department of Justice 
received an invitation from the privacy commissioner to do an 
informal inquiry into both what was right and what was wrong with 
the firearms program from a Privacy Act compliance point of view. 
The object of the inquiry was to fix any outstanding issues, if 
any.  The Department of Justice accepted the commissioner's 
suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The annual report from the privacy commissioner discloses that 
in January 2000 he began a review of the firearms registry to 
thoroughly assess its personal information handling practices. He 
notes in his report that the deputy minister of justice has 
welcomed the review and awaits any observations and 
recommendations that would help the Canadian Firearms Centre meet 
its requirements under the Privacy Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Firearms Centre examined that report in detail and 
had a meeting with the privacy commissioner's office in December 
2000.  In January 2001 the Canadian Firearms Centre submitted a 
report in writing expressing a number of improvements that could 
be made to the draft report.  As of early March no response to 
the firearm centre's comments and request for examples of misuse 
of information had been received from the privacy commissioner. 
These are clearly not the actions of a minister, a department or 
a program that, in the words of the hon. member, continues to 
ignore the recommendations of the privacy commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address the member's second concern, that 
information used to make public safety decisions when deciding on 
eligibility for a firearms licence exceeds the authority of the 
minister and the Firearms Act.  The House passed Bill C-68 after 
a lengthy debate.  Section 5 of the Firearms Act specifies that a 
person is not eligible to hold a firearms licence if it is 
desirable in the interest of the safety of that person or any 
other person that the applicant not possess a firearm described 
in the statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To set the framework for making this determination, the 
legislated statute makes specific references to offences under 
the criminal code, such as an offence where violence is used, 
threatened or attempted, and offences respecting criminal 
harassment.  Offences respecting drugs are specifically 
mentioned. Persons who have been treated for a mental illness are 
specifically mentioned where violence, threatened, attempted or 
used, is a concern.  Finally, a history of behaviour that 
includes violence, threatened or attempted, against any person is 
specifically mentioned.  Evidence of these factors could render 
an applicant ineligible for a firearms licence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gathering information in respect of these criteria is central to 
the public safety.  The requirement of section 5— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The motion to adjourn the House is now 
deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly the House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 7.19 p.m.)
