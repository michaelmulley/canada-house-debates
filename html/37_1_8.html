Mr. Speaker, starting tomorrow the city of Saskatoon will be 
witness to another flagrant and irresponsible waste of taxpayers' 
money by the Liberal government.  In this instance the amount is 
$20,000, small potatoes compared to last year's scandalous misuse 
of billions by the Liberal government's human resources minister, 
but wasteful spending nonetheless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring to the federal government's cash handout of 
$20,000 to the Queer City Cinema Film Festival, notorious for 
playing such films as the one about lesbian bikers who use 
children as sex slaves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers may not know which is more peculiar, the strange 
misuse of taxpayers' money in this instance or the Queer City 
Cinema Film Festival itself.  One thing they do know is that both 
are somewhat at odds with, much less appreciated, by hard working 
families who pay taxes to the federal government expecting that 
their money will not be wasted.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>   Mr. Speaker, 
our charter of rights says that everyone has fundamental 
freedoms, two being freedoms of conscience and religion.  Almost 
every bill of rights and the UN charter says the same thing. 
It is almost universal.  The abuses of those freedoms are almost 
as universal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister will be on a trade mission to China this 
month.  The abuses of people practising their religious and 
conscience freedoms are well documented: Christian, Muslim, 
Buddhist and Falun Gong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it in Canada's interest to raise these issues?  Are these 
matters not best left to internal Chinese authorities?  Is Canada 
not somewhat hypocritical about raising this issue as opposed to 
some other issues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a word, it is the rule of law.  How can Canadian businesses 
do business if the rule of law is routinely abused?  If 
fundamental rights of conscience and religion are routinely 
abused, how can a Canadian business person expect that matters of 
undertakings and contracts be recognized?  What are personal 
undertakings and WTO undertakings worth if these things occur? 
It is good for business to recognize these issues.

followed his exceptional career.

the cause of French and speak without restriction of the life of 
francophones of the region and the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the final years of his life, he felt that things were not

last week in New York, the United Nations held a special session

convention on the rights of the child, which came into force some 
10 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many citizens have been dismayed by language and practices

</I></B></P><P align=left>What a treat to read U.S. Ambassador E. Michael Southwick's 
release in which he stated that we need to be “emphasizing the 
vital role the family plays in the upbringing of children”.  This 
was good common sense, spoken clearly so no one could 
misunderstand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the U.S. position on the family.  This statement is 
accurate and significant and, in my view, is supported by the 
vast majority of Canadians.  I hope it will be reflected in

</I></B></P><P align=left>I also call on the government to increase its support for 
post-secondary education in Nova Scotia through a bilateral 
agreement recognizing the extra costs we pay for a high number of 
out of province students.  Our provincial government could use 
these funds to reduce Nova Scotia's tuition fees, currently the 
highest in Canada, and to increase the inadequate student aid 
program.

on our education and health care, on our schools and hospitals in 
Nova Scotia.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996-97, the Prime Minister made representations to the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, during the election campaign the 
Prime Minister was asked whether immigrant investor funds were 
invested in the Auberge Grand-Mère as a result of his meeting at 
24 Sussex Drive with immigrant investor Gordon Fu.  The Prime 
Minister replied, and forgive my language, “He has not invested 
a damned cent in that”.  That was his quote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have now obtained documents, which are available today, that 
show that in fact immigrant investors put $2.35 million into the 
hotel after the meeting with Mr. Fu.  Will the Prime Minister try 
to explain this serious contradiction? 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the investor fund is managed by the provincial 
authorities.  I was not aware that there was any investment 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time I received people from my riding.  We discussed 
many things.  All the members of parliament from all the 
provinces were asked to preserve that fund.  All provincial 
governments insisted that the investor program be kept in 
operation, including the government of Alberta. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  That is not the issue at all, Mr. Speaker.  The 
meeting took place at Sussex Drive.  The Prime Minister denied 
following the meeting that it had anything to do with Mr. Fu, 
that these investor funds would flow.  Yet it is very clear now 
with the information received that $2.35 million began to flow 
from the immigrant investors fund alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Prime Minister understand that Canadians have a right to 
ask whether his own involvement with the golf course, and 
therefore with the hotel, had anything to do with his very 
serious, intense involvement, and what appears to be financial 
gain? 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the taxpayers never had to pay a cent because of my 
errors, as was the case for the Leader of the Opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should also know that I receive members of parliament 
from both sides every day at 3 o'clock and visitors also come to 
see me. 
Every day of the week people from my riding or members of

or three minutes and then they leave.  This visit was of the same 
nature.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have proof right here that the Prime 
Minister is not out of the woods as regards the auberge. He 
hosted meetings that allowed Auberge Grand-Mère to get close to 
$3 million. Worse still, two of the participants in these 
meetings were people who had previously been convicted of 
criminal activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Prime Minister realize that he used his office to 
collect money that benefited a business of which he is a 
beneficiary? Does he realize that? 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
these are totally unfounded insinuations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue was discussed several times in the House. In fact, the 
hon. member is saying that he came to 24 Sussex Drive, and that 
is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The investment fund is managed by the provincial government. In 
1996, the provincial government was led by Premier Bouchard. I 
am pleased to learn now that he tried to help out businesses, 
probably as a result of representations made by members of the 
National Assembly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, one wonders if Mr. Bouchard made these decisions on his 
own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister said that not one cent of immigrant investor 
money went into the Auberge Grand-Mère.  He was out a whopping 
235 million cents.  It was $2.35 million that went into a 
business, which would increase the value of a golf course that 
was still owned by the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that not the real reason that the Prime Minister tried to 
cover it over? 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, that is another false statement.  The ethics counsellor 
replied very clearly that I had sold my share in the golf club in 
1993 before I became Prime Minister of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the entire country knows that money was still owed 
to him in 1996.  It was taken care of in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Auberge Grand-Mère received, just for instance, $50,000 from 
economic development for Quebec, $60,000 in HRD wage subsidies, 
$165,000 in TJF grants, $615,000 in Business Development Bank 
money, and now a whopping $2.35 million in immigrant investor 
funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister needs to tell the House what impact that had

Speaker, all the programs she referred to are public programs and 
are applied to all ridings.  I have nothing to add beyond what I 
have always said, which is that I had absolutely no conflict of 
interest.   I sold my 25% interest in the golf club in 1993 
before I became Prime Minister.  My assets were then given to a 
trustee to be managed.

disclosure program resulted in an agreement between his

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Access to this voluntary disclosure program requires exactly 
that: voluntary disclosure. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This seems logical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we saw in the case of CINAR was not a voluntary disclosure 
but the result of complaints and investigations into serious 
allegations of fraud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without going into the details of the affair, can the minister 
tell us what mechanism was used to reach an agreement with 
CINAR, because one such mechanism could be a discriminatory 
decision by the minister?

aware of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be understood that when there is a reference to a

confidentiality, which is fundamental and which has the support 
not just of the House, but of all Canadians.

such an agreement was reached between CINAR and the

figures submitted by CINAR. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But CINAR's financial statements have been questioned by the 
accounting firm engaged by CINAR, Ernst & Young, which has 
refused to endorse them, saying that they did not give a 
faithful and accurate representation of the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister stand by while his department concludes an 
agreement over something that does not even have the backing of 
the accounting firm engaged by the company? 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Minister of National Revenue and Secretary 
of State (Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions

say that the Minister of National Revenue would often like to be 
able to comment on certain cases.  Unfortunately, and still 
generally speaking, I am bound by the duty of confidentiality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again generally speaking, and with reference to no particular 
case, I must also say that investigations are conducted 
internally by officers of the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, 
without any interference.  They are conducted by individuals 
with solid expertise who, in my view, do an excellent job. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
let us be clear.  In the CINAR affair, the company apparently 
obtained millions of dollars fraudulently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An agreement was reached with public servants, and these same 
public servants have refused to co-operate with the RCMP.  It 
seems there will be no court case and the minister tells us that 
he cannot make any comment, that everything was done properly. 
And he asks us to trust him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want to know, however, is quite simple.  Without going 
into detail, under what provisions of the Income Tax Act was the 
agreement with CINAR entered into? 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Minister of National Revenue and Secretary 
of State (Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions

trust me as a minister.  Essentially, what I am asking it to do 
is respect the underlying principles of the Income Tax Act, in 
this specific case those set out in section 241. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to make the general comment, with no reference 
to any particular matter, that it is a regular occurrence when 
the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency is working on a case—and I 
am not in the least involved in such things—for it to also 
co-operate with provincial administrations. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
of course we have nothing but trust in the minister's answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement between CINAR and the Minister of National Revenue 
represents millions of dollars.  Can the minister tell us 
whether he gave approval to this agreement between his 
department and CINAR? 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Minister of National Revenue and Secretary 
of State (Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions 
of Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have always been told I was 
pretty clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, section 241 of the Income Tax Act says that there can be 
no disclosure.  It is very simple; we have a duty of 
confidentiality, and this goes for all files. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I would also like to point out that, when the Canada 
Customs and Revenue Agency carries out an investigation, the 
minister is not the one who intervenes to terminate it.  The 
minister does not intervene in any of the agency's 
investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all done by a department made up of experts, and they do

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the auditor general is criticizing the government for the 
partisan nature of appointments to the boards of crown 
corporations.  He points out a total lack of expertise in 
business management.  In short, the auditor general confirms 
that it is “buddies” first and foremost.  As for ability, 
it is a plus if there is some. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the Prime Minister not taken partisanship too far when he 
puts the management of $129 billion of public money at risk? 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member opposite must know more 
than he is saying today.  He must know that the appointment of 
people like Julie Payette, a well known astronaut, to the 
Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada is a 
good one, and that Phil Fontaine, who was appointed to the 
millennium committee, is a highly qualified individual. He must 
also know that Benoît Bouchard was certainly not a Liberal MP, 
but was well versed in the field of transportation.  A number of 
his friends opposite must know that for sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the government House leader should know that, for each of the 
names he has given us, we can name him at least 50 partisan 
appointments each. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the 1993 red book, a Liberal government would 
ensure that appointments reflected abilities when filling still 
vacant positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the Prime Minister explain this lack of ability in his 
appointments, he, who promised a return to healthier practices 
more in keeping with the principles of good management? 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the member opposite is accusing 
us of appointing more women to boards, it is true.  We have 
appointed 30%, three times more than in the other sectors.  It 
is true.  He would be right in saying that women represent 18% 
of board members as compared with 6% in the public sector as 
well.  If he said more native people are being appointed by this 
government than in other sectors, that too is true, and we are 
proud of it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have now obtained figures from the immigrant investor program

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian

add up in the way money goes into the Prime Minister's riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, he says that he did not own the golf course because 
he had sold it before the election.  On January 27 he phoned the 
ethics counsellor to say that the sale had fallen through and 
asked what he should do.  The ethics counsellor said that he 
still owned the shares.  He cannot have it both ways.  Money 
keeps going in and the answers do not add up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister give us some straight answers about why 
all of this money goes into his riding with his fingerprints all 
over it?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

has a need for Canadian softwood lumber. 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the rigid

also with the Prime Minister's optimism following his meeting 
with President Bush.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the minister just said it. We had a meeting. We explained to the 
U.S. president, the vice-president and the ambassador responsible 
for this issue in the United States that we have a free trade 
agreement with their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have a free trade agreement, it only makes sense that it

Mr. Speaker, Justice Ted Hughes, the B.C. conflict of interest

B.C.: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A minister must not make personal representations on behalf of a 
constituent to—a commission, board, agency, or other tribunal 
established by the government. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister obviously violated this principle in lobbying

correspondence from the Leader of the Opposition.  He has made 
crystal clear that all these matters, all the allegations being 
raised today, have been addressed.  There were no private benefit 
by the Prime Minister whatsoever and no conflict of interest.

appearing or advocating on behalf of a private party with any

did not break any rule or parliamentary convention in lobbying 
the federal agency.  Why has the Prime Minister set up the ethics

<P><A NAME="LINK85"></A></P>

Both the leader of the opposition of the day, Mr. Bouchard, and

following on the heels of the Vanier Institute report, how much

Canadians already know, that a decade of failed Liberal policies 
has resulted in Canadians working harder and longer with 
deepening poverty for millions?

</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing we want is a society of haves and have nots. That 
is why it continues to be important for us to invest in the 
national child benefit.  That is why it continues to be important 
for us to recognize in the employment insurance regime that low 
income families should receive an 80% benefit, not just the 55%

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let 
us be very clear.  It is this government that has created a 
society of haves and have nots.  If that is all the government 
can come up with then clearly it is socially bankrupt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is of even deeper concern is that in the throne speech we 
now hear reference to a national project on poverty, which is 
nothing more than a new guise for a workfare program to drive low 
income parents into low wage employment.

across the country, including New Democratic governments in the 
hon. member's province of British Columbia and those in 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba that believe, as we do, that investing 
together in the national child benefit, increasing the number of 
services available to low income families in support of their

Health intend to bring forward a bill to provide that regulatory 
framework and if so, when?

the hon. member can tell from the response that we missed him in 
more ways than one, I might say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from welcoming the hon. member back to the House, let me 
say that he has raised a matter which has to be dealt with by 
legislation.  Right now in government caucus we are discussing 
and deciding how it is best dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the approaches we have in mind is the possibility of 
preparing draft legislation which sets out the way forward and 
then putting it before the health committee where all parties can 
sit, have hearings, look into the matter and have some public 
discussion.  I will let the hon. member know as soon as possible 
what—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we await the draft legislation with 
interest, but as the minister knows our constitution assigns 
primary responsibility for health to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order for any regulatory framework dealing with a subject as 
important as this one to have the right kind of foundation, it is 
important that there not only be consultation with the provinces 
but that there be support for the framework.  Has the minister 
obtained the support of the provinces for the regulatory 
framework he proposes in that legislation? 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
not entirely.  It is important that we do that.  We are looking 
at various mechanisms, including potentially some equivalency 
clauses.  That too may be something for the committee to look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think, after we as a caucus decide on the best approach in our 
view, we will consult with the House leaders of other parties to 
see how the committee could be engaged on issues such as this 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a partisan matter.  All parties want to get this 
right.  We will find the best approach and we will communicate 
with the parties opposite at the appropriate time.

Mr. Speaker, members of all opposition parties in the House agree 
that the current system of equalization payments is unfair and 
counterproductive to provinces that are struggling to develop 
their economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the industry minister's Atlantic caucus colleagues have 
spoken out in favour of revisiting the equalization formula, as 
has he.  However the finance minister and the intergovernmental

are clearly divided on the issue.  Will the Prime Minister please 
tell us what his government's position is on the issue? 
<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the fact is that equalization is an essential foundation 
of the Canadian economy.  It is the one of a very few programs 
that was not cut when the country had its back to the wall.  At 
the present time it is at an all time high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted to hear that members of the opposition support 
the equalization program, but I must say that is a complete 
reversal of position.  They spoke out against equalization in the 
previous parliament and said that it should be cut.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 6 consideration of the motion 
for an address to Her Excellency the Governor General in reply to 
her speech at the opening of the session. 
<P><A NAME="LINK171"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Pallister (Portage—Lisgar, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker,  I will be sharing my time with the member for 
Surrey Central. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by congratulating you, Mr. Speaker.  I know you and I 
are just beginning our new roles and I am sure that we will both 
go through a wonderful learning curve very quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also offer my thanks to the constituents of my beautiful 
constituency of Portage—Lisgar.  They have bestowed the great 
honour on me, an honour that all of us who are members of this 
parliament share, of having the opportunity to speak on behalf of 
those who we love dearly, who we care very much about and who we 
share so much with.  I look forward to fulfilling, in any and 
every way I can, my role and obligations to those people who 
reside in my constituency, my province and my country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also thank my wife Esther and our daughters Quinn and Shawn. 
They have been a tremendous support and encouragement to me. 
Ultimately the sacrifices made by members of this Chamber are not 
sacrifices we alone make.  There are sacrifices that are made by 
our families as well and I especially want to thank them for 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also thank our leader for giving me the opportunity to join a 
political movement where I am made feel welcome and where the 
openness to new ideas and new approaches on many issues is very 
real.  The willingness to reach out and include other Canadians, 
not just in terms of theatrics or partisanship but in terms of 
real debate on real issues right from the grassroots level up, is 
a real and genuine thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last several years I have tried to do my best to reach 
out to and get people across this country who share the goals of 
small </I>c<I> Conservatives to join together and fight for those 
goals effectively beside one another.  The people of our country 
who share those goals to be divided plays only one role.  It is a 
role of effectively perpetuating a government of people who do 
not share those values, the government that is presided over by 
the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituency is Canada in microcosm and it is Canada in 
microcosm in many good ways.  Portage—Lisgar has attracted 
people from around the world to settle there.  It is an old 
constituency.  It was a fur trading area originally.  In fact, my 
home community of Portage la Prairie was one of the first 
settlements of Pierre La Vérendrye who was one of the first 
explorers of western Canada.  He saw the shining mountains that 
some of my colleagues and other members of the House are so 
familiar with.  It was that original sense of exploration, of 
reaching out, of going into new territory and into new lands that 
drove those people and that drives the people of my constituency 
to this very day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I can define the mindset of my constituents in an accurate 
and general way, I would say they are desperately fair-minded. 
They are people who are brutally honest and frank with one 
another.  More than any people I have ever met, they are tolerant 
and understanding of the differences which exist within that 
riding and within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Portage—Lisgar we have people who very much pride themselves 
on the diversity that exists within the riding and within the 
country.  They see it as a source of great strength and as a 
brighter future for all of us.  We are by every definition an 
inclusive people.  I feel very comfortable and feel very 
supported by this inclusive political organization of which I am 
now a part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of regional equity is something that is not addressed 
in the throne speech to any satisfaction, in any way, shape or 
form.  It is that inclusiveness that I, the people of 
Portage—Lisgar and the people on this side of the House value. 
That is missing from the throne speech.  The lack of 
responsibility of the government opposite is so evident.  There 
is a lack of a plan and a lack of any method or means to address 
the important issues of including everyone in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a centrifugal reality of the way in which the 
government has governed.  This centrifugal effect has pulled the 
people who do not reside in the centre of the country away from 
the centre of the country.  The policies enacted by the 
government have exacerbated those circumstances.  It has shown a 
disregard and a disrespect for the people outside that central 
area. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example would be in my riding.  Agriculture is such a key 
industry to us.  The government has no food plan for the nation. 
It has shown no respect for the trials and tribulations of long 
time family farmers, not just in Portage—Lisgar but across the 
country.  That disrespect is resulting in a playing field being 
perpetuated that is not level.  Foreign nations are subsidizing 
their farmers and their agricultural producers and we are, by 
default, adopting a policy of rural depopulation in this country. 
We are letting the nations of Europe and the United States 
establish policies which we cannot respond to.  That is what the 
government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By our failure to respond, we are saying to family farmers 
across the country that it is time for them to move to the 
cities.  It is time for them to leave.  That simply is not right. 
The damaging effect that has on rural societies across Canada is 
very obvious to all of us on this side of the House. 
Basically, the only effort the government made in the throne 
speech to address the problems of agriculture was a comment made 
about connecting farmyards to the Internet.  That should be 
increasingly easy as the number of farmyards across Canada 
dwindle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that when the government addresses the need for 
adaptation it looks elsewhere.  When it looks for adaptation 
within it does not find it.  The reality is that the most 
adaptable and diversified people, in terms of the challenges they 
have faced and the reality of their lives, are the farm families 
and farm producers of the nation who have been forced by 
necessity to made tremendous adaptations.  One of the principle 
adaptations they have had to make is to say goodbye to their 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to see these issues addressed in a real way.  That 
is what we are committed to doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we raised the issue of equalization.  The equalization 
formula seems to have a perverse incentive.  It seems to provide 
a disincentive for certain provinces to increase their industrial 
job component and to develop the resources that are within 
themselves because of the problems of the formula which benefit 
the federal government but punish the provinces.  We need to see 
those formulas revisited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other regions such as Atlantic Canada and the west have many 
shared goals and concerns.  They also have concerns that are 
specific to their regions.  Nonetheless, if we do not see a need 
to address the problem, as it is clear the government does not, 
it will not be addressed.  There is no plan in this throne speech 
to address these problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another longstanding issue to many of us is the issue of 
parliamentary reform.  Parliamentary reform would give a greater 
sense of involvement and representation, not just to the people 
here but far more importantly to the people we represent.  It is 
those people who we hear from on a regular basis.  They 
are telling us that they would like to see us have a more 
meaningful role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What better evidence of the truth of the disdain which Canadians 
increasingly feel for this institution than the absence of these 
same Canadians from the polling booths.  From their absence they 
have said to us that it does not really matter.  I am told that 
fewer Canadians turned out to vote in the last federal election 
than had for over a century.  More Canadians came out to vote 
when they were two horse families than when they were two car 
families.  That is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentary reform and other reforms such as electoral and 
Senate reform, and other aspects of measuring and addressing in a 
real way the need to include Canadians, to make their 
representatives more effective and with a magnified voice of 
effectiveness in the House, have not been addressed by the 
government in perpetuity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has taken an approach to many issues which 
basically is threefold.  First, ignore the problem and hope it 
goes away.  Second, belittle and blame those who advance and 
articulate the problem.  Third, if that does not work, throw 
money at it and maybe the people who articulated the 
problem can be coerced into supporting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a disrespectful approach.  It is that disrespect most of 
all that is reflected in the comments of the intergovernmental 
affairs minister, the immigration and citizenship minister of all 
people, and also in the Prime Minister himself.  Disparaging 
remarks about one region or another should not come from any of 
us.  They certainly should be apologized for by the members who 
made those disparaging comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close by quoting Donald Savoie in his book </I>Governing from 
the Centre<I> who said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I argue that the centre and, in particular, the hand of the 
prime minister, has been considerably strengthened in recent 
years, this is not to suggest that the federal government is 
better able to define new strategic direction or a coherent plan 
to which all government departments can contribute.  It is ironic 
perhaps that as the hand of the centre has been strengthened, its 
ability to manage horizontal issues has been weakened.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by saying that we need to reinforce the fact that 
the members of the House are not puppets of the Prime Minister. 
They are the tools for the people of our constituencies.  The 
reality is that we have a plan to address those issues and we 
will do so. I look forward to doing this to the best of my 
ability with the support and help of all of my colleagues in the 
House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened intently to the speech by the member, which I think is 
his first one in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member, who I believe is from Manitoba, talked about there 
being an exclusion in central Ontario.  I suppose I am part of 
that process because I am from Ontario.  He went on to talk about 
the agricultural community and how we have no understanding of 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Ontario produces more agricultural products than 
all the western provinces combined.  The reality is that it rains 
on both sides of the field.  We have agricultural problems in my 
riding.  I used to farm at one time.  Is the member telling me 
that there are no programs, that there is nothing the government 
has done to recognize the plight of farmers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our caucus has been very active in creating new moneys for 
farmers.  We continue to make the argument that it may not be 
enough, but Manitoba and Saskatchewan in particular have received 
additional funding in the last three or four years.  In fact, it 
was his former government that came here asking for money and we 
were receptive and listened to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have tons of farm programs.  I can think of programs like 
NISA, the Ontario market revenue program, CFIP and AIDA.  Yes, we 
are very concerned about the issue of family farms.  I talk to my 
farm group almost on a daily basis about their problems.  Some of 
the things that the member is talking about is because of the 
people that he is hanging around with.  They actually believe in 
western alienation.  The reality is, it is all psychological.  It 
is because of how long it takes them to get here that somehow 
they are discriminated against.  It is nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are more people in the province of Ontario who feel 
discriminated against because of agricultural policy than in all 
the west.  We have a problem here in agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member goes on to say that we need to help farmers.  The 
same party gets up day in day out and says no to subsidies. Its 
platform document in the last election specified no subsidies to 
farms.  Those members do not believe in subsidies but that is 
exactly what they are asking for today.  They cannot have it both 
ways.  What is it going to be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Pallister:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
his comments, erroneous and misguided as they may be.  He makes 
the statement that he used to farm.  I guess that implies empathy 
for agriculture generally.  He makes the statement that Ontario 
produces more commodities than other regions.  Therefore he is 
dismissive of the plight of grain farmers in certain 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This dismissive and arrogant attitude that is so evident in 
his comments shows an unwillingness to address the very vital 
issues that face real people regardless of region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member made reference to western alienation.  I referred to 
alienation by region.  In the households of people, regardless of 
region, there is a sense of alienation from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The larger issue is the very powerlessness, which that member no 
doubt feels—although he will not admit it today in the House—as 
he sits in the backbench and knows that he has no input into the 
government's policy direction.  More power and decision making 
has been centralized into the Prime Minister's office and into 
the Prime Minister's hands than in the history of any prime 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has made announcements without consulting 
members of his own cabinet.  The member opposite knows the sad 
truth of that fact.  The member behind him, from Prince Edward 
Island, a former director and president of the national farmers 
union, knows how truly powerless he is in the equation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the most powerless agriculture minister in our history, a 
minister who presides over a department that is so important to 
our country, comes out to Manitoba during a disastrous 
circumstance, meets with a group of farmers and then tells them 
in their hour of need that the best thing that ever happened to 
him was when he quit farming, and then I listen to a comment by 
another member telling me about his former farming practice, I 
wonder at the ability and willingness of those members to 
genuinely empathize with people who are trying to continue to 
farm and make a living.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to 
respond to the Speech from the Throne.  I thank the constituents 
of Surrey Central for re-electing me as their MP with triple the 
margin of the last election.  I shall try my best to represent 
them and address their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate you on your election as Speaker of the House.  I 
am sure you will receive the co-operation of the House all the 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my reply to the Speech from the Throne, I will address some 
of the issues brought forward by my colleague from 
Portage—Lisgar.  The throne speech is supposed to be the 
illustration of vision by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Traditionally members of parliament are invited to the Senate 
chamber where the speech is read.  Members of parliament are not 
allowed to sit down to listen to the speech.  Rather, they stand 
outside the Senate chamber, crammed in the hallway and scramble 
to listen to the speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of those who are seated inside have no business or role to 
play in implementing the contents of the speech.  Frankly it 
would be more appropriate for members of parliament to sit in 
front of a TV set rather than march off to the other chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read a quote from my colleague, the former leader of the 
Reform Party, who said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The TV cameras panning the audience focus not on the innovative 
entrepreneurs or scientists of the new economy, but the TV 
cameras focus on political fossils, former senators, staunch 
resistors of change and defenders of the status quo. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a great quote.  What a great observation of the dinosaur 
government that fights change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are important omissions and inconsistencies in the empty 
throne speech.  I will list some of them very quickly.  The first 
is the concrete plan that reduces taxes and pay debt.  There is a 
renewed need for the tabling of a budget as soon as possible, 
particularly in light of a substantive tax reduction in the U.S. 
and a sluggish economy, which is quite likely on the verge of 
affecting Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last election we saw the lowest voter turnout.  It 
signalled a warning to the Liberals.  Despite this, there is no 
meaningful commitment to parliamentary reform.  Western Canadians 
feel alienated like every other region in Canada.  Since their 
concerns are not being addressed, the Liberals are fanning the 
fire of alienation instead of using the firehose to put out the 
flames by addressing the needs of Canada's regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arrogance of the Prime Minister and the Liberals was evident 
even during the election when the Prime Minister made his 
infamous comments about his preference for dealing with eastern 
Canadians rather than with western Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 the Liberals have failed to address these concerns 
despite the new west being the fastest growing region in Canada 
with a lot of potential.  Here is a quick list of points worth 
listening to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have been hurting the B.C. salmon fishery, mining 
industry, softwood lumber industry and tourism industry.  For 
years the Liberals have failed to negotiate a Pacific salmon 
treaty with the United States.  They are killing jobs in British 
Columbia.  They closed CFB Chilliwack and left British Columbia 
without emergency preparedness. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT21"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT21"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1540

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals believe British Columbia is under-represented both 
in the Senate and in the House.  They will not let B.C. elect 
senators.  They do not give B.C. a fair share of government 
contracts and other resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue deals with transit levies.  The federal government 
raked in $700 million in fuel taxes from B.C. and returned only 
$35 million in the repair and maintenance of roads and highways. 
British Columbia is the only province in Canada that does not 
have four lane freeways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the Liberals who cut transfer payments which affected 
British Columbia's education and health services.  While the 
Liberals continue to ignore British Columbians, there are many 
reasons why British Columbians ignore the Liberals.  They turned 
off Pacific lighthouses.  They ripped the heart out of the 
Pacific coast guard and so on.  The list is long enough and it 
goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was pathetic watching the Liberal finance minister being 
given a tour by helicopter of my constituency of Surrey Central 
during the last federal election.  His handlers could not dare to 
have him listen to the concerns of the residents.  It was a vain 
attempt to give him a tour of the city by air.  Perhaps he saw 
more geese than people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister was actually quoted in our local media as 
admitting how naive he was to the needs of Surrey.  Following the 
helicopter ride he admitted that he was totally unaware of the 
transportation problem in Surrey.  During six years in office the 
Liberals have not listened to the needs of Surrey, but at 
election time a cabinet minister appeared from the sky, out of 
the blue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the Prime Minister spent more time in Florida 
than in the west.  Mostly he comes to B.C. to rake in money from 
fundraisers, as if westerners are not already paying enough into 
the federal coffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another important issue, the offices of members of parliament 
are overloaded with immigration case loads.  That work should be 
done by the immigration department, but the Liberals keep our 
immigration system clogged with backlogs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the federal immigration department not able to work 
efficiently and effectively?  That remains a big question.  The 
people caught in the system are suffering and are victims of the 
government's mismanagement.  Even refugee cases are taking too 
long to resolve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Visitor visas present a different kind of problem.  Politicians 
should not be allowed to interfere with the process, but the 
Liberals allowed their candidates during the election campaign to 
interfere in obtaining visitor visas for those who had been 
refused, even after repeated interventions by their members of 
parliament.  The system should be so effective that genuine 
visitors should get visitor visas without political interference 
and without hassles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already had corruption investigations initiated in our 
embassies abroad, and they produced successful results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another note, there is nothing in the throne speech 
concerning the federal taxes on fuel and our transportation 
problem.  In B.C. the federal government takes over 10 cents per 
litre in excise tax.  It charges GST on top of the excise tax and 
then puts GST on top of the PST.  There are taxes on taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only $35 million of the $700 million from the gas taxes being 
taken from B.C. is reinvested in transportation and 
infrastructure in B.C.  That is only 5%.  These kinds of 
injustices are at the root of regional concerns throughout 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to comment on the Liberal government's lack of 
concern for British Columbia's emergency preparedness. There is 
nothing about this in the Speech from the Throne, even though we 
have recently seen terrible earthquakes in India, El Salvador, 
Turkey and Taiwan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that scientists predict that British Columbia's lower 
mainland will have an earthquake.  The government refuses to 
dispatch the Vancouver search and rescue team to areas around the 
world that have been struck by earthquakes.  We should not be 
waiting to be asked.  We should be immediately sending our rescue 
team that is always ready at a moment's notice so that it can get 
experience that is needed at home.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest threat Canada faces is from organized crime.  As 
usual, there is nothing except a promise in the throne speech. 
The same is true regarding the RCMP.  There is nothing which 
gives the RCMP contingent in Surrey, for example, which is the 
largest in Canada, the tools, resources, legislation and 
personnel for it to do its job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the Liberals for having listened to my cry to do 
something about recognizing foreign academic credentials. However 
the Speech from the Throne has not mentioned anything about 
standardizing the national academic standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is increasingly out of touch with 
Canadians regarding regional differences, particularly those of 
B.C. and western Canada.  However the Canadian Alliance, the 
government in waiting, is here to continuously remind the 
government about these injustices just as I have done.  The ball 
is in its court.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore (Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Surrey Central for his excellent speech outlining the grievances 
of the province of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member comment on a newspaper item I saw just after 
the federal election campaign?  The article quoted a senior 
minister from Victoria, British Columbia, who said that the 
results of the November 27 election were not a repudiation of the 
Liberal government in B.C. and that the Liberals between 
elections actually eclipsed the Canadian Alliance and Reform 
Party but that the Alliance seemed to pass the Liberal Party at 
campaign time.  I found this astonishingly arrogant.  It speaks 
exactly to the concerns raised in the member's speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member comment on how this might impact on the 
capacity of the government to appropriately represent our 
province in the House and to address our grievances, when the 
senior minister from B.C. on the government bench has this 
mindset vis-à-vis our province? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
his excellent question and wish him good luck in the House.  This 
is also an opportunity for me to welcome all of my other 
colleagues and members from all parties who have joined us with 
enthusiasm and excitement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The alienation of different regions in Canada is a very 
important issue, particularly so because the federal Liberal 
government since 1993 has failed to apply the glue which would 
bind all the provinces and regions together to make a stronger 
Canada.  If we put all our excitement together and address fairly 
the issues and problems of different regions, the federation will 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's arrogant and ignorant attitude and its failure 
to listen to and address the problems are the root causes of the 
problems.  The Prime Minister goes more to Florida to play golf 
and do other things than to western Canada or other regions to 
address issues and listen to people.  We only see the Prime 
Minister in British Columbia when he is attending a fundraiser. 
That is ridiculous.  That is the root cause of the problem that 
is causing this fire of alienation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than fan the fire of alienation by not listening to the 
concerns of the various regions, the government should hold a 
firehose and put out the flames so it can address the issues. The 
government should address the issues and keep the glue in place 
that is binding various regions together.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am impressed with the speeches we are hearing today, 
both from new members and members who are very well experienced 
in the House.  The member from Surrey Central has been here three 
and a half years, since the Prime Minister called the election 
only three and a half years after the previous one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I would like him to comment on is the working of the 
House with respect to the representation by members of parliament 
of the wishes of their constituents.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has impressed me that whenever the member stands to speak his 
opening sentence is always that he is proud or honoured to 
represent the people of Surrey Central.  I am sure he has 
observed the way some members of parliament are not able to do 
that.  Would he comment on the effectiveness of parliament on 
that topic? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
who is a very hard working member of parliament and represents 
the beautiful constituency of Elk Island.  His dedication is 
highly appreciated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the moral responsibility of members that when we are sent 
by our constituents to this great House of honour where we have 
the honour and privilege of representing them, that first and 
foremost we understand why we are here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here to represent our constituents, not to represent 
Ottawa in our constituencies.  That is what our constituents 
expect of us.  That is why they sent us to this place.  It is 
always important that we bring forward to the House the issues 
and concerns that our constituents have so that they can be 
addressed.  Similarly I have brought forward concerns today about 
the whole region of my riding, to give a bigger picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, certain things definitely need to happen before our 
issues can be addressed.  There should be free votes in the 
House.  The House should work more in a democratic fashion.  The 
committees should work.  We highlighted all these things that 
should work in parliamentary reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my time does not allow me to elaborate on that I give the 
blanket, bigger picture that parliamentary reform is the first 
and foremost important thing that should be happening in the 
House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Minister of National Revenue and Secretary 
of State (Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions 
of Quebec), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to inform you that I will 
be splitting my time with my colleague, the newly elected member 
for Beauharnois—Salaberry, whom I salute and congratulate once 
again for his victory, which is a great source of pride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to rise today in support of the Speech from the 
Throne read on January 30. Allow me to begin with a quote to 
express the essence of the government's vision. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Way recognizes that economic and social success 
must be pursued together. In co-operation with Canadians, our 
government will keep on increasing prosperity in our society 
based upon the capacities of our citizens, communities and 
companies and on the unique place that Canada holds on the 
international scale. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quoting the Prime Minister of Canada. He was expressing by 
these words the vision that 
we want to develop here in Canada to ensure that we not only 
exist on the North American stage, but also that we radiate 
around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our vision is a balanced vision, a respectful, reasonable and 
responsible vision. 
On the one hand, there is the issue of economic development, the 
positioning of our firms not only at the national but also at the 
international level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, there is the issue of all the members of our 
society benefiting from the collective wealth we have been 
developing here in Canada these past few years. That is also a 
vision that comes within the logical flow of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will recall that, in 1993, when Canadians gave us the mandate 
to form the government, the situation was rather gloomy. We have 
since put our fiscal house back in order, launched a program 
review, and invested in some strategic sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also paid a great deal of attention to the Canadian social 
safety net that is the envy of many countries in the world. 
Today, our vision is a vision of the future, aimed at setting a 
balance among all these measures.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, when we look at the plan as it is put forward, we can see 
that the government is banking a lot on innovation, which is the 
spearhead of the Canadian economy and which can help improve the 
competitiveness of all our businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A large number of initiatives have been put in place. For 
example, Technology Partnerships Canada, a well-known Industry 
Canada program, has served all Canadian industries well . All 
things considered, it helped us not only to strengthen our 
competitive position but also to create good jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the Canada Foundation for Innovation, which is 
also supporting the government's desire to invest in innovation. 
We also have all the regional development agencies in Canada, 
including the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the 
Regions of Quebec, which I am responsible for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Industry Canada policy, these agencies operate in all the 
regions of Quebec, as is the case of the Economic Development 
Agency of Canada, and they try to support regional development 
according to the priorities, needs and policies of the regions. 
They also strive to assist in the acquisition and use of new 
technologies to help the regions cope with a new factor: 
innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important phenomenon is globalization. As a society, we must 
be able to use the various tools available to us. 
The first of these tools that comes to mind is the Internet, 
which eliminates borders between countries and opens up many 
opportunities socially, and with respect to economic 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again, Canada has made tremendous efforts to become the 
most connected country in the world by the year 2000. The throne 
speech expresses the Canadian government's determination to be 
better connected with all communities in Canada by 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All departments will be increasing their services and presence 
on the Internet. Certainly, the Canada Customs and Revenue 
Agency, which is under my responsibility, is one of the key 
players in the use of and access to services on the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us think about the pilot project that was launched by the 
agency last year and asking some Canadian taxpayers to file 
their income tax returns through the Internet. This year, the 
pilot project is open to the majority of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, I would mention “Government of Canada's Connecting 
Canadians”, which is providing its services on the Internet. One 
of the sites that is widely used in Canada and even in the rest 
of the world is without any doubt Industry Canada's Strategis 
site, which is probably the finest and largest bank of 
commercial data in Canada, indeed in North America. This site, 
which gets an incredible number of hits each week, has been very 
successful. Its primary objective was to provide better service 
and information to people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With our objective of being the most connected government by 
2004, the philosophy underlying our efforts is to better serve 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Speech of the Throne, we also find the issue of Canada's 
positioning in the world. How do we deal and interact with our 
trading partners, and how can we help our businesses to evolve 
in the era of globalization? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the major aspects of globalization is certainly 
everything that relates to customs. This is part of the Canada 
Customs and Revenue Agency and is being modernized, if I can put 
it that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, last April, I tabled a Canadian customs 
modernization plan for the next five years, so that customs 
could continue to properly serve people and fulfil its dual 
mandate, which is to ensure the safety of our communities and to 
make economic relationships easier, particularly between Canada 
and the United States.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, a certain number of initiatives have been put 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end by talking about research and development. If we want 
to be able to compete with other countries, we have to be able to 
innovate and to increase the productivity of our businesses. R 
and D is essential in today's new economy, to which we are 
confronted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the year 2010, we will no doubt have to double research and 
development. This is an important commitment taken by the 
government. One only has to think about the tax credit for 
research and development. This credit, which is administered by 
the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, may provide the Canadian 
business community with up to $1.5 billion a year in tax credits. 
These are all important tools which will help us increase our 
competitiveness and better position ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot talk about research, development and innovation 
without mentioning the National Research Council of Canada, which 
does an excellent job and plays a major role in helping all 
Canadian businesses to position themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by talking about vibrant communities. We want to 
continue to support all Canadian communities from coast to coast. 
As we know, the Canadian government has been omnipresent in that 
regard. I think, for instance, of Community Futures Development 
Corporations. There are many in Quebec and they work to assist 
all communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have launched a Youth Strategy which, according to the 
figures, has been a real success. Of course, the commitment 
regarding the broadband access to Internet project will provide 
considerable support to all regions. We do have a good Speech 
from the Throne with a great vision. 
<P><A NAME="LINK177"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of 
all, I want to congratulate the minister and member for Outremont 
on his victory in what probably was a hard fought battle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are aware of the traditions in the riding of Outremont, where 
the Liberal candidate must be strong and courageous, must be well 
known and must have good credentials within the party. My 
congratulations on your re-election. You will be here a long 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister talked about research and development, and the 
projects, initiatives and claims of the Liberal government with 
regard to innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know what he thinks of his government's attitude 
so far, unless he has new developments to share with us 
today, regarding the pulp and paper centre, a most important 
project for the Trois-Rivières area. That centre was created when 
the UQTR research centre and the CEGEP pulp and paper centre 
amalgamated into a new world class research centre, as the 
president of the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières described 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new centre will ensure that at least 3,000 young people 
receive adequate training so they can adapt to the technological 
change the pulp and paper industry must undergo, having to go 
from newsprint to special types of paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec has already offered a contribution 
amounting to tens of millions of dollars. However, the federal 
government, unless the minister has good news to tell us, has 
refused to grant $16.5 million as a financing package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the federal government's claims, I would like to 
know if the minister thinks it is acceptable for the government 
not to contribute to a project of such importance for Quebec, 
particularly for the Trois-Rivières area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my hon. 
colleague for referring to my beautiful riding of Outremont, of 
which I am very proud, in the preamble to his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He seemed however to be saying that the Liberals take the riding 
of Outremont for granted. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to say that no riding in the province of Quebec and 
in Canada should be taken for granted. We must do as thorough a 
job in each and every one of them. The same goes for my beautiful 
riding of Outremont. We must respect the people, the will of the 
people and the election process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I understand from what the hon. member has said is that he 
takes his constituents for granted, something, of course, I would 
never do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About the pulp and paper centre he was talking about, I have 
already had representations on this project. It is a nice 
project. Naturally, an application was submitted to the Canadian 
Foundation for Innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that applications were also submitted not only to Canada 
Economic Development but to other departments. They are being 
reviewed to determine whether something can be done. There is no 
doubt that this could be an interesting project for our region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also note that the Government of Quebec has undertaken to 
contribute a large amount of money. Of course, I would like to 
see the letter of undertaking. If there is one, it probably 
states as usual that the province's contribution is conditional 
upon the Canadian government investing in the program after doing 
all the groundwork. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was interested in comments made by 
the minister concerning Customs and Revenue Canada and its 
modernization.  Having travelled on both sides of the 49th for my 
constituency, I am particularly interested because of the deep 
concern Customs and Revenue Canada has about the modernization of 
technical and electronic entry, moving back and forth across our 
border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked to these people.  It is interesting to know that 
on the American side officials say that this is taking place to 
save on manpower.  Customs officers in Canada tell me they have 
great fears, simply because many of the ports of entry would be 
50 to 60 miles from the nearest RCMP office.  Having the largest 
number of border crossings in Canada, I would like to hear 
comments on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the question is very 
interesting.  The hon. member refers to the fact that Canada and 
the U.S. share by far the longest border in the world.  I do 
recognize that.  That is why we have within Canada Customs very 
good human resources.  We have officers with very good expertise 
and experience.  Today when one has a look at the situation and 
the management of customs not just in Canada but all over the 
world, one realizes that it is a question of risk management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the reform package we tabled last year we will be able to 
have much better risk management.  On the one hand, we will be able 
to use what we call soft technology, such as CANPASS.  We have 
started to establish CANPASS in some ports of entry across 
Canada.  On the other hand, using soft technology will allow us 
to use human resources when we have higher risk situations.  It 
is a much better system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Marcil (Beauharnois—Salaberry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my first words are for the constituents of my riding, 
Beauharnois—Salaberry. First, I want to thank them for having 
placed their trust in me during the election campaign, not only 
by choosing me as their representative, but also as their 
spokesman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In making that choice, they have allowed the beautiful riding of 
Beauharnois—Salaberry to escape its turpitude so that the people 
of the riding can have access to the wealth that is growing from 
day to day, from week to week in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is one of the countries with the highest economic growth. 
Unfortunately, the problem for the riding is that it did not 
derive any benefits from this growth, so it has remained at a 
standstill since 1993. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT27"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT27"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1610

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a reason for my coming back to politics. It is because 
I read a study conducted by the Seigneurie de Beauharnois CLSC, 
which clearly showed the problems in the riding, compared to the 
rest of the Montérégie, the riding of Beauharnois—Salaberry 
riding being the most underprivileged enclave of that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy, therefore, to see that social justice is one of the 
main themes of the Speech from the Throne. This is something that 
will have specific applications in my riding. 
Why? Because the study, which was published but was ignored by 
members at the time, draws a parallel between the unemployment 
rate in the riding and in the Montérégie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this very vibrant region of Quebec, the unemployment rate is 
approximately 6%. Unfortunately, in the riding of 
Beauharnois—Salaberry, the unemployment rate is always twice as 
high, at approximately 12%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study also showed that the highest rate of suicide among 
young people in the Montérégie was in Beauharnois—Salaberry, of 
course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Montérégie, the highest percentage of single parent 
families in the Montérégie is also in Beauharnois—Salaberry, as 
is the highest percentage of seniors living alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realized, and so did the population, that this riding had 
been left to its own devices since 1993. This is understandable 
because a vote for a Bloc Quebecois member is almost a wasted 
vote, since that person can do absolutely nothing for the 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I decided to enter politics precisely to take on that challenge. 
I was asked to get involved and I presented a three-step action 
plan that will give the people of that riding a chance to catch 
their breath. They say that creating wealth is nice, but to be 
able to share it is even nicer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne carries a strong message for us. 
In my riding, we have a high unemployment rate and a very high 
dropping out rate compared to the rest of Montérégie and we also 
rank last for economic growth. There are reasons for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of my riding already started to do something about 
the situation. Setting aside all political partisanship, they 
created a coalition. The leaders of the area got together to 
form this coalition with the Liberal candidate in the riding. 
Together, we put forward this plan. All the leaders were backing 
me. When I speak in the House, I do so on behalf of the 
leaders and the population of my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, we have a lot of work to do to put companies on solid 
grounds. We have ailing companies. 
There is very little funding for the companies in my riding. 
That does not bode well for the future. We decided to 
consolidate existing jobs. Meanwhile, we must also be in a 
position to create a climate that can stimulate investments from 
outside the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a road infrastructure problem in Montérégie and it is 
particularly acute in the riding of Beauharnois—Salaberry. That 
was one of the themes of the last election campaign because we 
wanted to complete what we had started in 1985, which is to 
disentrap our region as well as the greater Montreal area. The 
road system was therefore one of the major themes of the 
election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the basic reasons I came back to politics is the tragic 
situation of youth, something that was highlighted in the 
report. Earlier, I mentioned the high suicide rate among young people 
and the dropping out rate, which is also dreadful.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We launched an initiative, which is perfectly consistent with 
the Speech from the Throne, to establish a foundation to help in 
the fight against poverty and dropping out among our young 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the workers in this region as well as entrepreneurs have 
shown some interest for this initiative. For some weeks now, 
young people have been building this organization and learning 
about the problems of the region. In the coming months, they will 
be able to develop an action plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addressing these needs, it is very important to provide the 
people with an effective representative, one who will be able to 
communicate their concerns to the government. In my work as a 
member of parliament, I will use that victory, this seat that the 
people have given me, to address the needs of the region and to 
work aggressively with my government to get rid of the negative 
and pessimistic climate that has existed for a few years now. We 
want people to take charge of their own lives and to develop 
their region. 
Both the rural and the urban areas are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said earlier that one of the major points that will help us 
get out of this state is to work in co-operation with the people 
in this, to put pressure on the federal and Quebec 
governments to make sure that a plan of action can be developed 
so that everyone can benefit from the economic growth that 
Canada is currently enjoying. 
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
the hon. member for Beauharnois—Salaberry. I also want to wake 
him up from his deep sleep and tell him that he is not in the 
National Assembly but in the House of Commons and that issues 
such as dropping out and health are provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member sat in the Quebec National Assembly through two 
mandates. He should know or remember these things. Considering 
that he even forgot about his promises to build bridges when he 
was sitting in the National Assembly, perhaps we should ask him 
about that now. That will be my main question later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said there were no economic spinoffs in the 
riding of Beauharnois—Salaberry because voters voted for the 
wrong party. Was he an MNA under Taschereau or in a modern era? 
Because this is no longer how things work, or at least it should 
not be the case, unless the Liberals' policy is to penalize 
those who do not vote for them. It seems to me that this is what 
was implied in his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the unemployment rate, I should inform the hon. member 
that, in Quebec, the riding with the highest unemployment rate 
is Saint-Maurice. Yet, for 33 years now, it has been represented 
by a guy who supposedly belongs to the right party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his mailer, which I have here with me, the hon. member 
clearly promises his voters—this is crystal clear, it is not a 
commitment but a promise—that two bridges will be built. Now that 
he has been elected, now that his constituents have put their 
trust in him, will the hon. member tell us if he intends to 
fulfil his promise and build these two bridges during the 
current mandate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Let him put his seat on the line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Marcil:</B> Mr. Speaker, a debate on the division of 
responsibilities between the federal 
government and the provinces was held with the Bloc Quebecois 
candidate at the Valleyfield Cegep.  I would point out to the 
Bloc Quebecois member that when one is an MP, one represents the 
entire community.  There is no breakdown of jurisdiction.  One 
represents all members of the community.  That is how I intend

this is not a promise but an undertaking—I would like to remind 
him that between 1976 and 1985, when the Parti Quebecois was in 
power in Quebec, there was a moratorium on road construction.

corridors were retained. 
We achieved consensus in Montérégie.  We finalized one corridor, 
and built two segments of highway, which had not been seen in 
Quebec since 1976, and we concluded the impact studies in 1993. 
In 1993, Quebec's Department of Transportation wrapped them up.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid (Lanark—Carleton, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be dividing my time with the member for 
Wetaskiwin.  As is traditional, I will begin my comments by 
thanking the voters of my riding of Lanark—Carleton for placing 
their trust in me and for sending me to this place as their 
representative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lanark—Carleton is as large as Prince Edward Island and holds 
as many people as that province.  It is in some respects the most 
diverse riding in the country and contains within its bounds 
large tracts of rugged wilderness, much rich farmland, many of 
the prettiest small towns in Ontario, and also Kanata which is 
Canada's fastest growing and most dynamic urban area and the home 
of silicon valley north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The residents of the riding have long been among the most 
individualistic and creative of Canadians, from Dr. James 
Naismith of Almonte who invented basketball, to Captain Arthur 
Roy Brown who capped a glorious flying career in the first world 
war by shooting down the Red Baron, Manfred von Richtoffen.  In 
Lanark—Carleton we are, to quote from the motto of Beckwith 
township, proud of our past and confident of our future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also take a moment to salute a few individuals: my 
parents, Gord and Leatrice Reid, for their wisdom and perpetual 
support and my remarkable campaign team, headed by Frank Hall and 
Jerry Rice, who did so much to win the Canadian Alliance's 
easternmost seat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one other individual to whom I extend my personal 
thanks.  My primary opponent in the election was Ian Murray, the 
former Liberal member of parliament.  In a national campaign that 
was characterized by negative campaigning, Ian ran a clean and 
honourable campaign and was always a gentleman.  I salute him for 
that as he begins his life in private industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a great honour to serve as the critic within Her Majesty's 
Loyal Opposition for intergovernmental affairs.  As such it is my 
obligation to set out the parameters of the position my party 
will take in matters relating to federalism in this new 
parliament, and to emphasize as well one policy in particular 
that will occupy my own attention, that of intergovernmental 
transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this side of the House we are federalists in the true sense 
of the term: in the sense employed by James Madison in the 1780s 
when he wrote </I>The Federalist Papers<I>; in the sense that the 
term federationist was used a century ago in Australia when a 
federal system was being considered for that country; in the 
sense that citizens of Switzerland mean when they speak of the 
way their country divides its powers between federal and cantonal 
levels of government; and, most important, in the sense that the 
term confederate was used by the fathers of our own federal 
system at the conferences in Quebec City, London and 
Charlottetown in the mid-1860s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that a federal system ought to consist of two orders 
of government, each of which is completely sovereign within its 
own areas of jurisdiction and each of which has no authority 
whatsoever in the areas of jurisdiction assigned to the other 
order of government.  This is what the great British jurist 
Albert Venn Dicey meant when he made the startling but accurate 
observation that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A federal state requires for its formation...a body of countries 
such as the...Colonies of America or the Provinces of Canada, so 
closely connected by locality, by history...or the like, as to be 
capable of bearing, in the eyes of their inhabitants, an impress 
of common nationality.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course our Fathers of Confederation viewed the U.S. model and 
chose to construct our own federation a little differently.  They 
judged that the United States constitution had given the federal 
government too few powers and the states too many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They therefore assigned to the central government certain powers 
which in the U.S.A. are given to the states.  An obvious example 
of this is criminal law, which in most federal systems is the 
responsibility of the state or the cantonal government but which 
in Canada is a federal matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our fathers were federalists nonetheless in the pure sense of 
the term and not advocates of a unitary state.  Within the sphere 
of jurisdiction falling to each province the fathers clearly 
meant for that province to be absolutely sovereign.  They also 
intended the federal government to be absolutely sovereign within 
its own areas of jurisdiction, with no provincial interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wherever the fathers thought some form of joint jurisdiction 
would be the best arrangement, and they did not think this very 
often, they said so overtly, as in section 95 of the constitution 
which gives joint jurisdiction over agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately this decision to create a less decentralized union 
has been misinterpreted in recent decades as proof that what was 
intended for Canada was a highly centralized union in which the 
federal government could justifiably tinker in matters that 
clearly fall within the provincial realm of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government does this by offering to share the cost 
of provincial government programs and then attempting to impose 
conditions not only on how the transferred money is spent but 
also upon the manner in which all provincial moneys in that area 
will be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may seem a reasonable request, or at least tolerable, when 
speaking of federal grants amounting to 50% of total spending on 
a program, the so-called 50 cent dollars of the 1960s and 1970s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today when the federal government contributes less than 20 cents 
to every dollar of health care spending, for example, such 
demands for compliance to federal standards is clearly intended 
purely as propaganda, with the provinces bearing the lion's share 
of the cost of important programs but with the federal government 
taking as much credit as possible for maintaining standards that 
it does not take seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not happen because the federal government is smarter 
than provincial governments.  It has not happened because the 
voters who participate in federal elections are more responsible, 
more caring or more intelligent than the voters who cast their 
ballots in provincial elections.  It has not happened because 
federal Liberals care more about health care and education than 
do provincial Liberals, Conservatives or New Democrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has happened solely because the federal government has more 
revenues than it can reasonably expect to use for its own areas 
of jurisdiction while the provincial governments lack the revenue 
raising ability to directly finance their own constitutional 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that the so-called spending power stems not 
from any words to be found in the constitution itself, nor even 
from a supreme court interpretation of some unwritten emanation 
from a penumbra of the constitution, but rather from a 
straightforward assertion by successive federal governments that 
they have the right to disregard the boundaries set out in the 
constitution and to interfere directly in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No less an authority than Pierre Elliott Trudeau argued in 1957 
that the spending power was completely unconstitutional. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The disadvantages of a situation where taxes are levied by one 
level of government, and spending is done by another, are well 
known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preliminary report of the Liberal Party of Quebec says the 
following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal spending power leads to three types of problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the predictability of funding; with respect to cost-shared 
programs, for example, the provinces find themselves faced with 
the progressive withdrawal of federal funding once the programs 
are established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the unilateral imposition of federal standards; in the 
case of conditional transfer payments in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction, the conditions imposed by the federal government 
lead to pan-Canadian standards, despite the fact that the 
provinces have exclusive jurisdiction in the area in question. 
This is an especially delicate issue for Quebec, given the 
specificity of its society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the duplication of measures; one example of this is when 
a federal program is added to an existing provincial program.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Nor is any of this a recent discovery.  In 1930 Mackenzie King 
stated in the House “It is a pernicious principle to have one 
government collect taxes and another government spend them”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 100 years ago Sir Wilfrid Laurier warned “It is an 
entirely false principle according to which one government 
collects revenues and another government spends them.  This must 
lead always to extravagance.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have outlined a serious problem that was not addressed in the 
Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In concluding my remarks, I would suggest that there is a simple 
solution that could be and should be considered by the House. 
It is to transfer tax points and tax room to the provinces to 
allow their tax base and spending base to expand to reflect 
their important constitutional jurisdiction.  This would allow 
for our federal system to be represented, our constitution to be 
respected and our most important programs, such as health care, 
to be adequately financed now and in the decades in the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member for Lanark—Carleton is using arguments in 
connection with Canada's constitution, which we are beginning to 
hear more of with respect to the Canadian Alliance's position on 
the constitution.  In my view, it is a complete distortion of our 
constitutional history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talks about the federal government and the provincial 
governments being absolutely sovereign in their particular areas 
of jurisdiction at Confederation.  Anyone who has read Canadian 
constitutional history will know that the government created by 
Macdonald, Cartier and others was looking very specifically at 
what was happening in the United States in terms of its 
federation.  It saw the problem with states' rights and slavery. 
It saw a union and a federation dissolve after the civil war. 
That was the lesson learned from the American constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was always that toing and froing even within the American 
constitution's founding fathers, between Jefferson and Hamilton, 
in terms of whose theory of federalism would have ascendancy.  As 
it turned out, Jefferson's theory took hold in terms of the U.S. 
supreme court's interpretation of the American constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In relation to his speech, how does the hon. member's theory of 
absolute sovereignty of both levels of government at 
Confederation square with the power that existed at the time of 
reservation and disallowance?  At that time the federal 
government had the power to nullify all provincial legislation, 
which was a very significant power.  It was only after years and 
years of constitutional interpretation by the British judicial 
committee of the privy council that the power fell into 
disrepute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the hon. member square the Alliance's theory 
of absolute sovereignty in its own particular areas of 
jurisdiction at Confederation with what actually occurred? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member, 
whose riding adjoins my own, for his questions and his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the question of federal transfers and the use 
of tax points and tax rooms, it is not a new innovation of my 
party, nor is it something on which we stand alone.  This 
approach has been suggested by the Quebec Liberal Party in its 
recent report.  The so-called six wise men in Alberta have also 
suggested it in their recent proposal.  It is in fact a long 
standing proposal of various parties within Quebec.  The 
Ontario government has expressed an interest as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at Premier Hamm of Nova Scotia and his comments on 
the need to change the equalization formula, certainly the idea 
of using tax points is compatible with that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A broad based consensus is evolving and emerging in opposition 
to the Liberal Party and the government which basically holds 
that there is an effective way within our own system of dealing 
with the fact that there is a fiscal imbalance between the 
revenue raising abilities of the federal government and the 
spending needs of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He raised questions with regard to the manner in which the 
Fathers of Confederation saw our country and the question of 
disallowance and reservation.  I am surprised, in all honesty, 
that anybody at this time would want to defend the powers of 
disallowance or reservation.  The power of disallowance was most 
recently used in the 1930s and conventionally speaking is no 
longer regarded to be acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The power of reservation, if I am not mistaken, was used most 
recently in 1961 by the lieutenant-governor of Saskatchewan.  He 
was either dismissed or at least reprimanded for attempting to 
use it.  Both of these are constitutional provisions which have 
fallen into disuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the original intention of those constitutional 
provisions, we may recall that when Canada was founded it was not 
an independent country at all.  Nor did the Fathers of 
Confederation want it to be an independent country.  The debates 
that took place in the predecessor to this Chamber over the 
provisions of Confederation are full of strong emphases on just 
how we do not want to be an independent country.  We want to be 
part of the British empire.  We want to be in the position of a 
protectorate of what was regarded at that time as the freest and 
greatest assemblage of people in the world.

Speaker, I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your 
ascension to the chair.  I also congratulate the others sharing 
the chair with you.  We only demand of you perfection; nothing 
more, nothing less.  I do not think that will be too hard a bill 
to fill.  If that were not enough, perhaps we would also suggest 
that you could be an agent for some change in the House while you 
are at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my first intervention in the 37th parliament.  I thank 
the people of the constituency of Wetaskiwin for yet another 
tremendous vote of confidence bestowed on me on November 27 
during the federal election.  I give a special thanks to my wife 
Dianne.  As all members of the House know, their duties here also 
affect family members.  certainly my wife Dianne has been a great 
supporter.  I also thank our daughters Michelle and Dalene and 
our son-in-law Andy for their continued support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also mention the people on my campaign team who worked so hard 
in winter weather to get me re-elected.  In particular, my 
campaign manager Janet Moseson did a marvellous job of working 
with a less than perfect product, myself.  My official agent 
Gerald Grant has done a stellar job of looking after the 
finances, and his wife Averil Grant looked after the constituency 
office during a very busy time, and did it single-handedly. I 
thank all of them for their help, and the result is that I am 
back in the House of Commons for my third term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the campaign I promised the voters of Wetaskiwin that 
I would bring their message to Ottawa.  It would not be the other 
way around, that I would never bring Ottawa's message to them.  I 
would be their servant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents have asked me to bring a message to the 
government and to the Prime Minister.  Part of that message is 
that they want the government to be fiscally accountable and 
responsible.  They want the government to treat all Canadians 
equally regardless of where they live or who they support.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents do not want and certainly do not need the Prime 
Minister's tough love.  They want and deserve respect from the 
Prime Minister and his government.  Last week's throne speech was 
not a great start.  It had even more platitudes than previous 
speeches from the throne.  It was notable in that it had very 
little to say and it was notable in what it did not say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government came into power in 1993 the national debt 
and deficit had reached astronomical proportions.  A responsible 
government would have made tough decisions to cut wasteful and 
unnecessary spending in order to get things back on track. Not 
these Liberals.  Instead, they kept their patronage ridden, make 
work projects, and they balanced the budget by raising taxes and 
offloading expenses on to the provinces and municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech promised that the government would fund 
improvements to municipal water and waste water systems through 
the federal-provincial-municipal Canada infrastructure program. 
That is the same promise that we heard in red book one.  Instead, 
millions of dollars were squandered on questionable 
infrastructure spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 35th parliament the government announced the $6 billion 
infrastructure program.  Here are some of the examples of what 
the government thinks are infrastructure and how that money was 
spent, and I beg to differ with it.  There were bowling alley 
renovations in Ontario.  There were a $24 million tennis stadium 
and a $14.4 million circus training centre in Montreal.  There 
were a fountain in Shawinigan and golf courses in Atlantic 
Canada. Hardly any of that in the wildest imagination is 
infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears that municipal sewage and water treatment 
infrastructure was not a high priority for the Liberal government 
as bowling alleys or golf courses.  In the short term, make work 
projects designed to provide Liberal backbenchers with photo ops 
better describe it.  The main reason to invest in infrastructure 
should be to make sure that the economy remains competitive and 
buoyant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a municipality, a province or a country cannot offer clean 
water, a reliable transportation system and affordable housing, 
businesses will locate somewhere else.  If the British Columbia 
companies participating in the upcoming team Canada trade mission 
to China win large contracts, they will be faced with the 
problems of how to get their products to port because of 
deteriorating, congested road networks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canadian companies cannot get their products to market, they 
will simply lose those contracts.  Workers will have to be laid 
off and there will be a deteriorating effect on the economy.  The 
government will then have fewer tax dollars to collect from those 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians, whether they live in the west, the east, the centre 
or the north, expect the government to provide core services. 
They pay enough taxes to justify these expectations.  Before the 
government embarks on another potentially frivolous 
infrastructure plan, it should recognize what was wrong with the 
first two and steer clear of culture and social infrastructure 
components that led to many boondoggles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Existing physical infrastructure has long been one of the areas 
consistently neglected by the government.  An infrastructure 
program should embody economic efficiency and be a patronage free 
zone.  By the end of the program in 1999, the Liberals' 
inefficient manner of allocating taxpayer dollars was obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They left the private sector out of the picture in helping to 
identify, finance and administer the projects.  Unless the 
neglect is followed up by an innovative way of finding new areas 
of financing, Canada's infrastructure will continue to 
deteriorate to the point where governments will be required to 
spend more money for improvements.  As a matter of fact, 
improvements might not do it.  They might have to completely 
rebuild the infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treasury Board claims that the program was not renewed in 1999 
because the economy was booming.  That brings us to where we are 
today: another red book and another throne speech promising to 
fix Canada's roads and sewers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This time the government is still promising $2.6 billion, as 
announced in the February budget, for new physical 
infrastructure.  Is it any wonder that westerners are skeptical 
and nearly shut out the Liberals in the last election? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the economy is booming and Canada does not need another 
infrastructure program, we have to wonder why the government is 
renewing this program.  Perhaps it has something to do with 
bringing goodies to certain regions of the country.  For 
instance, Quebec got $515 million in federal contributions while 
Alberta got only $171 million.  This is not regional fairness. 
Albertans have heard the same storyline over and over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the auditor general noted that Canadians get upset and 
angry when they see their tax dollars wasted.  We cannot blame 
them.  They expect the government to take the same care of and 
have the same prudence with their money as they themselves must. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that my former colleague in the House, 
the member for Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Lee Morrison, authored 
a private member's bill that would have dedicated revenues from 
fuel taxes for repair of our crumbling highways.  Our 
Trans-Canada Highway is a shame, a disaster, and I think his idea 
is one that is well worth exploring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to conclude by saying that if the Prime Minister doubts 
what I am saying, he can visit the great riding of Wetaskiwin. We 
would be glad to have people meet with him and give him this 
exact message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other message the people of Wetaskiwin want me to deliver to 
this place today is that they want to see a country in which 
their children and grandchildren are treated with respect, have 
unlimited opportunity and have a government they can respect. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
disappointed in the member's speech.  If this is how he is going 
to start the new House I do not think we have much to look 
forward to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He begins by saying that he is bringing us a message from his 
constituents.  He is obviously very proud to be a member of 
parliament, as I am.  He obviously believes in representing the 
people of his riding as well as he can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in discussing the first two infrastructure programs he 
proceeded to malign the villages, townships, towns and cities of 
my riding, because within the guidelines of those first two 
infrastructure programs in the 1993 and 1997 parliaments, the 
choices were made by the municipalities themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also maligns the Federation of Canadian Municipalities.  That 
was the design program municipalities specifically asked for 
and have asked for again this time.  If he were to go to my 
riding he would discover that the elected representatives of my 
villages looked very carefully at their infrastructure needs. 
They effectively defined what was infrastructure and what was 
priority infrastructure at that time for their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to mention highways and water and sewage.  What is 
the point when a small municipality that has recently spent large 
sums of money on its highways is given money to spend on 
highways?  If there is a municipality that has recently invested 
in its water supply and has gone to great lengths to develop a 
good water system and a system of checking it, what is the point 
of giving that municipality infrastructure money for water? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Putting it another way, why should a municipality which has not 
done that get the benefit of a program simply because it is 
behind in checking its highways or water and sewage? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the purpose of this type of infrastructure 
program—and I do understand that there are others—is to deal 
with the smallest units in our system, which are the villages and 
townships of my riding and of the member's riding.  I hope the 
design of this program is the same, because only the design of 
this program can do it.  No one in Ottawa knows what the village 
of Havelock in my riding needs today.  We just do not, but we can 
listen to the villages and townships and respond as well as we

</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the hon. member's comments.  In his riding, in the 
1993 and 1997 programs, was someone other than the municipalities 
themselves deciding what was infrastructure? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what I did say in my 
remarks was that not even in my wildest dreams could I imagine a 
fountain in Shawinigan being infrastructure.  What I certainly 
can imagine being infrastructure is the repair of the 
Trans-Canada Highway, and I cannot quite understand why it has 
not been done.  To me that is infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly, as the hon. member says, if municipalities chose to 
repair their water and sewer systems before the infrastructure 
program became available to them, then he is right, it would not 
make sense to force money on them for water and sewer where it is 
not needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the same token, I challenge the hon. member to tell me how a 
fountain in the Prime Minister's riding would qualify, even in 
the broadest terms, as infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The availability of infrastructure money should come with no 
political strings whatsoever attached to it.  From where I sit, 
it appears that quite a lot of the infrastructure money came with 
some political strings attached to it.  It should be available on 
the basis of need for infrastructure spending in a municipality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the hon. member when he says that it should be 
decided by the area of governance that is closest to the people. 
Those people should be able to make the decision because they are 
the ones who know what is needed in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am just having a very difficult time understanding how he 
qualifies a golf course, for instance, or a fountain as 
infrastructure.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and 
Youth), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the representative from the 
Northwest Territories and the Secretary of State for Children and 
Youth, I am pleased to contribute in the debate on the Speech 
from the Throne.  I am sharing my time with the member for 
Markham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had it not been for the support that I received from my 
constituents through four elections in a row I would not have the 
opportunity to speak today.  I am grateful for having been 
returned to my seat in the House of Commons.  To serve as a 
member of parliament is one of the highest honours.  We are 
sitting in the highest court of our country, apart from the 
supreme court and the Senate, and we all take that seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to the Speech from the Throne, I am delighted to say 
that the emphasis is something that I really believe my whole 
life has been about in the work I have undertaken for the people 
I represent.  The emphasis is one of inclusivity and innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our goal is to ensure that all Canadians can succeed and fully 
participate in today's society.  As is said in the Speech from 
the Throne, the true value of a strong society in Canada is our 
willingness to include everybody and generate opportunities 
shared by all communities.  Every region, every province, every 
territory, every community and every citizen has a strong voice 
and can contribute to building our nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That resonates with me specifically because I come from such a 
remote part of our country.  I represent 33 communities in over 
half a million square miles, many of which are not connected by 
road and are only accessible by air.  These words in the Speech 
from the Throne really mean something to my constituents, because 
when we are essentially physically isolated there is the sense 
that everything is happening out there and we are not connected 
to it. 
My community and the territory I come from can appreciate these 
words.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to state how much we are progressing in the north. Much 
more economic development is occurring at this time.  Land claims 
are continually being settled.  A few are well on their way to 
being settled and others are in different stages of completion 
and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal in the north is to become much more self-sustaining. As 
Canadians, we want to contribute.  We want to be able to give 
back to this wonderful country what we have received in terms of 
transfer payments and equalization.  Never in the north has there 
been an opportunity as great as there is today to position 
ourselves to do that.  We are a part of Canada that is 
positioned, because of our resources and the region we come from, 
to be able to do that in a very short time if we are given the 
opportunity and the support we need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to say that at this time I see a better future for the 
people in the north because of the opportunities there.  I am 
honoured that the government has made a commitment to strengthen 
its relationships with the aboriginal people of Canada through 
the Speech from the Throne.  The government will support first 
nations communities in strengthening governance, including more 
effective and transparent administrative practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my community there is an ongoing debate about the Dogrib land 
claim.  Embedded in that claim is the provision for 
self-government.  These are constitutionally binding commitments. 
They are legal.  They are constitutional once they are completely 
finalized.  We have to recognize that.  Those provisions are not 
put there so that these instruments become hollow vessels.  They 
have to mean something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also in my riding is the community of Delenhe, which is working 
on a community self-government proposal.  This proposal is 
progressing quite well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These communities are serious in their negotiations and their 
intent and I believe the negotiators on all sides are negotiating 
with goodwill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have a proposal from the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation 
and the Gwich'in Tribal Council for regional self-government. 
Self-government does not have one mould.  It can have many 
different structures.  These are serious negotiations.  The 
proposal would provide greater responsibility to those who would 
be governing once they complete their negotiations and 
arrangements with the federal and territorial governments and 
among themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are important negotiations.  They speak to the actual 
substance of what the throne speech is speaking to in terms of 
strengthening governance for aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will work with first nations to ensure that basic 
needs are met for jobs, health, education, housing and 
infrastructure.  This will be reflected in all of the 
government's priorities.  This is good news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowhere is the creation and sharing of opportunity more 
important than it is for aboriginal people.  Too many live in 
poverty without the tools they need to build a future for 
themselves and their communities.  Over the last 12 years I have 
been to many reserves in many parts of Canada.  I have gone to 
touch the earth and be with the people, as have many hon. 
members.  I have seen many diverse living conditions in Canada 
and many ranges in the quality of life of Canadians.  That is 
being recognized in the throne speech.  We need to help these 
people develop the tools they need to build a better future for 
themselves and their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we enter this new millennium in a faster paced, digital 
economy, the government will work with all Canadians to build a 
stronger, more inclusive Canada, fueled by innovation, ideas and 
talent, an innovative economy built on an innovative society 
whose people welcome diversity and are willing to explore 
creative approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can only achieve our potential in the north and elsewhere if 
we expect all of our citizens to do well in education, work and 
life and if we willingly support them in that achievement.  We 
are already seeing progress.  Many of our young people are very 
technologically savvy, outward looking and more educated than 
ever.  They are managing very well.  However, we are ever more 
determined to build on this momentum. 
The throne speech refers to instruments like the creation of the 
registered individual learning accounts to make it easier for 
Canadians to finance their learning.  We will improve the loans 
available to part time students so more workers can earn while 
they learn.  We anticipate many thousands of working Canadians 
will take advantage of learning opportunities like these over the 
next five years.  This is good news for Canadians who need to 
upgrade their skills.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Northwest Territories we see tremendous opportunities 
opening up.  We have two diamond mines that are in full swing and 
producing diamonds.  They are the Broken Hill property mine and 
the Diavik Mine, which just started and is basically bringing in 
all its supplies because the winter road has now opened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all the spin-off effects on jobs and economic growth, it 
was said at one time that we could never cut and polish diamonds 
in the Northwest Territories, which is a value-added subsidiary 
of the diamond industry.  We have two cutting and polishing 
facilities in Yellowknife.  One of them is co-owned by Aboriginal 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to that, oil and gas companies have committed more 
than $1 billion in exploration in the Northwest Territories. 
This includes $750 million in the Mackenzie Delta, $85 million in 
the Sahtu region and $25 million in Liard area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The demand for natural gas is robust.  The development of a 
Mackenzie Valley gas pipeline has many benefits: $1 billion 
dollars in wages to workers; aboriginal people would have new 
opportunities and perhaps a chance for equity ownership of the 
pipeline; towns would have an increased tax base; and the service 
industry would expand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the next two diamond mines come into play, Diavik and Snap 
Lake Diamond mines, the Northwest Territories will be producing 
20% of the world's diamonds.  Diamonds have landed.  We have 
become a big player in the diamond industry in Canada and it is 
happening in my region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is like every other part of Canada.  Northerners want the 
opportunity to participate.  They do not want a handout, they 
want a hand up.  There are opportunities and the throne speech 
speaks about many of those opportunities. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, with 
respect to the throne speech, could the Secretary of State for 
Children and Youth tell us what some of her ideas are regarding 
the issue of young people with disabilities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the throne speech there is a section on support for persons 
with disabilities who have some attachments to the labour force. 
However, I see nothing that deals with the very real problems 
that young people with disabilities face in the education system 
in terms of mobility support.  At the present time there are no 
adequate national standards for education and certainly not for 
children with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my town hundreds of parents struggle every year to make sure 
there will be a speech therapist, a teacher's assistant and a 
psychologist.  We seem to throw all of these things into the 
provincial pot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a spokesperson for children and youth, I know that education 
and national standards for learning have to be part of any kind 
of a vision for the country.  How does the hon. member feel the 
government is helping with the solution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased 
that the hon. member has a particular interest in the issue of 
disability.  I and many other members do as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, in the aboriginal community in my area the 
incidence of disability is four or five times higher than the 
national average.  It is a very difficult issue for that 
community to deal with.  We have had a number of reports.  We 
have a working group for aboriginals with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that there is a particular concern for children with 
special needs. 
It was very well registered during the election by many of my 
constituents that we can do the integration into the labour 
market but that does not deal with the children who have FAE/FAS, 
or dyslexia, or impediments, or learning difficulties, or 
attention deficit or who have a number of other learning 
challenges.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big debate right now is how will we be able to take the $2.2 
billion of early childhood development and square that with the 
needs that are out there.  That is the challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other challenge is that we must not focus on our 
jurisdictional differences between the provinces, the territories 
and the federal government.  To a child, there is no difference. 
To families who need the help and to the schools that find this a 
tremendous challenge financially as well as in terms of human 
resources, there really are no differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to be able to come together as the representatives of 
various levels of government and come up with a strategy that 
will deal with children, specifically children with special 
needs.  That can be done through some of the suggestions in the 
Speech from the Throne.  The items that are listed there are for 
children, specifically early childhood development.  The most 
preventable disability, FAE/FAS, also got a special mention. We 
have a national strategy for that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say that there is a silver bullet and there will 
be a quick fix.  It will take a long time.  It will take greater 
dedication and more focus in terms of what is needed in the next 
report that comes out on the disabilities.  There has to be some 
kind of reflection of those needs that are out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have many considerations because it is not simple.  It is 
very complicated as I indicated.  However I do not believe that 
it is insurmountable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McCallum (Markham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I want to 
thank my fellow citizens in Markham for electing me. I also want 
to thank my family, which has accepted wholeheartedly the family 
and financial costs of political life. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often many things have a silver lining.  For my two teenage 
sons, the greater availability of a car during my sojourns in 
Ottawa is a definite plus. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the Prime Minister, who invited me to join his team by 
selecting me as a candidate. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I thank my Liberal colleagues, fellow rookie MPs from 
all parties and the staff of the House of Commons who have made 
this first 10 days a very exciting and pleasurable experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My theme today is that in at least two respects Markham, my 
riding, can be seen as a vanguard of the shape of things to come 
in much of the rest of the country.  I refer first to the 
increasing multicultural nature of our country and second to the 
degree to which we are as a country leaping into the new economy 
and making it grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go back 30 years, there was a negligible percentage of the 
citizens of Markham who were visible minorities.  Today it is 
about half.  Thirty years ago there were 135 Chinese people, 
today there are 43,000.  More than half of the people of Markham 
are new Canadians, people who were not born in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As one such as myself with a relatively Caucasian or WASP 
background from Bay Street or McGill, it was a distinct highlight 
of the campaign to have the opportunity to meet so many new 
Canadians in their places of worship and in their homes during 
door to door canvassing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One event sticks out in my mind as something I will never 
forget.  While canvassing on a street with mainly new Canadians 
one evening, I noticed that as soon as they saw a Liberal sign a 
smile would come to their faces and the names of Trudeau and that 
of the Prime Minister would often be mentioned, both in a 
positive vein. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that point I realized, as a question of reality, that rather 
than theory it truly is the Liberal Party that has traditionally 
been the one to welcome people to our shores from all parts of 
the world irrespective of culture, religion or race. 
This is increasingly the population of Markham and increasingly 
that of Canada. It goes without saying that the 
government will continue in that tradition.  In addition, there 
are measures in the throne speech and a commitment to work with 
provincial governments to make it easier for the credentials of 
immigrants to be accepted and for them to be integrated more 
quickly into our society.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a Quebecer, or at least as someone who was born in Quebec and 
taught at McGill University, and at the Université du Québec à 
Montréal, I appreciate not only the multicultural aspect of the 
Canadian way of life, but also our bilingualism or linguistic 
duality. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reflects the sense of balance which to me is the hallmark 
of being a Liberal.  We favour innovation and inclusion.  We 
favour wealth creation and growth and helping those who need 
help.  We favour multiculturalism and bilingualism.  This sense 
of balance comes naturally to Liberals, just as easily as walking 
and chewing gum.  However, without naming names, that ability to 
walk and chew gum at the same time seems to come less naturally 
to some of the other parties in the House.  That is meant to be a 
relatively non-partisan remark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come now to the second element.  I said Markham is in a sense 
the vanguard of multiculturalism.  Now let me talk about the new 
economy.  Markham describes itself as the high tech centre of 
Canada.  Markham has more than 800 high tech firms. Whereas the 
whole of the country benefits from the policies of this 
government, favouring economic growth and the new economy, 
nowhere will these benefits be felt more strongly than in 
Markham.  Let me briefly illustrate three dimensions of these. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there are measures to make the macro economy perform 
because the macro economy has to perform for both the old and the 
new economies.  The Liberal government's impeccably timed and 
very substantial tax cuts are just what the doctor ordered to 
allow us to weather the storms that are coming from south of the 
border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only that, there are also budgetary measures specifically 
favouring the new economy.  I refer to the end of the income tax 
surtax, the slashing of the capital gains inclusion rate and the 
measures on stock options, all of which are specifically geared 
to favour the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also refer to structural measures contained in the throne 
speech that will favour expanded research, increased 
commercialization of research, increased learning and an improved 
information infrastructure, all of which are essential to the new 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, as a specific illustration and as an economist, it does 
not make sense for the new economy to be a pure unadulterated 
private enterprise activity.  There has to be an element of 
partnership.  This is perhaps my favourite example of that.  In 
the past year Markham attracted an IBM facility with 1,500 new 
jobs, thanks in part to a $33 million federal investment.  Absent 
of that investment, according to IBM, it would not be somewhere 
else in Canada. It would be in Ireland or Asia. The Alliance 
policy, which would abandon and outlaw such partnerships, would 
see such companies not locate in this country but locate 
elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, Markham can be seen as a microcosm or as a vanguard 
of where much of the country is headed with respect to both 
multiculturalism and the new economy.  In both of those two 
dimensions, the progress of the town will be much aided by the 
measures taken previously in the budget and more recently in the 
throne speech.

my time with my colleague, the member for Champlain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to make my maiden speech in this House. First, 
I want to congratulate you on your appointment and to mention 
the election of the Speaker of this House. I also offer you my 
full co-operation so that we can have respectful debates while 
dealing with the business of the House in the years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You have perhaps the most significant job in the House. You must 
assist us so that, in our work, we respect of the rights of all 
members of parliament, particularly those in the opposition. I 
can assure you that I will support you to ensure that, even 
though the discussions between the opposition and the government 
are sometimes heated, they are never disgraceful nor 
disrespectful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to take a few minutes of my maiden speech to thank 
all the people in the riding of Châteauguay. I sincerely thank 
them for the trust they put in me on November 27. I can assure 
them that I will do my best to represent them and serve them 
here in parliament. I also want to pay my respects to the 
previous BQ member for Châteauguay, Maurice Godin, who, after 
having served his fellow citizens and Quebec for two terms, is 
enjoying a well deserved retirement with his family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that Mr. Godin, who is a fervent advocate of 
Quebecers' interests, will come out of retirement when there is 
another referendum, and that he will support Quebecers who want 
to choose freely and democratically their political destiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech read last week was quite a disappointment. To 
tell the truth, it was a bitter disappointment, for me and for 
many of my colleagues and fellow citizens. I was disappointed by 
the lack of a real government agenda and of any real vision of 
public administration. The throne speech was full of vague and 
meaningless phrases. The fact that the government has no agenda 
means that it will continue steering Canada day to day, with 
vague objectives in mind instead of clear goals. That this 
government should ask for clarity from others is the height of 
arrogance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the Bloc have pinpointed some of the flaws of 
the throne speech, and we will continue to do so. The main theme 
of our remarks has been the lack of a real vision for the 
development of the Canadian and Quebec societies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The various measures found in the throne speech remain vague and 
they lack clarity, in the areas of economic, social and cultural 
development. This is not the way to get Canadians and Quebecers 
interested in political life. The fact that four out of ten 
voters did not find the issues discussed in the last election 
campaign important enough to cast their ballot does not seem to 
bother the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly not with this kind of government agenda, which 
has absolutely no substance, that our fellow citizens will 
develop a renewed interest in politics and will give new lustre 
to this parliamentary institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important to say that the Speech from the Throne 
was a great disappointment to me, in terms of this government's 
vision of amateur sport. In fact, it has no vision whatsoever as 
far as our amateur athletes are concerned. The vision of the Bloc 
Quebecois is that amateur athletes must be our first priority. 
Right now, they have to get by without any formal support. 
Amateur athletes represent our country internationally, and yet 
they have to fend for themselves. The Bloc Quebecois is proud of 
our athletes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, French speaking athletes have to master the English 
language to be able to succeed in their sport. Nothing has 
changed. This is another disappointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>French speaking athletes have to be very tenacious, needless to 
say, to persevere in their endeavour even though English remains 
the only language used in many Canadian sport federations. It 
seems that, once again, the Bloc Quebecois has to ensure that the 
rights of Quebecers are respected by demanding that our athletes 
be able to train and compete in French.  All that in spite of the 
fact that French is one of our country's official languages.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois filed a complaint about that with the 
Commissioner of Official Languages in 1999, but nothing has 
changed, which is another disappointment. Can we hope for a 
follow-up on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very disappointed when I realize that English has become 
the official language of amateur sport in Canada. The government 
must send a clear message to our athletes by investing the funds 
required to promote the use of French within Canadian sport 
federations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must stop being so vague when it streamlines the 
budgets of the various federations and stop asking always more of 
French-speaking athletes, insisting that they work in English 
only if they want to succeed. Bilingualism must be a priority in 
amateur sports and the government must act now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also disappointed that the government has not taken a clear 
position on antidoping measures. It is especially disappointing 
since, as harmful as it is, doping has become more and more 
frequent, something athletes need to do to win and keep winning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Doping has also become a lucrative billion dollar business, 
dashing the hopes of any athlete who refuses to use drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Doping has become a lucrative business by creating a demand for 
the athletes to always perform better, given all the money the 
broadcasters are paying. The bottom line in this business is 
profits, and to make profits, the athletes must not only win but 
put on a performance worthy of being broadcast. To have athletes 
push their limits is profitable, not only for the broadcasters 
but also for the athletes who use performance enhancing drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such superhuman achievement tarnishes any real athletic 
performance. Athletes find themselves facing quite a challenging 
dilemma. The choice they have to make is a tough one, because 
they do not have the support they need and there are no 
guidelines to fight systematic doping in sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government have a concrete and real antidoping policy? 
No. Is there an arm's length agency to monitor and control 
doping? No. The government might say it is against doping but its 
commitments keep being shoved under the carpet. 
And so if the commitments have been shoved under the carpet, I 
ask you where are our athletes and where can they turn?  I ask 
you, who will respond to our athletes when they have been 
irretrievably lost to the world of drugs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a vicious circle already.  By remaining silent in the 
throne speech, this government is making very clear its lack of 
desire to fight this growing tumour in the world of amateur 
sport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the explanation for the government's lack of a stand 
with respect to our athletes?  What message is the government 
sending our athletes through its silence?  What are its 
intentions?  When will it take a firm stand?  Our only answer is 
disappointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must shorten my remarks considerably. To conclude, my 
colleagues, the members of the Bloc Quebecois, can count on me, 
as the youth and amateur sport critic, to criticize and unmask 
the actions of the Liberal government, which is acting 
increasingly as if no other level of government existed in 
Canada.  This arrogant attitude is especially true and verifiable 
in the case of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government seems to forget that the people of Quebec 
also put their trust in the representatives they send to the 
National Assembly of Quebec and give their national government 
important responsibilities.  I will ensure, with my Bloc 
Quebecois colleagues, that Quebec's responsibilities are 
honoured.  I will ensure, with the Bloc Quebecois team, that the 
national government of Quebec is consulted and respected.  I will 
ensure, on behalf of all Quebecers, that the people of Quebec are 
respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You can count on me to criticize every attempt to use young 
people to promote Canadian unity under the cover of new policies 
or programs.  The public is not fooled by this sort of arrogant 
and opportunistic attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be constantly on the lookout to not miss any opportunity 
to respond to Quebec's detractors in these areas.  The people of 
Quebec exist, whether the Prime Minister likes it or not, and 
they demand the respect and recognition of this government, and 
the fight, whatever they say, is not over.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I 
wish to thank the constituents of Charlevoix for having put their 
trust in me in 1993, in 1997, and again in 2000, electing me with 
a very clear majority of 63%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Charlevoix trust the Bloc Quebecois because we 
seem to be the best advocates of Quebec rights. I also want to 
congratulate the hon. member for Châteauguay, who just spoke, and 
congratulate his constituents on putting their trust in a Bloc 
Quebecois member since 1993. I take this opportunity to offer my 
best wishes to his predecessor, Maurice Godin, who is enjoying a 
well-deserved retirement and who is surely watching us from his 
cottage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure the people of Châteauguay that their new member 
will continue Mr. Godin's very good work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About this famous Speech from the Throne, I want to go back to 
the speech given by the revenue minister and member for 
Outremont, who told us this afternoon that he was proud of his 
government and of the Speech from the Throne. He said his 
government is the most connected ever. But connected to what? 
This government is no doubt connected to Internet, as we were 
abundantly told. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But when the minister speaks of connection to the Net, he is 
completely disconnected from society. 
In fact, voters in Charlevoix and in Châteauguay found no 
stability measures for seasonal workers in the employment 
insurance system. Let us not forget that they are often people 
working at minimum wage. Often they are women who are heads of 
single parent families, earning low wages at a certain period of 
the year. If they are seasonal workers, it is because their jobs 
are seasonal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the speech, nothing also is said about the World March of 
Women. Members will recall the 13 demands made by the women 
during the World March of Women and the demonstrations that 
occurred all over Quebec, in my riding, in Montreal and here in 
Ottawa. The Prime Minister said: “Wait for the next 
mini budget”. We waited in vain. “Wait for the election”. We 
waited in vain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question we are asking today is this: why do we have a 
throne speech that is a photocopy of the previous one? Nothing 
changed before or after the election. People are even asking why 
there was an election in the first place. Nothing has changed as 
far as the cabinet is concerned. Nothing has changed in the 
government party's agenda. The policies mentioned in the throne 
speech for the next four years have not changed. Nothing also was 
announced in terms of social housing. Nor was anything announced 
in the area of employment insurance, as I was saying earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like to ask the member for Châteauguay is: does he 
not think, like I do, that when the government says it is 
connected to the electronic world, the fact is that it is 
increasingly disconnected or out of touch with the people of 
Canada and Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Lanctôt:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is a very good question. 
Obviously, in a society such as ours, we must not only talk about 
getting connected to the Internet. We live in a society that is 
moving toward globalization and we have a choice. All of this 
must be controlled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had an opportunity to improve, clarify and give 
more substance to the employment insurance bill, the first one 
introduced in this parliament. The government lost an ideal 
opportunity not to proceed in haste but rather to consider 
whether it should allow young people and students not to pay any 
premiums, as it is well known they will not get any benefits. 
Only one out of four students receives benefits.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In its employment insurance bill, the government did not deal 
with people who, in ridings such as ours, in Charlevoix, 
Châteauguay or Champlain, are self-employed workers. These people 
cannot contribute to the employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the clauses we find discriminatory for young people, as I 
just said, are also discriminatory for women. That discrimination 
is reflected in an excessively high number of hours of work. 
Instead of 300 hours, they have to work up to 600 hours. When 
these women want to get back— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Champlain. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize to 
my colleague who could not finish his speech. I would have liked 
to have heard the end of it. He was eloquent, but it seems that it is 
my turn now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to congratulate you on your being appointed Deputy 
Speaker of the House. I will respect your authority. I had the 
opportunity to act as deputy speaker of the National Assembly on 
a temporary basis and I know it is not always easy to ensure 
that the rules are adhered to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy to be once again the member for Champlain, which 
is one of the greatest ridings in Quebec and even Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The riding of Champlain covers 30,000 square kilometres. It is 
as big as some countries in Europe. The riding of Champlain is 
extremely varied. It goes from the river all the way up north. 
Its population is scattered across a territory which includes 
communities such as Champlain and La Tuque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to thank all my constituents for the 
trust they showed in me by re-electing me. I was an MPP from 1976 
to 1984 with the team of René Lévesque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also Indians in my riding, including the Attikamek, 
north of La Tuque. I take this opportunity to particularly thank 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As everybody may know, I was elected in Champlain with a 
majority of 15 votes. I am the only member whose majority has 
doubled within a week since, after the recount, it went from 
7 to 15 votes. It is not much, but I got all the Bloc votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is wrong to say that the Bloc has lost some of its 
popularity, because in my riding the Bloc vote went from 43% to 
46%. If a Conservative candidate had run in Champlain, as was 
the case during the last election, I would have had the same 
majority as my predecessor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A 15 vote majority shows that we are not independent here. As 
members, we must devote ourselves to the people. Every time 
someone tells me “Marcel, I voted for you”, I thank him and say 
“Thank you, it is thanks to you that I was elected”. I had to 
wait 10 days, and I was increasingly aware of how important one 
vote is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One may wonder why people did not get more involved than they 
did during the last election.  The answer is that the election 
was not necessary. Every journalist said so. This election was 
meant to allow the Prime Minister, not so much to set a record, 
but to get what he wanted. 
If people had felt this election was necessary, they would have 
gone out and voted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What brought me back into politics is, to a certain degree, the 
arrogance of the Liberal Party, the arrogance of the government. 
I believe it has given ample proof, in the past, that it ignores 
Quebec, among others. And it still does. The throne speech is 
another example of how it ignores us. 
It continues to intrude into areas of provincial jurisdiction, 
as is the case in Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last parliament, this government introduced 
contemptuous and offensive bills. I am thinking of Bill C-20 for 
example. I am also thinking of another bill that is coming back, 
the one to amend the Young Offenders Act. They government is 
always trying to interfere in areas that come under the 
jurisdiction of Quebec and the other provinces, and by doing so, 
in my opinion, it shows contempt for the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came back to politics when I was invited to do so, because I 
wanted to add my voice to the voice of all the Bloc Quebecois 
members who defend Quebec's interests. I want to tell this 
government that one day it will have to stop laughing at the 
people of Quebec. I believe in Quebec's sovereignty. 
At 64 years of age, I plan to use all the energy I have left to 
ensure that we achieve sovereignty as fast as we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a people in Quebec, even if the Liberal government 
across the way does not acknowledge it. We are a people. We have 
the right to emancipation. We have a right over our territory. 
The very existence of this people is being denied. This is what 
brought me back to politics, and I intend to say so as often as 
I can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I am concerned, Quebec sovereignty in not against 
anybody, it is for Quebec and for the people of Quebec. Our 
development does not mean we have to take anything away from 
others. We want everything we deserve as founding people, as a 
people who had to fight to survive in the Americas, which 
includes 400 millions anglophones and allophones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>European artists who come here are constantly congratulating us 
for the energy we have shown in surviving as francophones in 
North America. Maybe the natural wealth of Quebec is its 
distinct people, which is like no other, a people which has the 
right to live and the right to possess its own territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This people is the francophones, the Quebecers, not only the 
francophones but the whole people of Quebec, all of its 7 
million inhabitants, who have the right to have their own 
territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a Quebecer, I have had enough of seeing my government having 
to beg for what it is owed. I find it insulting that to get the 
money we are entitled to, money paid with our own taxes, we have 
to kowtow. It is insulting to be forced to resort to see overlap 
in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take, for example, the millennium scholarships. This is 
our money. Education is Quebec's jurisdiction and a jurisdiction 
of other provinces as well. This money belongs to us. 
The government has spent millions of dollars to intrude into 
Quebec's jurisdiction. Worse, Quebec has been placed under 
trusteeship. A certain Jean Monty, for whom we have not voted 
and who has never been elected, has been appointed to administer 
the millennium scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Two million and a half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon:</B> Someone said two million and a half. 
Such things explain why Quebec wants sovereignty. Not 
sovereignty against others but for us, and possibly with others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having in Quebec a strong and proud people, a people that fought 
for its survival and will continue to do so, does not deprive 
others of anything. That will not be taken away from them. 
Sovereignty is in the heart of Quebecers. There are latent 
periods. The government can pass whatever legislation it wants, 
raise the percentage required to reach it, but I can assure you 
that one day Quebec will be sovereign.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when the hon. member opposite talks about a distinct 
Quebec people, does he talk about English speaking people like 
me, who live in Quebec? Does he talk about aboriginal people in 
northern Quebec? Does he talk about Chinese and Indian people 
who live in Quebec? I wonder whether it is true that the Quebec 
people is comprised of people of all origins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, yes, Quebec belongs 
to Quebecers. I believe in Mr. René 
Lévesque's version. I think no one would deny Mr. Lévesque's 
great intelligence and respect for democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, a Quebecer is a Quebecer, no matter which 
language he or she speaks. It is someone who lives in Quebec, 
who pays his or her taxes in Quebec and who has the right to 
vote in Quebec. Quebecers of all origins are well treated. I 
think, for instance, of English speaking people who live in 
Quebec and I am proud of this. They have universities, schools, 
hospitals and services. I am proud of this, and I am one of 
those who would defend them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the majority of people living on the Quebec territory are 
French speaking, we want French to be the first official 
language. This takes absolutely nothing away from the others. It 
would however allow us to grow and to continue growing, in 
association with the rest of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I 
respond to my colleague, the member for Champlain, I would like 
to tell my Liberal colleague that the members opposite should be 
careful when they talk about such sensitive issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Secretary of State for Amateur Sport once said, speaking of 
our former colleague, Osvaldo Nunez, a Chilean-born Canadian and 
Quebecer, that immigrants with such sovereignist affiliation 
ought to be deported, because they are not worthy of the 
Canadian citizenship. Such comments from over there would be far 
better left unsaid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to greet and congratulate my new colleague, the 
member for Champlain, not only on his speech, but also on 
winning his seat following a fight to the finish against a very 
big Liberal organization. 
His riding just like mine, which border the Prime Minister's 
riding, were real targets. We had many visitors, in particular 
the minister and member for Outremont and the Minister for 
International Trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Champlain won by a slight majority but 
brilliantly.  Already he has shown us how much he believes in 
sovereignty, a cause he also served in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me seize this opportunity to ask him to say a few words 
about Cap-de-la-Madeleine, the main municipality in his riding, 
which will be celebrating its 350th anniversary this year.  I am 
proud to say that my father presided over the celebrations for 
the 300th anniversary, in 1951, as president of the organizing 
committee.  Cap-de-la-Madeleine has played a very important role in 
the history of Quebec and America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, indeed I should have mentioned in 
my speech that this year will 
mark the 350th anniversary of Cap-de-la-Madeleine. It is not just 
one city's celebration, it is a celebration for all of us. It is 
the beginning of our colony and it touches all of us on both 
sides of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to invite people to come to 
Cap-de-la-Madeleine to revisit the past and, while they are there, 
they can tour the whole Mauricie area, which is the forestry 
capital of Canada for 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I intend to ask the member for Saint-Maurice to co-operate with us 
to fund these activities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I very much appreciate the 
opportunity to speak today to the throne speech.  It is a very 
important document in setting out the blueprint for the 
government's mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly take this opportunity to congratulate you, Mr. 
Speaker, because I know you will bring great decorum to the 
House.  I appreciate very much the fact that you are in the 
chair.  I also indicate that I am sharing my time with the hon. 
member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac.  We will hear from him in a 
short while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the residents and constituents of Waterloo—Wellington 
and show my gratitude to them in terms of my re-election.  I go 
on record as well and thank the Governor General, and Mr. Saul 
for that matter, for the throne speech and what was contained in 
it.  As I said at the outset, it outlined the blueprint of the 
Government of Canada over the course of its mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people spoke on November 27 and gave our government, a 
government of decency, respect and integrity, another mandate 
into the 21st century.  As a result of that sweeping mandate we 
can now govern accordingly.  That is in the best interests of all 
Canadians wherever they may be in this great country of ours, 
north, south, east or west.  It is appropriate that we proceed on 
that basis, knowing that we govern on behalf of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was slightly distressed when I read not long ago that the 
members for Okanagan—Shuswap and Wild Rose attended a western 
separatist meeting.  That is offensive when we really think about 
it in terms of our great country.  Even more offensive was the 
fact that the Leader of the Opposition did not take the time to 
condemn that kind of treachery.  I think he should have, but then 
we are on the road to seeing the kinds of things he is prepared 
to do such as spending $800,000 of taxpayer money.  It is tough 
to take when we hear from him time and time again about good 
fiscal responsibility and good fiscal order.  Here we have a 
person who could have settled for $60,000 and instead spent 
$800,000 when all the legal fees were added up.  It is quite 
remarkable.  I have to say that my constituents resent the 
hypocrisy contained therein. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of hypocrisy, we have the member for Edmonton North.  I 
was reminded not long ago of the pig buttons and pig noises that 
we heard in the House, which came mostly from her; the pigs out 
on the front lawn of parliament; and all the kinds of things that 
took place.  Here the high priestess of principle herself flip 
flops and with the duplicity of only what a contortionist could 
do is now back into a pension plan that she condemned so totally, 
so outrageously and so egregiously.  It really is, and my 
constituents share this view, hard to take from that party 
opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get to the throne speech.  It is important to note that 
we have set out a blueprint in keeping with the government's 
commitment to the people of Canada.  I re-emphasize here and now 
that it emphasizes our commitment to opportunity for all.  I do 
not mean for a few folks, or for people in certain geographic 
areas, but for everyone across the country.  It underscores the 
commitment of the government to work for, to build and to lead 
into the new economy, and to ensure in the process that our 
communities are safe and secure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan of action we have set out will allow Canadian men, 
women and children, for that matter, because we especially had 
emphasis in that regard, the very best country we can possibly 
give them.  That too is in keeping with what we have said all 
along, and the Canadian people quite frankly agreed with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the great endorsement on election day we are 
proud to proceed on the achievements we made in the first two 
mandates.  Even more important, we intend to fulfil the 
commitments we made in our election platform and proceed in that 
manner with opportunity for all.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The overriding goal is to secure Canada's place as one of the 
most innovative nations in the world.  Why settle for second best 
when we can take charge and widen the circle of social and 
economic inclusion?  In this way all Canadians can benefit from 
the economic rewards that are flowing and will continue to flow, 
and can share in the great future that is ours for the taking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since taking office in 1993 we have worked hard step by step, 
sometimes more incremental than other times, but we have worked 
consistently.  We have worked hard to build a strong economy and 
a solid social foundation so that Canada can enjoy excellence and 
prosperity and an even higher quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our plan is simply to create a very smart, focused and practical 
plan that ensures a bright future for all Canadians.  We want to 
create and share opportunity for everyone who can partake.  We 
want to include everyone in this great endeavour and leave no one 
behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister, cabinet and our caucus have repeatedly said 
that in the process we will make Canada the most innovative and 
entrepreneurial nation in the world, a land of endless 
opportunity for the best and brightest, not only to stay here but 
to be attracted here as a result of new investments, ventures, 
ideas and talent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do this, and I am convinced we will, can and must, we will 
enhance our unmatched quality of life by building a more 
inclusive society, one in which all share the opportunities I 
have spoken of and in which no Canadian is left behind.  In such 
a society we all work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan for our third mandate is to build a world leading 
Canadian economy driven by ideas and talent.  We plan to create a 
more inclusive society where there is quality health service and 
where children get the right start in life.  All of that will be 
available to individuals and families who can enjoy strong, safe 
and secure communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We plan to ensure a clean, healthy environment for Canadians. We 
need more and more to redouble our efforts in this area to 
preserve what is ours by nature and what we need to do as good

</I></B></P><P align=left>As Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General I would like 
to emphasize the feeling of safety in our communities and its 
importance to Canadians wherever they live.  Feeling secure in 
our homes, our neighbourhoods, our communities and our streets is 
a fundamental right for all Canadians.  Taking action to protect 
this fundamental obligation of government is very important.  We 
have lived up to this obligation over the last number of years 
with what I believe to be a firm hand and innovative solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have taken a balanced approach, which is very important.  It 
underscores the commitment of the government to ensure that it 
always proceeds in a balanced way.  As a result, it is fair to 
say that Canadians have confidence in what the government is 
doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me review some of the things we have done.  We have 
tightened up rules for early parole hearings.  We have made it 
possible to obtain DNA samples from suspects of crime involving 
physical violence.  We have cracked down on child prostitution 
and child sex tourism.  We have introduced amendments to the 
criminal code that will strengthen the voice of victims of crime 
in the justice system.  These are all important things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take as an example the national strategy of community 
safety and crime prevention and the money we have pumped into it 
to ensure that prevention is the order of the day.  Let us look 
at the innovative youth justice strategy that we will soon 
reintroduce in terms of the Young Offenders Act.  The act will be 
reworked for the benefit of all Canadians, and especially for our 
young people, to ensure not only prevention and consequences but 
rehabilitation as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's anti-smuggling initiative has resulted in 
17,000 smuggling related charges in excess of $113 million and 
another $118 million in evaded taxes and duties.

appointment as Deputy Speaker of the House and to extend my 
congratulations to the Speaker on his election as well. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with both pride and humility that I rise for the first 
time in this historic place as member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac. 
The voters in my riding put their trust in me. I have already 
promised them and I promise them again today that I will work 
hard for them day in and day out. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The riding of Beauséjour—Petitcodiac is almost a microcosm of 
our country.  As I found out in the last campaign it is 
geographically vast, almost evenly divided between French and English 
speakers, and is a mixture of rural and urban communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not the first member of my family to serve this riding.  My 
father was the member for Westmorland—Kent for 12 years. 
Standing in the House today I am more conscious than ever of the 
big shoes I have to fill. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And it is with a great deal of emotion that I realize that I 
occupy the same seat that my father did for 12 years or so 
in this House. I thank all my family, particularly my mother, my 
father and my sister, Geneviève. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My father is not the only one of my family to serve in the 
House.  My great-great-grandfather, George Elliott Casey, was 
elected in 1872 at 22 years of age.  Like me, he was the youngest 
member of his caucus at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not mention another of my 
predecessors as member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac.  The Prime 
Minister served my riding from 1990 to 1993.  During part of that 
time I worked for the then leader of the opposition in his 
office.  I had graduated from law school and had been called to 
the New Brunswick bar.  The Prime Minister gave me the 
opportunity to see how our government works up close.  I used to 
watch from up there in the gallery.  I must say the view from 
down here is considerably better. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will never forget the opportunity given to me by the Prime 
Minister. If I am here today, it is mainly thanks to him. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to make mention of the hon. member for 
Moncton—Riverview—Dieppe, the Minister of Labour.  She holds 
the riding next to mine.  Over the past few years she has been a 
good friend, a staunch ally and a mentor, both publicly and 
privately.  Her 30 year commitment to her community and her 
commitment to social justice and economic development stand as an 
inspiration to all of us. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also thank the Minister of Labour for her help during my 
campaign. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The campaign was perhaps a bit longer for me than for other hon. 
members.  I had hoped to be here in 1997.  I had campaigned to be 
here then and I fought hard, but I came in second.  I am a little 
late, but better late than never. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, my deepest gratitude goes to my constituents. The

generosity and warmth.

Donald Savoie, once told me that in Atlantic Canada we have three 
economies: a seasonal resource based economy largely in rural

itself to new technologies and to a new economy, and some areas 
where virtually no functioning economy exists at all. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that we have to solve these problems ourselves, but we 
also know that we need a federal commitment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

Atlantic investment partnership, a fund that will help keep our 
young people from having to seek jobs elsewhere.

future for themselves here at home. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Atlantic region has also seen over the past year a crisis in 
the fishery.  The integration of native fishermen into the 
commercial fishery has been difficult to say the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Behind the headlines, however, is a story of co-operation and 
goodwill on both sides.  This is the result of the tremendous 
efforts of fishermen, both native and non-native, and the strong 
leadership of the current Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  The 
minister's steady hand and commitment to conservation has earned 
him the confidence of all stakeholders.  People of goodwill 
support the minister's efforts to enact a set of conservation 
rules that will apply equally to all fishermen.

the threat of dissolution, when francophones and anglophones in

really feel a strong sense that this is a country that is united 
and united in its sense of compassion in all corners of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made reference to the proposed changes to employment 
insurance.  He said that that the changes would have quite an 
impact on his riding.  For the benefit of all Canadians, I wonder 
if he could elaborate on that a little bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dominic LeBlanc:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his comments and his good wishes.  The changes to employment 
insurance that were made a number of years ago had some positive 
elements, for example, the conversion of weeks to hours as a 
method of qualifying for benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In New Brunswick alone, 87% of the people work more than a 35 
hour week.  With the changes that the government made, all those 
weeks now go toward qualifying for employment insurance benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side believe in incentives for work but we do not 
believe in punishing people who work in seasonal industries. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member for Madawaska—Restigouche, has often 
told me, and he is right, that in Canada there are no seasonal 
workers, only seasonal industries. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fundamental difference that we must understand is that there 
are no seasonal workers in Atlantic Canada.  There are seasonal 
industries such as the fishery, tourism and agriculture. These 
industries have been unjustly affected by the intensity rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a very important measure that the Prime Minister 
undertook when he visited my colleague's riding during the 
election in Belledune in northern New Brunswick.  He made it 
clear at that time that the changes which had been introduced in 
parliament before the election to eliminate the intensity rule 
would be reintroduced as a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister kept that promise.  Bill C-2 was the first 
substantive piece of legislation introduced in this parliament 
and the changes, as the Prime Minister had committed, will be 
retroactive to October 1, 2000.

hope, with the co-operation of other members of the House, that 
the legislation will pass quickly. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

into effect. I intend to vote and to encourage the government so

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here in the 37th 
parliament and to make my first speech.  I will be dealing 
primarily with agriculture as it pertains to the Speech from the 
Throne, and my reply to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly in the time that I have I will not have time to talk 
exhaustively about all the issues but I will deal with some of 
them.  I would also like to share my time with the member for 
South Surrey—White Rock—Langley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I am pleased that I had the support of my constituents of 
Selkirk—Interlake.  I intend to repay them with diligence and 
hard work while I am down here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal with the Speech from the Throne in a positive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farm groups and farmers across the country have given many 
good suggestions to the agriculture minister and the government. 
I will go into some of those suggestions in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farm community has had a reaction to the fact that 
agricultural issues were not dealt with in the throne speech nor 
by subsequent Liberal members during debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bruce Johnstone, a writer for the Regina </I>Leader Post<I>, 
summed up how the farmers feel about the throne speech.  He said 
that it set a new low for “vacuity, fatuity, banality and 
inanity”.  He went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will help Canada's agricultural sector move beyond 
crisis management—leading to more genuine diversification and 
value-added growth, new investments and employment, better land 
use, and high standards of environmental stewardship and food 
safety. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also pointed out that all the Liberals had to offer were 
empty election promises of more farm aid bromides about the need 
to diversify and add value and a lot of hot air.  He concluded by 
quoting another author.  He said, and I have heard the same from 
farmers in Ontario and in the west, “This high-sounding rhetoric 
is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying 
nothing”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, that is exactly how the farmers feel about the 
throne speech.  Agriculture is having a real income crisis.  It 
absolutely needs an immediate injection of additional cash over 
and above the farm safety net programs.  Farmers are asking for 
that because the farm net safety program of AIDA, agriculture 
income disaster assistance, left out so many farmers with little 
or no assistance whatsoever.  Farmers, whose family income from 
the farm is well below the $20,000 mark, are actually living in 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the groups that have come to Ottawa to protest and put 
forward suggestions have had meetings with the agriculture 
minister, but I would like to reiterate some of the things that 
have been said so that it gets recorded in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start off by reporting first on the farmers from a town 
in my area called Beausejour.  They told me that their backs were 
finally against the wall and that they had done their best.  They 
said that they had done everything by way of diversification and 
efficiency but that they wanted me to report to the government 
that they needed a program which would deliver aid quickly, 
efficiently and without a big administrative expense.  Their 
request, which was in the neighbourhood of $50 an acre, was what 
they felt they needed.  I would like that passed along to the 
agriculture minister.  I am not talking party policy here, but I 
am telling the House what farmers out there are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The western barley growers is another good example of a farm 
group that has been in contact with the agriculture minister. 
They say that there are several areas of opportunity for 
government to assist agriculture without direct subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of these things were put forward by the Canadian Alliance 
also: removal of the excise tax on fuel used by producers in off 
road use; removal of the excise tax on fuel used by the railways 
to haul grain; review of the Grain Transportation Act to ensure 
that the cost savings, which were envisioned by the Estey 
commission, were actually delivered to producers; review of user 
fees; and a review of government regulations to ensure that only 
those which are required to market Canada's agriculture 
production remain in force.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario corn producers have asked for money over and above 
the current safety net commitment, to be administered by the 
provinces.  Once again, safety net programs have failed them. The 
grain growers of Canada are asking for an immediate infusion of 
public funds to restore equity between levels of direct income 
supports for grain and oilseed producers in Canada versus those 
in the United States.  This is an issue of parity.  They estimate 
that would work out to between $1.5 billion to $2 billion 
nationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a large sum, but let us remember that we all have to 
eat.  It is in Canada's national interest that we have a viable 
agriculture and are able for the most part to supply ourselves 
with the majority of food we eat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Federation of Agriculture has requested $900 
million in additional farm aid over the next three years.  Once 
again it has identified that the agricultural policies the 
Liberal government has brought out over the past seven years have 
failed farmers in Ontario and across the country and need to be 
addressed in an emergency fashion, as opposed to the long term, 
efficient, effective program that should have been put in place 
by the government in these last seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While these requests sound like a lot of money, once again I say 
that they are for emergency use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saskatchewan rally group was here.  That group was also 
talking in terms of $25 to $80 an acre.  It is now talking about 
a plan similar to the one in the province of Quebec, where the 
cost of production is actually the basis on which farm support is 
provided.  While that would be a lot of money across the country, 
we cannot have farmers producing food and working like serfs and 
slaves for the whole country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own province, Keystone Agricultural Producers had its 
annual meeting, which I was happy to attend, and came up with a 
suggestion.  Those producers said that they have identified to 
the government that a 1% food tax should be looked at.  That is 
another suggestion the government could look at.  They also made 
a suggestion for alternate land use services.  That would be a 
20% land set-aside over nine years, with payments being made for 
the land that is set aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years, besides the immediate cash injection and the 
long term safety net program, the Canadian Alliance has talked 
about tax reduction.  We have talked about harmonizing with the 
United States in regard to the use of chemicals so that there is 
no interference in trade with our big trading partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many things the government could do.  The 
suggestions have all been put before the government.  It is the 
duty and it is the responsibility of the government to address 
this crisis in agriculture income, part of which was of the 
government's making, and it is the government's fault for having 
let it occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the agriculture minister and the Prime Minister listen to 
farmers and farm groups and deal with this issue before spring 
seeding. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member opposite knows very well that 
one of the reasons why the benefits got out so slowly in the AIDA 
program is that the terms of dispensing those benefits were 
determined by the provinces.  It was a shared program.  The 
provinces did not want to put up the money any faster than they 
could help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, all the member can really talk about is spending money. 
It is amazing that the party opposite is willing to spend 
billions on a problem.  When the member talks about $80 an acre, 
he is talking about farms of 10,000 acres as an average.  That is 
$80,000 a farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there is a crisis in the west.  We know there is a 
crisis in Ontario, even in my own riding.  The real reason for it 
is the unfair subsidies that are occurring in the United States. 
The member opposite did not even mention that.  He knows that is 
the root of the problem.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this past week, our Prime Minister, when talking to the 
President of the United States, said to the president that he has 
to do something about these unfair subsidies because he needs our 
energy, so he has to fix the farm crisis.  That is a better fix 
than simply asking for more and more money.  We have to do 
something with the Americans and we have the Prime Minister who 
has the credibility to do that something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will quickly reply. 
Finally the Prime Minister has taken up the suggestion that I put 
forward to the 36th parliament, which was for the Liberals to get 
off their Liberal butts, talk to our partners there and get rid 
of the subsidies that are causing the distortion of production. 
The proof is in </I>Hansard<I>.  We could have the clerk bring it 
forward right now and I could prove that.  The Prime Minister has 
finally taken my advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing I will say is in regard to the AIDA 
administration and is a strange fact.  Some provinces administer 
the AIDA program and process the applications by themselves and 
in some places the federal government does it.  Where the federal 
government is doing it, in Manitoba and in Saskatchewan for 
example, the applications are processed more slowly and the 
payouts are much lower.  Where the provinces are administering 
the program, it is done much more quickly and the farmers get 
their money more quickly, so what the member said is not too

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to have the 
opportunity to share some thoughts with the Chamber.  We have 
decided that the theme of today from the official opposition is 
regional interests.  As a member from British Columbia, I am 
delighted to bring some of the concerns that British Columbia has 
with the direction that the government is planning to take and 
has shown in the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be addressing the omissions from the throne speech, the 
things that it did not address.  There are a number of concerns 
that British Columbians have.  One of the main concerns is the 
high level of taxation, both on a personal level and a business 
level, which prevents us from being competitive with our American 
partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia's economy is very much a partnership with the 
United States, as much as it is with Canada, so the high level of 
taxation that interferes with our relationship is certainly 
something we are concerned about.  The brain drain that is 
happening, the loss of our medical people to the United States 
because of taxation reasons, all of these are concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area of great concern to us is the low Canadian dollar. 
It affects each and every one of us, not just people in British 
Columbia.  Part of the reason gas prices are so high is that the 
gas is bought and sold in American dollars so we automatically 
are paying half again as much as our American counterparts who 
are buying it.  The low Canadian dollar causes people in my 
constituency and in British Columbia great concern and we see 
nothing from the government that indicates it plans to do 
anything about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the fact that for whatever reasons, and I will not go 
into what the reasons might be, we in western Canada and 
particularly in British Columbia feel that there is no support 
from the federal government.  We have urban transit issues that 
need to be addressed and we do not seem to be getting any support 
from the federal government for that kind of program.  We have 
trade issues that are very much a concern, softwood lumber being 
the most recent, and we do not see a commitment from the federal 
government to represent the interests of our region in these 
negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something as simple as the trade centre.  When Toronto 
wanted to redevelop its harbour to make it more aesthetically 
pleasing and to offer something to the community with their trade 
and convention centre, the federal government was there to assist 
them.  However, when Vancouver wants to develop a trade and 
convention centre to improve its harbour, the federal government 
is not there.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wonder why there is this inequity?  Why is it that a city in 
the east with the same type of project gets the support and a 
city in the west does not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of all these issues, the one that causes us the gravest concern 
is the government's lack of respect for the people of British 
Columbia.  It is indicated in many ways.  Some of them are very 
apparent, some are not.  That lack of respect also plays out here 
in that British Columbia is under represented in the House of 
Commons.  Our population deserves a greater representation in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned that there is a lack of understanding that 
Canada has changed its dimensions since Confederation in 1867. It 
is not okay to leave things the way they are.  It is not okay to 
continue to not respect the fact that there has been a massive 
change in the population in this country.  It is not okay to 
continue to have British Columbia under represented, not only in 
the House but in the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia was recognized by the House a number of years 
ago as a distinct region.  Canada now has five distinct regions 
as recognized by the House of Commons.  However, that is not 
taken any further than a piece of paper in </I>Hansard<I>.  One of 
the smaller Atlantic provinces has 10 members in the Senate and 
British Columbia, the third largest province, has six 
representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A province which is recognized as a unique and a distinct 
region, different from the rest of the country, has six members, 
while Atlantic Canada has thirty-two members, as a distinct 
region.  Ontario has 24 members as a distinct region, as do the 
province of Quebec and the prairie provinces as distinct regions. 
There is something wrong when British Columbia, the third largest 
province, is shown such disregard for its true place in 
Confederation, our true place in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lack of respect for the changes that have taken 
place.  The country is different now, some 130 years later, than 
it was in the beginning.  We need to recognize there is a 
different dimension.  We have a very multicultural community on 
the west coast which is not recognized by government policies. 
There has to be a willingness for the members of Confederation to 
sit down and start looking at what is appropriate going into the 
21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbians want to see a willingness to accept the fact 
that British Columbia is the third largest province, that is 
unique and that it has a lot to offer Canada as far as ideas and 
participation.  There should be more interest shown by the 
federal government to include British Columbians in what happens 
in the country.  We feel that not only through distance but 
through attitude there is an unwillingness of the government to 
recognize the contributions of people in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that its omission in the Speech from the Throne was not 
deliberate.  I hope the Liberal government will be willing over 
the next for our five years, a mandate given to it by the people 
of Canada, to show the people of British Columbia that it truly 
wants our participation, that it truly recognizes our place in 
Canada and that it will seriously look after the inequities of 
representation in both the House of Commons and in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbians would like to see signs of willingness by the 
government, not just talk, to recognize and acknowledge British 
Columbians as equals in Confederation.  When that happens we will 
feel that we are a respected member of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Speech from the Throne that was not apparent and was 
missing.  I hope that efforts will be made by the government 
in the very near future to show British Columbians that it was an 
omission, that it was not aware of some of these considerations 
and concerns and that it is sorry and will do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hoping it was only a big mistake.  I hope there will be 
signs in the future days ahead that British Columbians can feel 
respected and wanted members of this confederation.
