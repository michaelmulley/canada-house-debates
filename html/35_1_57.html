	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State 
(Parliamentary Affairs)): </B>Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing 
Order 36(8), I have the honour to table, in both official 
languages, the government's response to certain petitions.

	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs): </B>Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in this House today to provide information to my hon. 
colleagues on a subject we all care about, and that is the 
opportunities the Department of National Defence will provide 
young Canadians to receive officer training in the Canadian 
forces, in a fully bilingual Canadian military college.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I promised the hon. member for Roberval some weeks ago, 
when there was topical questioning as a result of the budget and 
the closing of the Collège militaire in St. Jean, Quebec, that 
within a number of weeks I would make a progress report to the 
House to let members know what the Department of National 
Defence is doing to ensure the bilingual nature of the military 
college system once there is consolidation at Kingston.
<P>
	Tomorrow I shall be appearing before the Senate finance 
committee. I understand the prime focus for the questioning on 
that date has to do with the collège militaire and its closing. I felt 
it was only courteous to members of the House that I make a 
statement in my own Chamber to let the House know how our 
thinking has evolved before I went to the Senate committee.
<P>
	The amalgamation of our three military colleges into a single 
institution has been dictated by both budgetary constraints and 
the operational requirements of the Canadian forces. Since 1989 
the strength of the officer corps of the regular force has been 
declining. As a result of the 1994 budget the number of officers 
will continue  to decrease until 1998. Thus the number of cadets 
in military colleges will obviously be reduced from the current 
level of about 1,600 to about 900. A single college will therefore 
be sufficient to meet our needs.
<P>
	Once we have one military college it will have to be fully 
bilingual for two reasons. First, our college must accommodate 
young Canadians from all regions of Canada, whatever their 
first official language. Not only must these young Canadians 
know they are welcome in their military college; they must feel 
at home there. Second, the principle of equality of the status of 
the official languages as well as the spirit of the Official 
Languages Act require us to ensure that the training of officers is 
carried out in both official languages.
<P>
	Bilingual training is also important because our officer corps 
must be able to command personnel from both linguistic groups. 
It was therefore recently decided that beginning in academic 
year 1996-97 all graduates of the Canadian military college 
must be functionally bilingual. I shall return to this point in a 
few moments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The establishment of a fully bilingual military college is 
typical of the challenges we face in Canada. Among our goals is 
to promote relationships based on respect for differences as well 
as harmony and co-operation in the name of a common cause: to 
serve and protect Canada. The Department of National Defence 
has taken on this challenge willingly. My department has 
developed both a transition plan for the period from 1994 to 
1997 and a plan to make the Royal Military College in Kingston 
fully bilingual.
<P>
	As part of the transition plan measures will be put in place to 
ensure the replacement of the programs currently offered by the 
three military colleges by the end of the 1996-97 academic year. 
We are also considering several options to replace, starting in 
1995-96, the qualifying year offered by the Collège militaire 
royal de Saint-Jean, in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	At the same time, the Department of National Defence is 
developing a plan to make the Royal Military College fully 
bilingual. Here is an outline of this plan. The Royal Military 
College is already partially bilingual, the science and 
engineering curriculum having been taught in both official 
languages for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3480"> 3480 </A></B>
<P>
many years. Both French and English have also been used for a 
long time in daily activities, alternating from week to week.
<P>
	The plan national defence officials are presently working on 
is geared toward making the Royal Military College fully 
bilingual and creating an environment where young 
francophones and anglophones will be motivated to study to 
become bilingual officers of the Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	This plan will have an impact on the four pillars of the 
Canadian military college system, namely academic training, 
the military training plan, sports and physical fitness, as well as 
second language skills. It will apply to the directing staff and the 
officer cadets and affect administrative support and all aspects 
of the daily operations of the college.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As part of the rationalization of our military college system 
all academic programs that are retained will be offered to new 
entrants in both official languages. To meet this objective 
college commandants and principals are currently assessing 
francophone and anglophone staffing requirements, both 
military and civilian.
<P>
	Because the level of bilingualism demanded of the Royal 
Military College graduates has been raised, increased emphasis 
will be placed on the day to day use of both French and English 
at the college. Cadets who need to upgrade their second 
language skills will take summer language training in an 
appropriate linguistic setting.
<P>
	The bilingual nature of the college will be enhanced by the 
simple fact that the cadet population at RMC will soon be 30 per 
cent francophone and 70 per cent anglophone, as compared to 
the current breakdown of 17 per cent and 83 per cent 
respectively.
<P>
	As for the military staff, the commandant is already working 
with personnel staff in Ottawa to ensure that the staff 
composition of the college reflects its requirements.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It must be pointed out that in July Brigadier General Charles 
Émond, who is the current commanding officer of the Collège 
militaire royal de Saint-Jean, will be taking on his new duties as 
commanding officer of our new centralized military college.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In other words the commandant at the Collège militaire de 
Saint-Jean, Québec, Brigadier General Charles Émond, will 
move to the Royal Military College in Kingston to ensure the 
smooth transition to one college system and that the bilingual 
presence will be maintained.
<P>
	I draw this to the attention of members on the other side of the 
House, especially my friends in the Bloc Quebecois because 
they were most concerned about the consolidation into one 
college at Kingston. I have great confidence that General 
Émond, the commandant now at CMR, will be able to realize our 
goals in making the Royal Military College in Kingston a truly 
proud bilingual institution all of us will admire.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Brigadier General Émond graduated from the Collège 
militaire royal and received a diploma from the RMC. We are 
counting on him to make our new college continue to reflect the 
National Defence vision of bilingualism among Canadian 
Forces officers.
<P>
	I will now outline in greater detail the bilingual officer corps 
concept within the Canadian forces. This concept was adopted 
by the Armed Forces Council on June 28, 1988. It met the senior 
officers' need to lead their subordinates in both official 
languages.
<P>
	This concept is now being studied by a special joint task force 
made up of representatives of National Defence and of the 
Commissioner of Official Languages. We intend to refine this 
concept and resolve the issues raised by the Commissioner 
during our consultations.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	Our goal is to establish the following policy: effective 
January 1, 1998, all officers promoted to the rank of 
Lieutenant-Colonel will normally have to be bilingual. I already 
mentioned this fact during oral question period in this House.
<P>
	The steps taken to offer second-language training to 
francophone and anglophone officers are part of the Official 
Languages Program of the Department of National Defence. 
This program is based in part on the 1988 Official Languages 
Act and contains the following elements: language of work, 
equitable participation, communications with the public, 
service delivery and language training.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	First, with regard to language of work, we have adopted a 
special model that takes into account our unique environment 
and the organizational arrangements needed to achieve 
bilingualism within the Department of National Defence and 
Canadian forces. The second element is equitable participation.
<P>
	In 1992 a detailed review of the linguistic designation of 
every unit and every position revealed that much still has to be 
done to increase the number of bilingual anglophones in the 
military.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To examine the participation rate of francophones within the 
Canadian Forces, we undertook a comprehensive analysis of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3481"> 3481 </A></B>
<P>
recruitment, enrolment, promotion and attrition rates of officers 
and non-commissioned members in the last 15 to 20 years.
<P>
	This review of all ranks and military occupations ended in 
December 1992. It found that, by and large, the goal of equitable 
participation was reached except in three out of 135 military 
occupations.
<P>
	The third element of the Official Languages Program deals 
with communications with and service to the public. Our 
personnel co-operate on a continuing basis with Treasury Board 
Secretariat officials to ensure that the Department of National 
Defence honours the spirit of official languages regulations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	At present, second language training is provided in house. In 
an effort to rationalize the program, senior staff of my 
department together with representatives of the Public Service 
Commission and Treasury Board are looking at the feasibility of 
transferring our second language training to the Public Service 
Commission.
<P>
	As for the more general criticisms directed at us by the 
Commissioner of Official Languages, rest assured that my 
department will continue to improve its performance. Let me 
underscore three areas I have just covered, namely our blueprint 
for a fully bilingual military college, the concept of an effective 
bilingual officer corps and the study aimed at improving the 
efficiency of our second language training.
<P>
	These three initiatives are striking examples of just how 
seriously the Department of National Defence considers the 
question of official languages. We will continue to work within 
the framework of the Official Languages Act and its associated 
policies. We will continue to work closely with the 
Commissioner of Official Languages.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I hope I have convinced my colleagues that we are striving to 
make the Canadian armed forces as a whole better reflect the 
Canadian reality. I also hope to have assured them that the doors 
of the new Canadian military college, one of the main paths to a 
career as an officer in the Canadian Forces, are wide open to all 
qualified candidates, be they anglophones or francophones.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As Minister of National Defence I am proud to be part of the 
creation of this bilingual military college. Indeed we can all take 
pride in this initiative, for our military college will be a unique 
institution, one that mirrors the linguistic duality of our country. 
It will welcome young Canadians, our leaders of tomorrow, 
regardless of their province or their territory of origin.
<P>
	Before I sit down I would like to apologize to the critics 
opposite. I am not sure they received sufficient notice of my 
statement. I think they got an hour or two, but they were most 
gracious in letting me go forward with the statement today.
<P>
	I would like to mention for the member for Charlesbourg who 
arrived just as I was beginning that one of the reasons for 
making the statement today is that I felt it was only courteous to 
give these comments to the House of Commons. Tomorrow I 
will be appearing before the Senate committee on finance where 
I understand I will be questioned most rigorously on the closing 
of the military college and the future of our military colleges.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg):</B> First of all, Madam 
Speaker, I was planning to point out to the minister the delay in 
informing us of the time he was to deliver his speech, but I 
accept his apologies.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	I am pleased to speak once again on this issue of burning 
importance to Quebec, that is the closure of the Collège 
militaire de Saint-Jean and the decision to use only one college, 
Kingston's Royal Military College, for the future training of 
officers. The closure of the Collège militaire de Saint-Jean has 
never been justified, either for cost cutting reasons, or because 
of the need to reduce the size of the military. Nor has the 
government demonstrated that the military college in Kingston 
is capable of taking up the slack.
<P>
	I have no doubt that the minister is being sincere and is 
making efforts in this area, but despite the speech that he just 
delivered this morning, I think that we have to be realistic. The 
Official Languages Act was around long before this Liberal 
government took office. RMC, the Collège militaire de 
Saint-Jean and Royal Roads Military College should have been 
bilingual and operating in both languages for a number of years 
by now. Based on the information we have and according to the 
criticisms of official languages pointed out by the minister, we 
know for a fact that the results of the legislation leave much to 
be desired.
<P>
	This morning, the minister of defence gave us an overview of 
a proposal to convert the Royal Military College in Kingston 
into a fully bilingual institution. As I have just indicated, we 
have some doubts as to whether this is at all possible, despite 
good intentions and the efforts that will be made. We are given 
the broad outline of the proposal, while at the same time, we are 
told that DND officials are in the process of drafting a plan. Are 
we to understand that the minister was merely throwing up a 
smokescreen this morning? There is absolutely nothing tangible 
in this plan.
<P>
	The minister talks about the consequences of a plan which we 
have not seen and of which we know nothing. We know nothing 
about its aims, its concepts or its mechanisms. Francophones 
expect more than vague concepts. The only details which the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3482"> 3482 </A></B>
<P>
minister released to us concerning his concept of a bilingual 
officer corps is the date on which this concept was agreed to. He 
informs us that this concept is presently being reviewed by a 
special joint task force. Another task force.
<P>
	Plans call for refining this concept and resolving the issues 
raised by the Commissioner of Official Languages. The minister 
defers to the department's Official Languages Program. We all 
know the kind of results this program had at the military college 
in Kingston. Worse yet, all officers promoted to the rank of 
lieutenant colonel are not expected to be bilingual until 1998. 
The minister has already made this fact clear to the House in 
response to questions put to him. I wonder what a normally 
bilingual lieutenant colonel is. What does ``normally bilingual'' 
mean? How can we accept it? It is too little too late.
<P>
	Furthermore, the minister tell us nothing about what he 
intends to do to promote French culture within the military 
college in Kingston. The environment counts for a great deal in 
training an officer cadet trying to master a second language. 
Learning a new language takes more than an academic program. 
It also takes the right environment and immersion. I am well 
placed to speak on it since I have trouble learning a new 
language. Even though we are in a situation of partial immersion 
here, I intend to take total immersion.
<P>
	From the recommendations produced by the official 
languages committee in the department of defence and in the 
Canadian Armed Forces, it appears that the committee 
recommended immersion as an important factor in training 
officer cadets. It recommended that all officer cadets at the 
Royal Military College and the Royal Roads Military College 
spend at least a year at the Saint-Jean campus, while those at the 
military college in Saint-Jean should spend at least a year at one 
of the other two colleges; this would help everyone develop their 
language ability and provide exposure to the other culture.
<P>
	This brief excerpt shows how training bilingual officer cadets 
is not something that can be achieved with a hastily conceived 
academic program such as the one the hon. minister has 
presented.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	It would certainly be more promising to emphasize 
immersion and exposure to another culture.
<P>
	Some positions explain why my colleagues in the Bloc 
Quebecois and I are opposed to closing the military college in 
Saint-Jean and have been opposed to it from the beginning.
<P>
	We all know that more francophones than anglophones in the 
Canadian Armed Forces are bilingual and most bilingual 
anglophones in the forces went to the military college in 
Saint-Jean.
<P>
	There is a big shortage of bilingual military people whose 
mother tongue is English, but a surplus of bilingual military 
people whose mother tongue is French.
<P>
	An internal report of the Canadian Armed Forces on 
bilingualism in the military reported a serious deficiency in this 
regard. This report said that 2,861 more francophones than 
required were bilingual, while there was a shortage of 1,424 
bilingual anglophones.
<P>
	Of course, this sample includes more than the officer corps, 
but it shows how much it has been left to francophones to 
promote bilingualism in the Canadian forces.
<P>
	Remember the climate surrounding the announcement that 
the military college in Saint-Jean would be closed. The defence 
minister said that the military college in Saint-Jean would be 
closed to save money. It is also for economic reasons that he has 
decided to put francophones in an English speaking 
environment for their military training.
<P>
	In his statement, the minister talks about an environment that 
encourages francophones to study in Kingston. Unfortunately, I 
think that is hypocritical, because many past and present officer 
cadets question the statement which the minister made this 
morning.
<P>
	The minister made optimistic predictions about the level of 
bilingualism in the officer corps. I will give him some more 
realistic projections: yes, there will still be bilingual officer 
cadets, but more and more of them will be from a French 
background. That is reality.
<P>
	There is nothing specific in this plan, nothing about how to get 
there, nothing about extra costs, nothing to satisfy us. There is 
nothing that could justify closing the military college in 
Saint-Jean or offset the loss and the major setback for 
francophones in the Canadian Forces as a result of this 
politically motivated closure.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> Madam Speaker, 
first I would like to accept the minister's apology for the late 
delivery of his statement. We have managed somehow even 
though it is late.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In answer to the minister, it must first be understood that 
Royal Military College in Kingston is already a rather bilingual 
institution and has been for years.
<P>
	It must also be recognized that, following the closing of CMR 
in Saint-Jean, there must be a place where francophone officer 
cadets can complete their studies.
<P>
	Consequently, it is desirable and rather easy to have a fully 
bilingual institution such as CMR.
<P>
	I also want to add that, after talking this morning with a 
former commanding officer of the college, I really think that 
bilingualism there is something which promotes national unity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3483"> 3483 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	While agreeing that bilingualism at RMC is desirable and 
achievable at little extra expense, the point could be made that 
with the closing of CMR and Royal Roads there will be 
considerable savings.
<P>
	Nevertheless it is necessary to signal a cautionary. The 
watchword from DND, the Department of National Defence, 
cannot be RMC today, tomorrow the whole country. There is a 
real and present danger underlined by the words of the Minister 
of National Defence in the House in February when he 
announced that by 1997 officers in the Canadian forces must be 
bilingual if they wish to be promoted beyond the rank of 
lieutenant colonel.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	English speaking Canadians should be able to have a full and 
unfettered career in the English language, however desirable it 
is to be bilingual.
<P>
	The recent booklet of the Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
``Official Languages: Myths and Realities'', states: ``English 
speaking Canadians and French speaking Canadians regardless 
of ethnic origin or first language learned have equal 
opportunities for employment and advancement''. It also states: 
``The federal government is bilingual but the individual citizen 
does not have to be. You have every right to remain unilingual. 
Universal bilingualism has never been the goal of the policy''. 
Finally it is stated on page 16: ``Individual bilingualism is a 
matter of personal choice''.
<P>
	In conclusion we can endorse the completion of the bilingual 
process at RMC for the reasons noted, including cost savings. 
However we caution the government against carrying the 
enforced bilingualism policy too far as it is doing in the rest of 
the Canadian forces.
<P>
	Voluntary bilingualism, yes; enforced, no.

Question No. 22-<B>Mr. Taylor:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Following the 1989 report of the task force on tax benefits for northern and 
isolated areas, will the government proceed with the termination of the tax 
benefits for certain northern and isolated areas?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> Because of the inequities associated with previous 
approaches of providing tax assistance to northern residents, in 
1988 a task force was established to study this issue and to make 
recommendations. The task force held public meetings in many 
communities across the country and received a number of 
written submissions. On the basis of these consultations, the 
task force concluded that an approach based on broad zones of 
eligibility was preferable. The northern and intermediate zones 
were defined using ranking systems developed by the task force 
which were comprised of objective criteria relating to 
environmental factors, community characteristics, and location.
<P>
	Full implementation of this system will result in gradually 
making certain communities ineligible for some or all of the 
benefits. For example, those communities becoming ineligible 
for all benefits were entitled to full benefits until the end of 
1992, received two-thirds benefits in 1993, will receive 
one-third benefits in 1994, and zero thereafter.
<P>
	A review of the events that led to the implementation of the 
current system establishes that the zonal approach is the right 
one. The system must be given a chance to reach a mature stage. 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3484"> 3484 </A></B>
<P>
When the full impact of the current  system is known after the 
transitional measures have run their course it will be possible to

effective than its predecessors at providing tax assistance to 
residents of northern and isolated areas.

	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport)</B> moved that 
Bill C-22, an Act respecting certain agreements concerning the 
redevelopment and operation of terminals 1 and 2 at Lester B. 
Pearson International Airport, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, today I have the pleasure of 
proposing the second reading of this very important piece of 
legislation and I want to take this opportunity to thank my 
colleague, the Minister of Industry, who was kind enough to 
table this bill on my behalf.
<P>
	Bill C-22 is a measure to cancel agreements between Her 
Majesty and T1 T2 Limited Partnership.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The arrangements I refer to were entered into by the previous 
government. They would have turned over the development and 
operation of terminals 1 and 2 at Canada's largest and most 
important transportation facility, Lester B. Pearson 
International Airport, for 60 years to a group of private 
developers.
<P>
	Our government after careful examination of the agreements 
has determined they are not in the public interest. Our 
examination included a report by Mr. Robert Nixon who 
described a flawed process clouded by the possibility of 
political manipulation.
<P>
	This government rejects the previous government's way of 
doing business on behalf of Canadians. A reliance on lobbyists, 
the backroom dealings, the manipulation of bona fide private 
sector interests and the lack of respect for the impartiality of 
public servants are absolutely unacceptable.
<P>
	It should be noted the request for proposals for the project was 
released in March 1992 after a ministerial announcement in 
October 1990. The claim for compensation from the partnership 
however shows that as early as August 1989 one of the partners 
was working on a proposal to develop and operate terminals at 
Pearson International. This would lead one to believe that 
someone other than the government was in charge of the 
privatization project at Pearson.
<P>
	The government intends to be in charge of the public agenda. 
We will make the decisions that affect the national interest. We 
believe matters that could significantly affect our economy and 
our competitive position as a nation should be decided in an 
open and accessible process, not by lobbyists and certainly not 
by five-year old governments in the dying days of their 
mandate. Decisions made by our government will reflect 
Canadians' traditional sense of fairness and fair play.
<P>
	In deciding to legislate an end to this quagmire, the 
government took account of several factors: the need to come to 
an early decision on the future needs of Pearson unencumbered 
by these agreements; the government's intention to put the 
national interest ahead of private sector profit; and the fact that 
the private sector would have taken control of one of the 
country's most important transportation assets, an asset that if 
not managed in the public interest could jeopardize the 
country's economy and its international competitiveness.
<P>
	These concerns and the government's response to them are 
reflected in the legislation before us today. The legislation 
contains several provisions. It declares that the agreements have 
not come into force and have no legal effect.
<P>
	Further, no court action of any kind may be taken against Her 
Majesty, her servants or agents owing to these agreements, the 
process that was followed to enter into the agreements or to 
terminate them.
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
	No one will be entitled to compensation from Her Majesty as a 
result of this legislation. However, the Minister of Transport 
may with governor in council approval provide for appropriate 
payments to the partnership for its out of pocket expenses, but 
nothing will be paid for lost profits or lobbyist fees.
<P>
	The bill will allow the Government of Canada to retain 
control over the future of terminals 1 and 2 at Pearson. It will 
provide a framework to allow for a fair and equitable disposition 
of the matter.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3485"> 3485 </A></B>

of the government that predate the signing of the agreement. 
Those statements included a clear warning to the developer not 
to sign an agreement and to risk cancellation of the agreement if 
it was found not to be in the public interest.
<P>
	As well, there have been the subsequent statements by 
government that it would consider paying out of pocket 
expenses but that nothing would be paid for lost profits or 
lobbyist fees. The government decided on no lost profits 
because we believe to pay such compensation is simply not 
appropriate in these circumstances.
<P>
	The warnings not to sign these agreements and the subsequent 
action taken to cancel them are absolutely consistent. 
Uncontrolled lobbying conducted behind closed doors that leads 
to a contract detrimental to the public good cannot and will not 
be condoned. The government's decision not to pay lobbyist 
fees recognizes that individuals and companies involved in the 
process did not take the public interest into account.
<P>
	The government wants to make it as clear as we can that we 
wish to deal with the private sector in an open, fair and 
responsible manner, but we will always take the taxpayers' 
interests into account. This decision should signal to all parties 
that abuses in the political process and practices we consider to 
be unacceptable will not be tolerated.
<P>
	The government has decided it may pay out of pocket 
expenses in recognition that this particular privatization process 
no matter how flawed was an accepted practice by the previous 
government. The parties were playing in a game that in this 
particular case was heavily influenced by the actions of 
lobbyists.
<P>
	It is recognized that the cancellation of the arrangement will 
have an impact on the developers. Several of the companies 
spent large amounts of money to plan, design and negotiate this 
deal. I am well aware some will say that expenses such as these 
should not be paid because of the manipulation that occurred. 
However we believe as a government that we must make every 
attempt to be reasonable and equitable.
<P>
	I want to emphasize another point. This legislation does not 
lessen the government's desire to reach a negotiated settlement 
with the developer on these out of pocket expenses. These 
negotiations are under way.
<P>
	The legislation clearly sets out certain parameters for these 
negotiations, including a time limit. A time limit is necessary to 
ensure that negotiations are not unduly protracted, thus allowing 
the government to proceed with planning the future of Canada's 
largest and most important transportation facility.
<P>
	The matter must be finalized so that we can plan the future of 
Pearson International Airport. It is our objective to provide clear 
direction on the future of Pearson before the end of this year. I 
have stated that on many occasions. This will include decisions 
on a future  management regime for Pearson and its 
development needs.
<P>
	These arrangements cannot be finalized while these contracts 
are not cancelled because they could very well hamper the 
ability of a new management system to respond to the essential 
needs of Pearson. Lengthy delays could have significant 
economic consequences not only in the metropolitan Toronto 
area but across the country because Pearson is the hub on which 
Canada's aviation system turns.
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
	In summary the legislation is designed to formally put an end 
to those agreements relating to the redevelopment and operation 
of terminals 1 and 2 at Lester B. Pearson that were arrived at as 
the result of a flawed process.
<P>
	I reiterate that in cancelling the deals the government will 
attempt to negotiate fair and reasonable out of pocket expenses 
compensation, but it will not pay for lost profits and it will not 
reimburse anything for lobbyist fees.
<P>
	The government will not be held hostage to any lengthy 
negotiating process that could impact on the future of Pearson, 
our economy, the international competitiveness of that facility 
and in the final analysis the public good.
<P>
	If an acceptable settlement cannot be arrived at and arrived at 
soon, the legislation provides that no compensation shall be 
paid.
<P>
	It is time to get on with the business of providing Canada with 
an efficient, safe and affordable national airport system. It is 
time to get on with the future of Lester B. Pearson International 
Airport.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Madam 
Speaker, this government has introduced Bill C-22 as an 
example of renewed political transparency. Or so it claims. In 
fact, in some respects, the proposed legislation casts a cozy 
mantle of discretion over the actions it was intended to censure.
<P>
	First of all, the bill itself raises a number of questions, and I 
hope this debate will help clarify the grey areas about which we 
have a quite a few queries. In fact, Bill C-22 is unsatisfactory, 
not because of what it says but because of what it does not say.
<P>
	Of course, the government wants to get rid of a hot potato that 
has been passed back and forth for months, from the anterooms 
of politicians to law offices, from lobbyists' offices to the halls 
of government. However, if the powers that be expect this bill 
will put an end to this disgraceful manoeuvring, they are wrong. 
On the contrary, there is some fancy legal wording that says a 
great deal about the hidden agenda of the government, one 
instance being section 9 of the bill which provides very clearly, 
as the minister just said with some satisfaction, that no com-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3486"> 3486 </A></B>
<P>
pensation will be paid. Section 9 provides very clearly, and I 
quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>9. No one is entitled to any compensation from Her Majesty in connection with 
the coming into force of this Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Now that sounds squeaky clean, does it not? The problem is, 
that the bill immediately goes on to say in section 10(1) that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>10. (1) If the Minister considers it appropriate to do so, the Minister may, with 
the approval of the Governor in Council-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In other words, the cabinet. It continues:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-if the Minister considers it appropriate to do so.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	With his ministerial discretion and considering what he thinks 
is sensible and the interests of his government and those of his 
friends, he may:
<P>
enter into agreements on behalf of Her Majesty to provide for the payment of such 
amounts as the Minister considers appropriate in connection with the coming into force of 
this Act, subject to the terms and conditions that the Minister considers appropriate.
<P>
	Of course the government is not at all trying to protect the 
interests of the parties involved with these agreements that will 
be made at the minister's discretion, in the privacy of cabinet, 
with the Liberal Party's lobbyists in attendance. That is the 
situation. That is what bill C-22 is all about. Although section 
10(2) provides:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) No amount is payable under an agreement entered into under this section 
in relation to (a) any loss of profits, or (b) any fee paid for the purpose of 
lobbying a public office holder-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We still have no indication of the nature of the amounts the 
minister may pay at his discretion or of the identity of the 
individuals who may benefit from such ministerial discretion.
<P>
	This is disturbing. It is disturbing because this particular case 
is overrun by lobbyists. It is full of people wheeling and dealing 
in the corridors of power with the two big parties, the Liberal 
Party and the Conservative Party.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	And it makes the hon. minister laugh. It amuses him. He is 
laughing at the thought that, by this evening, his concerns will 
be put to rest by a vote, while those who were mixed up in this 
sordid affair are loosing sleep over it.
<P>
	Furthermore, even if lobbying fees are not compensated under 
the legislation, the fact remains that the taxpayers will be paying 
part of the companies' lobbying expenses indirectly, in the form 
of corporate tax deductions.
<P>
	How can you justify making the taxpayers in Quebec and 
Canada contribute to the funding of such crass patronage? Even 
the current Minister of Transport has suggested that lobbying 
fees not be made tax deductible. Even he, the minister who is 
laughing here in this House today!
<P>
	His government did not listen to him. Did he protest? No, he 
smiled. He was voted down by Cabinet on this issue. He finds it 
amusing and defers to Cabinet solidarity and the party line.
<P>
	This is to say that we are not alone to rebel against this policy. 
What is the government asking for here?
<P>
	It is asking us to back this shameless political sham. They 
would want us to give the minister a blank cheque to compensate 
their friends and others spoilsmen that they would not go about 
it any differently.
<P>
	Never will the Bloc Quebecois accept to support in any way a 
government plan to take with the right hand what it is apparently 
forbidding itself to take with the left hand.
<P>
	They would have us be taken in by Bill C-22, colloquially 
speaking. Just to set things in perspective, allow me, to look 
back briefly on the recent past.
<P>
	I would like to reemphasize some basic facts of this complex 
issue. I see that the minister has little interest for the issue, since 
he is leaving! He has more important things to do than to listen 
to the truth on this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> And you, where were you when I spoke, you 
hypocrite?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Madam Speaker, unparliamentary language 
has just been used by a member whom you had not recognized. I 
would ask that you to call him to order.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> In the interest of 
courteous debate, I wonder if the minister would be willing to 
withdraw his comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
apologize. It is just that the hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois 
was referring to the fact that I was having a private conversation 
with a colleague while he was speaking.
<P>
	I simply pointed out that he himself was not in this chamber 
when I gave my speech and that it is somewhat hypocritical to 
mention my presence or absence when he himself was not 
present when I made my remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> On a point of order, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	I would like to remind you that, about a month ago, I used the 
same word or words to the effect that the hon. member who was 
tabling a particular petition was acting hypocritically, that it was 
hypocrisy and, at the time, the Chair had stood up and asked me 
to withdraw my remark.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3487"> 3487 </A></B>
<P>
	I wanted to explain myself, but was turned down and told to 
withdraw immediately what I had said. Out of respect for the 
Chair, I complied immediately, withdrew my remark, and 
apologized to the hon. member I had called a hypocrite. That 
is how much respect I have for the Chair and for this institution. 
I think that a Cabinet minister should do as I did and, at the 
request of the Chair, withdraw his remarks and apologize.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Like you, I noticed that, when the Chair asked 
the hon. minister to withdraw his remark, he rose only to 
reiterate it, using the word hypocrite again in what should have 
been an apology.
<P>
	I think that the least that could be expected from a minister, in 
particular a veteran of this House, when we are debating a point 
of paramount importance on a subject that directly concerns him 
as the minister responsible for the subject, the gentlemanly 
thing to do would be to withdraw his remarks.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young: </B>Madam Speaker, if, with the Opposition Leader's 
vast experience as a member of the government that created the 
problem we are trying to solve today, he does not consider 
himself a hypocrite, I will withdraw my accusation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> We will resume this very important debate on 
one of the biggest Canadian political scandals in recent years 
involving the two major parties. This affair is somewhat 
reminiscent of a political and financial soap opera. What is the 
plot? Who are the actors? Who is the director? It leaves a lot of 
unanswered questions. One thing is clear: there is no answer to 
be found in the bill we are being asked to approve.
<P>
	Although we are not entirely sure of the actors and the plot, 
one thing has been clear since the beginning: that the stage is lit 
with red and blue lights-a very bright, Liberal red and a 
tasteful dark Tory blue. Transparency is reduced to a bare 
minimum. In fact, the only thing that is transparent in this 
sensitive case, in my opinion, is the will of the parties involved 
to make things as unclear as possible.
<P>
	The most distressing aspect of this sorry business is that we 
are here today to debate a bill concerning the cancellation of an 
airport privatization which was accepted by the government 
whose official policy on airport management was, and still is as 
far as I know, to return the management of airports to the local 
people and not to private interests. As you can see, the plot 
thickens even before the curtain rises.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In April 1987, as members will recall, the previous 
government announced with great to do an overall policy for 
airport management in Canada. That policy advocated in 
particular that the running of airports be entrusted to local 
administrations, not to consortiums or friends or the party in 
power but to truly local administrations.
<P>
	Transport Canada in pursuance of that policy and recognizing 
the economic importance of airports for the regions they serve 
favoured local groups to run them, groups made up of local 
elected officials and businessmen, in other words, those people 
who have the best understanding of all the economic factors 
involved and of the need for a forceful and realistic management 
approach.
<P>
	Furthermore, in the case of Pearson International Airport such 
a group had been formed in April 1993 and was ready to take in 
hand the operation of the airport.
<P>
	The Ontario government was strongly in favour of turning 
over the operation of the airport to a local non-profit 
organization of that type. The federal government, using as a 
protest certain disagreements within the group, preferred to 
satisfy the appetites of the moneylenders and the lobbyists and, 
disregarding its own policy, proceeded to privatize the airport.
<P>
	What was the pressure to privatize? There was pressure of two 
kinds. First it was in 1993.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You were in cabinet.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> The Liberals seem to have forgotten that I 
resigned from government in May 1990. I am a free man. I am 
very happy to be that and have been very proud of it for the last 
three years.
<P>
	There was pressure of two kinds. First, there was the lure of 
gain for a friendly regime. Second, there was the desire on the 
part of the government to please those friends. That explains the 
unseemly rush during the last days of the Conservative regime to 
conclude a deal where everyone stood to gain except the public 
at large. The privatization was suddenly not motivated by any 
need on the part of the federal government of the day to get rid of 
burdensome installations since according to the airport financial 
statements transmitted to Mr. Robert Nixon, the Prime 
Minister's special investigator, the airport would have made 
profits in the region of $23 million in 1993 and that is without 
taking into consideration rental revenues from terminal 3.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	Let us not forget that Pearson International Airport is the most 
important airport in Canada. It employs 15,000 people. 
According to a Transport Canada study dating from 1987 it has 
direct economic side effects for the Ontario economy amounting 
to $4 billion. Approximately 57,000 passengers pass through the 
airport every day, that is to say 20 million passengers each year. 
About 800 aircraft land and take off daily for 300 destinations in 
60 countries.
<P>
	It is in fact the only Canadian airport which could be termed a 
hub for air traffic in Canada, a status that Vancouver is about to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3488"> 3488 </A></B>
<P>
attain and that Montreal could reach if only the government 
would give it the necessary boost.
<P>
	Yet it is the lure of profit that is the primary source of all the 
political and media tumult now obliging the Canadian House of 
Commons to come to a decision on the bill. If the Parliament of 
Canada has to be called in, the backroom ministerial 
manoeuvrings have to be particularly scandalous.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The intrigues surrounding this case since the beginning 
started as soon as the government announced its Canadian 
airport management policy. As I said earlier, this policy was 
made public in April 1987, and the following June, the 
government asked the Airport Development Corporation to 
build and operate Terminal 3 at Pearson Airport.
<P>
	In September 1989, Paxport Inc. submitted to the government 
a proposal to privatize Terminals 1 and 2. This proposal was 
rejected because the government policy was not to privatize. I 
was then a member of the government.
<P>
	One year later-I had since resigned-the federal government 
took the lead in inviting, without further explanations, the 
private sector to participate in the upgrading of Terminals 1 and 
2.
<P>
	In March 1992, the government officially requested proposals 
to privatize Terminals 1 and 2. But unlike what was done in 
awarding the contract to build and operate Terminal 3-a 
two-phase process consisting of the request for proposals and 
the selection of candidates-, the bids to privatize Terminals 1 
and 2 were only subject to one 90-day selection phase.
<P>
	Why the rush? Did the upcoming election spur them into 
action? In early June of the same year, perhaps because of the 
extremely tight deadlines set by the government, only two 
proposals were received, one from Paxport Inc. and the other 
from Claridge, already at work on Terminal 3.
<P>
	On December 7, 1992, the government approved the bid 
submitted by Paxport, which had until February 15 to 
demonstrate the financial viability of its proposal. But that was 
not to be since, less than two months later, a 
financially-troubled Paxport had to merge with its only 
competitor, Claridge Properties, to create the T1 T2 Limited 
Partnership consortium.
<P>
	Is it not rather surprising that the government awarded a 
57-year contract worth millions of dollars to a 
financially-troubled management company that was also close 
to the political party in office?
<P>
	We know that one of the arguments put forward by the 
government to justify its decision to award the contract to 
Paxport had to do with encouraging healthy competition 
between the manager of Terminals 1 and 2, Paxport, and the 
manager of Terminal 3, Claridge. How virtuous can you get?
<P>
	Here is a government which, although it wants to privatize, 
wants to do it according to the rules of the private sector, by 
encouraging competition. How can we explain this about-face 
by the government which accepts without objecting the merging 
of the two competitors? Under this submission, those two 
competitors who were adversaries one day became united 
friends the next. The government could have rejected that 
submission, but it did not even bat an eyelash, thereby accepting 
to deal with only one entity, after having sung the praises of 
competition and insisted on its necessity.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	Is it not strange that when the only two bidders for such an 
important contract form a monopoly, the government accepts 
that? Is it not strange that the period for making submissions 
was only 90 days, as in the case for an ordinary call for tenders, 
while the duration and the complexity of the contract are way 
out of the ordinary? Why limit that period? Is it to allow 
interested parties already familiar with the issue to review their 
submission? After all, Paxport had already submitted a 
privatization plan in 1989, while Claridge was already 
managing terminal 3 at Pearson Airport.
<P>
	Obviously somebody somewhere deemed appropriate to 
bypass the bureaucratic system and infiltrate the government 
political machine to gain some privileges, this in contempt of 
the official principles of equity. Is this not a clear and 
particularly cynical example of private interests being more 
concerned about their revenue than the common good? And 
what about the elected officials who caved in to them?
<P>
	The Nixon report judges them severely: ``It is clear that the 
lobbyists played a prominent part in attempting to affect the 
decisions that were reached, going far beyond the acceptable 
concept of ``consulting''. When senior bureaucrats involved in 
the negociations for the Government of Canada feel that their 
actions and decisions are being heavily affected by lobbyists as 
occurred here, the role of the latter has, in my view, exceeded 
permissible norms.''
<P>
	This strong statement should have convinced this government 
to take every measure to find out about the role played by 
lobbyists in the dealings related to the privatization of 
Terminals 1 and 2. Instead, the government decides to turn the 
page, and tries do so in an incredible way, after a five-minute 
speech by the minister responsible, who is not even here for the 
debate that follows. The minister is in fact asking the House of 
Commons to cover his acts. He wants to use a vote in the House 
to cover acts which should be made public. Instead of trying 
harder to discover the facts and to look in detail at the actions 
and motives of those involved, he tries to close the case by 
tabling a piece of legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3489"> 3489 </A></B>
<P>
	Who can doubt that, if it is passed by the House, Bill C-22 
will close the book for good on this shocking issue? Lobbyists 
and others involved in this operation will be able to relax. Some 
who are not lobbyists but who were bidders might even be 
compensated by the minister. Madam Speaker, you might 
wonder to which stakeholders I am referring? The act is silent 
on this and merely excludes refunding lobbyists fees and 
anticipated profits. Everything else is at the discretion of the 
minister and depends on his generosity.
<P>
	Everyone knows that lobbyists abound on Parliament Hill and 
are involved in every important issue. I agree that some 
lobbying is acceptable. In this regard, I support the comments 
made by the Standing Committee on Consumer and Corporate 
Affairs and Government Operations which, in its report on 
lobbies released last year, said that lobbying is a necessary 
component of a modern decision-making process, and that the 
right to lobby is a fundamental one in a democracy.
<P>
	However, the committee also added that, when lobbying takes 
place without the public's knowledge, there is a greater risk of 
decisions being made against its interest.
<P>
	If there is an example in our political history which confirms 
the validity of the committee's comments, it is the Pearson 
Airport dealings, which were conducted clandestinely, behind 
the close doors of ministers offices, with political operators, 
people who influence governments, political contributors and 
lobbyists.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	If we need an example of the need for public disclosure, which 
was one of the priorities of the Commons committee on 
lobbying, we have it right here. And if there is any lesson to be 
learned from the Pearson airport affair, it is that something must 
be done to change the rules of the game.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the case concerning us today it is clear that lobbying played 
a preponderant role. The final result will cost the taxpayers 
millions of dollars. That is what I call overstepping the mark and 
it is why I am inviting the Prime Minister to submit concrete 
proposals to make that very significant activity as open as 
possible.
<P>
	His government could suggest putting more teeth into the act 
respecting the registration of lobbyists, an act which lacks 
consistency to say the least.
<P>
	In its report on lobbying the standing committee draws 
attention to several flaws and suggests some useful solutions. In 
particular the committee considers inadequate the requirements 
regarding the registration of tier II lobbyists, a group which is 
very poorly defined in the present act and which has only to 
disclose their names and the names of their employers.
<P>
	The committee report says: ``Such disclosure gives no 
indication as to the type of questions which could be of interest 
to the organization'', to say nothing of the fact that the actual 
function of lobbyists could easily be disguised through the use 
of various legal tactics.
<P>
	Concerning the matter of the disclosure of the objectives 
sought by the lobbyists, the requirements of the act are not 
sufficiently forceful and the provision concerning the 
registration of lobbying activities is so vague as to be useless.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To close the loopholes in the current legislation on lobbyists, 
we should at least consider a system of disclosure, under which 
the public office holder being lobbied would have an obligation 
to disclose his professional contacts with lobbyists. 
Transparency would no longer apply only to the wish list of the 
lobbyists but also to the public office holders being lobbied.
<P>
	Similarly, the quality of our political and democratic system 
would be enhanced by imposing a code of ethics on elected 
representatives and senior officials. We could take our 
inspiration from the bill now before the U.S. Congress, where 
they have understood the need to provide a framework of 
measures designed to preserve the integrity of the political 
process.
<P>
	In fact, even the Liberal Party, during its period of abstinence 
when it was seeking power, had taken a position on this issue, 
and as far as I know, it still stands. The red book, which is 
constantly being quoted in this House and which was launched 
with lot of hoopla during the election campaign, clearly says on 
page 95, and this is from the Liberals before they came to power, 
and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-we will develop a Code of Conduct for public officials to guide cabinet 
ministers, members of Parliament, senators, political staff and public servants in 
their dealings with lobbyists.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The red book, still the red book, also promises:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In particular, a Liberal government will appoint an independent ethics 
counsellor to advise both public officials and lobbyists in the day-to-day 
application of the Code of Conduct for public officials. The ethics counsellor 
will be appointed after consultation with the leaders of all parties in the House 
of Commons and will report directly to Parliament-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Where is this independent ethics counsellor? When does the 
government intend to consult us? Why has it been dragging its 
feet for six months? Where is its political will? Where is the 
transparency? Nowhere, because today, the Liberals form the 
government and, by the same token, are in no rush to keep their 
promises.
<P>
	These are only a few examples, not only of the shortcomings, 
omissions and vagueness of the Lobbyists Registration Act and 
the questions it raises, but also of the ways which this 
transparency can be guaranteed. We must go further and apply 
the same principles to political party financing. In fact, if the 
government in its concerns for transparency intends to give all 
citizens equal access to public decision-makers, why does it 
refuse to make  political party financing more democratic? 
Good question.

<P>
	How can the Liberal government expect to make the system 
more transparent when it too depends on donations from large 
corporations. For example, in 1992, the last year for which data 
are available, the six largest Canadian banks-I will not bother 
to name them since we all know which banks are 
involved-donated nearly $500,000 to Liberal and Conservative 
party coffers. These two parties received $244,301.54 and 
$241,493.92 respectively. Canadian banks have a sense of 
election parity since the total amounts donated to each party 
were virtually identical. As we all know, the party in power 
today could be replaced by another tomorrow, and the banks are 
big on insurance policies. They like to keep things even, 
especially when their interests are at stake and especially when 
it is a matter of influencing government by the decisions they 
make.
<P>
	In Quebec, under the guidance of René Lévesque-yes, René 
Lévesque, a name not spoken in this House-this process was 
brought out into the open. The act of cleaning up our political 
standards and practices which ensued today stands as proof of 
the pride and democratic vitality of Quebecers.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> It is vitally important that the process of 
donating funds to political parties be democratized. The need to 
do so transcends partisan political divisions, given that the 
democratic well-being of the people is at stake. It was in this 
spirit that my colleague, the hon. member for Richelieu, tabled a 
resolution respecting donations to political parties. I wish to 
take this opportunity to invite all members of this House to 
reflect on this issue and to bring pressure to bear on the 
government to launch this process of democratizing political 
party funding as soon as possible. Our political system must be 
hooked into today's reality and made more open and accessible 
to the ordinary citizen. This process will breathe new life into 
the system.
<P>
	Everyone is well aware of the deals made between large 
financial backers and certain political parties, mostly the major 
parties and who can disagree that the Liberal Party is a major 
party? The Liberals are the first ones to say that theirs is a major 
party. The well-known deals and arrangements between these 
large political parties and the big financial backers have led the 
public to have an unhealthy distrust of our political institutions. 
There is not one member in this House who has not seen on 
numerous occasions how deeply suspicious his constituents are 
of the hidden, close, clandestine, almost incestuous relations 
between the big financial backers and the major parties that 
form the government.
<P>
	All members of this House are aware of this fact. Which ones 
will put pressure on the government to force it to adopt once and 
for all a fundamentally democratic measure which is 
desperately needed and to follow Quebec's example? I am 
referring to limiting to individuals, the right to donate to 
political parties a practice which we advocate and follow. It 
allows us to keep in constant touch with our fellow citizens and 
gives those who make donations a real voice in the political 
process. At the same time, it leaves the legislator perfectly free, 
because his first duty is to the public, not to groups operating 
behind the scenes.
<P>
	By raising donations in this manner, we will ensure that the 
party remains in the hands of the members, irrespective of the 
ongoing pressure exerted on the party's elected representatives 
to adopt sectarian positions. This process has a name: 
transparency. Transparency serves a purpose, that is the 
promotion of democracy. It is this same democracy that enables 
all of us here today to represent our fellow citizens. 
Transparency should be the cornerstone of the governing 
process. It is imperative that all government business be 
conducted in a transparent manner, including decisions to award 
contracts such as the one involving Pearson Airport.
<P>
	The same holds true with respect to financial backers 
associated with the government. Here again with the Pearson 
Airport deal, it is clear that the first and sole beneficiaries of the 
government's largesse in the contract adjudication process have 
ties to the previous Conservative government as well as to the 
present Liberal government. If I may echo the enlightened 
words spoken earlier by the member for Richelieu, the Lortie 
Commission which was set up several years ago to consider 
reforms to the Elections Act and which had a mandate to 
examine this particular issue, could have given serious 
consideration to party fundraising practices and could have 
made more substantial recommendations as to how the process 
could be made more democratic. However, it did not have the 
guts to do so.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	Although these days, as my colleague said, major companies 
account for only half of the electoral contributions to political 
parties, it is still too much because the amounts are still large 
and this obsolete system leaves plenty of room for all kinds of 
political schemes.
<P>
	Lobbyists do not only give money or cold hard cash to 
election campaigns; they give of themselves.
<P>
	They are high powered campaign workers. They rarely work 
for small fry like an ordinary backbencher. They prefer to work 
for ministers and even the Prime Minister, if possible, and their 
political zeal is apparent not only during elections, because 
leadership races appeal to their tireless devotion as well.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3491"> 3491 </A></B>
<P>
	And lobbyists are not at all partisan. Every time the 
government changes, we see them shuffling their deck and 
generously hiring lobbyists from the winning side. Lobbyists 
are wonderfully open-minded.
<P>
	So there are natural ties between contributors, lobbyists and 
elected candidates. This buddy-buddy relationship is 
particularly noticeable when a juicy government contract is at 
stake.
<P>
	The Pearson contract was a juicy one. In 1993, Pearson 
Airport made a profit of $23 million, not counting terminal 3.
<P>
	The rent to be paid by the Pearson Development Corporation 
was about $27 million the first year, $27 million the second year, 
$28 million the third year, $29 million the fourth year and $30 
million a year from the fifth to the tenth year.
<P>
	At first glance, renting the facilities for $27 million the first 
year might seem to be a good deal for the government, compared 
to the $23 million it makes from it now.
<P>
	But if you take a closer look, you see that is not at all the case. 
Indeed, after renovating the air terminal buildings, the Pearson 
Development Corporation intended to raise the rates charged to 
airlines from $2 to $7 a passenger, which would have meant 
millions and millions more income every year. For the whole 
airport, it is $100 million a year, but since the rate in terminal 3 
had already been raised to $7 per passenger, the additional 
charges for terminals 1 and 2 are quite a lot.
<P>
	Now who would have paid this additional charge per 
passenger? The travelling public, of course. In this regard, we 
were not surprised to learn that, to win Air Canada's support for 
this privatization, the government had agreed in July 1993 to 
pay 15 per cent of the rent for that airline and foreign airlines 
operating in terminal 2.
<P>
	Since Air Canada's present lease expires in 1997 and the new 
lease would run for 37 years, this measure alone would have cost 
the federal government some $70 million.
<P>
	I think that all these shady dealings are suspicious enough to 
raise serious questions about the management of public funds, 
but there is more.
<P>
	You will see that this huge waste of taxpayers' money has 
many ramifications. For example, I said a moment ago that these 
higher rates would have brought in tens of millions of dollars a 
year, which the federal government could very well cash in if it 
keeps control of the airport and makes the necessary 
adjustments and raises the rates itself. These rates would be the 
same as the present rate at terminal 3 and at most major North 
American airports.
<P>
	Of course, this higher rate provided for in the agreement 
would not have taken effect immediately, but only after the 
Pearson Development Corporation invested the $700 million it 
had promised.
<P>
	But this investment itself is a problem. Pearson had initially 
promised to invest $100 million of this amount to modernize 
terminal 1.
<P>
	However, to encourage the initial investment, the government 
had agreed to collect only $16 million of the $17-million annual 
rent, which amounts to a 40 per cent rebate for 1994, 1995, 1996 
and part of 1997. Although these amounts were to be paid back 
subsequently, with interest, by deferring these payments the 
federal government was actually helping to finance the 
upgrading of Terminal 1, when it had specifically said it would 
not do so.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	Let us not mince words to describe the scheming and artful 
dodging that went on around an agreement that was unworthy of 
the trust that should exist between citizens and their 
government. The players in this political-financial saga ignored 
the most elementary code of ethics that should guide the 
relationship between the electorate and their elected 
representatives. By their greed they undermined the very 
foundation of our political system. They made a travesty of the 
very essence of the social contract that binds society together, to 
satisfy a craving for profit at any price, and the disclosure of 
their dealings discredited what was left of the government in 
power at the time.
<P>
	It is rather difficult to understand why, after all this, the 
minister should seek authority to pay them compensation. I 
think we must ask this question: Is it necessary, appropriate and 
legitimate to pay these bidders compensation, considering the 
circumstances in which they operated? Only a thorough public 
inquiry would reveal exactly who did what and who is entitled to 
receive compensation and how much.
<P>
	A number of players seem to have tried to take advantage of 
their political connections. This was hardly the average business 
operation you could brag about on the campaign trail, so the 
friends of the outgoing government and those of the incoming 
government acted like sensible people and reached a very 
sensible compromise. They said: ``Let us stop fighting. Let us 
merge our Liberal and Conservative interests''. Together, they 
were to conclude very quickly, before the election, a deal which 
until then had eluded them.
<P>
	Not only Conservative lobbyists and personalities were 
involved. The government has presented this bill as through it 
were St. George slaying the dragon, in this case the Pearson 
contract. Away with this shameful Conservative contract and let 
the House help me raise a wall to protect the citizens of Canada 
from this contract!
<P>
	Not only Conservative lobbyists and personalities were 
involved. Both traditional parties, as they like to call 
themselves, are represented in this mixed bag of moneylenders, 
fundraisers and lobbyists.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	One of the directors of Claridge is the Liberal senator who 
received the future Liberal Prime Minister at his residence in 
Westmount at a $1,000-a-plate reception in the middle of the 
election campaign.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That's indecent!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Another lobbyist for Claridge was the present 
Prime Minister's former organizer, so we should not be misled 
by the present government's insistence on its role in cancelling 
the contract. The government knows perfectly well that this 
tainted contract was produced by the entourages of both camps, 
and not only by the Conservatives. The government knows 
perfectly well-my speaking time is not limited, Madam 
Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> No, I apologize for 
interrupting the minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> He is getting upset over there because he 
doesn't like what I am saying. He would prefer to see this 
legislation go through the House like so many bills, after a quick 
vote. That will not happen, however. There is a debate here in 
this House.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Right on!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Canadians and Quebecers are entitled to hear 
the truth about this bill.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members: </B>Let's hear it for political patronage!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> The government knows perfectly well that an 
enquiry would bring many of its fundraising friends scurrying 
out of their hiding places. We know that both camps worked 
together on this deal.
<P>
	There is a lesson here, and it is that like great causes and great 
ideas, money sometimes makes strange bedfellows.
<P>
	The author of the Nixon report is a former treasurer of the 
Ontario government. He is not a member of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	He is a respectable man, probably a federalist-and I respect 
him none the less for that-who was closely involved in the 
running of democratic institutions in Ontario, a well-known 
man, a man of integrity. In a word, the man I am about to 
quote-and you will notice that his criticism is even harsher 
than mine-knows what he is talking about. He has submitted 
the contract to a thorough examination, and was commissioned 
to do so. What did he find? He said: ``To leave in place an 
inadequate contract, arrived at through such a flawed process 
and under the shadow of possible political manipulation, is 
unacceptable''.
<P>
	In other words, Mr. Nixon, who had neither the time, the 
means nor the power to conduct a comprehensive investigation 
was only able to get a glimpse, through the curtain, through the 
smoke in the ante-rooms of power, of possible political 
manipulation. Now that we know about this possibility, we must 
act. We must gather information. We must find out who the 
players were and  who engineered this, if only to make sure they 
do not receive compensation they do not deserve.
<P>
	Should an in-depth investigation show that some of the 
people involved acted in an unlawful, unacceptable or unethical 
manner in this matter, would we still be expected to pass clause 
9, and especially clause 10, that allows the minister to pay them 
generous compensation? Certainly not! But, unbeknown to us, 
this doubt, this terrible, gnawing doubt, was put in our minds by 
the findings of the investigators.
<P>
	``Possible political manipulation'', that is heavy stuff. I could 
not bring myself to utter those words in my speech, but that is 
how the formal investigation report was worded. Do we stop 
here, in case the commission of inquiry decides some 
compensation is in order? That is a possibility. We do not know. 
We do not have all the facts. There may be people in there who 
acted in good faith. Maybe, maybe not. We would need to know 
which were honest and which were not. Otherwise, the good guy 
is going to pay for the actions of the others. We would have to 
sort all that out in a public inquiry that would show to everyone 
that justice has been served.
<P>
	In addition, if this commission found that some compensation 
was called for in certain cases, it could determine the amounts 
openly and publicly and much more objectively than any Liberal 
minister, including the minister responsible for this case. We 
could also protect ourselves in the future by identifying clearly 
the people who pulled the strings on the Liberal side. We know 
they are there and we could identify them, thus preventing them 
from acting the same way with the current government in other 
cases.
<P>
	I therefore ask the Prime Minister to set up such a royal 
commission of inquiry, which is the only authority capable of 
sorting out the real responsibilities of the parties involved in this 
case. It is also the only way to promote, in the general 
population as well as in this House, a healthy debate on the links 
that should or should not exist between a democratically elected 
government and partisan political entities interested in 
promoting private interests.
<P>
	Such a commission could also, in the course of its work, study 
the issues underlying all these manipulations such as the 
management of federal airports. In the current economic 
context, who is in the best position to guarantee the viability and 
profitability of airport development? Is it the federal 
government? Is it non-profit agencies created for this purpose 
or other formulas? Would it not be better to turn their 
management over to local administrations, like in Montreal, as 
advocated in  Transport Canada's policy during the events 
examined by Nixon?
<P>
	Who in this country is best equipped to manage airports? It is 
an important question. It appears that even the current Prime 
Minister is not sure as he objected to Pearson Airport's 
privatization only on the last day of  the election campaign, 
when it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3493"> 3493 </A></B>
<P>
became obvious that the public was outraged by the deal's 
secrecy.
<P>
	We all have a duty to be transparent. It is this transparency 
that made Nixon say on page 11 of his report: ``Failure to make 
public the full identity of the participants in this agreement and 
other salient terms of the contract inevitably raises public 
suspicion. Where the Government of Canada proposes to 
privatize a public asset, in my opinion, transparency should be 
the order of the day. The public should have the right to know the 
full details of the agreement&quot;.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	On this point, the Bloc can only support the opinion expressed 
by the fact finder, Mr. Nixon, and demand that the government 
truly take note of his comments and puts an end to this era of 
confusion which has everyone wondering.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Openness is a political virtue which has been absent in the 
country for many years now. Openness is a constant guide. It 
represents security and inspires confidence. We all know that 
confidence is a flower that has faded in recent years in Canada.
<P>
	The disengagement of citizens, smuggling, the black market, 
general cynicism, all these social phenomena are the products of 
apparently very disparate factors. They can all be traced back to 
the same origin: the lack of openness on the part of the state 
which operates behind closed doors concerned, I would say 
obsessed, with management matters, too often oblivious to the 
real needs of all those men and women upon whom it must 
depend for its very legitimacy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The time has come to go back to the basics and restore 
political transparency so as to once again give meaning to 
Canadian democracy. The Bloc will oppose Bill C-22. First, 
because this legislation is premature. First and foremost 
because a royal commission of inquiry must be appointed to 
clarify this dark episode in which the ethical behaviour of the 
government and some related players was not up to par.
<P>
	Moreover, and I will end on that, it is imperative that, before 
anything else, and especially before trying to hide the 
reprehensible actions which were taken, strict measures be 
taken to control the activities of lobbyists. This is the very basis 
of my amendment.
<P>
	Therefore, seconded by my colleague the member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That all the words following ``That'' be eliminated and replaced by the 
following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House refuse to proceed with the second reading of Bill C-22, an Act 
respecting certain agreements concerning the redevelopment and operation of 
Terminals 1 and 2 at Lester B. Pearson International Airport</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Because the bill is flawed since it does not provide measures to ensure the 
transparency of lobbyists' activities.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity today to speak on Bill C-22.
<P>
	This whole Pearson revitalization and the studies that have 
been done raise many questions. I am hoping that the debate we 
are about to embark on will provide some answers to the 
questions. Actually Mr. Nixon's review demands a response. I 
would like to quote from the press release that came out with Mr. 
Nixon's review: ``My review has left me with but one 
conclusion, to leave in place an inadequate contract, arrived at 
with such a flawed process and under the shadow of possible 
political manipulation, is unacceptable. I recommend to you 
that the contract be cancelled''.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	Those are very strong words and I think in those words there is 
a message that we must be fair. I was interested in the minister's 
comments when he spoke earlier this morning about being fair. 
The minister said that there may be those who would question 
any moneys being paid because of manipulation. He 
acknowledged that there may have been some manipulation. 
However he wanted his government to be fair and reasonable.
<P>
	To whom are we going to be fair and reasonable? Will it be the 
taxpayers of Canada, the people who are paying the bills, or the 
lobbyists who are to profit from any moneys that are exchanged 
here? I think we have to be fair and reasonable. My priorities are 
that we have to be fair and reasonable with the taxpayers of 
Canada. We have an obligation to be fair and reasonable to those 
whose names and reputations have been called into question in 
all of this. They should be given an opportunity to clear 
themselves if that is possible. There should be no tax dollars 
spent until the air is clear.
<P>
	Bill C-22 is virtually unprecedented. However I would 
suggest that the circumstances here are virtually unprecedented. 
We have accusations of patronage, accusations of political 
interference, accusations of excessive lobbying and apparently 
the elimination of competition.
<P>
	The government has said much about honesty and fairness. I 
would like to quote from the red book on page 91. Chapter 6 
begins:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If government is to play a positive role in society, as it must, honesty and 
integrity in our political institutions must be restored.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The most important asset of government is the confidence it enjoys of the 
citizens to whom it is accountable.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3494"> 3494 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-22 does nothing toward this goal. Full disclosure of all 
that has taken place would go a long way toward achieving this. 
Let us review the background and the history to bring us up to 
date on the Pearson revitalization. There are many conflicting 
and contradictory positions.
<P>
	Through a series of complicated deals two companies merge 
as partners: Paxport, which is controlled by Matthews Group 
Limited with very strong Tory connections, and Claridge 
investments, a company with very strong Liberal connections. 
These two companies are joined together as the Pearson 
Development Corporation.
<P>
	Bill C-22 is the beginning of the end of a process which 
started in 1987 to move airports across Canada into local hands. 
Generally airports across Canada have gone into the hands of 
local airport authorities. The ones they have tried so far have 
met with some excellent results.
<P>
	Pearson airport was a different case. The former Tory 
government was determined to privatize Pearson for the benefit 
of a number of its friends, among them David Matthews, a 
former Tory president and fund raiser and former Tory cabinet 
minister. Otto Jelinek joined Paxport, which is Matthews 
owned, shortly before the election. He is on its board of 
directors and president of its Asian wing. Excessive amounts of 
lobbying went into the privatization of Pearson airport. At least 
10 firms were involved.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	One of the clearest parts of this whole deal is the fact that the 
Liberals are heavily involved. Since the Liberal government has 
been in power it has appointed a former provincial Liberal 
cabinet minister to lead the review and the Prime Minister's 
former law partner to lead the negotiations for compensation.
<P>
	These may be very capable and honest people. However the 
circumstances dictated that direct political connections should 
have been avoided. A suspicious and secret deal by the Tories 
now looks very much like a suspicious and secret Liberal 
cancellation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am 
curious to what extent the Chair will go to allow the remarks of 
the member to potentially put into disrepute those individuals of 
whom the member speaks, especially in light of the result of the 
report of Mr. Nixon.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry but that is a 
point of debate rather than a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Madam Speaker, actually the 
history going back to 1987 was when the Parliament of Canada 
passed the National Transportation Act which set the stage for a 
newly deregulated Canadian airline industry.
<P>
	On April 8, 1987 the Government of Canada issued its policy 
on the future framework for the management of airports in 
Canada. It envisioned local airport authorities as the preferred 
method of airport management. Privatization was only given 
passing mention.
<P>
	Three months later we had a reversal. On June 22, 1987 the 
Airport Development Corporation was the preferred developer 
to construct and operate terminal 3 at Pearson. The Matthews 
Group of companies sponsored an unsuccessful bid in this 
competition. However it will reappear.
<P>
	In September 1989 the Matthews Group submitted an 
unsolicited proposal to the Government of Canada to privatize 
terminals 1 and 2 at Pearson. This proposal was not accepted. 
However no costs were expected at that time.
<P>
	In October 1990 the government announced that private 
sector participation in the modernization of these two terminals 
would be sought through a future request for proposals process. 
No details were provided. As a matter of fact attempts by local 
airport authorities were rebuffed or rejected. They were not even 
encouraged to bid in spite of the success of airport authorities in 
Vancouver, Edmonton and Calgary.
<P>
	On March 11, 1992 the government issued a request for 
proposals with 90 days provided for responses, placing heavy 
demands on those submitting a proposal. This gave the 
Matthews Group an advantage since it had previously submitted 
a bid in 1989. Two groups bid on the project: Paxport controlled 
by the Matthews Group and Claridge.
<P>
	It must be noted that 90 days is a very short time to allow for 
proposals on a project of this magnitude. Another thing worth 
noting is that this was a one stage process. When T3 was 
considered it was a two-stage process, the first stage being to 
solicit and short list bidders and the second stage being to 
encourage detailed bids. This was not the case when we were 
looking at T1 and T2.
<P>
	Another interesting aspect was that passenger volumes were 
open to projections by the bidders. A significant amount of 
information and coming up with a price was left open to those 
who were going to be bidding.
<P>
	At that time there were many firms looking for work and yet 
so few were given the opportunity to bid on this project.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	In December 1992 Paxport Incorporated was announced as 
the best overall proposal. It had to demonstrate its viability by 
February 1993. By that time Paxport found it did not have the 
financial backing it needed so it turned to Claridge for support.
<P>
	The question here is how could a project of this magnitude 
proceed without financial ability as a prime consideration. 
Having discovered that it did not have the  financial ability, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3495"> 3495 </A></B>
<P>
questions arise: Why Claridge? Was no other option available to 
Paxport?
<P>
	In February 1993 Paxport and Claridge announced a joint 
venture partnership which became T1 T2 Limited Partnership 
and eventually the Pearson Development Corporation with 
terminal 3 to pursue the redevelopment according to Paxport's 
proposal.
<P>
	The request for the proposal implicitly said that there must be 
competition between T1 T2 and terminal 3. As a matter of fact 
Paxport in its bid highlighted the importance of competition in 
its bid. However in joining forces the competition that was to be 
there was eliminated.
<P>
	In May 1993 Claridge had assumed effective control of the 
joint venture. Competition is lost and yet Paxport is still there.
<P>
	In June 1993 the Pearson Development Corporation and the 
government signed a letter of understanding as to the substance 
of the previous agreement. Just prior to that a member, Huguette 
Labelle, a former transport deputy minister, was moved out of 
her position because of her opposition to the government's 
movement.
<P>
	On August 30 the Minister of Transport announced that a 
general agreement was reached with Pearson Development 
Corporation to redevelop T1 and T2 and indicated the agreement 
would be finalized in the fall with a legal agreement for the long 
term management operation and redevelopment of the 
terminals. This is with the election only days away. On 
September 8, 1993 the election was called.
<P>
	Prior to the conclusion of the legal agreement the Leader of 
the Opposition, the present Prime Minister, had indicated 
clearly that parties proceeding to conclude this transaction did 
so at their own risk and that a new government would not 
hesitate to pass legislation to block the privatization of 
terminals 1 and 2 if the transaction was not in the public interest.
<P>
	At this time the chief negotiator of the Government of Canada 
sought written instructions about whether to complete the 
transaction.
<P>
	On October 7, 1993 the Prime Minister at the time gave 
written instructions to complete the deal. We were in the middle 
of an election and those instructions were given. One has to ask 
the question: Why?
<P>
	On October 7 the legal agreement was made to complete the 
Pearson privatization. At this point we were only 18 days away 
from an election. Knowing it was going to be an election issue, 
knowing it would be cancelled if it did not prove to be in the 
public interest, the government proceeded with the undertaking.
<P>
	On October 28, 1993 the Prime Minister appointed Robert 
Nixon, a former Liberal cabinet minister, to do a quick review of 
the Pearson deal.
<P>
	There is much that has gone on in the background and, as I 
said at the beginning, there are many questions that have been 
raised here. In fact there are questions that are crying out to be 
answered.
<P>
	We should take a minute to review some of Mr. Nixon's 
comments and his opinions in the process. On page 8 of his 
report he states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The request for proposals having as it did only a single stage and requiring 
proponents to engage in project definition as well as proposal submissions and all 
within a 90 day timeframe created, in my view, an enormous advantage to a

<P>
	The role of lobbyists and political staff, as stated on page 9 of 
the report, reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is clear that the lobbyists played a prominent role in attempting to effect the 
decisions that were reached, going far beyond the acceptable concept of 
consulting. When senior bureaucrats involved in the negotiations for the 
Government of Canada feel that their actions and decisions are being heavily 
affected by lobbyists, as occurred here, the role of the latter has, in my view, 
exceeded permissible norms.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As well, there was the perception that political staff were interested in this 
transaction to a highly unusual extent; indeed, this climate of pressure resulted 
in civil servants being reassigned or requesting transfers from the project.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In closing, this was a flawed process that would appear to be 
killing this project. Mr. Nixon in his review said that the project 
should indeed proceed. There are five chairpersons and 32 
municipalities which support that position.
<P>
	There is also a safety angle here. Pilots have been stressing 
this safety factor. I quote from an article in the <I>Toronto Star</I> that 
was reported in response to some airline pilots who attended a 
committee hearing.
<P>
	As pilot Rick Anderson noted, ``planes are designed to land in 
the wind. Crosswinds can cause problems, especially on 
slippery runways. When heavy crosswinds are blowing, a 
second north-south runway would be safer to use than the 
existing east-west runways, and cut delays as well. While the 
value of the latter cannot be underestimated as we pull out of 
this recession, since planes burn about 1,360 kilograms of fuel 
an hour while waiting to land, travellers, airlines and 
environment all would benefit from reduced travel time, fuel 
costs and air pollution''.
<P>
	There are thousands of construction jobs at stake. The delay in 
this project is hurting job creating projects around the province, 
and indeed in Canada. Mike Sifton, president of Toronto 
Airways, stated that ``airports create jobs and business. The real 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3496"> 3496 </A></B>
<P>
jobs an airport creates are one and a half miles down the road 
from the runway''.
<P>
	This review need not and should not hold up construction. 
Currently some Toronto MPs are delaying this for purely local 
concerns. Canadian jobs and growth are at stake. Pearson is a 
national issue, not a local issue, and jobs are at stake in 
Kitchener, Windsor, North Bay, Kingston, Oshawa and Barrie.
<P>
	There is much at stake here: honesty and integrity in the 
system, confidence and trust in politicians, potentially millions 
of taxpayers' dollars, the names and reputations of many people, 
Pearson's revitalization, thousands of jobs and future growth in 
the economy.
<P>
	Bill C-22 in my view does nothing to address these issues. We 
will be supporting the Bloc amendment. I would move an 
amendment to the Bloc amendment. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the amendment be amended by adding immediately after the words 
``more open'' the words ``in Canada''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I would like to advise 
the hon. member for Simcoe Centre that we will take his 
proposed subamendment under consideration.
<P>
	For the moment I will resume debate with the hon. 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport):</B> Madam Speaker, before I get into the text of my 
speech I wonder if I could make a couple of observations that are 
rather striking and troublesome.
<P>
	We have heard from both the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform 
Party. They have questioned the way the Pearson deal came 
about and the substance of the deal. We all agree that the process 
and the substance were seriously flawed in many ways because 
the Canadian public interest was not protected. Yet both 
opposition parties are voting against the bill.
<P>
	That is rather curious. I must admit I was rather surprised that 
the leader of the Bloc Quebecois would take the time to address 
this issue. He talked about a number of things, from lobbyists to 
other circumstances. He went on ad nauseam about the fact he 
had left the government before he had anything to do with it. I 
believe that perhaps he has a guilty conscience.
<P>
	He is right. He left the government in May 1990, but he was 
part of that gang, part of his colleagues, part of the cabinet, part 
of the so-called friends he now wants to deny he ever had 
anything to do with who put this darned bad deal together. It is 
rather curious that the Bloc leader would go on at length trying 
to divorce himself from a bad gang, as Canadians would know it, 
as he knew it. Yet he participated maybe not in the Pearson deal, 
but right from the beginning he knew exactly what was going on.
<P>
	He went on and on. He must have a guilty conscience about 
the fact that he had anything to do with the gang that operated in 
Ottawa for nine years.
<P>
	He then starts talking about the bill being a smoke screen and 
in fact talks about Pearson being a very important economic 
instrument and transportation mechanism. What does he ask 
for? A public inquiry that would probably cost millions and 
millions of taxpayers' dollars and waste a lot more time. We 
need to get on with the planning of Pearson. The bill needs to be 
put in place to effect the cancellation because the former 
government did not put a cancellation clause in the agreement.
<P>
	I find it rather curious that the Bloc talks about integrity. It is 
really talking about wasting a heck of a lot more time so that we 
cannot get on with the business of deciding what we need to do 
in the public interest with regard to Pearson.
<P>
	The comments of the Reform Party were equally absurd. They 
talked about the flawed process, about the flawed contract. Yet 
what is it talking about? It is talking about delaying.
<P>
	The member for Simcoe Centre said that Pearson was an 
important employment generator. We can put people back to 
work. Yet he said Reformers could not support the bill until 
certain other things happen. That is not being fiscally 
responsible, like the Reform Party likes to pretend it is, at least 
in the minds of Canadians. I do not really understand where the 
Reform Party is coming from in terms of delay and timing. We 
want to do exactly what I thought the member said, and that is 
get on with planning the future of Pearson and national 
transportation.
<P>
	I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the 
debate on this important legislation, Bill C-22. I want to add my 
support to the Minister of Transport who has brought this 
legislation forward to cancel the agreements entered into by a 
previous government for the operations of terminal 1 and 
terminal 2 at Pearson International. This is a necessary step not 
only to ensure the future of Pearson but also to restore the faith 
of Canadians in their democratic institutions.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	We are not cancelling this deal because it was fashioned by a 
previous government. To do so simply for partisan reasons 
would be unjustifiably frivolous. Rather the government has 
said that we will build on some of the previous government's 
initiatives when, and I emphasize when, such works serve the 
interests of the people of Canada. Pearson airport did not serve 
those interests.
<P>
	The people of Canada voted in the last election for open and 
transparent government. The process that led to this deal was 
neither open nor transparent, nor did it stand up to scrutiny byan impartial observer, Mr. Robert Nixon. As we all remember,Mr. Nixon, the former Ontario treasurer, advised the 
government to reject the deal saying: ``To leave in place an 
inadequate 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3497"> 3497 </A></B>
<P>
contract,  arrived at with such flawed process and under the 
shadow of possible political manipulation, is unacceptable''.
<P>
	I want to digress perhaps a little for a moment, although it is 
related. One of our important commitments as a government is 
to renewing Canada's infrastructure and that includes our 
transportation system.
<P>
	As my hon. colleague, the Minister of Transport, said in his 
speech in February, we intend to help Canadians build a stronger 
economy. One way to do this is through policies that bring 
immediate gains in transportation efficiencies. This kind of 
forward thinking will contribute to long term economic growth 
by enabling Canadians to do business and move goods quickly 
and efficiently at competitive costs. Yes, we need to improve our 
transportation infrastructure but not at the expense of the long 
term interests of the people of Canada.
<P>
	To get back to this particular deal, perhaps it would be useful 
to look at some history, to get some perspective on where things 
started to come apart. I know that other speakers have already 
indicated that. On April 8, 1987 the then Government of Canada 
issued its policy framework for the management of airports in 
Canada. On June 22, 1987 the government selected the Airport 
Development Corporation to construct and operate Pearson's 
terminal 3. I should point out at the same time that the Leader of 
the Opposition was in the Conservative cabinet.
<P>
	The Falcon Star Group which included the Matthews Group of 
companies was an unsuccessful bidder in this competition back 
on June 22, 1987. In September 1989 the Matthews Group 
submitted an unsolicited proposal to privatize terminals 1 and 2 
but this proposal was not accepted by the then government in 
September of 1989.
<P>
	In October 1990 the then Minister of Transport announced the 
government would privatize terminal 1 and terminal 2 at 
Pearson. A year and a half later on March 11, 1992 the 
government issued an RFP for the privatization and 
redevelopment of terminals 1 and 2. The original RFP provided 
only 90 days for response, although that was extended, if we can 
call it that, by an additional 30 days.
<P>
	It is not as though the construction industry was booming in 
southern Ontario in those days. Yet no other firms were given 
reasonable time to participate, so the process was flawed right 
from the beginning.
<P>
	On December 7, 1992 the government announced Paxport's 
proposal was the best overall, but Paxport still had to 
demonstrate that its proposal was financially viable. When it 
could not do this it turned to Claridge, its rival for financial 
support. By February 1, 1993 Paxport had joined forces with the 
other original bidder in a joint venture partnership which 
became T1 T2 Limited Partnership.
<P>
	By May 1993 when most outstanding issues had been dealt 
with sufficiently for formal negotiations to start, we now find 
that Claridge, the second place finisher, in effective control of 
the joint venture.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	On August 30, 1993 the then Minister of Transport announced 
that a general agreement had been reached to redevelop and 
operate the two terminals. Then just nine short or long days 
later, depending on your perspective, on September 8, 1993 the 
government called the long awaited election. We all remember 
that campaign well and we all remember the concerns raised by 
the public and media about the Pearson deal.
<P>
	The soon to be Prime Minister warned the parties to the deal 
not to sign it, that a new government would not hesitate to cancel 
it if it was not found to be in the public interest.
<P>
	It should perhaps be noted that the circumstances were such 
that the government's chief negotiator asked for written 
instructions about whether to complete the transaction. That 
chief negotiator got those instructions on October 7, 1993 
despite the concerns expressed by many Canadians, the soon to 
be former Prime Minister issued explicit instructions to 
conclude the deal. We now know where the push came from. It 
seems that the Canadian people had some doubts as well and we 
know how they expressed themselves at the ballot boxes.
<P>
	What would the Government of Canada have gained by the 
agreement? Remember the terms of the lease was 37 years with 
an option for an additional 20 years. This means the government 
could well have been signing away control of a major national 
asset for almost three generations.
<P>
	The agreement also included a constraint on alternative 
airport development within a 75-kilometre radius of Pearson. 
How did the previous government suppose this government 
would serve the people of London and the rest of southern 
Ontario by this kind of provision in the agreement?
<P>
	Extensive reviews have shown that the airport facilities in the 
area of south central Ontario must be co-ordinated. Southern 
Ontario airports must, for planning purposes, be considered part 
of a single integrated system. This clause alone would have 
severely constrained future governments, eliminating many 
sound planning options. Under the agreement the government 
could have done nothing to alleviate the pressures of growth at 
other airports until Pearson topped 33 million passengers a year.
<P>
	As Mr. Nixon said in what I take to be restrained 
understatement, the agreement did not serve the public interests.
<P>
	I know my allotted time is running out, but I cannot leave the 
matter without some mention of the appearance of cronyism 
conveyed by this deal. It is this appearance that is so corrosive to 
public confidence in the  government and its institutions. While 
we are not suggesting that anything illegal was done by any of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3498"> 3498 </A></B>
<P>
the parties, some of their actions conveyed the impression that 
they had something to hide.
<P>
	Everyone knows how much concern was expressed about 
lobbyists and political staff seeming to have an inordinate 
influence on decisions that should have been made on the basis 
of public interest, influencing them so much that senior public 
servants felt pressured.
<P>
	We have a long tradition that requires openness and 
transparency in any undertaking that involves the public purse. 
Canadians are entitled to disclosure when it comes to a deal 
affecting their assets.
<P>
	I am afraid there is much more, but time does not permit me to 
examine the rest of it. What is also important now is that it is 
time to move forward. The government understands that the 
people of Ontario, in fact all Canadians affected by Pearson's 
operations, would like a prompt decision on how we are going to 
manage Pearson. That is one good reason for proceeding with 
the bill, to cancel the agreement as we must formally through 
this legislation as quickly as possible. Pearson is too important a 
national asset to languish while we debate. The Minister of 
Industry said when he introduced the bill: ``We need to get the 
cancellation over with so we can get on with the job of planning 
for its future operations''.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	However, as has been clearly stated by the Minister of 
Transport, we will not be put in the untenable position of 
cobbling together a solution. Pearson is too important and we 
are too much aware of our responsibility to Canadians to rush 
simply for the sake of doing something, anything, as some 
members opposite seem to want us to do without proper care for 
the long term effects of our decision.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that the decisions we take at Pearson 
do not just affect that single airport. That is why we are 
consulting with a great many people. Yes, we are consulting 
with our Toronto members of Parliament. They were elected and 
are the rightful voice of their constituents in Parliament, in our 
caucus and in our government. We will consult with provincial, 
municipal and regional governments and local community 
leaders. We are doing that and the minister is doing that. We 
intend to do it right, not like the previous government has done.
<P>
	In fact, as some of our other counterparts have indicated in the 
debate this morning, Pearson is not a local airport. It is a 
national airport and we are seeking national consultation.
<P>
	The fact that our party is a national party with representatives 
from all parts of this country is a positive for us, not a negative. I 
cannot say that about the Bloc which only has members in one 
province nor the Reform Party which has members in only two 
or three provinces. We are a national party with national 
representation. We  will consult with our national caucuses as to 
what to do about our national airport.
<P>
	The government intends to make a final decision on Pearson's 
administrative structure before the end of this year. It is now 
time to close the book on this sorry chapter and move forward 
with planning for the future of Canada's transportation hub. 
Passing the legislation will allow us to plan the future of Pearson 
unencumbered by these flawed agreements.
<P>
	No one should be surprised by anything in the legislation. It is 
nothing more than what we said we would do before the election, 
after the election, and when we introduced the legislation.
<P>
	We will negotiate only for out of pocket expenses. We will not 
negotiate for lost profits and we will not negotiate for lobbyist 
fees. We are doing what the Bloc has indicated we should not; 
we are doing what the Reform has indicated we should not, 
which is to negotiate lobbyist fees. We will not pay for lobbyist 
fees. We will not pay for lost profit. We will pay for out of 
pocket expenses.
<P>
	The legislation does not limit the amount of any potential 
payment nor does it preclude any continued negotiations 
because negotiations must continue. It does make clear to all the 
parties what the government is and is not prepared to consider. It 
makes it clear that these negotiations cannot go on indefinitely.
<P>
	We are not saying that lobbyists should not be paid. We are 
saying these parties should take up the matter with the people 
who employed them, the developers, and not the taxpayers of the 
country.
<P>
	I would like to close with this reminder. The most important 
asset a government can have is the confidence of its citizens. 
During the nine years of the previous government-and I was 
happy to hear the history lesson from the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois because he participated in part of those nine years in 
that government-we saw a steady erosion of confidence in the 
public sector.
<P>
	This erosion had many causes, from the behaviour of certain 
elected politicians to an arrogant style of political leadership. 
One of the key causes of this erosion was the practice of 
conducting public business behind closed doors giving the idea 
of favouritism.
<P>
	Canadians deserve better. The government intends to do 
better by delivering to Canadians the leadership and the 
innovation demanded by today's changes backed by integrity 
and supported by principles that will never be sacrificed to 
expediency.
<P>

<HR>

<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	We look forward to working with both parties at committee to 
improve the legislation, if we can. We need to get on with the 
business of planning Pearson's future. We cannot unless we pass 
the legislation. I look forward to the comments of members from 
both sides.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Prior to going to the 
questions and comments section, the subamendment as 
proposed by the hon. member for Simcoe Centre is procedurally 
acceptable, as long as he is asking that we insert the words ``in 
Canada'' after the word ``lobbyist''. Is that correct?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> That is correct, Madam 
Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I would like to place a couple of comments on the record before 
putting a question to the hon. parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	Bill C-22 is reasonable, prudent and protects the Canadian 
taxpayers. After all, the developers behind the Pearson deal 
were warned. The Liberal Party stated long before the 1993 
election that it smelled something rotten in this deal. We put it 
on record that we would take this action if we found there was 
something rotten about the deal. The Nixon report confirmed 
that and now we have Bill C-22. It is the only course of action to 
take.
<P>
	Leading up to my question I am glad the government is taking 
this action. It indicates to me that the government is committed 
to transparency and accountability.
<P>
	The House probably already knows that airport authorities are 
being proposed for other centres in Canada, including my home 
city of Winnipeg. The hold-over model proposed by the former 
government for the proposed airport authority in Winnipeg is 
flawed.
<P>
	In my opinion the accountability under the plan proposed by 
the Conservative government is weak. Transparency is not 
there. For example there is no provision for the public tendering 
process. The conflict of interest guidelines are a joke and 
representation can certainly be improved.
<P>
	If we are going to go ahead with establishing airport 
authorities, be it one to replace the Pearson deal in Toronto or to 
replace other Transport Canada management at other centres in 
the country, let us get it right. Let us get it down so we do have 
public accountability, transparency and so on.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. parliamentary secretary could answer my 
questions. Are we going to establish further airport authorities 
of the kind proposed in Winnipeg, not for profit but still an 
airport authority, a kind of privatization? When these airport 
authorities are established will public accountability be the top 
priority?
<P>
	I do not want private clubs operating airports. I want bodies 
that operate airports in the public interest and have public 
accountability at the top of the list.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fontana:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the comments 
made by my colleague from Winnipeg St. James. He has touched 
on a number of important issues with regard to local airport 
authorities. He is absolutely right that we want to get it right, 
that we want to do it right.
<P>
	The government has learned from mistakes made by others. 
The Minister of Transport and Transport Canada are looking at 
ways of fixing those flaws the member talked about with regard 
to local airport authorities. There are tremendous opportunities.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	The minister sees it that way. Transport Canada sees it that 
way. Local communities can play a positive, constructive and 
proactive role in running airports to be the economic 
instruments they can be, but not to the detriment of public 
interest. We are defining what that public interest is in terms of 
safety and other matters.
<P>
	The member is right on. We intend to make sure the local 
airport authority provisions are enhanced to make them much 
more accountable, much more transparent. We intend to ensure 
there is broad representation on those boards, to ensure the 
bottom line is that the interests of the community are always at 
the top of the heap so to speak.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for his constructive suggestions. We 
hope to have those revisions in place as soon as possible. As the 
member has indicated a number of communities are looking at 
opportunities.
<P>
	As the Reform Party keeps reminding us, the government 
wants to be as effective and as efficient as it possibly can to save 
taxpayers money. If the local airport authorities can do the job 
well and protect the public interests as well as further their own 
local objectives, why not? The government is prepared to look at 
that.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> I detect some 
contradiction in the words of the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Transport, and I will explain why.
<P>
	It seems to me that the parliamentary secretary is speaking 
from both sides of the mouth, not at the same time, of course, but 
I will explain myself.
<P>
	On March 10, the Minister of Transport, in response to the 
Budget Speech of the Minister of Finance, said in several 
places-I do not have the <I>Hansard</I> with me, but I studied his 
speech very well-that several activities currently conducted by 
Transport Canada would have to be sold and privatized.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3500"> 3500 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like the parliamentary secretary to indicate to me 
whether there is not a contradiction in what he was saying earlier 
about the fact that the Pearson airport should continue to be part 
of the public heritage.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fontana:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the comment and 
question by my colleague the transport critic for the Bloc.
<P>
	The minister and the government have indicated that 
Transport Canada and our government want to look at 
commercialization opportunities. Commercialization does not 
necessarily mean the same as turning over or privatizing so that 
the private interest is protected and the public interest is not.
<P>
	The member will know we have already announced some 
measures such as the air navigation system. We will be 
consulting all the stakeholders to find out if there is a better way 
of controlling our air navigation system to make sure that safety 
is paramount, that all the stakeholders have input into the 
system, and at the same time save the taxpayers some money.
<P>
	I do not have to tell the member why we need to look at 
opportunities for saving money. We have a deficit and a debt to 
deal with. The taxpayers also demand that this government look 
at every opportunity to make sure we are as efficient and as 
effective as possible, but not to give up the public interest.
<P>
	We are not in any position to make an announcement as to how 
we will deal with Pearson. That announcement will come as the 
minister indicated and as I indicated in my speech. By the end of 
the year we will put forward our plan of action for Pearson, not 
only the administrative structure but also the plans we have for 
its future. We are consulting.
<P>
	It is not inconsistent nor is it talking out of both sides of the 
mouth to say that the deal structured by the former government 
was a bad deal. It was badly structured. It was a bad process, 
repugnant to taxpayers. The detail and substance of the deal 
were bad and not in good public interest.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	We do not intend to make the same mistakes. We have learned 
from other people's mistakes, hopefully. We will put together a 
plan for Pearson, other airports, other modes of transportation, 
be it the seaway, be it rail, be it marine, be it highways, to work 
in co-operation with all the stakeholders, the provinces, 
municipalities, communities, anyone we have to, to make sure 
that Canada has the most effective, efficient, integrated 
transportation system to serve Canadians.
<P>
	At the end of the day Canadians have to compete with the 
Americans, with the Mexicans, with the global community. 
Unless we can move goods and people as efficiently as we 
possibly can and at the best costs we cannot compete. If we 
cannot compete we do not have  jobs and if we do not have jobs 
we have economic and social problems.
<P>
	I would hope that commercialization is not a bad word. It is an 
opportunity that the government wants to look at to see how 
much more efficient and effective we can be in all modes of 
transportation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> Madam Speaker, you 
will understand that, as transport critic for the Official 
Opposition, I am extremely interested in Bill C-22 which was 
presented at first reading on April 13, 1993. I also carefully 
reviewed the report Mr. Robert Nixon submitted to the hon. 
Prime Minister on November 29, 1993.
<P>
	I did not waste any time in studying the contract signed on 
October 7, 1993 by the Government of Canada and T1 T2 
Limited Partnership. I also asked certain employee associations 
for their opinion and consulted with some airport managers. I 
will not violate any official secrets by saying that, after these 
consultations and all that reading, I agree with the amendment 
proposed by the Leader of the Opposition and ask this House to 
authorize a Royal Commission to hold an inquiry on the 
circumstances surrounding the deal entered into by the 
government and T1 T2 Limited Partnership.
<P>
	In its present form, Bill C-22 contains a dozen clauses. We 
agree with some of them but cannot support the wording of 
subsection 10(1), and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If the Minister considers it appropriate to do so, the Minister may, with the 
approval of the Governor in Council, enter into agreement on behalf of Her 
Majesty to provide for the payment of such amounts as the Minister considers 
appropriate in connection with the coming into force of this Act, subject to the 
terms and conditions the Minister considers appropriate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	During the election campaign, the leader of the Liberal Party 
of Canada, the present Prime Minister, made it very clear to the 
parties involved that he would have no qualms about cancelling 
the deal after he was elected. Following this statement, the chief 
negotiator for the former government requested written 
instructions on whether to complete the transaction. The then 
Conservative Prime Minister specifically requested that the 
agreement be signed that very day. However, concluding a 
transaction of this magnitude in the midst of an election 
campaign, effectively tying the newly elected government to the 
previous government's policies, flies in the face of normal 
democratic practices.
<P>
	We must admit that the new Liberal Prime Minister, who was 
elected last October 27, wasted no time in dealing with the 
situation, announcing on December 3, 1993 the cancellation of 
the Pearson Airport privatization deal. Unfortunately, he 
probably soon realized that some of the people involved in that 
deal belonged to his party. It is probably why, on April 13, 1994, 
his government presented a bill to finalize the cancellation 
while reserving the right, under subsection  10(1), to enter into 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3501"> 3501 </A></B>
<P>
agreements on behalf of Her Majesty to provide for the payment 
of such amounts he himself considers appropriate.
<P>
	You will understand that to exclude Parliament from such an 
important decision and to give a blank cheque to Cabinet, 
especially the minister of Transport, is unacceptable.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	During the last campaign, our party mentioned that the 
Liberals and the Tories were so similar that they were like two 
peas in a pod or ``blanc bonnet, bonnet blanc'', as we say in 
Beauport and on Île d'Orléans. This bill confirms it.
<P>
	It is unacceptable for payment of compensation to be 
authorized without even being sure such compensation is 
warranted. When examining all the documents, and particularly 
the lengthy Nixon report, I wonder if there was any wrongdoing 
in that operation and I am very concerned about the answer.
<P>
	After the royal commission of inquiry has made its review, 
after its decision and recommendations, maybe we will come to 
the conclusion that it is rather T1 T2 Limited Partnership that 
should pay compensation to the Canadian government. If 
however the royal commission concludes that there is 
compensation to be paid, Parliament will still be in a position to 
make a fair and enlightened decision.
<P>
	I mentioned that we were not in agreement with section 10(1), 
but I would like to add that there should be another section in the 
bill saying who should manage Pearson International Airport. 
We all know that Transport Canada still operates the airport, but 
we would have liked to see this bill determine clearly that the 
Toronto airport should be under the management of a non-profit 
organisation just like the Montreal, Calgary, Vancouver and 
Edmonton airports.
<P>
	In these cases, management is a group of people from the 
local community so they are quite capable of defending the 
interests of those they represent. Let me just give as an example 
Aéroports de Montréal, the corporation that operates the two 
Montreal airports; the members of its board come from the 
business community and are also board members of the 
SOPRAM, the corporation responsible for the promotion of 
Montreal airports.
<P>
	The eighth member is the president and chief executive 
officer of Aéroports de Montréal, ADM if you will. It is also 
interesting to note that SOPRAM is a non-profit organization 
comprising 21 members appointed by the following 
organisations: the City of Montreal, the City of Laval, the 
Conférence des maires de banlieue, the Chambre de commerce 
du Montréal métropolitain, the Board of Trade of Metropolitan 
Montreal, the Corporation de promotion de l'aéroport de 
Mirabel (COPAM), the Société montérégienne de 
développement (SMD) and the city of Longueuil.
<P>
	This kind of representation means that the corporation is 
sensitive to local interests and has a perspective rooted into the 
business community. This is a prerequisite that we would have 
liked to see in Bill C-22. I would like to come back to the royal 
commission we are requesting. Why should we have a 
commission of inquiry? There are several reasons.
<P>
	The first would be to determine why, on March 11, 1992, the 
government asked formally for proposals regarding the 
privatization of Terminals 1 and 2 of Pearson Airport. There 
would be only one phase and no prequalification, contrary to the 
process for Terminal 3, which was to be in two phases.
<P>
	The second reason is that, looking at the Nixon report, we note 
that the call for tenders left only a very short time, 90 days, 
which meant that only groups closely connected with the 
operation of the airport, like Claridge and Paxport, could 
possibly submit a valid tender. This explains why only two 
tenders were received. Paxport had already submitted a 
privatization plan in 1989, but had had to withdraw, and 
Claridge was operating Terminal 3.
<P>
	The third reason is to determine why the contract was signed 
on October 7, 1993, during the election campaign, and despite 
the fact that the very hesitant chief negotiator had asked for 
written instructions before signing the deal.
<P>
	The fourth reason is to determine what role did the lobbyists 
played and whom they lobbied. The fifth one, to determine the 
cost to the public of this hasty decision, and who really 
benefitted from it. The sixth one, to establish why the 
Conservative government sought to privatize Pearson Airport, 
the most profitable in Canada. The seventh reason, to find out 
why the government allowed T1 T2 Limited Partnership a rate of 
return of 24 per cent before taxes and 14 per cent after taxes.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	The eighth reason is to see why the Nixon Report recommends 
that no compensation be paid for lost business opportunities and 
lobbying costs. Have the commissioners uncovered even more 
irregularities than we know of?
<P>
	The ninth reason is to determine the role of certain 
stakeholders closely linked either to the Conservative Party or 
to the Liberal Party of Canada.
<P>
	The tenth reason is the answer to the following question: Why 
did the government not include in Bill C-22 a clause allowing it 
to transfer the Pearson Airport administration to a non-profit 
organization?
<P>
	These are some of the reasons why a royal commission of 
inquiry is needed to arrive at a well advised decision. It is also 
important that the commission clearly indicate the impact of 
lobbyists in this case. It must examine the costs to the taxpayers, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3502"> 3502 </A></B>
<P>
the impact on jobs in the Metro Toronto area, and especially, the 
impact on transportation in Canada.
<P>
	I will be focusing in particular on the repercussions of this 
transaction on Canadian transportation. My colleagues will 
discuss not only the impact on public finances and on jobs in the 
Metro Toronto area, but also the role of lobbyists in this affair.
<P>
	Airports, along with aircraft and human resources, are the 
mainstay of the air transport industry. Airport facilities allow 
you to increase the number of destinations, accommodate 
various types of aircraft and provide different kinds of services.
<P>
	Air transportation has a great influence on the overall 
economy of a region. An airport is the point of arrival for foreign 
investors and the point of departure for local human and 
non-human resources. For the region where it is located as well 
as for the destinations it is linked with, an airport is considered a 
significant economic lever.
<P>
	According to a study conducted by the École des hautes études 
commerciales of Montreal in the late 1980s, the contribution of 
Montreal airports to the Gross Domestic Product in terms of 
value added in 1992 was expected to be $1.3 billion in direct 
effects only and $2.2 billion in both direct and indirect effects.
<P>
	To show just how airport facilities can influence regional 
development, let me quote from an IATA report issued in 
December 1991. In Toronto, the addition of a runway would 
mean $3.5 billion more in revenues for the region over the next 
15 years and $9 billion more for the province. The impact on the 
employment situation would be significant: locally, the addition 
of the runway would create 3,300 new jobs every year and 3,700 
jobs throughout Ontario, which comes to over 7,000 new jobs 
for Ontario.
<P>
	Also, in its October 1992 issue, the magazine <I>L'Actualité</I> 
reported that the number and frequency of air transport 
communications between major cities is the fifth criterion used 
by potential investors.
<P>
	The air transport industry depends directly on airport 
facilities. Carriers are the primary clients of airports and it is 
thanks to the serviceability of airport facilities that airlines can 
develop and generate by their activities considerable revenues 
for the community.
<P>
	The main cause of these decreases is quite clear. In the mid 
1960s, projections for future passenger and cargo traffic led 
authorities to plan the building of a second airport in Montreal, 
that is Mirabel. According to the projections made in 1967 for 
the 1980s, we were to expect 14 million passengers and 
2,020,000 tons of cargo by 1985.
<P>
	Also in the mid 1960s, we anticipated a 15 per cent growth 
rate for passenger traffic in the Montreal area, that is 
approximately 10,600,000 passengers for 1975, the year 
Mirabel was going to be inaugurated.
<P>
	Lastly, Mirabel was to be the sole gateway in Canada for all 
transatlantic flights and, eventually, for all international flights 
other than transborder flights.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Things did not turn out that way. In 1985, the combined 
passenger traffic for Dorval and Mirabel was 7 million 
passengers, that is half of what was initially projected. In 1985, 
the combined cargo traffic for Dorval and Mirabel was 
approximately 105,000 tons, which is less than what Dorval 
handled alone in 1975. This cargo is 5 per cent of what was 
projected in 1967.
<P>
	In the years following the inauguration of Mirabel Airport, 
Montreal lost the preferential status that it had been promised. 
Mirabel is no longer the only gateway in Canada and more and 
more airlines are authorized to offer direct flights from other 
Canadian airports to foreign destinations.
<P>
	Between 1966 and 1975, passenger traffic in Montreal grew 
by about 9.9 per cent, which is 5 per cent less than expected. 
However, the growth rate did not remain steady after 1975. 
Between 1975 and 1984, passenger traffic grew by only 2.24 per 
cent, which represents an annual growth rate of less than one 
quarter of one per cent. So, the growth rate at both Montreal 
airports was about 10 per cent of the Canadian growth rate 
during the same period.
<P>
	Between 1975 and 1984, increases in passenger traffic 
occurred mainly in Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, 
Ottawa and Halifax. Montreal accounted for only 1.86 per cent 
of the overall growth in traffic in Canada during this nine-year 
period. Also, during the last ten years, that is from 1981 to 1991, 
the growth rate of passenger traffic in Montreal was minimal 
compared to the 44.55 per cent rate recorded in Toronto.
<P>
	In 1981, Dorval and Mirabel handled 7.5 million passengers a 
year, whereas Toronto handled 14.7 million. The slow growth of 
airport activity in Montreal since the early 70s is especially 
notable compared to what happened in Toronto over the same 
period. Statistical data are a proven measure of airport activity.
<P>
	Therefore, one can imagine that the negative impact of this 
shift in economic activity from Montreal to Toronto has played a 
major role in the erosion of Air Canada's pilot base in Montreal 
in favour of Ontario's capital. For example, in 1979, Air Canada 
had 461 pilots based in Montreal and 451 in Toronto, a 
difference of 10 in favour of Montreal. Some 13 years later, in 
1992, Air Canada had 301 pilots based in Montreal and 781 in 
Toronto, a difference of 480 in favour of Toronto. Over a 
13-year period, Montreal lost 160 pilots whereas Toronto 
gained 480 pilots. This 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3503"> 3503 </A></B>
<P>
about-turn is due mainly to the fact that Montreal has lost its 
privileged status with  regard to direct flights to Europe, which 
allowed a shift in economic activity from Montreal to Toronto.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to quote the words of Mr. Tory Hine, 
financial analyst for Scotia McLeod, as reported by the 
magazine <I>Wings</I>, vol. 5, in the fall of 1992.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``We have an airline industry concentrated on a single hub, 
Pearson International in Toronto, with secondary hubs in 
Vancouver, the Pacific gateway and Montreal. The position and 
dominance of the Toronto hub is the single asset of Canada's 
industry. The potential for Toronto to be the North American 
scale hub is important for the jobs and revenue which would be 
created in the Toronto area, but it also provides an important link 
which enables Canada to participate fully in both the 
Canada-U.S. and North American free trade agreements. The 
split of Montreal's two airports between international services 
at Mirabel and domestic and transborder services at Dorval 
means that the two airports are relegated to serving primarily the 
local market. Montreal as a result has not emerged as a full 
hub''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Again, if Montreal could have maintained the status it 
enjoyed in the seventies, it would not have to limit itself to 
serving local routes.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, the Montreal airports authority manages 
Montreal's two airports very well. Business people and airport 
people are talking to each other and the best solution will soon 
be found. Hopefully, the Montreal airports authority will try to 
convince airlines to have their inspection and maintenance work 
done in a place where air traffic is already heavy. This would 
have a major impact on employment at the Air Canada technical 
maintenance centre in Montreal, where close to 3,500 people 
work and which is known around the world for its excellence and 
expertise.
<P>
	My party does not intend to take the place of local people 
when it comes to deciding whether there should be one or two 
airports in Montreal. We are convinced that they are able to 
make the right decisions.
<P>
	The government will soon have important decisions to make 
concerning Pearson Airport, and I am not talking about 
compensation, but about its future and administration. Before 
making decisions that could result in one area of the country 
being more prosperous than another, would it not be a good idea 
to review the whole Canadian airport system, to discuss with 
business people and specialized agencies, and to involve the 
provincial governments so that all regions, and not only one, can 
prosper?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (St. Paul's):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of Bill C-22, an act respecting certain agreements 
concerning the redevelopment and operation of terminals 1 and 
2 at Lester B. Pearson International Airport.
<P>
	This is the bill to cancel the agreements made by the previous 
government for the operation of terminals 1 and 2 at Pearson 
airport. As my colleague, the member for London East, made 
clear a few moments ago, it is time we close the book on this 
ill-conceived project so that we can get on with the important 
work of planning Pearson's future.
<P>
	I support the bill for a number of reasons because it puts an 
end to agreements contrary to the public interest reached 
through what have been described charitably as a flawed 
process. The legislation enables the government to get on with 
planning the future of Pearson airport and air transportation and 
that future is too important to be tied up in procedural knots.
<P>
	Most of all, the bill should be supported because it clears the 
decks for the serious work of rebuilding Canada's transportation 
system, including our air transportation network which has 
Pearson as its hub.
<P>
	One of the government's first priorities is to secure Canada's 
economic future, a task in which transportation plays a key role. 
There is no question that the cost of moving goods and people is 
a major factor in our nation's economic health. For Canada it is a 
daily challenge.
<P>
	The growth and prosperity of the country have always 
depended on transportation. This was true before Confederation 
and it is true today. It is even truer today; a fast, reliable, low 
cost transportation system is vital to Canada's prosperity. It is 
the life support system of the country's exports and a critical 
factor in our competitiveness. It is transportation which keeps 
us together as a nation.
<P>
	Air travel plays a particularly important role in binding the 
country together. It is how we travel when we go home for the 
holidays, when we take a vacation, when we seek out new 
business. Pearson is the hub of air transportation in Canada, our 
largest airport, one of North America's busiest gateways. 
One-third of all air travellers in Canada pass through Lester B. 
Pearson International Airport. Twenty-one million people 
passing through on their way to visit friends and family make 
business connections or even take their first steps on Canadian 
soil.
<P>
	As Mr. Nixon said in his report to the Prime Minister, Pearson 
is a critical national gateway and a hub service to travellers, 
families and shippers. It cannot be duplicated by any other 
facility in the area, indeed in the province or in the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3504"> 3504 </A></B>
<P>
	However Pearson is more than a transportation hub. It is also 
an economic generator for southern Ontario. The airport 
generates employment for 57,000 people directly and indirectly, 
including 14,000 people who work on site, and these jobs 
generate almost $2 billion a year in personal income. Add to that 
the almost $4 billion a year in direct revenue for local businesses 
and tourism and the $633 million in taxes from airport activity 
that go to various governmental jurisdictions. That gives us 
some idea of the airport's economic contribution to southern 
Ontario, the greater Toronto area, and all of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	When we consider its economic and social importance to the 
region, the provinces and the country we see that Pearson is far 
more than a transportation facility. It is one of the most 
important public assets in our economy, an airport which serves 
the entire region, Ontario and all of Canada.
<P>
	It is incredible to me that the previous government would 
have planned to sign away this vital asset in the heat of an 
election campaign without financial prequalification and 
constraining airport development in the entire region.
<P>
	As Mr. Nixon concluded, this was an inadequate contract, 
arrived at in a flawed process and under the shadow of possible 
political manipulation. This deal was contrary to public good.
<P>
	Being against the Pearson deal is not the same as being against 
renewal of our transportation system; far from it. As the 
Minister of Transport said in his response to the budget, the 
government is fully committed to helping Canadians build a 
stronger economy. An essential part of this effort is renewing 
Canada's infrastructure and that includes our transportation 
system. This renewal will contribute to long term economic 
growth by enabling Canadians to transact their business and 
move their goods quickly, efficiently and at competitive cost.
<P>
	The government is committed to improving transportation 
effectiveness, but we must avoid simplified solutions that stem 
from a political agenda rather than clear eyed planning. We must 
avoid sacrificing the interests of the nation as a whole to serve a 
narrow, ideologically based vision.
<P>
	That is why the government is developing a national 
transportation policy, a framework to allow us to retool our 
facilities and services to meet current and future needs.
<P>
	To meet these needs we need to develop an integrated 
transportation system. To get maximum benefits from 
transportation we have to focus on the entire system, not on its 
parts, its many parts. The transition may be difficult, especially 
for aspects or facets of our struggling transportation industry 
but it must be done.
<P>
	We must also encourage and stimulate competition. 
Government can do this by providing the regulatory framework, 
incentives, and infrastructure the private sector needs to deliver 
transportation services competitively and safely.
<P>
	The government intends to pursue a pragmatic mix of modal 
integration, innovation and realism. Transport Canada is 
reviewing all its policies and programs. This review is intended 
to address the challenges and pressures facing Canada's 
transportation sector through a comprehensive, coherent 
strategy of reform.
<P>
	Being against the flawed Pearson deal does not mean being 
against private sector participation in what were once viewed as 
traditional government activities.
<P>
	The government does not believe that it has to own and 
operate a system in order to achieve its public policy goals, but 
government does have as role to play as a facilitator, as a 
catalyst, setting goals, providing direction, monitoring 
performance, making sure the job gets done fairly and 
effectively.
<P>
	Yes, the federal government has a responsibility to ensure that 
Canada has the national transportation system it needs and we 
intend to live up to that responsibility. We see no reason why the 
private sector should not be invited to do what it does best. The 
government believes that commercialisation is an attractive 
option, one that brings business discipline to the provision of 
services that have traditionally been delivered by government.
<P>
	However commercialisation does not necessarily mean 
outright privatization. It can take many forms, ranging from the 
contracting out of services, public-private partnerships, 
non-profit entities, special operating agencies, crown 
corporations.
<P>
	Regardless of what form it takes, what is essential is a 
business like approach to the provision of services, an approach 
that is more efficient, more responsive and less dependent on the 
Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	This will result in better capital planning, access to private 
financing, faster approval, easier introduction of new 
technologies and more user and client input. For example, the 
government sees great potential for commercializing the air 
navigation system. The International Civil Aviation 
Organization cites a clear trend toward the establishment of 
autonomous authorities to own and operate AMS facilities 
around the world.
<P>
	Commercialization in these and many other areas of 
government activity can bring major savings to taxpayers and 
better service to clients. Any move to commercialization must 
always maintain Canada's high transportation standards. 
Cancelling this deal is not an attack on the private sector. It is an 
attack on what is a flawed, suspect deal contrary to the public 
interest.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3505"> 3505 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	Our action in regard to this transaction does not rule out future 
involvement by the private sector in some of the activities now 
undertaken by government. We will look at every opportunity to 
collaborate with the private sector to provide transportation 
services to Canadians.
<P>
	The private sector has a role to play in airport operations. 
Non-profit private sector management groups now have 
responsibility for five of Canada's major airports. We must take 
the necessary action to terminate the ill-conceived terminals 1 
and 2 deal and allow the government to move forward with its 
plans for Pearson.
<P>
	Under the proposed legislation the government may make a 
payment to developers, but this will not include lost profits or 
any fees paid for lobbying. The Minister of Industry said when 
he introduced the bill: ``We publicly asked the previous 
government and the company not to conclude this highly 
controversial deal during the election campaign. They chose to 
proceed anyway''.
<P>
	The legislation does not stop or hinder any negotiations or 
compensation. It simply sets the necessary limit on how long 
this process should go on, how long negotiations might block 
resolution of this matter.
<P>
	The government prefers a negotiated settlement. However 
once this legislation is passed and proclaimed the government 
and the developers will have 30 days to come to an agreement. 
After that there will be no further discussion and no additional 
compensation. After all, the government has been negotiating 
with Pearson Development Corporation on behalf of T1 T2 
Limited Partnership since last December when the Prime 
Minister announced that the government would cancel the 
agreements.
<P>
	I remind the House that the legislation is required to finalize 
the cancellation of this contract because the original agreement 
negotiated by the previous government did not include a 
cancellation clause.
<P>
	The transport minister has said decisions affecting airport 
expansion projects are linked directly to decisions on the 
airport's management structure. These decisions cannot be 
made as long as the previous agreements are in place. That 
means nothing can move forward until we have cancelled this 
agreement which should not have been made in the first place. 
Our decisions with respect to Pearson can no longer be held 
hostage to those agreements.
<P>
	One result would be that there would be no new construction 
this year on terminal 1 and terminal 2 development or runway 
expansion projects at Pearson. I am sure we would all agree that 
it is in the best interest of the people of southern Ontario and the 
country in general to move as quickly as possible to develop a 
new administrative structure for the airport so that we can move 
ahead in making the critical decisions to maintain Pearson as a 
vital economic asset for the entire country.
<P>
	The time to act is now. We can no longer allow this to proceed. 
The passage of the legislation will allow the development of 
Canada's air transportation hub to proceed in the public interest 
unhindered by yesterday's mistakes. We must proceed now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, what a 
strange situation we find ourselves in today, debating whether or 
not to pass a bill which might control the amount of 
compensation which can be paid as a result of the cancellation of 
the Pearson airport privatization deal.
<P>
	Under normal commercial circumstances in the private sector 
cancellation of a contract usually means a negotiated or litigated 
settlement which takes into account the lost opportunities and 
the lost profits.
<P>
	Admittedly these private sector negotiations can sometimes 
take years to complete. It is often only the lawyers who make 
money out of the whole exercise. However an entity in the 
private sector does not have the luxury of legislating itself to be 
exempt from the obligation to compensate another party when it 
breaks an agreement.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	Generally speaking there is something unattractive in the idea 
that a government can do what the private enterprise cannot do 
by exempting itself from the need to compensate a group and to 
also exempt itself from the ability of someone to start litigation 
against it.
<P>
	I must admit I feel somewhat uncomfortable about the reality 
of the bill, the fact that the government could introduce such a 
bill to protect itself. I know this Liberal government has a large 
proportion of lawyers in its ranks whereas within the Reform 
caucus we only have one lawyer.
<P>
	Perhaps it is this abundance of lawyers in the Liberal Party 
that has driven the introduction of the bill. Perhaps they are 
celebrating what must be every lawyer's dream, the ability to 
control the outcome of a case. Why would one need a judge and 
jury when one can simply legislate the outcome of the event with 
no recourse?
<P>
	I admit feeling somewhat uncomfortable about this situation 
although I also admit that the circumstances in this situation are 
rather unique. It was August 1993 when the then Minister of 
Transport announced that a general agreement had been reached 
with the Pearson Development Corporation to redevelop 
terminals 1 and 2.
<P>
	The minister indicated that the agreement would be finalized 
in the fall with a legal document for the long term management 
operation and redevelopment of the terminals. What an 
impressive list of players there were involved. Included were 
Donald Matthew, a former Tory president and fundraiser; Otto 
Jelinek, a former Tory cabinet minister; Bill Neville, formerly a 
Tory chief of staff and part of the transition team for the 
previous Prime Minister. There was a Quebec multimillionaire, 
Charles Bronf-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3506"> 3506 </A></B>
<P>
man. There were also some well known  Liberals, a certain 
senator, Herb Metcalfe, and Bob Wright, a Liberal fundraiser.
<P>
	It is the involvement of these high profile Liberals that caused 
me to use the word might in my opening sentence when I said the 
bill might control the amount of compensation. Could it be that 
clause 10 of the bill will allow the Minister of Transport to look 
after Liberal friends while shutting others out?
<P>
	The portion of the bill in question reads: ``If the minister 
considers it appropriate to do so, the minister may with the 
approval of the Governor in Council enter into agreements on 
behalf of Her Majesty to provide for the payment of such 
amounts as the minister considers appropriate''.
<P>
	The question I have is whether appropriate compensation for a 
Liberal supporter will be different from appropriate 
compensation for someone else. One wonders aloud. Despite all 
this, there is one aspect to the circumstances surrounding the 
signing and subsequent cancellation of the Pearson deal that 
provides a powerful argument for supporting Bill C-22.
<P>
	It comes from the natural sense of justice that a person feels 
when having warned someone that there will be consequences of 
an action, that person defies the warning, goes ahead with the 
action and subsequently does indeed suffer the consequences.
<P>
	Just nine days after the Pearson agreement announcement of 
August 30, 1993, the previous Prime Minister called the 
election. Prior to the conclusion of the legal agreement on 
Pearson, the then Leader of the Opposition, now Prime Minister, 
clearly stated that parties taking part in the agreement did so at 
their own risk because a Liberal government would not hesitate 
to pass legislation to block the privatization of terminals 1 and 2 
if the transaction was not in the private interest.
<P>
	The chief negotiator for the government at the time took the 
statement so seriously that he asked for written instructions 
about whether to complete the transaction. On October 7, 1993 
in the final days of her government, the previous Prime Minister 
gave her written instructions to complete the deal and the same 
day the agreement was made.
<P>
	Subsequent events, starting October 28, 1993 with the 
appointment of Robert Nixon to review the deal, have resulted in 
its cancellation. Although the idea that a government can 
exempt itself from responsibility for compensation bothers me, 
on balance I would tend to support the bill because all parties to 
the agreement were clearly warned of the consequences. 
Perhaps some of them even believed that the deal would be 
cancelled but took a gamble that compensation would be paid in 
the normal manner after cancellation. Quite a gamble.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	I doubt that any party to the agreement could claim that there 
was not an awareness of the stand of the present Prime Minister 
on the issue when he was in opposition back in October 1993. 
There was plenty of publicity and plenty of reason to believe 
that the deal would indeed be cancelled if the Liberals took 
power. At the time the polls certainly showed that to be a 
possibility.
<P>
	Incidentally I have often wondered why those same pollsters 
who so confidently predicted a win for the Liberals never 
realized that Reform would get 52 seats. I wonder whether they 
really knew and suppressed the information or whether they did 
not conduct a reasonable poll.
<P>
	I will continue to listen to the debate on Bill C-22 and will 
continue to take input from my constituents who have been 
writing me letters and making occasional phone calls on the 
issue. I would urge all other members to do the same: listen to 
the debate and receive input from their constituents before they 
make the final decision on whether to support Bill C-22.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
honoured to rise to speak in favour of Bill C-22. I will start by 
identifying what we are talking about, specifically looking at 
Toronto area airport issues.
<P>
	Pearson International Airport is Canada's premier airport. 
Thirty per cent of all air passengers in Canada go through 
Pearson; 20 million passengers in 1992. It is among the top 30 
airports internationally, the third largest gateway to North 
America after JFK airport and the Miami airport. It is a critical 
hub for many smaller cities in Ontario and indeed Canada.
<P>
	It has 15,000 employees on site. It creates 56,000 jobs in 
Ontario and accounts for over $4 billion of annual economic 
activity. That is the reason why the Pearson airport issue is so 
important.
<P>
	We have before us Bill C-22 to deal specifically with matters 
pertaining to Pearson. I would like to give some background 
events leading up to the legal agreements which Bill C-22 deals 
with.
<P>
	In 1989 the Matthews Group of companies submitted an 
unsolicited proposal to the federal government to privatize 
terminals 1 and 2 at Pearson. The government did not accept that 
proposal, but the following year it did announce that it would 
proceed with a request for proposals to obtain private sector 
participation in the modernization of the two terminals at 
Pearson.
<P>
	The request for proposals for the privatization and the 
redevelopment of terminals 1 and 2 was issued by the federal 
government in March 1992 and the bidders were given 90 days 
to respond. Two bids were submitted: one by Paxport Inc., 
controlled by the Matthews Group, and the other by Claridge 
Holdings Inc.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3507"> 3507 </A></B>
<P>
	In December 1992 the Paxport proposal was declared to be 
more acceptable and the company was given until 
mid-February 1993 to satisfy the government that it was a 
financially viable proposal. When Paxport could not 
demonstrate this or raise the necessary capital, it sought 
assistance from Claridge. The private sector participants then 
formed the Pearson Development Corporation, referred to as 
PDC, and T1 T2 Limited Partnership for the purposes of 
carrying out the project.
<P>
	In August 1993 the federal government and PDC announced 
that they had reached an agreement to redevelop and operate 
terminals 1 and 2. Legal agreements were to be finalized in the 
autumn of 1993.
<P>
	A federal election was called on September 8, 1993. During 
the election campaign the Leader of the Opposition, now the 
Prime Minister, declared that the new government under his 
leadership would cancel any deal to privatize terminals 1 and 2 
if the transaction was deemed not to be in the public interest. 
The chief negotiator for the government sought written 
instructions on whether to complete the transactions and on 
October 7, 1993 received written direction that it was Prime 
Minister Campbell's wish to complete the deal on that date. The 
legal agreements were therefore finalized on October 7.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	Subsequent to the election one of the first actions of the 
government was to review the Pearson deal. As many members 
have alluded to, the government engaged Mr. Robert Nixon to do 
an independent review. I would like to read the conclusion from 
his report: ``My review has left me with but one conclusion, to 
leave in place an inadequate contract, arrived at with such a 
flawed process and under the shadow of possible political 
manipulation, is unacceptable. I recommend to you that the 
contract be cancelled''.
<P>
	I then went on to look further because obviously a bald 
statement like that does require some substantive support to be 
able to indicate the so-called flawed process. In looking at Mr. 
Nixon's report, page 8, subparagraph 3, I would like to read into 
the record some extracts to give Canadians an idea of some of 
the things that were of concern to Mr. Nixon in preparing his 
report:
<P>
	``The request for proposals having as it did only a single stage 
and requiring proponents to engage in project definition as well 
as proposal submission and all within a 90 day timeframe 
created in my view an enormous advantage to a proponent that 
had previously submitted a proposal for privatizing and 
developing T1 and T2. Other management and construction 
firms not having been involved in the manoeuvring preceding 
the RFP had no chance to come up to speed and submit a bid in a 
short time period''.
<P>
	At this point Mr. Nixon noted that there are some timing 
irregularities and probably some improprieties, at least in 
appearance:
<P>
	``With little construction and developing occurring others 
should have been sought out and given reasonable time to 
participate. Further, it is significant that no financial 
prequalification was required in this competition. For a project 
of this magnitude the selection of the best overall acceptable 
proposal without complete assurance of financial viability 
seems to me to have been highly unusual and unwise''.
<P>
	Finally Mr. Nixon states: ``The concluding of this transaction 
at Prime Ministerial direction in the midst of an election 
campaign where this issue was controversial in my view flies in 
the face of normal and honourable democratic practice. It is a 
well known and carefully observed tradition that when 
governments dissolve Parliament they must accept a restricted 
power of decision during the election period. Certainly the 
closing of a transaction of significant financial importance 
sealing for 57 years the privatization of a major public asset 
should not have been entered into during an election campaign''.
<P>
	I have to reiterate that the government said very clearly 
during the election campaign that the Pearson agreement should 
not proceed and that if it did the government's intention was to 
review the deal and to cancel the deal if indeed it was not 
deemed to be in the public interest. It chose to proceed and in 
fact the government did honour its promise to the Canadian 
people.
<P>
	We have heard a lot of speakers today discussing the process 
and how it is seriously flawed, that the substance was similarly 
flawed and that we really need a transportation vision for 
Canada, a comprehensive strategy for our transportation 
system.
<P>
	During the election campaign it was very clear to me that 
Canadians were saying political credibility is zero. I think one 
of the things that all members know and have learned very well 
is that political credibility demands fiscal responsibility. That 
fiscal responsibility will result in hopefully the restored 
confidence of Canadians in our legislative process and indeed in 
the integrity and credibility of people in political life. The 
Pearson deal, as many have suggested, did not do justice to the 
Canadian people. It was the right thing to do.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	I would like to turn now specifically to Bill C-22, an act 
respecting certain agreements concerning the redevelopment 
and operations of terminals 1 and 2 at Lester B. Pearson 
International Airport, which received first reading on April 13, 
1994. I would like to read for the House the explanatory note:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3508"> 3508 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The enactment concerns agreements arising out of the Request for Proposals 
for the Terminal Development Project at Lester B. Pearson International Airport 
or the negotiations following that Request. It declares the agreements not to have 
come into force and to have no legal effect, and bars certain actions or other 
proceedings against Her Majesty in the right of Canada in relation to the 
agreements.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The enactment also authorizes the Minister of Transport, with the approval of 
the Governor in Council, to enter into agreements for the payment of amounts in 
connection with the coming into force of the enactment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The bill was presented to the House by the Minister of 
Industry on behalf of the Minister of Transport. In summary of 
the legislation it indicates that the proposed legislation-this is 
for the benefit of those who have not followed the debate so 
far-will cancel those agreements that were entered into. It will 
make clear that government is not obligated to compensate the 
developer and allow the minister to make some payments but not 
for specifically lobbyist fees or lost profits.
<P>
	The government's policy has been and remains that it would 
consider reimbursing out of pocket expenses with the exception 
of the lobby fees but would not make payments for lost profits.
<P>
	As I went through many of the documents that were available 
to us, I found with some interest rhetorical questions which I 
think probably many Canadians and maybe members have been 
considering. The first question one might ask is: Are not private 
sector companies now going to be afraid to do business with the 
government? I think that is a very fair question and I think the 
answer is not at all. The government takes its contractual 
obligations seriously, but this is a different and special case 
unlikely to arise again.
<P>
	The Liberal Party made it very clear that we were concerned 
that the agreement might be contrary to the public interest but 
the parties risked signed that anyway. It is extremely important 
that the government gave notice and put the participants on 
notice. In spite of the clear message that was sent they took the 
public risk to proceed in any event.
<P>
	The new government subsequently reviewed the agreement in 
detail and determined that it was indeed contrary to the public 
interest and that is precisely what we expect elected officials of 
governments to do.
<P>
	The second question of note was why is the government being 
so hard on Pearson Development Corporation. It sounds like 
Pearson Development Corporation is going to lose a lot of 
money for the sin of negotiating a contract with the government 
of the day. Again that is a very relevant and good question, but 
we also have to understand that the people who entered into 
these agreements are responsible and professional business 
people and that the government wishes to negotiate with them in 
a fair and reasonable manner.
<P>
	During the campaign our party made it very clear that we were 
concerned that the agreement was contrary to the public interest 
but the parties proceeded anyway. This is extremely important 
to the essence of the bill.
<P>
	The government subsequently reviewed the agreement in 
detail and determined it was indeed contrary to the public 
interest. However the government stands by its commitments 
and there will be no payments for the lost profits or lobbying 
costs.
<P>
	The final question that was stated was what are the 
government's future plans for Pearson International Airport. 
This is probably as important a question as any. I stated earlier in 
my speech some of the dimensions of the Pearson contribution 
to Canada, to jobs and to the economy.  The Minister of 
Transport said that he intends to make a decision on airport 
administrative structure and potential expansion before the end 
of the year. He is seeking input from a large variety of sources, 
including his own caucus which will be giving him input with 
regard to the decisions.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	I have a special interest in the Pearson airport issue because it 
is just north of my riding, a mere 10-minute drive from the east 
end of my riding. We have had a number of public meetings over 
the years on many controversial issues, many relating to 
privatization, some relating to the expansion of the airport, and 
recently a very emotional debate with regard to expansion of 
runways, the new north-south runways which were already 
subject to a major environmental assessment review.
<P>
	Having had two public meetings, I think the last one was just 
two weeks ago, the people who have participated in this debate 
over these many long months have said one thing, that they 
agree Pearson is an extremely important economic unit to 
Canada and that the future of Pearson has to be handled in a 
comprehensive but careful manner to ensure that they will be 
able to maintain Pearson as the focal airport of Canada.
<P>
	At this point I do not intend to debate the merits of expansion 
of the airport, of privatization. All I can say is that the people I 
represent and who have attended these public meetings are 
calling out and asking the government to provide the leadership 
with regard to this important economic unit.
<P>
	I believe the bill is the next step in the process. Any time is a 
good time to cancel a bad agreement and to get on with the future 
of Pearson, which is the undertaking of the government today.
<P>
	I would like to conclude my comments simply by making a 
reference to the amendment proposed by the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois. It basically calls for a public inquiry. It has a lot to 
do with the fact that the bill does not deal sufficiently with the 
transparency of activities of Canadian lobbyists, which was the 
amendment from the Reform.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3509"> 3509 </A></B>
<P>
	I have some difficulty understanding why that issue is 
relevant to this particular bill. There is no question the 
government has put everyone on notice that the activities of 
lobbyists are an important issue to this government and that it 
will be addressing specifically matters related to the lobbyist 
activity in our country.
<P>
	Lobbyist activity does not directly relate to the bill. The bill 
deals with legal agreements and how we have a point of 
departure to get on with the business of the day to ensure that the 
future of Pearson is dealt with in a timely fashion.
<P>
	The amendment appears to be quite inappropriate. I do not 
understand it. Pearson will continue to be the major airport for 
Canada. It is my pleasure to have spoken today in favour of Bill 
C-22.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly):</B> I have been listening very 
carefully to the remarks made by the hon. member who just sat 
down.
<P>
	Throughout his remarks, he spoke of cancellation: 
cancellation of contracts, cancellation of agreements. I have 
some difficulty understanding that Bill C-22 is in fact a piece of 
legislation which cancels something since, in law, in Quebec as 
everywhere else in Canada I suppose, nothing leads to nothing. 
It is clear that if something is null it was nothing to begin with, 
and cannot lead to something.
<P>
	Bill C-22 declares that the agreements are null, and that they 
are nothing, but on the other hand, the government wants to 
breathe life into that nothingness, so to speak.
<P>
	With Section 10, indeed, they want to compensate friends of 
the government that might have benefitted from this whole 
scheme. That is my first question.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member who just sat down said that he does not 
understand much of what the Bloc Quebecois is saying, that it is 
using the piece of legislation we are currently considering, to 
address the issue of lobbying. Since this morning, I have the 
feeling that the Liberals understand what they want to 
understand and prefer to ignore what is not convenient for them. 
There has been some strange goings-on with regard to this 
whole scheme. We do not say so; it is the Nixon Report that says 
so. There have been some very unusual dealings in this matter by 
friends of this government as well as friends of the previous 
government.
<P>
	I doubt that any future legislation on lobbying will prevent the 
sort of thing that happened last fall. Any such new legislation, 
should the Prime Minister ever introduce it, will hopefully 
regulate the activities of lobbyists. As for the past, I am 
surprised by the attitude of the Liberals, who are saying: ``We 
are cancelling all that, we want to do it in a hurry, but we do not 
want to harm anybody, we do not want to tarnish anybody's 
reputation''. I find such remarks outrageous in the face  of a 
project such as this one on Toronto airport, where just about the 
whole investment by Canada would have been handed over to 
some people, if they had been allowed to do as they pleased. 
That is all I had to say about the matter. I would like the hon. 
member to tell me, if he can, whether we are dealing with a 
cancellation or with the legal recognition of a valid contract, the 
main players of which are about to be compensated?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Madam Speaker, I understand the member's 
concern and his questions.
<P>
	He dealt with two issues, one being the issue of lobbyists. He 
also commented with regard to the propriety of the amendment 
proposed by his leader.
<P>
	First, the issue of lobbyists is important and it must be dealt 
with. The government has indicated it will be dealing with the 
total question of lobbyists. I believe it probably would be 
appropriate to call a public inquiry, to investigate what 
happened and why with regard to lobbyist activities, whether it 
be Pearson or otherwise, just to ensure that we know what 
happened.
<P>
	The amendment proposed by the leader of the Bloc Quebecois 
is basically to frustrate the passing of the legislation. The 
member has not really addressed the real question of whether the 
legislation which has been proposed should go forward. It is not 
to say that if this goes forward we cannot look into the aspects of 
lobby registrations.
<P>
	The member is asking questions about the bill, whether there 
is agreement or not, and what we are trying to do. Clearly the 
government assessed whether it was necessary to bring in the 
legislation. It made the determination based on the best legal 
advice it had and counsel it obtained that it was necessary to 
come forward with legislation to put a stop to the agreements, to 
declare that they have not come into force. It deems they did not 
come into force and they have no legal effect. It bars certain 
actions against the government.
<P>
	This requires legislation and the government has brought 
forward the legislation to ensure that the matter can be dealt 
with finally by the Government of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly):</B> Madam Speaker, the bill 
before the House is needed because of the context in which 
certain agreements were signed concerning the redevelopment 
and operation of terminals 1 and 2 at the Toronto international 
airport. The findings of the Nixon report commissioned by the 
Prime Minister speak for themselves.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3510"> 3510 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``My review has left me with but one conclusion. To leave in 
place an inadequate contract, arrived at with such flawed 
process and under the shadow of possible political 
manipulation, is unacceptable. I recommend to you that the 
contract be cancelled''.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	If this bill is needed to cancel all agreements with T1 T2 
Limited Partnership, any responsible government must look 
into the reasons why we are in this dilemma.
<P>
	Our gracious Majesty had dealings with unknown persons 
whose identity is still shrouded in mystery. As recommended by 
the Nixon report, the Crown must unilaterally cancel those 
agreements because it was misled by her main counsellors and 
agents at the end of the 34th Parliament. We will try to explain to 
the House the role played by certain parties. It will then become 
clear why they want to remain unknown.
<P>
	The Nixon report is particularly harsh with those responsible 
for the signing of those agreements. It is not impossible that 
very influential people wielded that influence improperly and in 
a way which is detrimental to the Canadian heritage. According 
to the Nixon report, there was very high level influence 
peddling.
<P>
	If this House has reached the point where it is going to ignore 
the consensual principle and have our dear monarch lose face by 
unilaterally cancelling an agreement, I think it is because the 
Crown was very poorly advised.
<P>
	What was the rush for a clearly moribund government to pass 
such contracts privatizing the only profitable air terminals in the 
country, thus binding for a long time, the next 57 years in fact, 
future Canadian governments, when the then-Leader of the 
Opposition and present Prime Minister of Canada cautioned the 
government not to conclude these deals before the election of 
October 25, 1993, and even warned that he would cancel the 
whole thing?
<P>
	Before the deal was finalized, the future Prime Minister said 
publicly and warned the parties that he would not hesitate to 
cancel all that. Following this declaration, the government's 
chief negotiator in this case asked for written instructions before 
signing the contracts. On October 7, 1993, the then-Prime 
Minister, through an internal memo, insisted on the signing 
being done the same day. During the final phase of negotiations, 
certain top-ranking civil servants involved asked for a transfer 
because they were not sure that they were acting correctly.
<P>
	Can we associate this move with the 500 partisan 
appointments made about the same time of close friends of the 
regime which was then collapsing? It is not improbable.
<P>
	Not only a lot of money was lost because of all what had to be 
spent in this voluminous case, which some of my colleagues will 
address later, but it dealt a severe blow to the principles of 
transparency and honesty. I did not invent any of this; it is all in 
the Nixon report.
<P>
	By taking lightly the whole development of an industry of the 
future which cost Canadians a lot of money, the government 
seemed to the people to be out to grab what it could, and this is 
serious, coming from what must be the most honest and upright 
of our democratic institutions.
<P>
	The government of the 34th Parliament acted like a real 
scrounger, thus tarnishing the image Canadians had of it. The 
verdict rendered a few days later leaves no doubt in this regard.
<P>
	We also learn in the Nixon report that our government even 
willingly colluded to deprive the Government of Ontario of its 
right to $10 million under the land transfer law of this province.
<P>
	A responsible governement cannot afford to have two 
different sets of laws: one for itself and another for the citizens. 
In the past, several forceful rulings by the highest court of the 
land have reminded us of it in no uncertain terms. But we can see 
now the unbearable consequences of the former government's 
doings: unilaterally cancelling a contract is almost indecent.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Ordinary citizens cannot resort to what is called in French 
``dol'', that is fraud by deceit, to seek the cancellation of a 
contract, except in Quebec, of course, where that procedure is 
allowed under the new Civil Code. Once more our beautiful 
province has shown her clearsightedness and sense of 
innovation, as opposed to some provinces that are incapable of 
changing their traditional vision of this country.
<P>
	But I digress, Mr. Speaker. I want to come back to Bill C-22 
which reflects poorly on the crown from a legal as well as 
factual point of view.
<P>
	Common law principles do not allow ordinary citizens to 
resort to ``dol'' and case law has not changed in that regard.
<P>
	To lose face, Mr. Speaker, is not too strong a way of putting it. 
How could Her gracious Majesty resort to ``dol'' to cancel that 
contract, when she is so well advised by the largest firm of legal 
advisors, the Public Service of Canada?
<P>
	Her Majesty must surely not be very happy with what is 
happening right now. If it had not been for her unlimited 
authority, Her Majesty would have been had. Fortunately, as we 
were taught during the first term of our BA in law, the only thing 
the crown cannot do is to change a man into a woman, and I 
would add ``and even that remains to be seen''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3511"> 3511 </A></B>
<P>
	The Queen can do no wrong. It is because of this principle of 
common law, so dear to our fellow citizens across the floor, that 
this fool's deal can still be cancelled and its effects avoided, 
thank God.
<P>
	Earlier, I was wondering how come we had gotten there. I 
agree that we should cancel for all intents and purposes the 
agreements concerning terminals 1 and 2 of Pearson airport, but 
I do not want this to be done at the expense of our public 
servants. It is understandable that we would want to hold the 
previous government responsible, as this government always 
does, but I would advise the Liberals against casting the first 
stone because the Conservatives just pushed a bit farther the 
puck that had been put into play by their predecessors.
<P>
	What does the government intend to do, to avoid further 
insults of this kind to our beloved sovereign? In its famous red 
book, the party now in power, rightly criticizing the agreements 
reached a few days before election day on October 25, had 
definitely promised Canadian taxpayers to introduce a bill 
which would have the effect of restricting lobbying activities on 
Parliament Hill. Did it keep its promise? Not at all.
<P>
	The present Prime Minister and member from Saint-Maurice 
had promised us legislation governing lobbyists' activities on 
Parliament Hill. This legislation has yet to come.
<P>
	In the daily <I>Le Droit</I> of March 21, David Zussman, in charge 
of the lobbying issue for the Prime Minister, said regarding the 
introduction of such legislation that, although the principles 
were clear, it sometimes takes more time to write the rules than 
to agree on the principles. He also said that there are so many 
elements and so many players in all of this that it will require 
much more time than one could have imagined.
<P>
	There is reason to be confused, especially when one 
remembers that the Prime Minister, when given a rough ride in 
his own riding, said recently that it was all in the red book, that 
one had only to read between the lines.
<P>
	Good legislation must be clear, concise, and precise. Its 
principles must be clear and not be subject to interpretation. Its 
scope must not be mitigated in any way neither by the number of 
people concerned nor their political or social status. If such 
legislation is written on the basis of the corporative interests of 
all the friends of the government, it can only be legislation 
difficult to write, evasive, permissive and easy to circumvent. It 
becomes questionable legislation. Must we understand that this 
is the kind of difficulty that the government is having with the 
development of this bill at this time?
<P>
	The Pearson airport contracts were awarded in its last days by 
the former government, when it felt the carpet slipping under its 
feet. What does the government intend to do to protect itself 
against such a temptation at the end of its present mandate? I 
trust that such a vision of the future will not dictate that it uses 
the same self-control as it is using in the development of its 
code of ethics.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	Could the present government, which is as alike as two peas in 
a pod as its predecessor, not reassure our dear sovereign, 
Canadians and Quebecers that such absurd actions as those that 
were perpetrated by the previous government with regard to the 
Toronto airport will not likely occur again?
<P>
	Those divine banquets at $3,000 per person, which were 
attended by the most powerful members of the present 
government and the Senate, and those brunches at $1,000 per 
person, that is where the main activities of the most powerful 
lobbyists are likely to occur, because the Prime Minister's 
eloquence alone cannot justify such an investment.
<P>
	Far be it from me to cast aspersions on our Prime Minister. 
After all, his political longevity is proof positive of his integrity. 
However, I think we can say the Prime Minister was being a 
little careless about his image when he appointed Robert Wright, 
a Liberal fundraiser from away back, to negotiate the 
cancellation of the agreement on privatization of the air 
terminals in Toronto, especially when we realize that Mr. 
Wright, who has many qualifications, was the Prime Minister's 
fundraiser during his campaign for the leadership of the Liberal 
Party in 1984.
<P>
	Section 10 of the bill before the House today says that, if the 
Minister considers it appropriate, he may enter into agreements 
on behalf of Her Majesty to provide for the payment of such 
amounts as the Minister considers appropriate in connection 
with the coming into force of this act. That is what it says.
<P>
	This provision adds insult to injury. Not only did Her august 
Majesty get the short end of the stick in these agreements, she 
will also have to deal with the fall-out that will come as a result 
of this legislation. Is the government again using Her long 
suffering Majesty to get several million dollars for its friends?
<P>
	Far be it from me to cast any doubts on the integrity of the 
Minister of Transport who, I am sure, is capable of exercising 
his discretionary powers with the requisite honesty and 
restraint, but I think this is a truly herculean task which we 
cannot reasonably ask him to perform.
<P>
	Those who dealt with the government in this particular matter 
had been warned by the present Prime Minister that the deal was 
a dead end and that, if the Liberal Party came to power, the 
contracts would be cancelled. That is why the government 
negotiator asked for instructions before proceeding with the 
signing of the agreements. Those who dealt with the government 
were aware of all the implications. They gambled, and they lost. 
Moral turpitude is not a defence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3512"> 3512 </A></B>
<P>
	In any case, the parties to these contracts never lost money in 
their dealings with the government in power, and for reasons I 
mentioned earlier, I wonder on what ethical grounds we would 
owe them anything at all.
<P>
	Throughout my speech, I consciously and purposely used the 
terms ``Majesty'', ``Sovereign'', ``Queen'', and the ``Crown''. 
The people in this House know that when we refer to Her 
Majesty, we are talking about the people of this country, which 
means all Canadians. But do Canadians realize this? Do they 
realize that they also got the short end of the stick?
<P>
	Do the citizens of this country realize that the Toronto airport 
deal is only the tip of the iceberg? For 127 years, for as long as 
the Canadian federation has existed, the citizens of this country 
thought they owned this country and were the masters of its 
destiny. A cold, northern country, very austere, but a country of 
the strong, the brave and the adventurous. Those who chose it 
did so out of love, because they had a dream to build a life and 
were prepared to suffer, to forego sun and heat and make do with 
very little, but always with a great love for the land.
<P>
	They were exploited by foreign fur traders, misled by 
power-hungry or simply money-grubbing politicians, leading a 
life of few dreams and limited prospects. What are we going to 
leave our children? Six, seven, eight, nine hundred billion 
dollars worth of debt!
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	I am ashamed, Mr. Speaker, ashamed. Why? Because I am 
part of the generation who made off with the cashbox. I inherited 
a beautiful, clean country, and in less than 50 years, see what I 
have done, see what will be left for the next generations: a 
country burdened with debt, polluted, dirty, torn apart by sorry 
politicians who cared only for their personal comfort.
<P>
	This country has been ruined by greed, vandalized by those 
who feel no loyalty to any country, by mudsucking tadpoles, by 
well-educated politicians who lack vision and are blinded by 
their personal ambitions.
<P>
	A great philosopher once said: it is not the last drop that 
makes the cup overflow, but the first one. It is true.
<P>
	The Toronto airport could very well be the last drop. There is 
too much doubt, too much confusion here, as well as too many 
mistakes, for us not to start asking questions.
<P>
	In this whole mess, some senior officials resigned, others 
asked to be transferred, and others said nothing for fear of 
retaliation. The operation was so gross that only those few who 
had absolute authority thought they were untouchable.
<P>
	The steamroller was in motion. They were marching on 
against all common sense and advice; greed had no limits, the 
project was the only purpose and cupidity ruled.
<P>
	Proud people were made into servants, honest ones were made 
deceitful and truthful ones turned into liars. Things have to 
change, this country must regain its dignity, regain respect and 
redefine its aspirations; most of all, it must re-establish the rule 
of law. That is why we must immediately, even at the risk of 
collectively hurting ourselves, revive justice and pride to give 
hope once again to those who follow; we must take our destiny 
into our own hands.
<P>
	Consequently, we must immediately set up a royal 
commission to inquire into the Pearson Airport deal and we 
must implement its recommendations. We must put a stop to 
false bidding and allow Canadians, including Quebecers, to 
regain their sense of pride and dignity. The nobility of the 
principles of equality, fraternity and justice must be restored. 
This way, perhaps we could considerably reduce disputes 
between Quebec and Ottawa. Perhaps people could understand 
that Quebecers who choose emancipation have decided to free 
themselves from this kind of socioeconomic and financial 
colonialism that holds too many Canadians hostages.
<P>
	Que bene annat, bene castigat, or ``spare the rod and spoil the 
child''. This age-old latin maxim is still valid today. If our 
Prime Minister is tabling Bill C-22 for honest reasons, if he 
wants to restore the principles of justice in this country, he must 
proclaim now the appointment of a royal commission of inquiry 
on Terminals 1 and 2 in Toronto. The conclusions of the 
commissioners will allow us to prosecute all those who are at 
fault, as rich as they may be, under one justice, honourable and 
righteous, the justice of Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Madam Speaker, toward the end of the hon. 
member's remarks he sounded as if he had taken the government 
position.
<P>
	We as Liberals led by the Prime Minister have fought against 
the dismantling of the Pearson International Airport. We did that 
not only when we sat on that side of the House of Commons. 
During the election campaign when we heard that the then 
Conservative government was going ahead we said it was not 
our policy direction. We did not want to privatize Pearson 
International Airport. We campaigned against it and we acted 
immediately once the Prime Minister took office.
<P>
	In no way, shape or form are Canadians confused when it 
comes to the decision the Prime Minister took. It was decisive 
and the right thing to do in the long term interests of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	This is a strange approach we we have here today. We are 
trying to act on the decision and put the Pearson file behind us 
and properly pay those people who unfortunately got into a bad 
deal with the previous government.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3513"> 3513 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	We are trying to put that file behind us so we can rebuild a 
market in Toronto with a fresh policy start. There are a lot of 
unemployed people in Toronto. We do not intend to leave 
Pearson in the state it is forever.
<P>
	However we would like to do this as a Government of Canada 
project. As the member so appropriately recognized, this is a 
Government of Canada asset. It generates profits for the people 
of Canada. That is part of the reason we did not want to proceed 
on this deal. It was not a good deal for taxpayers.
<P>
	To mix the issue of lobbying with the action of the bill today is 
not the right way to go. Could the member not see this whole 
issue of reviewing lobbyist activity, and even reviewing the 
lobbyist activity as it pertains to Pearson International Airport, 
could be more appropriately handled when we bring forward the 
lobbyists registration bill which we will not only discuss in the 
House but in committee as well? In that way we would not be 
slowing down the whole process and we could put the bill behind 
us.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Madam Speaker, I said it before, and I will say it 
again, the Liberals understand what is grist to their mill and acts 
in their favour. When they present their bill, their code of ethics, 
it will not be appropriate to bring up past cases. The member 
who asked the question is well aware of that. He is trying to 
ensnare me. He knows that we will not be able to mention the 
Pearson airport deal when his government finally decides to 
present its bill.
<P>
	We will debate the essence of the bill, its strengths and 
weaknesses, which I expect will be many. But we will not be 
allowed to talk about the maneuvering that preceded the Toronto 
airport deal. Being a lot more experienced, he knows that better 
than me. I cannot understand why the Liberals who, during the 
election campaign, opposed this deal which was in the process 
of being completed, are now very sheepish, having realized 
since October 7, when the contract was signed, that some of their 
friends were involved in that deal. Does this explain the 
compensation under clause 10?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> I rise on a point of order, Madam Speaker. I 
have been standing for one minute and it is customary, once a 
member has asked a question to a Bloc Quebecois member, that 
a member from another party then addresses the previous 
speaker. I therefore wonder why you are not giving me the floor 
instead of recognizing the member who just rose.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The speaker was a Bloc 
member. Mr. Mills rose for questions and comments. It is 
customary to then recognize the party opposite. In this case the 
speaker was a member of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like you to consult 
the clerks and the Standing Orders. It is the member who rises 
first who has the floor, and should several people rise at the same 
time, according to tradition, you must alternate between parties. 
Since I have been standing for one minute, it is obvious that I 
should have the floor. No other members having risen, I have 
priority to address the previous speaker. I ask you to consult and 
give a new ruling.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Madam Speaker, 
perhaps I could assist in straightening out this confusion. I was 
about to speak on debate and that is why I rose. When the 
member from the Bloc suddenly stood, I sat down. There are still 
a couple of minutes left.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I will come back to the 
hon. member for Richelieu. It is true that the parliamentary 
secretary was asking to be recognized, but there was another 
member behind him. I apologize to the member. I had not 
forgotten him and I was not ignoring him either. Quite the 
opposite, in fact.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
want to respond to a comment made by the member who 
basically imputed motives. I know the Speaker has often said to 
members to take due care in terms of imputing motives.
<P>
	The member indicated the reason the Liberals cancelled the 
deal was so that they could deal with their own pockets. I find 
that statement very unsavoury. I would invite the member to 
read the report of Mr. Nixon to determine whether there was a 
flawed process, and to make his own decision if it was 
appropriate to cancel the deal. Do not impute motives to the 
Liberal Party but rather make a decision on your own. It is a bad 
deal. It has been cancelled, and the government is acting 
responsibly.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. It seems that I came in on a pretty warm 
debate here.
<P>
	It being two o'clock, pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the 
House will now proceed to Statements by Members, pursuant to

	<B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
draft amendments to the Criminal Code and the Customs Tariff 
Act introduced by the Minister of Justice last week in response 
to the proliferation of serial killer cards and board games is a 
clear indication to all Canadians that the justice minister is 
listening and that he will be acting promptly to bring needed 
changes to the justice system.
<P>
	As the justice minister stated, as a society we must protect 
children and youth from exposure to material which exploits 
violence, cruelty and horror, while balancing this goal against 
the important guarantees of freedom of expression contained in 
the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	The government is committed to making our streets, our 
homes and our communities safer. The threat of violence that 
pervades our society is intimidating and alarming to most 
Canadians. By seeking to prohibit the sale or distribution of 
materials that exploit violence, we do a great service not only to 
the majority of law abiding citizens, but to the young people 
who deserve to develop interests and talents free of such 
negative influences.

His four world championships are an inspiration to all 
Canadians. Kurt's accomplishments and his real Canadian spirit

<HR>
<B><A NAME="3515"> 3515 </A></B>
<P>
	It is an industry with the potential to employ many more 
people than it does currently and this in an area of very high 
unemployment. The tourism industry encompasses small to 
large companies as well as business people of all backgrounds, 
including youth and seniors. The needs of these people and the 
tourism industry must be looked at to help them not just to 
survive but to prosper and expand.
<P>
	Tourism is a $28 billion industry in Canada. The vast majority 
of the 60,000 tourist enterprises are small or medium sized 
businesses. Tourism tax revenues for all levels of government 
are estimated to be in the neighbourhood of $11 billion annually. 
This is an important sector of economy.

	Notwithstanding the foregoing, I would point out that there

	<B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce):</B> Mr. Speaker, Thursday 
CNN reported that because of our low Canadian dollar, 
Americans were flocking to Canadian border communities to 
buy new cars. Americans realized they could save thousands of 
dollars by shopping in Canada.
<P>
	There is one problem. No, it is not either national 
government. In fact freer trade laws have enabled these types of 
sales. Rather it is the big three auto makers forbidding their 
dealerships to sell cars for export.
<P>
	The big three have told their dealers that if they sell cars for 
export they could lose their franchise agreement. This does not 
sit well with dealers who say that if allowed they could sell 
hundreds of cars to our American neighbours. It is especially 
difficult for the dealers since other dealers not associated with 
the big three have not been curtailed from selling for export.
<P>
	Businesses have long complained that government is 
hindering their sales potential with obtrusive trade laws. The 
government has acted but now apparently big business has 
stepped in to install greater non-tariff barriers. The Canadian 
economy has suffered for years from cross-border shopping. 
Now it is time to reverse that and take advantage of the situation 
while it is still in our favour.

following: ``The Quebec election is not a factor to be analyzed in 
reviewing Canada's credit rating''. The president of Moody's 
acknowledged that Canada's credit rating was being closely 
monitored  because of the country's financial situation and high 
debt levels. The outcome of the current review could prove 
costly in terms of high interest rates.
<P>
	In fact, since the Liberal government brought down its first 
budget, the gap between Canadian and American interest rates 
has widened considerably. The markets are reacting this way 
because foreign investors are worried about the lack of concrete 
deficit reduction measures in the first Liberal budget.
<P>

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ATLANTICFISHERIESADJUSTMENTPROGRAM">ATLANTIC FISHERIES ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	In its Atlantic fisheries adjustment program, the government 
will oblige fishermen to sign a contract requiring them to take 
training courses, go back to school or do community work. 
Otherwise they cannot receive benefits from the program. The 
Minister of Human Resources Development even confirmed 
that his reform could extend such a contract to all social 
programs from coast to coast.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister to tell us if, under his reform, he 
intends to require the unemployed and welfare recipients to take 
courses and to work in order to collect the benefits to which they 
are entitled and I ask him to tell us whether he admits that it 
would now be illegal to apply such a contract to everyone.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Since it is 
most unusual to have people who completely lost their 
livelihood, in co-operation with the provincial Government of 
Newfoundland, we have tried to set up a program that could help 
these people find something else to do with their lives.
<P>
	Since we know that half the fishermen will not be able to go 
back to fishing, they need to adjust to the labour market; that is 
why we prepared such a comprehensive plan and we want those 
who cannot return to work in the fisheries to be able to work 
elsewhere and they will be trained in educational institutions in 
the provinces concerned.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> There 
seems to be a contradiction again between the Prime Minister 
and the minister responsible, since the Prime Minister is telling 
us that the fisheries program was designed to meet a very 
specific need and would therefore be limited to fishermen. 
However, the minister suggested that all social programs could 
be subject to this kind of requirement.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	I therefore ask the Prime Minister if he can tell us whether the 
fierce opposition of several provinces to his program of social 
reform is due to their refusal to endorse the coercive approach 
favoured by his minister.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
what my minister is trying to do now is to reach an agreement 
with the provinces. They asked for time to study in more detail 
the best ways to help people go back to work and that is our 
priority. We want people to return to work and have the dignity 
of doing a job and the satisfaction of supporting their family. 
That is why the Department of Human Resources Development 
is negotiating and discussing with the provinces now, because 
like them, we have programs and we prefer to find a solution that 
will suit the provinces and the federal government.
<P>
	We want people to be able to retrain and to prepare themselves 
so that they can earn their living honourably.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, despite what the Prime Minister says, everyone knows 
that they are not negotiating very hard, since the provinces, or at 
least several of them, refused to attend the latest 
federal-provincial conference that the minister wanted to hold 
on this subject.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3518"> 3518 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, the provinces are well aware that all the Prime 
Minister's answers indicate that, if they do not accept his point 
of view, he will impose it on them.
<P>
	So I ask him if we are to understand that he is trying to break 
the poorest provinces by brandishing the threat of a substantial 
reduction in transfer payments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition has 
it all wrong. It is unfortunate that he spends all his time in the 
House trying to foment difficulties where there are not 
difficulties.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is we just met and talked last week with 
provincial ministers who are all still committed to working in 
collaboration to bring about serious reform in the country on 
programs that will help people get back to work.
<P>
	There is only one person with one group in this entire country 
who wants to see the programs fail and it is the Leader of the 
Opposition.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HIBERNIAPROJECT">HIBERNIA PROJECT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Hibernia project is already far from proving that it 
can be profitable. Because of the announced cost overruns, the 
production cost of a barrel of Hibernia oil would be considerably 
higher than international market prices. The extra money 
invested in this project by the government is totally 
unjustifiable. Defending Hibernia's profitability seems to be an 
act of faith we can no longer afford.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Natural Resources, of 
course. How can the minister invoke the profitability of the 
Hibernia money pit, when it seems certain that the cost of 
extracting oil from the Hibernia deposit will be higher than oil 
prices on the international markets?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me say first, in response to my hon. colleague's 
question, that we have contractual obligations. We are one of 
five owners of the Hibernia project. We are an 8.5 per cent 
equity owner. We must maintain and live up to our contractual 
obligations. Therefore we are going to be responsible for 8.5 per 
cent of any cost overruns.
<P>
	In addition, let me say that the government and I continue to 
believe that Hibernia will be a profitable project in the coming 
18 to 20 weeks.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, are we to understand that, after investing $4 billion in 
the development of Hibernia, the government is now telling us 
that its hands are tied, that it cannot go back and that it must go 
ahead at any cost, by continuing to sink millions of dollars of 
taxpayers' money?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me clarify for my hon. friend that the federal 
government has not spent $4 billion on the Hibernia project. The 
total projected cost of the project, involving all equity owners, is 
$5.2 billion.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	Therefore to suggest that the federal government has 
expended $4 billion is completely inaccurate and unfortunately 
a misrepresentation of the situation as it presently exists.
<P>
	In addition, let me reiterate the point that we as a government 
believe and my projections and figures indicate that Hibernia 
has every prospect of being ultimately profitable and an 
important component in our long term energy security as a 
nation.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEECONOMY">THE ECONOMY</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Both the International Monetary Fund and Moody's Investors 
Service have again expressed concern about overspending by 
the Canadian government. It is not just the size of the deficit and 
the debt that worries the money markets. It is also their concern 
that the federal government seems to lack the ability or the tools 
to control overspending.
<P>
	What plans, if any, does the government have to strengthen 
the capacities of the Treasury Board, of departmental managers, 
of Parliament itself to control federal overspending?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
to answer the question, it is something that we are working on all 
the time.
<P>
	When we look at the budget, we indicated that we are working 
to reduce substantially the deficit and we are confident that the 
deficit in relation to GDP will be 3 per cent at the end of three 
years. We are doing it on a constant basis.
<P>
	For example, the minister of immigration cancelled all 
citizenship judges, thus saving millions of dollars.
<P>
	Still today I am waiting for the member's list on where to cut. 
Whenever we propose a cut he says it is not the right one, that it 
should be somewhere else. I received complaints from people in 
his province because we had to cut national defence, for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3519"> 3519 </A></B>
<P>
example. It is not that easy to  do. We are doing our best. We 
have a plan that we were elected on and we will deliver the 
goods.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the Prime Minister for his answer. He may be a bit behind 
in his reading. We tabled in the House a list of $20 billion in 
spending cuts that could be made over the next three years. 
Those were our contributions to the solution to that problem.
<P>
	My supplementary line of inquiry is that one positive signal 
that the Prime Minister could send to the money markets would 
be to openly encourage parliamentary committees to reduce 
rather than simply rubber stamp the spending estimates 
presented to them.
<P>
	Could the Prime Minister assure members of the House that if 
they were to reduce the spending estimates presented to them in 
committee, the government would accept those reductions and 
not regard them as an expression of non-confidence in the 
government's budget?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are looking at all the expenditures. If the committees want to 
make more recommendations we will be delighted to see them 
but there are some principles, some things we will not agree to 
cut.
<P>
	We will not scrap medicare in Canada even if members ask us 
to do that.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Good, some members 
opposite are applauding. Do members want us to scrap old age 
pensions?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Okay. Do members want us 
to stop transferring money to-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> More, more.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are getting question period reversed here. We will be happy 
to answer the questions.
<P>
	In seriousness, the Prime Minister did not answer my simple 
and direct question. I will repeat it. All we are looking for is a 
straight answer. Could the Prime Minister assure members of 
the House that if they were to reduce the spending estimates 
presented to them in committee the government would accept 
those reductions and not regard them as an expression of 
non-confidence in the government's budget?
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	I ask this not just on behalf of committee members on this side 
of the House but on behalf of members on all sides of the House.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is all come and go in the committee and make the 
recommendations and get the recommendations. We would be 
happy with that. That is why we have committees. It is very easy 
to make a big statement here.
<P>
	Whenever I suggest areas where we could cut, members of the 
Reform Party say we should not cut. They should make up their 
minds. They are obsessed with only one or two programs, such 
as bilingualism. They would not reduce the deficit with that one. 
Later on when we are faced with those who want to separate 
from this country they will blame me because I did not want to 
have a policy to keep the country together.
<P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ELECTIONACT">ELECTION ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. The Quebec 
director general of elections, Mr. Pierre-F. Côté, has recognized 
yesterday that the Prime Minister and his ministers are not 
bound by the provisions of the Quebec Election Act, and those 
governing election expenses in particular. This means that the 
Prime Minister and his ministers can spend as much as they want 
during the election campaign without having to account for it, 
while other federal members of Parliament, including the Bloc 
Quebecois members, have to comply with the legislation.
<P>
	My question is as follows: Does the Prime Minister 
undertake, on behalf of all the members of his government, to 
abide by the spirit of the Quebec Election Act during the next 
election campaign, as requested by the Quebec director general 
of elections, for the sake of democratic fairness?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have not read the report in question. Are you afraid that I will go 
and campaign in Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Good. I will certainly find 
opportunities to let the people of Quebec know that it would be 
disastrous if the separatists were to be elected.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> And that would not cost a 
fortune. I can assure this House that I have no intention of 
abusing my privileges as Prime Minister of Canada during the 
election campaign. I will respect the wishes of the people of 
Quebec. Of course, opportunities will arise for me and my 
ministers to express our views. But do not worry, we will not go 
overboard. However, we will continue to represent the 
government, and as such, we have the right to speak in any 
province during an election. We will avail ourselves of that 
right. I think 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3520"> 3520 </A></B>
<P>
that, unlike Mr. Parizeau, Mr. Johnson does not need the support 
of the federal party to win the election.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we hope the Prime Minister will come and discuss the 
real issues in Quebec. But we do not want have to pay out of the 
tax dollars we send to Ottawa for the Brinks' trick he pulled off 
with Trudeau and his friends in the old days.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> I would like to ask the Prime Minister if he can 
promise not to launch large scale government advertising 
campaigns that could serve the interests of his federalist ally in 
Quebec. Can he promise not to waste public money for purely 
partisan purposes?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
the hon. member can promise me that not one single member of 
the Bloc Quebecois or their constituency office staff will take 
any part in the election, that they will carry out their duty as 
members of Parliament and remain in Ottawa during the 
election, then I too will stay in Ottawa. That is a promise.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> So, if they do not agree at 
this time-
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	No, no; that is it. Because the 54 members from the Bloc 
Quebecois have staff working for them who are paid by the 
federal government to deal with problems concerning the 
federal government, and they should not be promoting the 
separation of Quebec using federal funds.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEMEPARK">THEME PARK</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	In addition to the $20 billion in spending cuts that we tabled, 
we have a very practical example. Yesterday the Prime Minister 
referred to vast private sector support for the patronage theme 
park in his riding.
<P>
	I would point out to the Prime Minister that Hydro Quebec, 
which is supplying almost all of the so-called private funding, is 
a provincial crown corporation. In fact the taxpayers of Canada 
and Quebec are contributing almost all of the funding for this 
boondoggle.
<P>
	In light of the fact that this theme park is almost entirely 
funded by public funds and not the private sector, will the 
federal government withdraw its support for this doomed 
project?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the report that the member is using was published two years ago. 
After that it was reviewed and downsized and the provincial 
government and the federal government agreed to develop this 
park. It is a project that the community has been working on for a 
long time.
<P>
	If it had done it through the infrastructure program, the 
federal government would have paid one third. Through this 
system it is paying less than 20 per cent. Just from the 
construction we will most likely get more than our share in 
income tax and other taxes that the project will generate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is really disappointing to see the government with its 
blinders on. The report by the Federal Bureau of Regional 
Development on this project claims that the revenue generated 
by visitors to the park will be less than half of what is projected. 
The cost of maintaining the facility will be almost $900,000 per 
year higher than projected and to run the park properly it might 
have to triple its payroll.
<P>
	The evidence indicates that this patronage park will run 
deficits every year.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister whether his government is prepared 
to bail out this money pit year after year, or is the Prime Minister 
prepared to show some leadership and pull the plug on the 
boondoggle-no more federal funding?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the member is making the case. I just said that the document he 
is looking at was prepared in 1992. The project has been cut 
down to a more manageable level. The group has been told very 
clearly by the Quebec government and by the federal 
government that if it cannot make a go of it, it will not be able to 
come to us later on.
<P>
	The local community is dedicated and committed to making it 
work and I am convinced it will work. We are making a small 
contribution compared to what Hydro Quebec is making. Hydro 
Quebec is very independent from the government; it is run 
completely separate. Ask any MLA and they will tell you.

that his government will privatize the Coast Guard, hence 
decreasing the competitiveness of ports along the St. Lawrence

bill, which will come to about $200 million a year?

	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have heard from the Official Opposition and from other 
parties in the House that we need to put our financial affairs in

where there is a possibility of reducing costs and being more 
efficient.

Transport Canada is responsible, including the coast guard. We 
are going to be very careful at maintaining what we think is our 
fiduciary responsibility of providing security for Canadians in 
all modes of transport. But we are going to look at all 
possibilities in consultation with provinces and with the clients 
that we have to serve.

question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	There was a rather disturbing report in <I>La Presse</I> this morning 
about the government member for Saint-Léonard. Has the 
Prime Minister personally reviewed the RCMP file and security 
check on the member in question and, if so, could the Prime 
Minister assure the House that he is satisfied that there has been 
no questionable conduct?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. There are times when we get into very 
delicate issues in the House. I would remind all hon. members 
that in putting questions that there be in no way any hint of 
attacking the character or integrity of another member of 
Parliament.
<P>
	However these questions, as long as they are put within the 
concept or the precept of the administrative responsibility of the 
government, of course would be in order. This question I would 
judge to be in order and I would permit the right hon. Prime 
Minister to answer.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Yes, Mr. 
Speaker, I have thoroughly reviewed the situation.
<P>
	When I became the head of the government, before I formed 
the cabinet I asked the police to review all members of 
Parliament on my side. They had a question mark about clients 
of the member, but they made no allegation against the member 
at all.
<P>
	I asked the member if he had done something wrong and he 
said ``no''. He asked me: ``How can I get this question mark out 
of my file?'' I said: ``Let's ask the police to go to the bottom of 
it''. In January the Clerk of the Privy Council informed me that 
there was absolutely no allegation whatever against the integrity 
of the member who is the whip.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know the hon. 
member. He was the whip of my party when I was in opposition 
and he was a very good whip. In fact, I asked him to serve again 
as whip and we can see the result of his work. We have cut $5 
million from the perks.
<P>
	Another good example of how good he is in terms of 
administration was in 1988. When 55 new members were 
coming into the House of Commons, the previous 
administration spent $1.3 million to move members around. 
This time, with 205 new members in the House, this whip 
managed to do all that and spent only $185,000. He saved 
more-

once and for all?

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Health. On June 8, 1992, the 
BioVac company of Quebec submitted an application for the 
licensing of its BCG-cancer vaccine. After 22 months, this 
application is still pending. Connaught submitted an application 
for a similar vaccine on March 2, 1989, and a license was issued 
after 14 months. This delay in the licensing process is causing 
serious prejudice to BioVac which stands to lose important 
contracts.
<P>
	Could the minister tell us what is delaying unduly the 
licensing of the Biovac BCG-cancer vaccine?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
cannot comment on what happened in the department before my 
appointment. However, I can tell you that there are many 
reasons why delays sometimes occur. In this particular case, I 
could try to get information and answer some time later. You can 
be assured that we are trying to serve the Canadian people in the 
best possible way.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to point out that I already put this question to the minister in 
the lobby, but that I am still waiting for an answer. I wish she 
would explain why the double standards, one for BioVac which, 
after 22 months, is still waiting for an answer from the 
department, and one for Connaught which got a license for its 
vaccine after 14 months.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	The most recent session of the 1993-94 Pacific salmon treaty 
negotiating round has failed to make any progress. The 
negotiation with the United States once again is at an impasse. 
This impasse will have important conservation consequences in 
1994 and in future years. It will also  have bilateral fisheries and 
international relations consequences for Canada and the United 
States.
<P>
	Would the minister please advise the House what further 
action the government will take to reach an agreement and to 
protect Canadian fishermen and Canadian resources under 
international law?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the member for his question on this important 
and troubling negotiation.
<P>
	We have done everything we can to move the negotiation 
forward and to avoid confrontation with the Americans on the 
Pacific salmon management plan this year. As recently as last 
week the Prime Minister raised this question directly with the 
President of the United States as an important unresolved matter 
between our two countries.
<P>
<B>(1450 ) </B>
<P>
	I will be in British Columbia this week meeting with 
stakeholders in the industry and seeking their advice before 
Canada proceeds further on this matter.
<P>
	I can say that the United States is indicating thus far it wants 
more access to Canadian salmon, to the tune of $60 or $70 
million a year more access. It wants Canadian fishermen to have 
less access to our own salmon and U.S. salmon. In fact it wants 
the imbalance that has been in place over the last nine years to 
continue. I can tell the House that is not going to happen.

<P>
	A group of international experts was recently assigned to the 
Krever Commission on tainted blood to do a comparative study 
of the best blood supply systems in the world and make

in Canada.
<P>

money for these international experts, while the Canadian 
Hemophilia Society is still waiting to receive the money it needs 
to adequately represent its own members before the 
Commission?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health): </B>Mr. Speaker, Mr. 
Justice Krever who is in charge of the inquiry spends his money 
as he sees fit, and in fact, he hired these experts. We remain in 
touch with the commission, and I must say there have been no 
problems so far. The people who wish to take part in this inquiry 
have the right, as well as the funding they need, to appear before 
the commission.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, I beg to 
differ. The Canadian Hemophilia Society has to lay off staff 
because the minister has not granted the requisite funding, 
effectively putting a gag on the society.
<P>
	Does the minister agree that appointing this committee of 
experts will do absolutely nothing to shed light on the tainted

<P>
	The government recognizes that inmates in federal prisons 
exist in medium to high risk exposure to AIDS because of the 
significant numbers of inmates who have a history of IV drug 
use, the continued drug use with unsterilized needles in prisons, 
inmates who receive tattoos with unsterilized needles, or engage 
in unprotected sexual relationships.
<P>
	Considering the high cost in social and monetary terms AIDS 
imposes on society, why has this minister not instituted a 
concerted HIV testing program in prisons?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House

hope the hon. member will not mind if I answer his question. 
This is a matter pertaining to Correctional Service Canada.
<P>
	Recently a blue ribbon committee outside of government 
studied the matter and made recommendations. The government 
through Correctional Service Canada announced it was 
accepting most of the recommendations, including measures to

<P>
	I know the minister is aware of the injustices that have been 
committed against children in Canada and the many cases of 
child abuse. I know he would agree that for too long these 
offences have been hidden.
<P>
	Will the minister commit to taking some immediate action to 
establish a national child abuse registry? Prior to hiring a person 
to work in a position of trust with children, it would require that 
an employer conduct a search to determine whether the 
applicant had previously been convicted of a sexual offence 
against children.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
</B><B>General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can give the commitment 
readily.
<P>
	In fact as a result of work that the Solicitor General, the 
Minister of Health and I have done over the last several weeks, 
we are about to release an options paper during the month of 
May into the hands of interested parties across the country. It 
will set out specific steps we can take to put in place a registry of 
child abusers in the country.
<P>
	Just this morning I met with Monica Rainey who has been the 
very active and very effective president of Citizens Against 
Child Exploitation. Her work and the message she brought me 
this morning serve to show the urgency of this undertaking. We 
have to protect children from repeat abuses by people who have 
been convicted of these offences.
<P>
	The efforts we are making focus on both the short term and the 
long term. The first is to establish the registry perhaps through 
an adaptation of the CPIC system the police use for convictions. 
The second is to have an effective screening system so that 
employers who are about to hire people in positions of trust can 
find out whether they have been convicted.
<P>
	I share the hon. member's sense of urgency on this issue. I 
assure him we are taking steps and our paper will be in his hands

Pearson International Airport, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee; and of the amendment; and of the 
amendment to the amendment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I understand that, before 
Question Period, a question was asked of the member for 
Chambly. I will ask him to kindly complete his answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly):</B> Mr. Speaker, there seems to 
be some confusion. I answered the question. The member for 
Mississauga spoke after me on that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate having the opportunity 
to speak on Bill C-22 because as members know, this was an 
issue I was quite active on when in opposition and also during 
the campaign. Pearson International Airport is not directly in 
my riding but it is located in the city that I represent with many 
other Liberals.
<P>
	I want to go back to the days when we opposed the 
privatization of Pearson International Airport and make it 
perfectly clear that when we told the then government we were 
against this particular project, the privatization of Pearson, we 
were very specific about our reasons.
<P>
	One of the reasons we put forward was that Pearson 
International Airport is probably the largest profit centre the 
Government of Canada controls. I was just looking at some 
figures that my colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Transport, handed me during question period. These 
numbers are taken from years 1991-92 and 1992-93 where the 
positive cash flow after operating expenses and capital 
expenditures was over $50 million.  That was during a period of 
time when revenues and travelling were down. In 1992-93 it was 
$67 million and in 1993-94 the revenues were close to $68 
million again.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	If we go back to the mid and late 1980s there were a couple of 
years when the Pearson International Airport was generating 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3526"> 3526 </A></B>
<P>
close to $100 million a year. We heard from the Conservative 
government at that time that if we let the private sector take over 
Pearson it could do a better job than the bureaucrats and the 
officials.
<P>
	The position we took was that if there were management 
people out there who could do a better job than the bureaucrats 
who were at that time generating $100 million a year, and even 
during the depression over $50 million a year, that was 
interesting. Why not introduce us to these management experts 
and let us give them a contract as management consultants?
<P>
	In other words, if they said that they could improve the cash 
flow at these airports from 51 to 60 or put some specific targets 
in place, let us give them a base salary and a percentage of what 
they would pick up as they increased the efficiency or the cash 
flow from what the officials or the bureaucrats were doing.
<P>
	We thought that we could probably achieve everything that 
the government wanted to achieve: a better cash flow, renovate 
or renew the airport and clean up the parking lots without giving 
it away. That was the position we took.
<P>
	I know that during the election campaign several people were 
involved in the airport transaction. They had actually come to 
me in my campaign office and said: ``Dennis, listen, I hope you 
aren't as rigid on your view of Pearson''. I would tell them: ``I 
am as rigid today as I was then''. I am not against giving people a 
contract to renew or construct new construction at the airport. I 
am not against using the private sector to do the food services, 
the parking lots, the cleaning services, all these things that the 
private sector can do better. However the thought of handing 
over a crown asset, a jewel in the crown, that essentially had the 
potential to pay for all of the renovation and renewal required in 
about a 10-year period out of the existing cash flow.
<P>
	Again I felt that our position was constructive in opposition 
when we said: ``Look, if there is room for efficiency we will 
accept that. There is always a possibility, but let's hire these 
so-called experts who can operate it better. Let's give them a 
contract but let's not give away the whole franchise. Let's not 
give away the whole store''. If a business was doing well and 
somebody came along and said ``I can improve your profits or 
your cash flow by 10 per cent or 20 per cent'', it would say: 
``Sure, let's do it''. However, if the person said: ``No, no, no. I 
want to own the business. I want to take your business'', there is 
not a member of Parliament who would go along with that deal.
<P>
	Therefore the Prime Minister made the right decision during 
and after the campaign when he shut down this contract because 
it was not good in the long term interests of the Canadian public.
<P>
	The thing that makes me feel bad about this contract is that we 
could have had that airport under construction right now if the 
people who had all of this expertise and all these plans on 
renewal and renovation had come in with a proposal that did not 
say we need to own it. It is a fact of life that we have to clean up 
the parking lot and we have to do the renewal and renovation 
there and we could have had people working. It is too bad they 
did not  take the compromised approach that many of us 
suggested. Hopefully we can get through the bill today and 
maybe get back to this with a fresh approach.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	There is another part of this contract that I did not like. I want 
to credit my colleague from York South-Weston for bringing 
this up. My colleague from York South-Weston as everybody 
in Canada knows really led the way on the debate on the merits 
of why we should not proceed with the privatization on this deal.
<P>
	I will never forget one particular evening when we were in a 
meeting. It is like any family, some people in the room are for or 
against and take different positions on an issue. I remember the 
member for York South-Weston turning to someone in the 
room who had an awareness of certain contents related to the 
contract and he asked: ``Is there a flip clause in this particular 
Pearson privatization contract?'' The person said yes, at year 10 
the owners have the opportunity to flip this. That is exactly what 
was said.
<P>
	I remember all of a sudden the lights went on with all of us. 
We said: ``Imagine if this contract had gone through, 10 years 
from now with the private owners of the Lester B. Pearson 
International Airport. Can you imagine what the people of 
Canada would have said if we had basically sold this airport to 
the Libyans or sold it to some other offshore group?'' I 
remember we said jokingly that night that 10 years from now it 
will be called Gaddafi International.
<P>
	Just the thought of selling the Pearson International Airport to 
an offshore group-if there were ever a piece of good, positive 
contribution to our community and our country as Pearson 
airport, to think that we would be so stupid as to construct a deal 
that would allow it to be given away ten years from now, there is 
just no contest on that point alone.
<P>
	I am happy to stand in the House today in support of the bill. I 
want to say to the members of the Bloc Quebecois who put 
forward an amendment today proposing that this go to a royal 
commission of inquiry that I know exactly where the Bloc 
members are coming from. They want to do a detailed analysis 
of the players, the participants, and who constructed this deal. If 
that is put into a royal commission mode that would go on for 
months and months and perhaps years, and it would cost literally 
millions of dollars.
<P>
	The basic objective the Bloc members are trying to achieve 
could be done when we do the lobby registration bill. We need 
speedy passage of the bill so that we can start from scratch in 
renewing and renovating Pearson International Airport. Not 
only do we need it for creating immediate jobs but because 
Toronto is a major access point for tourism, trade shows and all 
kinds of other activities. It is not just in the greater Toronto area 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3527"> 3527 </A></B>
<P>
but in every other region of Canada. It is really important that we 
get on with that.
<P>
	I hope when we come to the table the next time with the 
private sector it will understand that we respect its skill in terms 
of giving us advice on how we can manage the place. We would 
certainly want it to do the construction and everything else 
because that is not government's business. It also has to 
understand that in the long term interests of Canadians it is best 
that the Lester B. Pearson International Airport stay in the hands 
of the Government of Canada.

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a question 
for the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood. He stated in

profitable and that the private sector should no longer be party to 
this transaction, the government decided to cancel the contract. 
The member told us that the government would like the Pearson 
Airport to stay in the hands of the Government of Canada, but in 
the same breath, he added that, when it comes back to the table 
the next time with the private sector, it will seek better terms to 
make sure that the interests of Canadians are well served.
<P>
	Are we to conclude from this analysis of the issue by the 
member that the government intends to turn Pearson Airport 
over to the private sector in the near future, while, for the time 
being, cancelling a deal signed with the private sector? The 
government would temporarily take over the airport to 
eventually put it back into the hands of the private sector, maybe 
in a few months or in a couple of years.
<P>
	If that is the case, one must wonder what the government 
really intends to do. Is the government cancelling the deal only 
to hand out the airport to other individuals it likes better than the 
ones chosen by the previous government? I would like the 
member to clarify this point.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the question from the member. I want to make it 
perfectly clear that we have taken a policy position. Not only 
was this particular airport contract flawed but the privatization 
approach that was used was not in keeping with our thrust.
<P>
	We are not just cancelling this contract to walk around the 
curtains and give it to some other private sector group. We are 
looking at all types of options to make sure we get the best 
contract for Canadians, not just in the short term but in the long 
term.
<P>
	That means that it may not be run out of the Department of 
Transport but maybe it could be quasi-crown organization. In no 
way, shape or form have I ever heard from anyone on our side 
that we are looking to shut this contract down so we just turn 
around and give it to some other private sector contractor.
<P>
	I personally believe that the officials in Transport Canada 
have been doing a very good job in managing the Pearson 
International Airport. Is the member asking me can they do a 
better job? We can all do a better job. It does not matter what we 
are doing. Does it mean that maybe we should go outside and get 
some private sector advice on how we can increase the profits or 
do a better job to raise funds? I have no problem with that. What 
I am saying is: give the contract to the consultants. Let us not 
give away the farm.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with the 
previous speaker that certainly Pearson airport is the hub of the 
Canadian airline industry. Certainly the building of an airline 
and a successful transportation network within Canada is 
dependent on the hub and spoke concept. It is perhaps the single 
most important airport. As I have mentioned, it is certainly an 
important part of the infrastructure of Ontario and of Canada as 
a whole. Therefore the outcome of any bill or action surrounding 
the Pearson airport is of utmost importance to Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	With this in mind Pearson airport must be a cornerstone in this 
whole planning process. Pearson International Airport 
operations generate some $2 billion in personal income, $4 
billion in business revenues and $700 million in tax revenue.
<P>
	Pearson accounts for one-third of Canada's domestic flights 
and 50 per cent of all international and transborder traffic.
<P>
	We all agree that the deal that was struck between the 
Conservative government and Pearson Development 
Corporation last year was unacceptable. This is an obvious 
example of the old style of doing business. We agree with the 
Minister of Transport's statement earlier today that the deal 
should quashed because of backroom dealings and other 
unscrupulous behaviour. If the minister is correct and someone 
other than the government of the day was responsible for the 
Pearson deal, the current government must not honour the 
contract. If the contract was influenced unduly by lobbyists, 
again the current government must not honour that contract.
<P>
	I believe these facts to be true. For this reason I feel that it is a 
wise move for the current government to cancel this deal. To 
legislate an end to the fiasco and hopefully open the process of 
revamping Pearson airport is acceptable to me and my party. 
What is not acceptable is the clause of Bill C-22 which allows 
the minister to negotiate the payment of out of pocket expenses 
to the contractors. The Prime Minister promised before the  
election that he would cancel the entire deal. He has cancelled 
part of the deal, but now the hon. Minister of Transport is going 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3528"> 3528 </A></B>
<P>
to compensate those individuals who were involved in this 
sordid affair. The minister has done nothing to remove the 
secrecy surrounding this deal that began with the previous 
government.
<P>
	Greg Weston of the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> said in his March 9 
column: ``The Grits have managed the remarkable feat of 
turning a highly suspicious and secretive Tory deal into a highly 
suspicious and secretive Liberal cancellation process. A secret 
inquiry followed by current secret compensation negotiations''. 
The government must not stop halfway on this issue by paying 
off those who were involved in this questionable affair. Quite 
simply, there should be no compensation whatsoever for anyone 
involved in this deal, period.
<P>
	Many suspect excessive amounts of lobbying went on in the 
privatization of the Pearson airport, with both Liberal and 
Conservatives heavily involved. Key people include Charles 
Bronfman, Senator Leo Kolber, Herb Metcalfe, and many more. 
The list is some 50 people.
<P>
	Liberals have appointed former provincial Liberal cabinet 
minister Robert Nixon and the Prime Minister's former law 
partner, Bob Wright, to lead the negotiations for compensation. 
The Liberal government with Liberal negotiators compensating 
Liberal backers is questionable at the very best.
<P>
	What are the alternatives? This payoff of what has been 
reported could reach $40 million, could be funnelled back into 
Pearson directly. With the money that we will pay back for this 
deal we could do a lot of things in that airport. Many of those 
things have been mentioned earlier today.
<P>
	We could help the airline industry, currently struggling to 
become more efficient and competitive in the international 
market. As just one other example, permit me to talk a little 
about the runway construction at Pearson and the many things 
that have to happen there.
<P>
	The runway expansion is the most sensible, cost effective way 
to secure the future viability of Pearson International Airport. 
For example, the first runway that is required by the airport is a 
new crosswind runway and this is needed as soon as possible 
because it will help to eliminate around 50 per cent of all the 
delays at Pearson. These delays cost the Canadian traveller a 
great deal of money as planes circle and use large amounts of 
fuel.
<P>
	There has already been some $30 million in preconstruction 
work invested in the north-south crosswind runway. A 
crosswind runway would greatly increase safety at Pearson 
airport. Recently pilots who fly into Pearson have cited the 
potential dangers of extreme crosswinds on the current runways.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	Pearson could also use the $40 million the government is 
going to spend to buy off contractors to fund two east-west 
runways. That would raise Pearson to its optimum capacity and 
ensure the airport's place as an international hub.
<P>
	Furthermore if this expansion does not occur traffic will soon 
have to divert away from Pearson airport. Currently there are no 
reasonable alternatives to expansion of Pearson. Moreover, 
attempts to divert traffic away from the Pearson hub will hurt the 
regional spoke communities. For many of these communities 
two-thirds of their traffic going to Pearson is connecting to 
another airport.
<P>
	Finally these new runways can be built now without impeding 
any discussions on the future organizational structure of 
Pearson. Directing the money now slated to pay off contract 
expenses from the Pearson deal could be routed to runway 
expansion. It would create an estimated 2,500 construction jobs 
and up to 6,000 over the long term.
<P>
	Therefore the bottom line is, like so many other decisions 
made by this government, the money that is to buy off a 
contractor could be put to good use in funding the expansion of 
one of Canada's most important pieces of public infrastructure, 
Pearson airport.
<P>
	There are also international concerns which should be 
touched on. It has been reported in the <I>Financial Post</I> that one of 
those corporations seeking compensation is a Dutch government 
company called Schiphol.
<P>
	Schiphol has filed a claim in Ontario court for $7.5 million in 
damages for loss of contract. The Dutch airport authority has 
expressed shock at Ottawa's willingness to use its power to pass 
laws to nullify a valid contract.
<P>
	I am not suggesting that this government retract its stand on 
rejecting such a claim. However I do wonder out loud how this 
government will deal with a firm such as Schiphol which is 
non-political and has a good argument that it had nothing to do 
with Canadian political nepotism. Will it be compensated for 
out of pocket expenses? Will it be compensated for its original 
contract? What are the political and diplomatic ramifications of 
these international concerns?
<P>
	What we want most is a transparent government, one which 
does not make behind the scenes and closed deals as is the 
example in the Pearson deal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member raises concerns about other companies that 
may have been involved in good faith in this particular process.
<P>
	I remind the hon. member that the contract on the 
redevelopment of Pearson International Airport was not signed 
until October 7, 1993. That was several weeks before the general 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3529"> 3529 </A></B>
<P>
election campaign and after the leader  of the Liberal Party made 
it clear and unequivocal that if elected he would rescind or 
cancel the contract.
<P>
	With that knowledge in mind, the consortium signed the 
contract. All the other people who might have a claim today 
would have had that knowledge. In the circumstances, does the 
hon. member not feel that those who participated in this 
particular unconscionable contract were the authors of their own 
misfortune as they knew the contract would be cancelled well in 
advance of the time it was signed? Does the member not think 
their claim for compensation is not founded on solid principle, 
moral and otherwise?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly agree with 
that. I would agree wholeheartedly with the member's 
comments that they knew better and they obviously should not 
be expecting any compensation.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	However, because some of these are international, and that is 
why I used Schiphol as an example, the diplomatic problem is 
possibly more important than the actual possibility of their 
getting any money out of the deal.
<P>
	When other foreign governments start suing our government 
because they feel the government has interfered in business that 
is where, rightfully or wrongfully, the diplomatic problem 
comes in. That is why I used that example. Others could come 
up, certainly a number of the other airlines which had plans and 
had done some of their negotiating with that group. That is 
where the problem comes in.
<P>
	In actual dollars it should not cost us anything. As I said I 
would not recommend paying a single penny in compensation to 
anyone.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, the contract was signed on 
October 7 and the member raises his concern about this 
diplomatic problem we might have.
<P>
	If anything, the message was sent out loud and clear by the 
Prime Minister and the Minister of Transport when this contract 
was cancelled. The message was if you want to do business with 
the Government of Canada then you have to do it above board in 
a responsible and reasonable way and it ought to contemplate 
the public interest.
<P>
	In this particular case Mr. Nixon made it abundantly clear that 
there were a lot of shady aspects to this particular deal. There 
were a lot of backroom negotiations and much manipulation. 
There were a lot of payoffs. Lobbyists were selling access. They 
were arranging meetings for very significant fees.
<P>
	The hon. member talks about this particular company that 
might feel particularly aggrieved. One wonders whether it hired 
one of the lobbying firms involved. Surely as responsible 
business people they knew what was going on.
<P>
	In any event would the member not agree their claim is not for 
out of pocket expenses but for lost profits? Any out of pocket 
expenses they may have incurred could only have taken place 
after the signing of the actual contract on October 7. After that 
of course they knew on October 25 the government would 
change.
<P>
	Again would the hon. member not agree that any company 
that in any way shape or form was involved with this contract, or 
hoped to gain as a result of this contract knew very well that the 
contract would be cancelled even before it was signed? 
Therefore why would it expend one red cent when the writing 
was already on the wall?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I repeat that I agree with 
those comments. They are legitimate comments.
<P>
	In a discussion with the Dutch embassy just now it feels Bill 
C-22 unjustly punishes third party firms associated with 
Pearson. It says that the Schiphol airport authority being 
non-political should not be caught up in the whole Canadian 
political corruption the hon. member mentioned. According to 
the embassy it is saying the company from Holland feels it has a 
claim.
<P>
	Again I get to the diplomacy. I am not saying that position is 
right. Obviously the courts will determine that. However it has 
filed a claim in the Canadian courts about this deal. Therefore it 
is obvious it feels this is not a dead issue and that it is not 
something it should not raise.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am more 
inclined to endorse the recommendations of the hon. member 
who spoke before the Reform member. I wonder which 
principles come into play. I can understand that there may have 
been companies which unfortunately entered in good faith into 
negotiations or made some kind of deal with T1 T2 Partnership 
Limited. But, getting back to what the Liberal member was 
saying, what reason would we have for compensating 
individuals who were truly involved in some kind of scheme 
against the government?
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	If a group of criminals spends a substantial amount of money 
plotting to rob a bank and then screws up, the bank is not about 
to compensate those people for the costs incurred in the 
planning of the robbery. That is the principle I am having trouble 
understanding. I hope that the Reform member is not trying to 
tell me that we would be better off paying compensation to avoid 
lawsuits from foreign companies. Is that what he is suggesting?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me make it extremely 
clear. I am recommending we compensate no one involved in 
any part of this, including foreign companies that are now 
making claims in court. We  should not compensate them. All I 
am saying is those claims are out there and it does not help our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3530"> 3530 </A></B>
<P>
image. That is all I am concerned about. Do not compensate 
them at all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, the third party contracts the hon. 
member refers to would fall within the definition of agreement 
under the bill. In effect the bill cancels or precludes any legal 
recourse whatsoever for all contracts whether they are with the 
consortium or other third parties who might have participated. I 
just wanted to make that point.
<P>
	One further point is that the request for proposals dated March 
1992 made it abundantly clear to all those who wanted to bid on 
this contract that the government was under no obligation to 
accept any of the bids. In fact the government reserved the right 
to reject any or all of the proposals and to elect not to proceed 
with the project.
<P>
	All the companies involved in the bidding process, and 
perhaps this foreign company was one of them, knew in advance 
that any moneys they spent in preparing the proposal could very 
well have been money lost because the government made it clear 
in its bid for proposals it could elect not to proceed with the 
project.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree totally with that 
comment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Comuzzi (Thunder Bay-Nipigon):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to discuss Bill C-22 today. The essence of the bill is 
to put a fence around the problems surrounding the development 
of Canada's largest airport for the last number of years. It not 
only puts a fence around the problem in delineating a timeframe 
but it also goes on to speak about the type of compensation, if 
any, which is to be allowed to the successful bidders.
<P>
	In the minister's statements today, lobbying fees, other costs 
and loss of profit are not going to be considered in the eventual 
solution to this problem.
<P>
	It is interesting and I say with pride that there has been some 
continuity in the Liberal Party. From its inception we have 
opposed the concept of privatizing Pearson airport, even when 
we were sitting on that side of the House.
<P>
	On June 12, 1989 in the recommendations of the federal 
caucus task force on the future of Pearson International Airport, 
my colleague who spoke a few moments ago stated in part: ``It 
should never be allowed that Pearson be privatized. It should 
always remain as a viable and important part of the 
infrastructure of Canada. It should always be used for the public 
policy and in the public interest of all Canadians''. That was in a 
report made by my colleague as far back as 1989.
<P>
	This problem had its genesis when the government of the day 
decided it should privatize a new terminal that was being built at 
Pearson. As a result of that process a private consortium was 
allowed to build what we now know as Trillium or terminal 3.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	To this day, as hard as we worked when we were in opposition 
to find out the terms of that contractual arrangement between the 
owners of Trillium and the government of the day, we were not 
made privy to that very important document that allowed the 
first privatized terminal at Pearson airport.
<P>
	We were told at the time that the reason for the privatization 
of terminal 3 was that Canadians did not have the means by 
which to expand airport facilities in that area. That had some 
semblance of accuracy. However we failed to realize at that time 
that terminal 1 could have been made into a more efficient 
airport with the expenditure of a few million dollars for 
modernization.
<P>
	As they got on with the building and prior to the opening of 
terminal 3 we were advised that there was a move afoot to 
privatize terminals 1 and 2. The reason was that the government 
wanted, and this is a very important concept, to provide a 
competitive factor at Pearson International Airport in order to 
keep in balance the privatized interests that were operating at 
terminal 3 and terminals 1 and 2 under another entirely different 
corporate structure. This was to bring some balance for the best 
interest of the consumer who was travelling in and out of that 
airport. That was the reason it came forward with the 
privatization concept of terminals 1 and 2.
<P>
	We had some concerns about the privatization concept. As a 
result of that the Liberals while on that side of the House entered 
into another task force proposal. That was done on September 
12, 1990, one year after the first proposal. We found that the 
contract for terminal 3 had been entered into but there had not at 
that time been any designation of any airline that would use that 
airport.
<P>
	I will quote from some of our findings of that task force. 
Please recall that in 1990 the airlines, as they are today, were 
experiencing severe financial difficulties. Part of the findings 
were that the airlines in the country, particularly Canadian, 
faced the dilemma that operationally it could not use terminal 3. 
At the same time Canadian could not afford to move into that 
airport. It would have been a financial disaster. That came from 
one of the leaders of the Canadian airline industry at that time.
<P>
	We found as a result of that study in 1990, and these feelings 
were expressed in the House just prior to the opening of 
Trillium, that the cost of flying into terminal 3 would be 
prohibitive to the average Canadian consumer. Those of us who 
sometimes travel at government expense perhaps do not not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3531"> 3531 </A></B>
<P>
realize the cost  of travelling as much as we should. However the 
cost of going into terminal 3 would have been prohibitive to the 
average Canadian wage earner in the country flying with his 
family or wanting to see the rest of Canada.
<P>
	We knew that exorbitant rental fees were being charged. After 
terminal 3 opened there was almost a rebellion by everyone 
renting space in terminal 3. The costs of leases to the airlines 
and the the retailers were passed on to the travelling customer.
<P>
	If terminals 1 and 2 are privatized, price increases can be 
expected for every consumer. Terminal 3 will set the pattern for 
terminals 1 and 2 should privatization be allowed. Either way, 
whether it is privatization with one consortium of terminal 3 and 
privatization by another corporate citizen of terminals 1 and 2, 
there will be one inevitable conclusion: The cost of travelling 
into Toronto, the largest airport in the country, will increase 
substantially. Those were our findings. Those were our 
recommendations. The government carried on, although we 
were sincere in trying to get it to change its mind.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Let us see what happened after that. All of a sudden people 
showed up at some of our offices, including I am sure the office 
of my colleague who just spoke, saying: ``We want to show you 
our proposal''. This was long before the government asked for 
proposals for the privatization of terminals 1 and 2.
<P>
	In 1991 people came to my office and said: ``We would like to 
show you our proposals for terminals 1 and 2''. I told them the 
government had not asked for proposals. The answer was: ``Yes, 
but we are anticipating that this government is going to ask for 
proposals for privatization''.
<P>
	Finally, I believe in March 1992, the government asked for 
formal presentations for proposals for the privatization of 
terminals 1 and 2. As a result three proposals were made. The 
first proposal was by the then owners of terminal 3. That was not 
met with much favour because of the competitive factor that we 
wanted to maintain between terminals 1 and 3.
<P>
	A very good proposal was submitted by the British Airport 
Authority which operates the airports in England and other 
places on the continent. It had some very good ideas that I think 
we should incorporate into what we are trying to do at Pearson 
today. However its proposal was shortlived. It did not meet with 
favour.
<P>
	The third proposal was from a company called Paxport. 
Paxport always seemed to have the inside track for whatever 
reason. Eventually, as these proposal were being discussed, Air 
Canada made it known that Paxport made a proposal that 
interested it most and since it was operating exclusively out of 
terminal 2, Paxport was the proposal it would entertain.
<P>
	Going back to the original statement, competitiveness was 
always a factor in the privatization of terminals 1 and 2. The 
Paxport proposal was looked on with favour by Air Canada. 
Eventually something else happened.
<P>
	Terminal 3 was taken over by a corporation called Pearson 
Development Corporation. The previous owner sold out interest 
to Pearson Development Corporation.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Who owns Pearson Development 
Corporation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Comuzzi:</B> Then Paxport disappeared, the one that was 
operating with favour. Where did it resurrect itself? Pearson 
Development Corporation. All of a sudden, having been given 
assurances by the government of the day that there would be 
competition at the airport in Toronto, as the government was 
getting close to awarding the tender we found that there was 
going to be no competition at Pearson International Airport. In 
fact the three terminals, terminal 3 which was called Trillium, 
terminal 2 and terminal 1, would all be under the direct control 
of Pearson Development Corporation.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> A real monopoly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Comuzzi:</B> A real monopoly in Canada's main hub, the 
largest airport and our pride and joy in Canada. That move was 
just unconscionable.
<P>
	We in the government kept expressing our displeasure at what 
we saw happening at the Pearson airport complex. We stated 
throughout the election, including when we were approaching 
October, that the Pearson privatization was not a rational, 
logical proposal for the public interests of Canada.
<P>
	What was proposed for all other airports in the country was to 
put every one of them under what we called local airport 
authorities. That vested the local airport in each of our 
communities under a local control made up of non-profit 
oriented business people, men and women who would operate 
the airports in the best interests of their communities. That was 
not a bad idea and we supported that legislation.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	We asked the government of the day why, if local airport 
authorities were all right for Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary, 
Winnipeg, Mirabel, Dorval and other airports in the country, 
they would not be good for Pearson International Airport.
<P>
	The reason was simply that we were having a difficult time 
getting along with all of the jurisdictions that surround Pearson 
airport at the municipal level. That did not wash.
<P>
	The second reason was that Pearson was such a strong 
international airport that it could not be left to the control of a 
local authority, although that did not apply to Dorval, Winnipeg, 
Edmonton, Calgary or Vancouver. The whole concept never ever 
made any sense.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3532"> 3532 </A></B>
<P>
	Those who knew about it most were those who eventually 
evolved from Paxport into Pearson Development Corporation. 
In June, July, August and September 1993 the issue became 
hotter and hotter on the political stage. Time does not allow me, 
Mr. Speaker, to give you some insight into the lengthy meetings 
with the lobbyists.
<P>
	Former ministers of the government were getting into the 
bargaining process with the Pearson Development Corporation 
and the Department of Transport. When the lobbyists found out 
that it was slipping away they entered into a contract knowing 
full well that if there was going to be a change in government, 
the Pearson deal was going to be cancelled. That was the first 
move this government made and I am thankful that it was.
<P>
	That brings us to where we are today. My colleagues in the 
House and I suspect that within the next four to eight weeks the 
Pearson deal will be cut, finished once and for all, and we can 
get on to doing the things that are necessary at Pearson airport 
not only for the benefit of metro Toronto and southwestern 
Ontario but for the benefit of the travelling public in Canada as a 
whole.
<P>
	When we get rid of this problem and through to the eventual 
climax, we must look at the contractual arrangement that was 
entered into. A contract was signed on October 7 or October 8, 
20 days before the election. That in itself was unconscionable. 
We talked today in the House about awarding compensation. 
Our minister, who is much more generous than a lot of us on this 
side of the House, said the government is not going to pay for 
lost profits and lobbying fees but it will look at out of pocket 
expenses in so far as the proposals were concerned.
<P>
	Are we looking at the cost of making the proposals by the 
British Airport Authority which made an excellent proposal but 
was not given the opportunity to bid with any degree of 
certainty?
<P>
	If we look at Pearson Development Corporation it is only just, 
equitable and right that we look at what the British Airport 
Authority did in trying to present its best proposal to the House 
and to the government of the day. We must also look at the other 
proposals that were made and see what costs were borne by 
them. That is just, that is equitable and that is right.
<P>
	To be exclusive in looking at compensation for out of pocket 
expenses for Pearson Development Corporation alone is not the 
right thing to do. We should take in the whole gamut of all those 
who spent considerable time and expense in developing 
proposals.
<P>
	In conclusion, I trust that in the next four to eight weeks my 
colleagues on all sides of the House will be happy to get this 
problem over with as quickly as possible in order to get on with 
the decision as to whether we need a north-south runway at 
Pearson and deal with the problems associated with two extra 
east-west runways. Let us get on with the problem of what is 
going to happen to terminal 1. Should it be refurbished? It is a 
very good  airport and accommodates eight or nine million 
people a year very comfortably.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	In so far as transportation requirements are concerned in the 
country, we have to start to get on track. We are being 
superseded by communities that are not even half the size of 
Toronto. We are falling backward because we are failing to act 
and failing to do what is necessary in not only airport 
transportation but in passenger rail service and finding an 
economical way of getting our goods to market so that we can be 
globally competitive.
<P>
	I implore all of my colleagues on all sides of the House, let us 
get down to business, let us get Pearson over with as fast as we 
can, let us get on with making Pearson a world class airport that 
we can all be proud of. I know the government with the support 
of our people on the other side will work toward this very 
fundamental, vital role for this airport that will be to the benefit 
of all of us.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have trouble 
understanding the comments made by the hon. member for 
Thunder Bay-Nipigon. He seems in complete agreement with 
what has been said on this side of the House since this morning. 
The Canadian people, and the Quebec people among others, can 
testify to the barely concealed and unconcealable 
embarrassment of the speakers from the party in office with 
regard to Bill C-22.
<P>
	We are told: ``There has been scheming; acts that would 
otherwise be unquestionably criminal have been committed by 
politicians and business people. But let us forget about that, so 
that Toronto airport can be developed. Let us forget about all 
that and stop talking about it, as it does not make things move 
forward''. Is this case as urgent today as it was on October 7? 
What is preventing us from getting to the bottom of this and 
looking at the facts? Is it the urgency of it, as the hon. member 
for Thunder Bay-Nipigon is telling me?
<P>
	I understand the urgent need, at some point, to resolve this 
issue, but the members opposite seem to be trying to hide behind 
convoluted language and they almost get away with it. Some 
things need to be clarified. We must clear things up.
<P>
	Why do they not want to clear things up? If no serious 
impropriety has been committed in this case, unlike what Mr. 
Nixon says in his report, the Canadian people will at least feel 
that the government then in office and the current government 
acted in their interest. Why refuse at all costs to get to the 
bottom of this?
<P>
	I ask the hon. member for Thunder Bay-Nipigon to try to 
justify this behaviour, if he thinks he is still strong enough to do 
it.
<P>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Comuzzi:</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps I did not make myself 
clear at the outset of my intervention today. I am not defending 
anything that went on in the past. I feel as my colleague does that 
there were a lot of things that went on with respect to the 
privatization concept that may one day be exposed.
<P>
	I do not think that is our job today. I think our responsibility 
here today is to get on with the problem of deciding if there is 
compensation to a party, Pearson Development Corporation. 
Leave the problems of the workings of government and how they 
evolved for another day so it does not hamper what we want to 
do immediately. I have nothing to hide nor does this government 
have anything to hide with what we have done.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	If there is anyone who wants to hide anything I would suggest 
to my colleagues that the previous government should be 
answering to how it got us into this position at Pearson 
Development Corporation up to this point.
<P>
	All we are trying to do, and I impress this upon my friend, is 
clean up a mess. A royal commission, I suspect that is what my 
friend is alluding to.-What is a royal commission? A royal 
commission is four, five or half a dozen independent people who 
have not perhaps been exposed to the problem before. They are 
funded. What is the price of a royal commission today? The last 
one I saw on transportation policy came out to be $22 million. 
Do we need that type of venture today? Do we need that type of 
inquisition in order to tell us something that we already know? 
Are we prepared to spend that kind of money? We will have a 
report in 18 months or 24 months-that is what it takes to have a 
royal commission now-on something we already know.
<P>
	I understand. I sympathize. I appreciate the comments the 
member just made but I am saying let us get on with the job. Get 
this thing over with and not only work here for Pearson 
International Airport, but work on behalf of every airport in this 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, I share the view 
of my Bloc colleague. I want to thank him for putting on the 
record the kind of sordid history of this whole mess.
<P>
	I remember the need for disclosure that involved the Petrofina 
sale and I remember the cry of the opposition to the Liberal 
government of the day to provide the Auditor General with all 
details necessary to report fully on that purchase. I remember it 
refused to provide that. Then the government changed and as 
Canadians we heard the Liberal opposition demanding of the 
Conservative government to do the very same thing, to reveal all 
the financial details to the Auditor General so that he could 
make an accurate report to the public on the sale of Petrofina. 
That never happened.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned a contract that was let with 
regard to the development of the third terminal and that they had 
asked for the details of that.
<P>
	Is the government prepared to provide information, to make a 
full disclosure on this? We do not need a royal commission of 
inquiry, but bring all the pertinent documents and table them in 
this House so that the public has access to them and the 
representatives of the Canadian people have access to those 
documents so that if we want to examine them we can or any 
interested body can make representation for that kind of 
information.
<P>
	Would the member comment on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Comuzzi:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would very much like to 
comment on that and I am pleased to hear the member say that 
we do not need a royal commission.
<P>
	His question is so timely. We had a meeting this morning of 
the steering committee on transport. The Reform Party had I 
think two representatives there and we agreed unanimously that 
what we want the transport committee of the House of Commons 
to do is go into as much detail as we possibly can, to get as much 
information as we possibly can, to put it out on the table as fast 
as we can so that through this medium people in this House and 
people in this country will know exactly what kind of process 
was ongoing to strike that kind of deal that interfered with the 
rights of Canadians.
<P>
	I hope that we can all learn a lesson on this side and on the 
member's side that we should never, if we represent the people 
in this country properly, allow ourselves to get into that kind of 
negotiating process again. I would be very upset if I saw anyone 
in this House get into that type of process of negotiation with 
such lobbying and such influence that it would be embarrassing 
to be a member of this government.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	I welcome that question. The information that the member is 
requesting will be forthcoming through the Standing Committee 
on Transport and his membership in his party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to compliment the hon. member for his submissions today. 
As a result of his submissions I am sure it is clear to everyone 
that he is one of the resident experts on Pearson International 
Airport, indeed on transportation issues.
<P>
	I have always admired the depth of knowledge of my 
colleague. I am not only saying this because I happen to agree 
with him, but since his election to Parliament in 1988 he has 
distinguished himself as one of the foremost experts on 
transportation matters, in particular with regard to the Pearson 
airport deal. I know he provided me with a lot of advice on this 
particular matter.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3534"> 3534 </A></B>
<P>
	He and I share the opinion that it takes a lot of audacity on the 
part of Mr. Bronfman and other principals in the Pearson 
Development Corporation to put forward a claim of close to 
$200 million for compensation-that is right, after all of the 
shenanigans that took place.
<P>
	The hon. member has pointed out some of the aspects of the 
deal that caused Mr. Nixon to make the following conclusions: 
``My review has left me with one conclusion, to leave in place an 
inadequate contract, arrived at through such a flawed process 
and under the shadow of possible political manipulation, is 
unacceptable''. Mr. Bronfman has the audacity to put forward a 
claim.
<P>
	My question for my friend and colleague is: Does he believe 
that they ought to be entitled to anything at all? In my respectful 
submission, Mr. Bronfman and the Pearson Development 
Corporation, as a result of everything that transpired, deserve to 
be told to take a hike. They are not deserving of a single red cent 
as a result of the unconscionable nature of this contract.
<P>
	If he agrees on that being the case, would he not agree that-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I am sorry, we do 
not want to extend the time too much longer. I would like to ask 
the member for Thunder Bay-Nipigon to respond, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Comuzzi:</B> Mr. Speaker, I should respond by thanking first 
the member for those very kind remarks. I will try to be succinct. 
I think the starting point for these negotiations is just that, zero.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister had promised to make public all the details 
regarding the negotiation of a privatization agreement 
concerning Pearson Airport as well as the agreement itself.
<P>
	Instead, we have a study done by a former Ontario Liberal 
minister, behind closed doors, that explains that political 
personnel and lobbyists had a role to play, a role out of the 
ordinary, in the negotiation of this agreement. We have few 
details and nobody is being blamed. We must shed more light on 
this, and only a public inquiry can do it.
<P>
	Till we know the role of the various players, that is to say 
governments, officials, political personnel, lobbyists and 
investors in these negotiations, and till we know who exercised 
pressure to have this deal signed come what may, even during 
the election campaign, we will not be able to determine whether 
investors are really victims that should be compensated, or 
players who managed to get a hasty signature, and therefore 
should not get anything from the public purse.
<P>
	Since the government wants to appear open and show us that it 
functions in a transparent way, it should allow the royal 
commission of inquiry we have been asking for since the very 
beginning of this affair. We must shed light on a case which just 
might be one of the biggest patronage affairs in the history of 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	I should point out that in the first few days of this 
government- I was hearing this morning comments sometimes 
odious, often uncalled for -the Minister of Transport was not 
against such an inquiry on the Pearson deal. Several Liberal 
members of the Toronto caucus were definitely in favour. 
However, they soon realized that friends of their party were also 
involved, not just friends of the Conservative Party, so the 
government and the minister backed down and went for a report 
prepared behind closed doors: the Nixon report.
<P>
	There is no doubt, when you look at the people involved, that 
there were many lobbyists very close to the previous 
Conservative government. Let me name just a few. There was 
Pat MacAdam, a Conservative lobbyist and college friend of 
Brian Mulroney. There was Bill Fox, a Conservative lobbyist 
who is a former press secretary and personal friend of Brian 
Mulroney. There was Harry Near, a Conservative lobbyist and a 
long time party activist. There was Don Matthews, former 
chairman of Brian Mulroney's nomination campaign in 1983, 
and also former chairman of the Conservative Party and of the 
party's fund-raising campaign. There was Hugh Riopel, a 
lobbyist who was an important member of Mr. Mulroney's staff. 
There was John Llegate, a close friend of Michael Wilson. There 
was also Fred Doucet, who has always been related to the 
Conservative Party in one way or another.
<P>
	However, there were also Liberals, which probably explains 
certain things. This is probably why, in spite of all the promises 
made regarding an eventual royal commission of inquiry to find 
out the details regarding the privatization of Pearson Airport, 
such an exercise was not conducted with all the necessary 
transparency.
<P>
	For example, the people involved included senator Leo 
Kolber, who made the headlines during the election campaign, 
when he organized for the current Prime Minister a very private 
dinner meeting, a simple affair where the cover charge was a 
mere $1,000. Senator Kolber invited well-known personalities 
such as Charles Bronfman, who also happened to be involved in 
the Pearson dealings.
<P>
	Also present was Herb Metcalfe, a lobbyist with the Capital 
Hill group, as well as an official for Claridge Properties and a 
former organizer for the current Prime Minister. There were 
others and there will be others such as Ramsay Whitters, a 
Liberal lobbyist closely related to the Prime Minister. There 
were all kinds of people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3535"> 3535 </A></B>
<P>
	So, when I look at all this, I can understand that the Liberal 
Party of Canada did not want to embarrass its friends who 
probably indirectly contribute, through their interests in 
Canadian ventures, to the party financing, and this is probably 
why the government did not want to shed light on this episode.
<P>
	The members opposite are upset because we name their 
friends and point out the major reason why such an indecent bill 
was tabled today by a government willing to let its friends off 
the hook, in spite of their involvement in the privatization of 
Pearson Airport.
<P>
	The public has the right to know all the details surrounding 
this decision, and this is why the Bloc Quebecois demands a 
public and independent inquiry which will shed light on these 
dealings. The situation is so serious in fact that the Minister of 
Transport himself stated that the federal government was 
considering setting up a royal commission of inquiry. The 
minister made that statement on November 29, 1993. It is true 
that new appointees are always full of good intentions when they 
take over a department. I suspect the minister was quickly called 
to order by his party's establishment.
<P>
	We must not only mention the involvement of friends of the 
Liberal Party of Canada. There is also a whole series of strange, 
bizarre and even indecent things which have occurred from a 
financial point of view regarding the transaction as such, and 
these things must be pointed out. I will just name a few. We have 
examined the contract in its entirety and that is why it would be 
interesting to have a royal commission go over these 
incongruities together.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	First, the term of the contract. The term would be divided in 
two: a 37-year term, with the possibility to renew for another 20 
years. What for? Why did the federal government accept to do 
this for the Pearson Airport investors at the time? To avoid 
paying an Ontario transfer tax whereby you have to pay some 
$10 million in taxes on leases with terms over 50 years.
<P>
	So, with the help of the federal government, the investors 
were able through that clause to circumvent the Ontario tax. 
Have you ever heard of a federal government conniving in 
defrauding provincial tax?
<P>
	Second incongruity: the way the rent is to be calculated. It 
says in the contract that it can be calculated one of two ways. I 
will mention just one about which there are no less than ten 
oddities, ten seldom if ever used clauses in this kind of contract, 
especially for multimillion dollar transactions like the 
privatization of the Pearson Airport. The contract provides that 
PDC, Pearson Development Corporation, must pay 30.5 per cent 
of its previous year gross income to the government, up to a 
maximum of $125 million of gross income. On any amount 
exceeding $125 million in gross income, PDC would have to pay 
to the government 45.5 per cent of its gross income in rent.
<P>
	Normally, gross income includes all income generated by the 
operation of air terminals but, in the case of the Pearson Airport, 
it excludes no less than 10 deductions considered as unusual in 
this kind of contract. The first one relates to taxes paid by 
consumers, passengers and occupants which are collected by 
Pearson Development Corporation on behalf of the government. 
Second, certain unusual items do not go into the calculation of 
the gross income, which is unusual. If you deduct these unusual 
items when calculating gross income, of course this will reduce 
the rent to be paid.
<P>
	So unusual earnings were intentionally removed from the 
contract so that the Pearson lease could be reduced over the 57 
years. The third incongruity in this financial deal is that other 
types of income provided for, while not extraordinary, are not 
usual and do not originate from regular terminal operations, 
including the sale of assets. In other words, again, gross leasing 
costs are reduced by exempting these unusual types of income.
<P>
	There were other inconguities in the provisions on investment 
income. I will not go into detail on this as there are actuarial 
tables available, but I will say that this type of investment 
income provision is unusual in this kind of transaction. I could 
mention the discounts and refunds granted by PDC to airport 
tenants. I could talk about the money recovered and spent by the 
government to occupy parts of the airport, where 
inconsistencies and things that are unusual in this kind of deal 
were noted everywhere.
<P>
	We could also talk about the amounts collected by PDC on 
behalf of the government or any other party, which is a rather 
unusual clause in this type of contract. I would also like to point 
out another clause whereby the federal government covered 
Pearson's debts although it was not involved in operations in any 
way. In other words, it covered bad debts although it was no 
longer involved in airport management. It is a disgrace, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	I could also talk about the $70 million paid to Air Canada to 
convince it to support privatization. Imagine, convincing Air 
Canada to support a privatization project as inappropriate and 
unusual as the Pearson airport deal.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	We could also mention the severance allowance for 
employees of Transport Canada. The Government of Canada had 
offered severance allowances to 160 of its employees, although 
their jobs with Pearson Development Corporation were 
guaranteed for two years, under conditions similar to those in 
their current jobs. This severance allowance was supposed to 
cost Canadian taxpayers the trifling sum of $5.5 million.
<P>
	It is also appalling to see, especially in a transaction of this 
nature, the total lack of any financial analysis, of any sound and 
independent projections of the main parties' revenues, and I am 
referring to the two investment corporations which later 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3536"> 3536 </A></B>
<P>
merged, and also the lack of any analysis of these investors' 
status. When we look at  Paxport and the other party to this 
transaction, it is clear that all was not rosy. The financial 
situation of Paxport was appalling.
<P>
	So we could talk about all kinds of anomalies, and we could go 
on for ever, because when you look at the fine print, there are 
always questions that arise regarding this deal.
<P>
	So by going ahead with the bill before the House this morning 
and by refusing to conduct a public inquiry into this matter, the 
government has lost its credibility, a government that during the 
election campaign claimed that it was going to restore the 
confidence of citizens in government by opting for transparency 
and integrity. I think they are off to a very bad start.
<P>
	I think it is time Liberal members opposite, who look rather 
depressed by the course of events, decided to wake up. It is time 
they did, because my colleagues and I have the impression they 
are being manipulated by the establishment of their party and by 
their minister who comes to caucus meetings with instructions 
to vote for this and support that and do the other. They are 
mainly being manipulated by the leaders of the Liberal Party 
establishment.
<P>
	I beg them to wake up, because the public is starting to wake 
up. It is fed up with patronage and money going to the friends of 
the party, fed up with the lack of policies for public funding, fed 
up with the lack of transparency and integrity-in other words, 
fed up with people who for years criticized the previous 
government's lack of integrity in condemning a deal which they 
practically endorsed, because friends of the Liberal Party of 
Canada are involved, and they are directly involved.
<P>
	For all these reasons, I will vote against Bill C-22, and on 
behalf of my colleagues, and the Leader of the Opposition made 
the same request this morning, I ask that a royal commission of 
inquiry be appointed to investigate this matter.
<P>
	Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I hope my colleagues opposite 
wake up some day, because their behaviour today is 
irresponsible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, the statements made by the hon. 
member are, to say the least, absolutely unfounded. To accuse 
this party, that did what it said it was going to do and cancelled 
the deal, and call us puppets, is absolutely ridiculous.
<P>
	We are not the party that is trying to abrogate its 
responsibilities to the Canadian public. We are, by this 
legislation, doing what we promised before the election and 
what we promised since we have been elected: cancel the deal 
because we knew it was not in the public interest. Even the Bloc 
admits that the process is bad and that the substance of the 
agreement is not good.
<P>
	I wish the member would be a little more generous with his 
terms. It was his leader who was party to that gang of hoodlums, 
as we knew the previous government, for a good many years. I 
am getting sick and tired of listening to your hypocrisy, pointing 
fingers here-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I would like to 
remind members to direct their interventions through the Chair, 
please.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fontana:</B> Mr. Speaker, through the Chair, he is a 
hypocrite and so is his leader and-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. That is not 
acceptable. The Chair will ask the parliamentary secretary to 
withdraw that unparliamentary remark.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fontana:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is only unparliamentary when it 
is not true. I will not withdraw the comment because we are 
taking all kinds of accusations-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I know that 
members feel very strongly about issues that they bring to the 
floor of the House. By and large each and every one of us 
conducts ourselves in a respectful manner to uphold the 
traditions of this House and I think also to fulfil the expectations 
of our constituents across this great land of ours. In the Chamber 
at times there is a great deal of passion in our discussions and 
deliberations, but I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Transport to reconsider and to withdraw that remark.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fontana:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do withdraw the remark, my 
apologies to the House.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fontana:</B> I would hope that the member on the other side 
would find it possible not to also send out derogatory remarks 
such as calling members on this side of the house puppets 
because that is impugning the character of members on this side 
of the House.
<P>
	The Bloc has put forward an amendment and a proposal 
asking for a public hearing. I want to know how the member can 
justify the great delay that would take, the great expense that 
would also entail and would it not be prudent to put this behind 
us? The bill is pretty clear as to what we will pay and what we 
will not pay. We will not pay lobbyist fees, we will not pay loss 
of profits, loss of opportunities but we will pay out of pocket 
expenses. The bill is pretty explicit. In fact it says that we 
negotiate on those terms. If we cannot negotiate on those terms, 
30 days after proclamation there in fact will be no further 
negotiations and the people will get nothing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3537"> 3537 </A></B>
<P>
	The Bloc talks to us about fiscal responsibility, talks to us 
about transparency, talks about getting on with building this 
country, building Pearson and so on. How can it put forward a 
proposal that will cost the Canadian taxpayers more money, not 
less money, and in fact delay the process even further?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before I recognize the 
hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, I want to express on 
behalf of all chair occupants my respect and appreciation to the 
member for London East for his reconsideration and 
withdrawal.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I accept my colleague's apologies.
<P>
	Why should we convene a royal commission of inquiry? I will 
give you several reasons why. First, to respond to the 
recommendations of Mr. Robert Nixon who brought to light a 
number of irregularities. At one point, he said that lobbyists had 
played a very crucial role in this whole affair, along with friends 
of the Conservatives and the Liberals.
<P>
	Therefore, a royal commission would shed some light on this 
deal and would perhaps prompt the lobbyists running around on 
Parliament Hill trying to influence ministers, members, 
caucuses and the Prime Minister to behave as good citizens, not 
as schemers acting in cahoots with former senior officials with 
close ties to the Liberal Party.
<P>
	If the collective conscious of the members opposite is clear, 
why are they so reluctant to convene this royal commission of 
inquiry, in keeping with a recommendation made not so very 
long ago by the Minister of Transport? Why do they refuse to set 
up a royal commission? Second, I find my colleague to be 
somewhat of a complete cynic when he states that, with this bill, 
the palms of those who likely benefited from other projects, 
albeit perhaps not on the same scale as the Pearson deal, will no 
longer be greased. Once a professional lobbyist, always a 
professional lobbyist, in so far as federal areas are concerned.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	How can he say that no more palms will be greased as far as 
this project is concerned, when it is stated that the Minister of 
Transport can choose whether or not to compensate the parties 
involved and when the final decision as to the amount of 
compensation to be paid, and to whom, rests with him? Imagine, 
he enjoys a virtual dictatorship.
<P>
	Therefore I would ask my colleagues not to be so cynical and 
to stop boasting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to say to my colleague that I agree with him that a royal 
inquiry is needed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to say to the member that I agree with him and his party 
in their request for an inquiry into this matter, especially in light 
of what Mr. Nixon had to say.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> I want to quote again from Mr. Nixon's report: 
``To leave in place an inadequate contract arrived at through 
such a flawed process and under the shadow of possible political 
manipulation is unacceptable''.
<P>
	He goes on to say: ``The role of the lobbyist was extensive, 
going far beyond what I consider to be appropriate activities of 
consultants that are available to businesses to approach 
government''.
<P>
	One could almost conclude that the activity bordered on the 
criminal. Mr. Nixon conducted his report-I have considerable 
respect for Mr. Nixon-in private, his investigation in private. 
While we were in opposition and while in government we 
complained about the process that lead up to the signing of the 
contract with the Pearson Development Corporation.
<P>
	Mr. Nixon conducted his hearings in private. Mr. Wright now 
is conducting the negotiations in private and in my respectful 
submission I want to say that in order for Canadians to 
understand exactly what happened, Mr. Nixon did not name any 
names and perhaps names should have been named publicly so 
that Canadians can come to a conclusion on whether 
compensation ought to be paid.
<P>
	We are being told here by this bill that there should be some 
compensation for out of pocket expenses. In my submission 
there ought to be no compensation at all.
<P>
	With an inquiry or if Canadians are apprised of the total facts 
in this particular situation they too, I believe, will agree that no 
compensation is necessary.
<P>
	I would like to put a question to my friend from the Bloc 
Quebecois. Would he not agree with me in light of the 
information that he has available today that there ought to be no 
compensation at all?
<P>
	If that is the case would the Bloc Quebecois support an 
amendment that would delete paragraph 10 from this bill which 
is the paragraph that allows the minister in effect to have a blank 
cheque in order to pay out of pocket expenses?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, my party will examine the hon. 
member's suggestion on its merits. One thing is for sure, we 
welcome the hon. member's remarks and we are relieved to see 
that not all the members opposite are puppets or marionettes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to congratulate my 
colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe on his brilliant speech, in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3538"> 3538 </A></B>
<P>
which he set out troubling facts arguing for a royal commission 
of inquiry.
<P>
	I would also like to make a comment about my colleague and 
friend, the hon. member for London, who spoke against a royal 
inquiry. He also accused our leader of using unparliamentary 
language and linked him to decisions made by the previous 
government which went along the lines of the decisions 
concerning Pearson Airport. I think he should reconsider and 
agree with us on the need for a royal commission of inquiry. 
Then, he would see who the real players were, on both the 
Conservative and Liberal sides. He would understand better why 
it is so important that all the information be made available to 
the public.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	So, I would invite my colleague, as well as his colleague, to 
support this request for an inquiry. I think that, following 
tomorrow's caucus meeting, the government members will sing 
another tune. I am convinced that, by tomorrow afternoon, they 
will readily support the Bloc Quebecois amendment proposal.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Leeds-Grenville, Ethanol; the hon. member for 
Lévis, Youth Action Plan; the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, VIA Rail.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to make some submissions 
with regard to this bill before Parliament, Bill C-22.
<P>
	As a member from metropolitan Toronto I took a particular 
interest in this matter not only during the election campaign in 
the fall but indeed a number of years before when I chaired a 
federal Liberal Party task force studying the future of Pearson 
International Airport.
<P>
	The committee submitted its report on June 12, 1989 and in 
this particular report we concluded that it would be a mistake to 
proceed with privatization of any of the terminals at Pearson. 
We as a party have maintained that position throughout the last 
number of years.
<P>
	Much to our chagrin the previous Tory administration decided 
in its wisdom, if you will, that it would privatize terminals 1 and 
2 at Pearson, having already allowed private interest to build 
and operate terminal 3.
<P>
	It became abundantly clear over the last year and the months 
preceding the general election campaign that what was 
happening with regard to the privatization of the airport 
terminalswas that Tory ministers and, I would submit, the Prime Minister, 
Mr. Mulroney, and Prime Minister Campbell knew exactly what 
was going on with regard to the privatization and in fact gave 
their blessing to a process that Mr. Nixon would subsequently 
call flawed and have a lot of very strong comments on.
<P>
	The negotiations took place behind closed doors. The deal 
was consummated in the shadows. Lobbyists were involved. 
Lobbyist earned hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars 
as a result of what was occurring.
<P>
	I keep repeating Mr. Nixon's quotation: ``My review has left 
me but one conclusion, to leave in place an inadequate contract, 
arrived at through such a flawed process and under the shadow 
of possible political manipulation, is unacceptable''. He went on 
to say: ``The role of the lobbyist was extensive, going far beyond 
what I consider to be appropriate activities of consultants that 
are available to businesses to approach government''. He also 
pointed out in his report that senior transport officials were 
replaced when they objected to the contract.
<P>
	Imagine, the previous government when faced with 
bureaucrats who had as their preoccupation the public interest 
objected to this particular contract. They in effect were 
constructively dismissed from their positions and put 
elsewhere. They were replaced with people who would agree 
with a contract that in effect rewarded Tory loyalists and 
supporters.
<P>
	During the election campaign the government, indeed the 
consortium, recognizing that the Conservative government was 
on its last legs, tried to and in fact did sign the contract on 
October 7, 1993, two and a half weeks before the general 
election.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	It thought that having signed the deal the new Liberal 
administration would not cancel the contract. It had another 
think coming because during the election campaign the Prime 
Minister, as the leader of the Liberal Party, made it clear in 
advance of the signing of the contract that if elected he would 
cancel the contract.
<P>
	He said on October 6: ``I challenge the Prime Minister to stop 
the deal right now''. He went on to say: ``You do not make a deal 
like that three weeks before an election when hundreds of 
millions of dollars are at stake. We will not accept it. I am dead 
serious. To anybody involved in that, I say: `Don't get too 
excited tomorrow. We will review the deal when we form a 
government. If it is not a good deal, we will not proceed'''.
<P>
	He also said: ``It is the Mulroney mentality at its worst. They 
are really trying to put one over on us at the last minute and I say 
it is totally unacceptable''. This is the Prime Minister speaking 
in the election campaign: ``I am warning everyone involved that 
if we become the government we will review this transaction. If 
necessary, legislation will be passed to overturn the deal''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3539"> 3539 </A></B>
<P>
	What could be more clear from the Leader of the Opposition 
in advance of the signing of the deal? What could be more clear 
that his government would cancel the deal? To have Mr. Charles 
Bronfman and the consortium come to the taxpayers of Canada, 
cap in hand, after doing what they did to get this deal signed and 
after signing the deal when warned by the man who was destined 
to become the next Prime Minister, for them to come seeking 
$200 million from the taxpayers of Canada, that takes a lot of 
balls. It takes a lot of audacity to do that.
<P>
	I say shame on Mr. Bronfman and shame on his corporation 
for having the audacity to do that after what Mr. Nixon had to 
say and what the Prime Minister had to say when he was the 
Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
	This bill allows for limited compensation. I have to take 
exception to any compensation being paid at all. No one has 
established why any compensation should be paid. All kinds of 
reasons can be given. We have heard from various members as to 
why there ought not to be any compensation at all. I have not 
heard anybody say that because they were acting in good faith or 
because they expended money unbeknownst, they were 
innocent, they deserve some compensation. I have not heard that 
reason.
<P>
	There is not a reason. That is why members have not heard any 
justification or rationalization or rationale for paying the 
Pearson Development Corporation any money at all. For that 
reason I believe that paragraph (10) which allows the minister to 
pay compensation should be deleted from this bill.
<P>
	I would urge members of the committee who study this bill to 
delete paragraph (10) because that is the paragraph that 
empowers the minister, in effect gives the minister a blank 
cheque, subject to no compensation for lobbyist fees or lost 
profits but short of that, to compensate not only the Pearson 
Development Corporation but everyone involved with them for 
out of pocket expenses.
<P>
	I would submit that it would be unconscionable if they were 
paid any money whatsoever not only because of what was said 
during the election campaign, and what happened behind the 
scenes, but also because of the very clear statement and the 
request for proposals that was put out in March 1992. At 
paragraph (8.6.3), it says this. Again Mr. Bronfman and all those 
who were participating in this contract were well aware of what 
was in the request for proposals.
<P>
	It said: ``All costs and expenses incurred by proponents 
relating to proposals will be borne by the proponents. The 
government is not liable to pay for such costs and expenses or to 
reimburse or to compensate proponents in any manner 
whatsoever for such costs and expenses under any 
circumstances, including the rejection of any or all proposals 
and the cancellation of the project''.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	What could be more clear than the statement in the request for 
proposals that said to all those who wanted to contract with the 
Government of Canada, that wanted to enter into this contract, 
that you are doing so at your own risk, that not only might your 
proposal be rejected, but even if it does happen to be the best 
proposal the government reserves the right not to proceed with 
the project.
<P>
	Why then would there be any compensation at all? The 
request for proposals goes on to state at paragraph 8.7.1: ``The 
government has the right, number one, to reject any or all of the 
proposals; number two, to accept any proposal, and three, to 
elect not to proceed with the project, all as it so determines in its 
sole and absolute discretion''.
<P>
	What could be more clear? If that is the case and they were all 
aware of what they were doing, why would the poor taxpayers be 
requested to pay anything at all to the Pearson Development 
Corporation, which is majority owned by billionaire Charles 
Bronfman from Montreal?
<P>
	That is the question the committee and Parliament has to 
grapple with. I would submit that the overwhelming majority of 
members of Parliament would agree that in the circumstances 
there should be no compensation.
<P>
	There is a Latin phrase which says: ``Ex turpi causa non oritur 
actio''. It is something they taught us in law school way back in 
first year. When you go to court you have to go with clean hands. 
You cannot be the author of your own misfortune or you cannot 
be party to a fraudulent transaction, or you cannot be culpable in 
any way, shape or form and then expect to go to the court to seek 
out justice, equity or compensation.
<P>
	It could hardly be said that Mr. Bronfman and the Pearson 
Development Corporation and its predecessors, Paxport and all 
those involved in putting together this unhappy and unfortunate 
transaction were not aware of what they were doing and what 
was going on behind closed doors.
<P>
	The Canadian people were hoodwinked by the previous Tory 
administration. We were told for example that there would be 
competition at the airport and yet the contract was awarded to a 
friend of the Prime Minister, Mr. Mulroney. Then, for financial 
reasons, he goes to Mr. Bronfman and says: ``I can't carry this 
out''. Mr. Bronfman, who owns terminal 3, all of a sudden 
becomes the monopoly owner of all the terminals at Pearson 
International Airport.
<P>
	Where was the public interest? Was there anybody 
considering the public interest throughout this whole sorry 
matter? I would submit not. There were a lot of people who were 
more concerned and people who are presently before this 
Parliament seeking compensation, were more concerned about 
somehow gathering and squeezing out of the taxpayers as much 
money as possible. They were prepared to border on activity that 
could be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3540"> 3540 </A></B>
<P>
conceived as criminal or fraudulent in order to  strike a deal 
which, as I have said, is totally unconscionable.
<P>
	All the responsibility lies with the previous administration. 
The present Prime Minister made it clear during the election 
campaign that he would cancel the deal and that is what he did. 
No one could ever call into question the integrity of the Prime 
Minister as far as the cancellation of the Pearson contract deal is 
concerned. He conducted a review. The review took place and 
the deal was cancelled. In effect, the deal was cancelled on 
December 3, 1993. The bill before Parliament today gives legal 
effect to the decision of the Prime Minister on December 3. It 
goes further. While I agree in principle that the deal ought to be 
cancelled, I disagree fundamentally with compensation being 
paid pursuant to paragraph 10. More important, I disagree with 
the proposition that Parliament be called on to discuss, in effect, 
a proposal that we do not know about.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	The consortium led by Mr. Bronfman has put forward a claim. 
I would submit that the people of Canada are entitled to know 
exactly what that claim is. Where is the claim? What exactly 
does he want to get paid for? We know he is not going to get paid 
for lost profits, but he is still seeking, reports indicate, some $30 
to $35 million in compensation for out of pocket expenses.
<P>
	Before Parliament can effectively deal with this matter, the 
committee should request and Parliament must have a detailed 
listing of exactly what the compensation is for if Parliament is to 
give the consortium anything at all. In my submission it ought 
not to be given anything.
<P>
	I hope the minister is not prepared to sign a cheque to the 
consortium and keep the taxpayers in the dark as to what the 
cheque is for. I have considerable confidence in the integrity of 
the Minister of Transport and I know he will not allow that to 
happen, and that the claim will come before Parliament. At 
committee I hope a request will be made that whatever claim is 
being made the details will be put forward.
<P>
	Those are my submissions on the issue of compensation. I 
agree that the deal has to be cancelled by law. It is obvious that 
the consortium, the Pearson Development Corporation, will not 
simply walk away. It should, in effect, be told to take a hike but 
it appears it is not. It is pushing the issue.
<P>
	The other issue that has to be dealt with is the future of 
Pearson International Airport. In the few minutes remaining I 
want to make a few comments about that.
<P>
	Having decided to cancel the transaction, the government now 
is faced with making a decision as to what ought to happen at 
Pearson International Airport. The debate will decide ultimately 
whether a private group, a local airport authority, should control 
Pearson or whether Transport Canada should continue to have 
direct control over a federal government asset that generates 
close to 100,000 direct and indirect jobs and is responsible for 
billions of dollars in economic activity.
<P>
	A more thorough debate will have to take place but in my 
respectful submission, given the importance of Pearson airport 
to the national economy, to the national transportation system, 
the Government of Canada should continue to have direct 
control over Pearson through the Department of Transport. We 
ought not to transfer responsibility to a local airport authority. A 
local airport authority would be concerned primarily with the 
local area of metropolitan Toronto, in this case, as opposed to 
the impact that Pearson will have on the nation as a whole.
<P>
	I hope the minister at some point will allow Parliament to deal 
with the greater question of the future of Pearson International 
Airport and who should control it. I think most members will 
agree that it ought not to be privatized, that that is a mistake. Our 
main international airport should not be handed over to the 
private sector for private profit and gain.
<P>
	We all want to see Pearson refurbished but some say that the 
government simply does not have the money to refurbish 
Pearson. That is not quite true. Looking at the profit and loss 
statements of Pearson International Airport over the last 10 or 
20 years and in particular over the last few years when we were 
in the midst of a recession, the airport in effect has been making 
significant profits. Those profits could be used to refurbish.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	Some 20 million passengers travel through Pearson annually. 
If push came to shove, given the numbers of passengers, if a $5 
fee were levied to refurbish Pearson which is not unreasonable 
then the necessary funding could be received without having to 
privatize the airport.
<P>
	Given the importance of Pearson, the task force I was part of 
recommended that a royal commission of inquiry look into the 
future of Pearson International Airport, its purpose and use, the 
problems with air traffic control, the need for additional 
runways and their environmental impact. I do not believe we can 
look at any one aspect of Pearson in isolation from the overall 
picture.
<P>
	I urge the minister to engage this Parliament in a debate as to 
the future of Pearson and what the best mechanism will be to 
determine what route should be taken.
<P>
	In closing let me reiterate this bill must be amended to make it 
absolutely clear that no compensation should be paid 
whatsoever to the Pearson Development Corporation. In any 
event, before this Parliament can effectively deal with this bill 
the claim that is being put forward by Mr. Bronfman should be 
made public so the taxpayers of Canada know exactly what the 
nature of the claim is.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to commend the hon. member for his clear 
presentation. I think that he knows the issue quite well-that is 
pretty obvious.
<P>
	I would like him to tell us what effect it will have on the 
people of Quebec and Canada not to hold a public inquiry in a 
situation like that, if, as it seems very clear, there were many 
underhanded dealings in this case, many people who took 
advantage of the over-representation by lobbyists and the 
questionable lobbying practices.
<P>
	So I would like to know from him what he thinks the impact on 
the public and on the future of the present Liberal government 
would be if we were led to believe that it is a free-for-all and 
that we will continue to operate with the same kind of system, 
and at the same time, what message does it send to those who are 
not part of this wonderful system where special contacts and 
having friends in the right places are what counts.
<P>
	For ordinary people who are caught in the current economic 
bind, with all the attendant difficulties, and who are being hit 
with an increase in the number of weeks needed to qualify for 
unemployment insurance, for example, what message does it 
send when a whole government tolerates such situations and 
would let them be by not holding a public inquiry that could 
clarify matters?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can tell the hon. member that 
the Prime Minister promised integrity in government. Last year 
on December 3 he sent out a very clear message to all those who 
would like to do business with the Government of Canada. That 
message was if you wanted to do business with the Government 
of Canada the public interest must be paramount, public concern 
must be discharged and he would not hesitate to denounce and 
cancel any transaction that was consummated in a fashion 
contrary to that public interest.
<P>
	To his credit the Prime Minister has always maintained there 
ought to be fairness and equity in deliberations with the 
Government of Canada. I think that message has been well 
received by the people of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, it seems clear 
that clause 10, including all of its subclauses, is a means by 
which compensation is going to be paid. That seems to be clear. 
Therefore one can conclude this clause is a direct result of 
representation being made to the government by someone.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	Consequently what appears to be happening is that 
compensation is going to be paid. Someone has made 
application to the government for compensation and probably 
the sums have been clearly articulated. Through clause 10 this 
document is going to allow for that payment to be made.
<P>
	The hon. member has laid this out so well and he seems to be 
clearly in opposition to what his own government is doing. 
Would the hon. member respond to what appears to be surfacing, 
that the application for compensation has been made, the 
legislation is in place under clause 10 to provide for that 
compensation and there is nothing we can do about it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, I disagree. I think there is a lot 
we can do.
<P>
	This bill is before Parliament. We are all parliamentarians. 
We have a responsibility to make sure this bill discharges the 
public interest. I expect all hon. members who feel as I do to 
speak out for the repeal of clause 10 in this bill.
<P>
	If you read clause 9 of the bill it says that no one is entitled to 
any compensation from Her Majesty in connection with the 
coming into force of this act. This makes it clear that the deal is 
cancelled, but I have very serious reservations about clause 10.
<P>
	The hon. member is correct. It is the vehicle by which a 
cheque could be written to Pearson Development Corporation 
and that is wrong. In my view it ought not to be paid anything.
<P>
	I am not part of the transport committee, but I expect and hope 
that members of the transport committee will move an 
amendment rather than being sidetracked on issues such as a 
royal commission. That is a separate issue. With regard to the 
bill before Parliament, I hope that hon. members will move an 
amendment to delete clause 10. The deletion of clause 10 in 
effect will not allow for any compensation at all.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
commend the hon. member for York South-Weston for his 
frankness and courage. Unfortunately, we have not observed the 
same qualities in all members of the party opposite.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member if he thinks, based on his 
experience, which I have tremendous respect for, because he has 
been in this House for a long time now and his reputation and 
honesty are well established, and based on the legislative 
program presented to us or which we can expect, if we will have 
a chance, as the hon. member for Thunder Bay-Nipigon said 
earlier, to review this whole Pearson Airport saga, especially 
when the famous legislation on conflicts of interest or lobbies 
on Parliament Hill is presented. In any case, it is rather hard to 
get an idea of what kind of legislation is coming, but I think that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3542"> 3542 </A></B>
<P>
he knows to what legislation I am  referring. Does he think that 
we will then be able to deal with all that, as the hon. member for 
Thunder Bay-Nipigon said?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> As I indicated earlier, Mr. Speaker, it is 
important that all the details of the Pearson deal be made public. 
I am not sure what vehicle should be used, but all the documents 
should be made public.
<P>
	Mr. Nixon made some very strong comments but he did not go 
into the details. The details are necessary so we know for 
example exactly which lobbying firms in Ottawa were part of 
the deal and which individuals who are presently dealing with 
the Government of Canada partook in an activity Mr. Nixon 
found to be totally unacceptable. Public interest requires all 
those details to be made public. For that reason I support an 
inquiry.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	The transport committee could conduct an inquiry. A 
three-month royal commission with a limited mandate and a 
limited budget could serve the same purpose. Or, Mr. Nixon who 
has already been involved in this matter could conduct the 
inquiry in an open fashion so that all the evidence could be heard 
and Canadians would know the exact details.
<P>
	I do not think the decision or the desire to pay them 
compensation can be adequately discussed or debated unless we 
rely on the details presently available. As I said earlier based on 
the information I have and the statements made by Mr. Nixon, 
my conclusion is that there should be no compensation at all.
<P>
	For future reference, given that we will be discussing an 
ethics package before Parliament, this deal could serve as a very 
strong example of how governments and lobbyists can harm the 
public interest in its deliberations and the type of activity that 
ought to be avoided.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak on this issue. I certainly 
appreciate the member's comments in opening up the matter 
quite clearly for all of us. I also hope this will peak the interest 
and raise the ire of Canadians across the country.
<P>
	The privatization of Pearson airport and this government's 
hasty reversal of the privatization decision smacks of a political 
soap opera with very real consequences for the people involved, 
for Torontonians and for all Canadians. At this rate the soap 
opera will not have a happy ending.
<P>
	The privatization of Pearson was a complex animal right from 
its conception. One of the reasons is that it was all done behind 
closed doors. It was a decision which grew more complex with, 
the passing of time and the ever increasing involvement of 
political players.
<P>
	Now Bill C-22 comes along. It is not really a complex piece 
of legislation on the face of it. However the simplicity of its 
prose I am afraid masks what many believe is a complexity of 
intent on the part of the government.
<P>
	Needless to say the Reform Party supports the cancellation of 
the privatization deal for Pearson, despite the fact that 
privatization of most if not all government industries would 
represent a great leap down the road to a new Canada. It is truly a 
shame the previous government and previous governing party 
was so mired in scandal and pork that it could put such a bad 
light in the minds of Canadians on this whole concept of 
privatization.
<P>
	Of course Bill C-22 is no solution or remedy to the mess 
created by the former government. It just creates a new mess of 
its own. That is why it is imperative we scrap Bill C-22 by 
passing the motion of my colleagues in Her Majesty's Loyal 
Opposition and start from scratch to untangle this web of 
political intrigue, patronage and bad politics.
<P>
	As we untangle this web we may find a new list of names 
along the way which played a prominent part in this whole 
episode. That I fear is the motivation in proposing carte blanche 
out of pocket compensation in Bill C-22, a bill that will not fix 
the Pearson problem but only make it go ever so quietly away.
<P>
	I refer to the Pearson saga as a soap opera, but this soap opera 
has real players who have been genuinely hurt by this mess. As 
usual, the people who have the least to do with creating the 
problem are most likely to be hurt by it and least likely to be 
helped by the solution proposed by this government.
<P>
	I refer to the residents of Toronto. They so very badly require 
Pearson to become a world class air terminal to serve a world 
class city. I refer to the men and women who would have done 
the work to modify Pearson. Those people were counting on 
jobs. I refer to all Canadians who whether they know it or not 
depend on Pearson, the most important hub airport in Canada, to 
keep business flying, to take Canadians efficiently to overseas 
trade destinations and to bring foreign traders in.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	It is always the case that there is a ripple effect whenever a 
government makes a decision of any kind. This is precisely why 
government must learn to restrict itself, for it is inevitable that 
government when it acts will often disrupt the lives of people 
who have no stake in whatever particular project is undertaken.
<P>
	Again, privatization is to be encouraged but when that 
privatization breaks down due to mismanagement and 
corruption, as it did in this case, then the reversal of that 
privatization must be undertaken with the greatest of care, even 
if it takes a bit of time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3543"> 3543 </A></B>
<P>
	That is not what happened here. This government wants to 
ram Bill C-22 down the collective throats of this House. It wants 
to ram Bill C-22 down the throats of Canadians. Whenever 
traditional government takes the decision to study something 
and issue a report, it is customary to expect that with the amount 
of time involved before bureaucrats get around to actually 
concluding something, so much dust will have settled and the 
pages turned so yellow with age that the problem will have 
evolved into something entirely different.
<P>
	That was certainly the case for the last government and was 
also most certainly the case when this party was last in power. It 
is not in this case. I have become so sceptical about the workings 
of traditional politics that I cannot help but be suspicious that 
the sheer speed with which this government published its Nixon 
study and decided to allow for compensation reveals that this 
government has something to fear when it comes to leaving this 
issue on the table for too long.
<P>
	The Pearson deal as it was struck needs to be revoked. Let us 
do that. Then, rather than granting the minister the power to dole 
out vast sums of money, somewhere in the neighbourhood of $30 
million to $40 million for out of pocket expenses, a politically 
suspicious phrase if I have ever heard one, let us dig deeper into 
the issue to discover a couple of things. Number one, let us find 
out the degree to which the previous government bungled this 
deal.
<P>
	A public inquiry, that is one dead horse that deserves to be 
beaten a bit more for fear that it may rise from the dead and 
trample once again on the political process in Canada. Let us 
take time to find out just how wide the web of political blunder 
has been woven. In particular, let us find out precisely the role of 
the lobbyists in this deal. Let us discover how many people have 
been needlessly and through no fault of their own adversely 
affected by the Pearson debacle in order that this government 
can provide restitution where restitution is due.
<P>
	It is interesting to note the players who have come into being 
and whose party or whose companies and names have been 
published in other manuscripts. They should be examined 
closely. Let us use this as a case study in politics gone wrong so 
that it hopefully will never happen again.
<P>
	We need to see just how much of a liability Pearson has been 
for the government. We know that a major liability has been 
incurred already and will grow if Bill C-22 is passed, especially 
with section 10.
<P>
	Last, let us re-examine the privatization of Pearson to see just 
how to make it work. This time around I hope the government in 
power will exercise the political will and common sense wisdom 
necessary to bear in mind that political decisions like this affect 
more than just the political players involved. They affect 
everyone, the people who work at Pearson, the people who 
would rebuilt Pearson, and all Canadians who depend on 
Pearson in so many ways.
<P>
	There is a valuable lesson to be learned from Pearson. By 
proposing Bill C-22 this government has proven to the Canadian 
people that they have learned nothing, especially with the 
compensation package. I hope that it will redeem itself by 
supporting the amendment to kill this bill, to stop the blind 
power of the minister to make huge repayments without 
accountability and by starting over.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	If not, this government will have proved that narrow political 
interests are still at work controlling Ottawa and that the 
interests of hard working people have yet to be adequately 
represented by traditional political parties.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
congratulate the member who just spoke because his comments 
are very much to the point.
<P>
	Since the hon. member is also in favour of setting up a royal 
inquiry commission, I want to ask him if he agrees with the 
Liberal member who said earlier that the costs related to such a 
commission would be somewhere around $27 million.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a good question as to the 
evaluation of costs. What do out of pocket costs or expenses 
mean if one is talking about repayment? I do not think I can 
evaluate that compensation package at this point. It would have 
to be exposed to the public and a clear examination done.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned something about a royal 
commission. I question whether a royal commission is 
necessarily the way to go. I certainly agree to an inquiry to have 
the package exposed to public scrutiny but not necessarily to a 
royal commission.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to go back to the comments made by the 
previous speaker, who said that we must distinguish between 
privatization under circumstances which justify such a measure, 
and privatization under rather dubious circumstances such as in 
the case of the Pearson Airport.
<P>
	I want to ask the hon. member if, in some future legislation on 
lobbies, it would be appropriate to include specific provisions 
on the concerns related to lobbies under particular 
circumstances where privatization is anticipated. Should we 
have specific rules concerning lobbies which could apply to this 
case, but which could also apply to any case, so as to be sure that 
those who have a vested interest are kept at arm's length?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, lobbying has been around for as 
long as politics has been around. To really stamp it out through 
legislation may be a very difficult thing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3544"> 3544 </A></B>
<P>
	One matter that must be brought forward on any deal, 
compensation package or transaction the government involves 
itself in with private industry is if it is all laid out on the table for 
it to be examined by the public and everyone knows exactly 
where they stand in any operational deal, one is going to avoid a 
lot of questionable activities. If it is protected and hidden behind 
closed doors, the lobbyists will be the most effective. Exposing 
it to light, of course, they are the least effective.
<P>
	From that point of view I would like to see things certainly 
brought to the forefront when it comes to any kind of 
privatization deal in the future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is an aspect 
of the issue which concerns me somewhat. Several members 
expressed concern regarding the cost of such an inquiry, and 
whether a royal commission is the way to go. Perhaps we could 
have another type of inquiry. The important thing is to have an 
instrument, a commission which will have the power to find out 
the truth. When it comes to deciding between a material interest 
related to the quick construction of an airport terminal and the 
common interest, we should not even hesitate if we want the 
public to trust institutions such as ours: we must favour the 
common interest and ensure that the public is protected.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	If we have to wait a further six months before a third terminal 
can be built at Pearson, then so be it. During this time, the 
taxpaying citizens will know that their tax dollars are being used 
wisely. Moreover, if the government party's conscience is clear 
with regard to the former government's transactions and if the 
current government believes that it is not acting in a similar 
fashion, then it should have nothing to fear from a commission 
of inquiry. It would have no reason to fear that a commission 
would uncover some deals in which it may have been involved 
itself.
<P>
	A transparent government like the one the Liberal Party likes 
to boast about should not have any concerns about inquiries 
conducted by a royal commission. It should not be afraid of 
answering questions put to it. Yet, the government continues to 
object to this request. Taxpayers may very well begin to 
question this government's sincerity. They may start asking 
themselves why the Liberals are trying so hard to avoid 
appearing before a commissioner of inquiry. When someone's 
hands are clean, there is no need to fear the truth, or 
investigators. There is no reason to fear disclosing someone 
else's past activities because they may be associated with ours.
<P>
	I think that the comments made were sincere, but this should 
not be the end of it. We must ensure that the truth comes to light, 
that the public is informed of it, and above all, that with respect 
to other projects-it could be Hibernia or maybe the helicopter 
contract, another  cancelled deal-the same questions will not 
come up again. When questions do arise and when the public 
interest is at issue, there should be no reason to fear asking the 
questions openly.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I do not know if the 
member for Calgary Northeast wishes to comment to the last 
intervention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not believe there was a 
question there. There was certainly a considerable amount of 
information passed through his five minute presentation.
<P>
	Again, going back to the royal commission and looking at 
taxpayers' dollars, what is to be gained by striking a royal 
commission? In looking at previous royal commissions they 
have been very expensive in nature. Can this matter be handled 
in a much more efficient way than a royal commission and the 
expenditure of millions more?
<P>
	I know that Mr. Nixon did a study on the matter and there were 
certain recommendations and I believe that we should be 
looking closely at those recommendations. If they indicate that 
there should no compensation then there should be no 
compensation. I am certainly much in favour of that.
<P>
	Apart from that, I really do not have anything more to say in 
reference to the member's comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I consider it a privilege to speak in this debate on Bill 
C-22. In the last election campaign, the leader of the Liberal 
Party of Canada travelled from coast to coast to promise a 
transparent government, among other things, to the Canadian 
people. Where is this government after six months in office?
<P>
	I will quickly go over a few facts that, in my opinion, are 
revealing in this regard. As promised, the government cancelled 
the helicopter contract but we and the Canadian people still do 
not know how much this decision really cost.
<P>
	Last December, when hardly anyone was paying any attention 
to what was happening in Ottawa, and while we were busy 
setting up our offices in Ottawa and in our respective ridings, the 
government announced an increase in unemployment insurance 
premiums. In its February 22 budget, the government tried to 
portray itself to Canadians as a generous and understanding 
government and a very good manager by announcing a premium 
reduction that will, however, only come into effect in 1995. This 
government does not want to let Canadians know that it has 
brought premiums back to where they were before it increased 
them.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3545"> 3545 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	In the Ginn Publishing affair, the government did not fool 
anyone who followed the case, and Canadians did not fall for the 
very strange and contradictory explanations given by the 
various ministers questioned on this subject.
<P>
	The Official Opposition tried by every means available to 
shed light on the sale of a Canadian publishing house to an 
American giant. It was all in vain. All Liberal members and 
ministers continued to act in collusion, preferring silence to 
clear and unequivocal answers. They prefer to swim in neutral 
waters where only spoken words leave traces and where the 
Liberals feel tied by a verbal agreement apparently made by a 
minister from the previous government. According to a legal 
opinion given by the Department of Justice at the request of its 
client, the Department of Finance, this information is subject to 
solicitor-client privilege pursuant to section 23 of the Access to 
Information Act.
<P>
	Given the lack of transparency of this government, it was 
impossible for the population to know for sure who was 
protected in this deal and who really benefited from it. This was 
followed by another troubling situation: serious allegations to 
the effect that the Museum of Nature was mismanaged. There 
was a general outcry from Canadian and international scientists, 
who asked the government to intervene before it was too late.
<P>
	The Official Opposition pointed out, once again, before the 
Committee on Canadian Heritage that the population had the 
right to know whether or not the allegations were founded since 
the $18 or $20 million budget of this museum comes from 
taxpayers. Both Opposition parties demanded the right to let the 
committee hear witnesses so we could listen to both versions of 
the story. No such luck! The Liberals who are so proud of their 
transparency refused, once again, to let us shed light on this 
issue.
<P>
	I will not pretend that I undertook an exhaustive review of this 
government's first six months in office. My purpose is rather to 
draw the public's attention to one constant in the few examples I 
have just given. The constant is this: every time the government 
could follow up on its promise of integrity and openness, it 
chooses subterfuges, even though, in the red book and in his 
speeches throughout the campaign, the Prime Minister said in 
various ways that openness was necessary if people were to 
regain confidence in government and in politicians.
<P>
	Now let us take a closer look at Bill C-22, an act respecting 
certain agreements concerning the redevelopment and operation 
of terminals 1 and 2 at Lester B. Pearson International Airport. I 
will go right to the point and highlight briefly, in my own way, 
some of the events which began in April 1987.
<P>
	First, the Conservative government agreed to entrust the 
building and operation of terminal 3 at Pearson Airport to a real 
estate company owned by Charles Bronfman. This first group of 
friends included Herb Metcalfe, a lobbyist for Claridge 
Properties Inc. and former organizer for Jean Chrétien; Leo 
Kolber, a Liberal senator who, as has been mentioned on many 
occasions, held a party at $1,000 per guest during the election 
campaign; Peter Coughlin, president of Claridge Properties Inc. 
and general manager of Pearson Development Corporation; Ray 
Hession, who was deputy minister of everything important in 
previous Liberal governments and has ties to Paxport Inc., as the 
<I>Ottawa Citizen</I> pointed out.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	Later, Brian Mulroney's government went back on one of its 
decisions and in December 1992 decided to turn the 
redevelopment and operation of terminals 1 and 2 at Lester B. 
Pearson International Airport over to private enterprise. The 
deadlines were very short and only two firms could answer the 
government's call for tenders and bid: Claridge, for Charles 
Bronfman, and Paxport, for the Matthews group. Paxport Inc. 
was selected.
<P>
	This time we find the Conservative government's real friends, 
including Don Matthews, president of Paxport Inc., who was 
president of Brian Mulroney's leadership campaign in 1983; he 
is a former president of the Conservative Party and chaired 
many fund-raising campaigns. His son-in-law, David Peterson, 
was Premier of Ontario. Mr. Chrétien asked Bob Nixon, a former 
Peterson Cabinet minister, to investigate, behind closed doors, 
the transaction that he promised to cancel on the very last day of 
his campaign.
<P>
	Otto Jelinek, a former minister in the Conservative 
government, is a member of the board of directors of Paxport 
and president of an Asian subsidiary of the Matthews Group. 
Fred Doucet, a professional lobbyist and long-standing friend 
of Brian Mulroney, will be hired by Paxport; his name will also 
come up in the Ginn Publishing affair. As you can see, Mr. 
Speaker, it all holds together.
<P>
	Bill Neville, another Paxport lobbyist, and a former chief of 
staff-a very interesting character, as you will see-of Joe Clark 
when he was Prime Minister, member of Brian Mulroney's inner 
circle and head of Ms. Campbell's transition team. He will have 
served all three of them; in his case, it was wall to wall.
<P>
	Paxport Inc. was to demonstrate the financial viability of its 
proposal by February 15, 1993, but the government did not hold 
firm on this condition. Since its financial backing was not solid 
enough for this transaction to go through, Paxport will have to 
turn to their pal Charles Bronfman and ask him: ``Come to our 
rescue, competitor dear. Let us merge and acquire a controlling 
interest in this highly profitable airport. This will allow us to 
add millions to our respective family trusts''. As a result, T1 T2 
Limited Partnership was established; it was  the only way to go 
on with negotiations with the government. Furthermore, Cla-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3546"> 3546 </A></B>
<P>
ridge, the rival company, became a majority holder, with 66 per 
cent of the shares, while the company initially selected to 
implement this project found itself holding a mere 17 per cent of 
the shares of the new company, based on what it could afford.
<P>
	To make this enterprise very profitable for its friends, the 
government undertook to divert passenger traffic to that airport 
and curb, if not stop, any airport development activity within 75 
kilometres of the Lester B. Pearson Airport.
<P>
	Since the government apparently had unlimited funds 
available given the possibility of making deficits, it dug out 
several other millions to complete this privatization which 
would allow the government's friends to get rich on the backs of 
the taxpayers. To sell privatization to key groups, the following 
compensations were offered: severance pay for Transport 
Canada employees, for a grand total of $5.5 million and this, in 
spite of the fact that all jobs had been protected for at least two 
years with Pearson Development Corporation.
<P>
	Add to that a 15 per cent contribution toward the rent paid by 
Air Canada and foreign airlines using the facilities at Terminal 
2.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	Moreover, while the government had expressly committed 
itself to not finance the construction, repair or renovation of 
terminals 1 and 2, it secretly decided otherwise by agreeing to a 
40 per cent carry over on rent, through a good clause in a 
contract which is about that thick. I saw it this morning and I was 
rather surprised. The money will be paid back later, with interest 
based on the Bank of Canada rate, plus 2.5 per cent.
<P>
	The Lester B. Pearson Airport generates profits, and this 
could make it attractive for third parties. Yet, in a contract that 
thick, the Canadian government did not even include a clause to 
enable it to oppose such a transfer, so that the airport operations 
could fall in the hands of foreign interests and the government 
would not even be able to do anything about it.
<P>
	There seems to be sufficient reasons to justify a public 
inquiry. Indeed, in the report which recommended cancelling 
the privatization of Pearson Airport, Mr. Nixon mentions that 
the role of lobbyists in this case went largely beyond what is 
normally acceptable, especially as regards the reassignment of 
several senior civil servants. The report also points out that to 
conclude a transaction of this scope during an election campaign 
flies in the face of democratic practice.
<P>
	The first eight sections of the legislation cancel the 
transaction and prohibit any suit against the Government of 
Canada and its officials. Fine. The Liberal government had 
made a promise and, for the second time, it gets out of a written 
commitment involving several million dollars. First, it got out 
of the helicopter contract and now, through a piece of 
legislation, it is  getting out of a hastily drafted contract 
regarding the Lester B. Pearson Airport.
<P>
	How can this same government claim, as it has been doing for 
months now, that it was not able to get out of an oral 
commitment made by a minister of the previous government, 
while it gets out of the written agreement? This government is 
not fooling anybody, and the inquiry could reveal other things.
<P>
	What is really behind the cancellation of this whole deal? Is it 
that too many Conservatives and not enough Liberals were 
benefitting from the transaction? Or, was there some fear that 
the scheme would eventually be discovered?
<P>
	There is reason to be worried, and Canadians will come to 
know the contents of this bill. Just when they are being asked to 
tighten their belts and prepare for a review of their social 
security net, the government wants to enact legislation 
favouring those who let certain political parties come to power.
<P>
	Pursuant to clause 9, there will be no compensation in 
connection with the coming into force of the Act. But, according 
to clause 10, compensation may be awarded if the Minister 
deems it appropriate. This is doctoring, Mr. Speaker! I was very 
happy to hear other members say that to leave all that power in 
the hands of the minister was dangerous, as some bleeding is 
occurring and God knows when it will stop.
<P>
	Here is my conclusion: This government is hog-tied thanks to 
friends of the system who, year after year, continue to fill the 
campaign coffers of both the Liberal and the Conservative 
parties.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	And I will remind hon. members that the Leader of the 
Opposition very clearly demonstrated this morning that the five 
largest Canadian banks split their donations fifty-fifty between 
both traditional parties, handing out almost half a million 
dollars, that is $250,000 to the Liberal Party and $250,000 to the 
Conservative Party.
<P>
	These old political parties take into account the best interests 
of those who make it possible for them to take turns running the 
country, while ignoring the best interests of the public.
<P>
	The time has more than come to put public finances on a 
healthy footing by introducing a bill concerning the financing of 
political parties, something similar to the legislation passed by 
the Quebec government.
<P>
	In this case, we do not have any other choice but to set up a 
royal commission to clarify this very dismal and shameful 
instance of patronage.
<P>
	This commission could, if necessary, recommend the amounts 
of money to be paid following the cancellation of the current 
contract. However, it is understood that this money could not be 
used to cover any potential profit T1 T2 Limited Partnership 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3547"> 3547 </A></B>
<P>
could have made from Terminals 1 and 2 at Pearson Airport or to 
cover the fee paid for the purpose of lobbying a public office 
holder.
<P>
	To put it plainly, that covers any fee paid to the lobbyists who 
made the government do their bidding by reminding them who 
in fact is responsible for their election.
<P>
	Canadians are sick of this government's lack of openness. 
They are sick of these secret promises that cost a bundle to 
Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	Canadians have had enough of this government protecting its 
friends and paying back those who financially supported its 
election campaign. They have had enough of the promises made 
in the red book-which, when I was young, referred to the used 
cars listing-and which makes the government look good and 
projects an inaccurate picture of its true identity.
<P>
	In short, Canadians are sick of promises that keep the wheel 
turning, that allow the rich to get richer, the poor to get poorer, 
and the traditional political parties to take turns at running the 
country and taking a slice of the pie.
<P>
	Canadians have reached the threshold of tolerance and have 
lost confidence in a government which, in a very short period of 
time, has missed all the opportunities it was given to restore 
confidence and refused to show any openness.
<P>
	On their behalf, I too call for a royal commission to get to the 
bottom of this shocking deal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member sitting next to me for 
her clear demonstration. It was very instructive and we can see 
that her experience as a teacher is now useful when time comes 
to give very clear examples.
<P>
	I really liked the comparison she made with Ginn Publishing. 
Whereas the Pearson Airport situation is the doing of the 
previous administration, the Ginn Publishing matter is the 
responsibility of this government but, in both cases, we see the 
same pattern of unclear behaviour which maintains the 
behind-the-scene influence of the lobbyists. I would like my 
colleague for Rimouski-Témiscouata to give us more details 
about the changes to the financing of political parties that would 
be needed to correct this situation.
<P>
	In a sense, this reminds us a little of what may have happened 
in Quebec before 1976, particularly during the first two terms 
under Robert Bourassa, that is from 1970 to 1976, when 
questionable practices were common.
<P>
	We had people somehow similar to those mentioned in the 
speech. In Quebec, Desrochers, for example, was maybe the 
type of person to do that kind of work.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	Quebec managed to break free from such practices thanks in 
particular to the way Mr. René Lévesque revised the financing of 
political parties. I would like my colleague to clarify for us the 
ways to eliminate the questionable relationship between 
governments and lobbyists.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question and for giving me an opportunity to talk a little bit 
about political party financing.
<P>
	It is, obviously, extremely important that the federal 
government address this question and make a fundamental 
change to prohibit all companies from making donations to 
political parties. The money to fund political parties must come 
from individuals and there must be a limit on contributions.
<P>
	We have seen what has happened in the past. If we look at Mr. 
Desmarais' contribution in the Charlottetown referendum 
campaign, each of the eight members of his family, including a 
three-year-old girl, gave $3,000. His contribution could not 
exceed $24,000. That is a far cry from the $250,000 campaign 
contribution he could have made.
<P>
	It is the same thing with Bombardier. These companies have 
to paint themselves red or blue. It would take too long to give a 
detailed answer to my colleague's question, but if we took away 
the right of companies to donate money to political parties, we 
would not have such a mess on our hands. If the legislation on 
lobbyists was reformed, we would know exactly how things 
work and we could get to the bottom of the matter.
<P>
	The same applies to people who appear as witnesses before 
committees. We should adopt the American system where sworn 
testimony is the rule, otherwise the work of committees is 
pointless.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think it is clear 
that when a government stops a deal like this the question is how 
can it do so without alienating very powerful people within 
Canada who are involved in the deal. It is obvious how the 
government has arranged to do that and that is through section 
10. Section 10 is clear evidence that an agreement has been 
made. Not only that, in order to satisfy everyone that agreement 
has to be consummated in very short order.
<P>
	Subsection (3) of section 10 states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No agreement may be entered into under this section after one month after the 
coming into force of this Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	All the payouts are going to occur one month after this act is 
passed.
<P>
	The agreement that has been made, and it is obvious to me and 
everyone who has looked at this situation, is that the 
compensation package has been put forward by those people to 
the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3548"> 3548 </A></B>
<P>
government. It has been agreed upon and we are simply going 
through the motions. Because  we are in a majority government 
situation, this is going to be passed. This is a fait accompli.
<P>
	I would like to ask a question of the hon. member who spoke 
so eloquently about this situation. The Bloc is recommending a 
royal commission of inquiry. Does the member not feel it is time 
that the standing committees of the House were empowered to 
deal with these kinds of issues? Should they not have the power 
of subpoena and the power to bring witnesses before the 
standing committees to examine them? Should not the elected 
representatives be playing the role that the royal commissions of 
inquiry have in the past at enormous costs? Ought we not to be 
doing that job? I am asking the hon. member if she would agree 
with that. If she does, would she make that recommendation to 
her caucus?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
very pertinent question and his very judicious comment. It is 
quite clear that one does not need a crystal ball or clairvoyant 
powers to see what is in clause 10 of the bill.
<P>
	Thanks to clause 10, people will recover what they lost when 
their contract was cancelled. I agree totally with my colleague 
on that point.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, I do not believe in the work of committees. 
Based on my personal experience, I find these committees a 
sham. Unless we can have people subpoenaed and testify under 
oath, these committees are merely entertainment for most 
Liberal backbenchers, but are becoming quite a waste of time 
for us on this side.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let me first of all congratulate my colleague for her 
speech. What I retain from her remarks is the kind of 
relationship, the kind of scheming brought to light on this issue, 
between various successive governments.
<P>
	Basically, my colleague for Rimouski has very eloquently 
demonstrated the relationships that the Liberal-Conservative 
contributors and the Conservative-Liberal contributors have 
had sometimes with the Conservative government and 
sometimes with the Liberal government. As we can see, it all 
boils down to the same thing. That is something to really think 
about. Our colleague for Crowfoot suggested that clause 10 in 
this bill hints that there is a deal somewhere, but that it 
obviously cannot be outlined in the legislation. What is stated in 
the bill is that the Minister may approve any agreement 
submitted to him within 35 days after the passing of this 
legislation.
<P>
	I would like to hear my colleague further on that kind of deal 
and also on that kind of Liberal-Conservative or 
Conservative-Liberal buddy-buddy system, because of which 
we always find ourselves in that kind of situation. The people 
invited to a $1,000 or $3,000-a-plate dinner are not the kind of 
people the Prime Minister referred to  as beer drinkers last week, 
but rather people arriving with their six-pack of champagne and 
generous contributions for the Liberal Party.
<P>
	The only way we can resolve that problem is to pass a 
legislation on the funding of political parties and electoral 
campaigns. I like to remind people that since such a piece of 
legislation was passed in Quebec, no matter what government is 
in power in Quebec, there has been no instance of wrongdoing 
brought to light. How come? Because of the transparency of the 
funds contributed to the parties. I would like to hear my 
colleague speak on that.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief. Obviously 
a deal has been concluded, this is very clear in this legislation. 
This is the only thing transparent in this bill, there is a deal. Now 
it has been repeated during the whole campaign, Conservatives 
and Liberals are six of one and half a dozen of the other, they 
amount to the same thing. If we are able to rise today in this 
House and condemn this legislation, and denounce the scheming 
and the patronage, it is because our hands are clean.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.56 p.m., the 
House will now proceed to consideration of Private Members' 
Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

	The House resumed from March 22 consideration of the 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pity 
we have to move on to other things, because we were having a 
very interesting and lively debate. We will now proceed to 
something more technical dealing with child support payments, 
a subject which is rather important in itself.
<P>
	This issue arises in a context of developments to which 
society must adjust. Broken families are more and more 
prevalent and, even though it may not be desirable, the 
government must adjust itself to these new circumstances.
<P>
	The motion presented by the hon. member for Nepean reads as 
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3549"> 3549 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should amend the Income 
Tax Act so that child support payments are no longer considered taxable income 
for their recipients.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	This is a very interesting motion, but we should nonetheless 
consider both sides of its potential impact. Some of my 
colleagues have already mentioned that the Bloc would support 
this motion. That is what we will do.
<P>
	But I would like to make a point. Under the current system, 
the parent who must make support payments-that is the father 
most of the time-can deduct those payments for income tax 
purposes. The mother who receives support payments must 
include them in her own taxable income.
<P>
	The first goal, naturally, is to avoid double taxation and to tax 
the income in the hands of the recipient. Another consideration 
would be to allow the taxpayer with the lowest income to include 
the payments in his or her income in order to lower the tax 
amount. Those are commendable goals but they create in fact a 
deep feeling of injustice.
<P>
	The one question that should be asked is: Who is the recipient 
of the support payments? They are paid to the mother and she 
must include them in her income. In fact, it is income that is 
used and should be used for the children, and, in most cases, it is 
used for the children. It is often insufficient, however, since it 
must take into account the ability to pay of the spouse or of the 
person who is making the alimony payments. And the person 
who receives the payments must pay income tax on it.
<P>
	This creates a feeling of injustice because, in reality, the 
income should go to the child. Does the child have to pay or 
support income tax, finally? The child has no income, and this 
could be the problem. Should we really make this income 
taxable?
<P>
	This may be where we should improve on the proposal. 
Insofar as the person receiving the alimony payments is not 
required to pay income tax or to declare these payments, we 
should make sure that, in establishing the amount of alimony, a 
judge is not influenced by a change in the tax system.
<P>
	Take for example the case of a person receiving alimony of 
$6,000 a year or $500 a month; the person would receive a gross 
income of $500, and a net income of let us say $400, which 
would allow for $100 in income tax. We could be in a situation 
where a judge would take the new tax rules into account and say: 
``I will ask the spouse to pay only $400. He will pay tax only on 
$400 and the beneficiairy will receive the same amount as 
before''.
<P>
	We would then be in a neutral situation for the person 
collecting alimony. I do not think this is the purpose of the 
motion presented by the member for Nepean. I think that its 
objective is to ensure that the gross amount that is paid becomes 
a net amount, and that the spouse who is giving child support 
bears the tax burden, as if in fact  that spouse was still part of the 
couple and should pay for children's expenses.
<P>
	We could say: ``Yes, but in fact, the simple thing to do would 
be not to tax either side''. That is dangerous, because that would 
easily encourage a transfer of income from one spouse to the 
other, so that a good part of the income would become 
non-taxable. That is not really desirable. A part of the income 
must continue to be taxable.
<P>
	The question we must ask ourselves is: Must the children 
support a part of that tax? For the government, taxing the spouse 
who is giving child support payments would have a stimulating 
effect on the income since that income is often higher that the 
one that gets the spouse who is receiving those payments. On the 
other side, that might encourage single-parent families. That 
should be examined.
<P>
	There is also an aspect in this issue that should not be 
overlooked. A good part of the problems does not stem 
necessarily from the tax treatment, but often from the 
incapability for a spouse who is entitled to child support 
payments to actually get them.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	We all know or are often told that an ex-husband or ex-wife 
may often have one or several unreported incomes. We all know 
that the underground economy is thriving and that a spouse can 
avoid paying alimony. In such cases, it is very difficult to do 
something about it and proceedings are long and expensive. We 
are looking at a group of people who do not take their 
responsibilities seriously. I am not saying everybody is like that. 
Despite the fact that their family is apart, many people remain 
very much concerned about the development of their children 
and take their responsibilities seriously.
<P>
	In some cases, however, things are much more difficult. We 
should insist on the protection of ex-spouses, and in particular 
ex-wives because there are much more ex-wives who 
experience problems with alimony payments from their 
ex-husbands. I think these are issues that should not be dealt 
with separately. They should be integrated as a whole. In that 
sense, I think it is a good proposal but, as I said, we should take 
that into consideration.
<P>
	After checking this afternoon, according to information we 
received, it would appear that judges tend to take the tax 
treatment into consideration before allowing an amount to an 
ex-spouse. That being said, if they do that now, chances are that 
they will continue to do that in the future and that they are going 
to take into account the amendments brought to the Income Tax 
Act.
<P>
	We should clarify things so as to avoid an adverse impact 
from this measure. I understand that it is only a motion and that 
we want to set out a principle. I think that we all have to agree on 
that principle. Even the members from the Reform Party who 
said they were against the motion recognized that principle. 
They are  not opposed to it. However, they said that they had 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3550"> 3550 </A></B>
<P>
problems with the technicalities. That is possible, but that does 
not mean that there is no way to improve them.
<P>
	The member from Nepean thoroughly researched her motion. 
She talked about the origin of the alimony, which began in the 
1940s, and the way it operates for income tax purposes. She was 
perfectly right when she said that the context or the legislation 
never made any progress over the years. She talked about the 
principle of deduction/inclusion since it is possible to make a 
deduction on one hand, and on the other hand, to include the 
amount that has been deducted in the other income which is not 
correct and which, according to several people, seems quite 
unfair.
<P>
	In that sense, I think that knowing that she has the support of 
this side of the House, she should now go one step further than 
what is proposed in her motion and talk to the minister of 
Revenue and the minister of Finance.
<P>
	I am sure that the Department of Revenue reviewed the 
matter. When this was debated earlier in the House, someone 
mentioned that, in the United States, no distinction is made 
between the portion of the alimony used for the expenses that a 
woman must incur by the very fact that she has children, and the 
portion of the alimony used for the expenses directly linked to 
the children. There are two categories subject to different tax 
treatments. Perhaps this is an alternative worth considering, an 
interesting approach. One should also look at what is done 
elsewhere. There are certain things which are easy to do and 
which would allow a fairer system. This is the meaning of her 
proposal.
<P>
	Finally, in introducing this motion, the member has been 
guided by deeply humane motives. We are going to support her 
proposal, but we must go one step further in the technical details 
so as to ensure that what we want to put forward will not have 
adverse effects.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
my pleasure to speak in support of the private member's motion 
put forward by my colleague from Nepean. Her initiative 
provides an opportunity for this new Parliament to address not 
just one issue but three recent phenomena which Canadians are 
not happy about.
<P>
	The motion specifically addresses the taxation of child 
support payments, but more broadly asks us to examine the 
distribution of wealth in the country, the growth of child poverty 
and the cohesion between the values of Canadians and the 
policies of government.
<P>
	First let us look at the distribution of wealth. If you put all the 
families in Canada together and then divide them into five 
equally sized groups, you see some interesting numbers. The 20 
per cent at the top level of income receives 40 per cent of the 
income paid out. The lowest 20 per cent receives only a meagre 
6 per cent of the income.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	If we go further and combine the two lowest groups of 20 per 
cent and form a new group that represents 40 per cent of all 
Canadian families, we will find that this substantially sized 
group receives and lives on only 18 per cent of the total income. 
Compare this idea of the bottom 40 per cent living on 20 per cent 
of the income with the top 20 per cent living and spending 40 per 
cent of the income.
<P>
	The remaining two groups in the middle receive 18 per cent 
and 24 per cent respectively, hovering close to the 20 per cent 
figure that the group represents.
<P>
	I ask the House whether as representatives of Canadians we 
are satisfied with this situation? I know it is a large question but 
I think it is appropriate to ask it in the early stages of a new 
Parliament because today's debate is the first opportunity to 
begin to consider it and keep it in mind as we discuss tax reform 
and the 1995 and subsequent budgets.
<P>
	Personally I am not satisfied with the fact that 20 per cent of 
our families struggle to exist on 6 per cent of income because I 
know that in those families live children who are not getting 
their fair share of the wealth of their country.
<P>
	Second, let us look at this phenomenon of poverty of children 
in Canada. Statistics Canada reports that 1.2 million children 
under the age of 18 live in poverty. The effect of poverty on their 
health is particularly significant, given that poverty at the 
earliest stages of life has a lasting impact on health status that 
extends into adulthood.
<P>
	This is further illustrated by the fact that the infant mortality 
rate of children in poor neighbourhoods is almost twice as high 
as that in rich neighbourhoods. In 1992, 900,000 children 
needed to use a food bank and about one in eight families were 
living in substandard housing.
<P>
	I am not satisfied with these statistics either. They remind me 
of a situation in an emerging nation where a few live like kings 
and the many struggle to exist. They even bring to mind the word 
oligarchy where a powerful few are in control and are accepting 
of and tolerant of the sight of hungry children.
<P>
	Canadians reject the idea that such a system is acceptable. 
Canadians question the appropriateness of obscene salaries for 
certain chief executive officers. In <I>Maclean's</I> magazine this 
week Allan Fotheringham in his column writes about a Canadian 
CEO who was paid $6.9 million last year and asks the question: 
``Is anyone worth $6.9 million for one year's chores''?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3551"> 3551 </A></B>
<P>
	Many Canadians are suffering, food banks are blooming but 
somehow there is enough spare change in the system to pay one 
person $6.9 million. This is offensive to Canadians who value 
fairness and dignity for all. It is offensive to a people committed 
to peace, order and good government.
<P>
	This is the context in which we address the question of the 
taxation of child support payments. Today on breakup of a 
marriage one parent usually gets custody of the children and the 
other parent is ordered to make regular payments. The money 
received by the custodial parent is considered to be income and 
is taxed as such. The non-custodial parent is allowed to deduct 
the amount transferred over the course of a year from taxable 
income on the annual tax form.
<P>
	I believe that from the outset this is unfair compared to the 
situation of intact or two-parent families who file income tax 
returns. In a two-parent family both parents spend money on 
their children's welfare all year but neither of them is able to add 
it all up and then subtract it from taxable income.
<P>
	Today we are actually rewarding the non-custodial parent by 
providing a tax break not enjoyed either by single custodial 
parents nor by the two parents who stay together.
<P>
	Why did we ever do this in the first place? It was thought that 
if income tax was paid by the custodial parent, usually the 
mother who was in a lower tax bracket, that less money would go 
to the government and there would be more for the children. 
This idea was obviously developed by people who had never 
been divorced and who thought that the concept of the original 
family including mutual support and nurturence continued 
beyond the date of the divorce.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	It ignored several realities, the reality that divorce is 
adversarial and usually leaves in its wake revenge and 
bitterness, the reality that divorce requires the maintenance of 
two households with accompanying costs, and ignored the 
reality that the non-custodial parent embarks on a new lifestyle 
with new demands and unanticipated costs. It ignored the reality 
that the family which remains loses one adult worker to share 
housework, home maintenance and child care. It ignored the 
reality that the custodial parent inherits the work, the worry, the 
emotional and intellectual strain of maintaining a home and 
being on duty 24 hours a day for the children.
<P>
	Our tax system rewards the parent who leaves and penalizes 
the parent who stays.
<P>
	Some would say that amounts to be paid are the business of 
the courts and that judges and lawyers today are calculating all 
these facts when they gross up support payments. But some of 
these decisions are 10 to 15 years old and not only are the 
amounts paid totally inadequate but no gross up ever occurred in 
the original calculations.
<P>
	Some would say then it is time to go back to court for a change 
of circumstance review. I would say those who give such advice 
have never been divorced either, or at least have never lived the 
life of a single parent. Single parents are usually poorer than 
their peers who are still married. They are often exhausted 
because of the burden they carry.
<P>
	Picture a single mother of three teenagers who has been 
divorced for 10 years. Chances are she has already been back to 
court several times attempting to secure arrears owed to her, or 
perhaps she has registered with the provincial system designed 
to chase the non-custodial parent for arrears owing. Neither 
system has served her or her children well.
<P>
	The result of these systems that do not work on the members 
of a single parent family is a feeling that they are less valuable to 
society, that they are marginalized in their struggle to survive. 
The temptation is to give up.
<P>
	When poor single parents read in the paper that 61 per cent of 
single parent families live in poverty at an average of $9,000 per 
year below the poverty line it confirms to them the reality that 
they are living every day. It is not encouraging to them.
<P>
	I and the other members of this new Parliament have inherited 
a country where over the last nine years the free market and 
government inaction were supposed to enhance the economic 
wellbeing of all but Canadians have come together to agree that 
that system did not deliver the results they were looking for.
<P>
	They are expecting us to shake off the political paralysis and 
to shed the philosophy of inaction. They are asking us to unleash 
the political will for changes that will restore a sense of fairness 
to all Canadians.
<P>
	Amending the Income Tax Act so that child support payments 
are no longer considered taxable income for the recipients is 
admittedly just one piece of a much larger puzzle but this motion 
before us tonight is the first chance we have had to demonstrate 
that we too are appalled by the statistics on the poverty endured 
by children in single parent families and that we are committed 
to restoring hope to those children.
<P>
	Our support of this motion sends a message that we are not 
timid. We are not afraid to challenge the status quo. Rather it 
says that we who formed this government reflect the deep held 
values of Canadians and that we do have the political will to 
make the changes necessary to reinstate fairness as the hallmark 
of Canadian society.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to support the motion presented by the 
hon. member for Nepean. The issue of support payments is a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3552"> 3552 </A></B>
<P>
very important one for many people, especially for women and 
children.
<P>
	The current legislation discriminates against children born in 
poor families or families headed by single parents. This motion 
is needed to improve the circumstances of women and children. 
The legislation was passed 52 years ago and has changed very 
little since then, but society and the status of women have 
changed a great deal.
<P>
	In the forties, the government introduced what was 
considered progressive legislation. In 1994, that is no longer 
true.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In 1942 when this policy was first developed the support 
payers, at that time mostly men, invariably earned more than 
their wives so that the tax brackets of the two parents were 
different. The husband would save more by his deduction than 
the wife would pay in tax and that net savings would 
conceivably be passed on to the child. In some cases of course 
this has happened, though to so few that it makes little 
difference. Three facts make support of this motion essential.
<P>
	To begin with the reality of separation and divorce is rarely so 
easy, and I am sure we all know of cases where children have 
become pawns in parental disputes. Children who generally 
never have a say in such matters are left without a voice in their 
own future.
<P>
	Change of the income tax code will not eliminate this problem 
but it will be a significant measure to combat it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is also true, that after a divorce, the husband's standard of 
living goes up while that of the wife and children goes down. 
Justice in this case is impossible under the prevailing 
legislation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Second, since the reform of the tax code several years ago the 
number of tax brackets has been reduced to three. The likelihood 
of tax differential has dropped merely as a result of that factor 
alone.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Today, the likelihood that both parents are in the same tax 
bracket is far greater. It means giving a break to the 
non-custodial spouse and obliging the spouse who does to pay 
income tax. The system does not make sense, and when all is 
said and done, the money saved rarely goes to those who need it 
most, in other words, to the children.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Third, when one also considers that more and more women are 
part of the labour force than when this law was introduced, it 
becomes even clearer that the system has become a system of 
subtle discrimination against women. In other words, as women 
have entered the labour force their relative responsibilities 
regarding the family have stayed the same as witnessed by the 
fact that still very few men gain custody of children.
<P>
	With the duel responsibilities of family and work single 
parent women suffer all the more because their child support is 
taxed back once again. This was never an intention of the 
original law.
<P>
	Let us look at a typical situation of child support payments. 
Across Canada we have the problem of many so-called deadbeat 
dads who do not pay child support in full. If for example 
supporting a child would cost $10,000 per year, that income 
would naturally be taxed back. Often settlements will include 
that extra amount. Therefore the net amount would stay the 
same.
<P>
	Unfortunately if the support is in partial default the parent 
with custody, and again I repeat almost always the mother, must 
pay tax on an amount already insufficient to support her child, 
whereas the defaulter would still get a tax credit on what he did 
pay.
<P>
	If the defaulter paid half the amount, which is $5,000 in this 
case, the mother and the child would suffer from not having 
enough money and the obligation by law to pay for it while the 
man would receive a tax credit on the part he did pay with no 
penalty.
<P>
	A law that allows this sort of shocking absurdity must be 
changed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We often hear stories about how hard it is for single parent 
families to get support payments. They are often poor, and the 
government penalizes them even more.
<P>
	I hope members of all parties will realize that this motion is 
not just a matter of amending the income tax, but of letting 
justice prevail, so that these people will have a better life than 
they do now.
<P>
	I also want to say that the changes proposed by the hon. 
member for Nepean are entirely sensible and economically 
viable. Our social programs support many women who then 
have to spend money they do not have to pay taxes. Often poor 
women cannot work because it would be too expensive. Being 
on welfare undermines a person's hope and dignity.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	The purpose of social programs is not to help divorced 
spouses. The current system is unnecessarily costly.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have to remember some important facts about the broader 
issue of single parent families. Large portions of poor children 
come from mother supported single parent families. Single 
parent families most often live either just on the edge of or 
below the poverty line.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3553"> 3553 </A></B>
<P>
	I think we should all recognize that to fail to change this law 
would result in some people-I remind all members that these 
are living, breathing children not just numbers out in space 
somewhere-not succeeding where a relatively minor measure, 
from our point of view, might help them to succeed in their 
endeavours.
<P>
	However, if you look at the law it seems that we actually try to 
hurt our youth. Youth issues have always been important to me 
and I am sure to all my colleagues and I must oppose any 
measure which we know makes life even more difficult for the 
youth of Canada.
<P>
	As my colleague pointed out when she introduced this motion, 
Canada seems to be unique among first world nations in that it 
taxes child support. The United Kingdom, the United States and 
Australia were all among the nations she cited then as being 
more progressive than Canada.
<P>
	It is at this point that I wish to criticize the member for 
Calgary Centre who asserted in the House on March 22 that 
because child support would then become income exempted the 
government would receive less money and therefore damage the 
economic wellbeing of the country.
<P>
	Once again the Reform Party is failing to take into account the 
long term. Not helping our children now might lead to greater 
family insecurity, welfare dependency and even crime, subjects 
I know all members are currently concerned about.
<P>
	I must disagree with his analysis of the validity of this motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Can we truly say that the system is fair? No. Many experts 
agree that the legislation should be changed as soon as possible. 
This is not just a debate between men and women. Children are 
the ones who are affected most by separation or divorce, and in 
all cases, it is the children who suffer.
<P>
	Can we tolerate the status quo, when measures taken by the 
government today discriminate against youth? We cannot, Mr. 
Speaker. Young people are our resource for the future. Our 
government has many programs that are very important, and I 
am glad to support them. However, what we give with one hand, 
we take back with the other. We will never achieve prosperity if 
we maintain measures that discriminate against young people 
who have not had all the opportunities to which they are entitled 
in a country as rich and strong as Canada.
<P>
	Once again, I want to commend the hon. member for Nepean 
for presenting this votable motion. I hope that all members of 
this House will take note of this motion and support it without 
hesitation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
particularly pleased to rise and to speak to this motion this 
evening. It addresses an issue of importance to our nation and it 
is of importance to families, whether  together or apart, and that 
is taking responsible action to ensure that our children are well 
provided for.
<P>
	Having said that, I believe that the Income Tax Act should be 
revenue neutral when considering taxable income for families 
that remain intact and for those that separate. Presently it is not 
revenue neutral.
<P>
	I want to make it crystal clear from the outset that I support 
this motion in principle. However, it does not go far enough. It is 
because of the manner by which it does not fulfil the principle 
that ultimately I cannot support it.
<P>
	I will explain how the motion goes right and how it goes awry. 
In keeping with the practice established by my Reform 
colleagues in this House, I will propose constructive 
suggestions for making this motion more acceptable.
<P>
	I commend my hon. colleague, the member for Nepean, for 
having identified a piece of legislation that is in absolute and 
desperate need of reform. She pointed out that the legislation 
was enacted during a time when women seldom worked outside 
of the home. The year was 1942 and for those post war times the 
legislation was developed in good faith.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	However, the relevant section of the Income Tax Act has 
become severely outdated. It no longer properly reflects the 
contemporary reality of divorce. In particular, it fails to address 
the reality of the millions of Canadian women who work outside 
the home. Let me share a little of today's reality for those 
women whose spouses have left and who are raising children on 
their own.
<P>
	Statistics Canada has indicated that a large and growing 
number of single parents, particularly women, suffer a decline 
in their standard of living in income relative to the parent who 
no longer lives with his or her children. We have heard that 
argument numerous times in this debate.
<P>
	The Income Tax act provides for deductibility of child support 
payments by the payer and their inclusion into income by the 
recipient. If the payer had remained in the family unit, his or her 
ability to deduct child raising expenses would in most cases be 
reduced.
<P>
	For example in 1993, the main income earner in a typical 
husband, wife and one child family would have received a child 
tax credit of $1,002 for a dependent child. That is if they lived in 
Alberta and the child was between seven and eleven years of 
age. If the family income was above a threshold level, then no 
child tax credit would be paid and the cost of raising the child 
would provide few, if any, tax deductions. If the parents 
separated in 1993 and the highest income earner supported the 
child only through fully tax deductible payments, $500 a month 
for example, he or she would obtain this significant tax 
deduction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3554"> 3554 </A></B>
<P>
	It is estimated that by allowing the deduction for the 
non-custodial parent and taxing the payment received by the 
custodial parent, generally the one with the lower income, it cost 
the government $235 million in tax revenue in 1992. With 
tougher laws enforcing more parents to pay child support it is 
expected this amount will grow. One can call that a moral 
hazard, if you will.
<P>
	I agree with my colleague across the House that the Income 
Tax Act seems to treat the parent who leaves a relationship and 
who has fewer responsibilities for raising the children better 
than the parent, usually a woman, who remains with the 
children. Let me give an example of how this is the case. This 
example does not just come out of thin air. It reflects a number 
of real Canadian situations and actually comes out of my riding 
of Calgary Southeast.
<P>
	This is the case of a married man and woman. He made 
$85,000 a year and she was a homemaker who received no 
income. This couple divorced and the woman received custody 
of the children. He continues to earn $85,000 a year and she now 
has a job that pays $17,000 a year. As part of the settlement he 
agreed to pay his former spouse $6,000 a year in support 
payments for his children.
<P>
	What we need to look at is the $6,000 given as maintenance 
support. Under the present tax system, the recipient of the 
$6,000 pays income tax on this amount and the payer, the former 
husband in my example, receives a $6,000 tax credit. This 
system provides tax incentives for spouses who leave marriages 
and who do not raise the children.
<P>
	A person who divorces, thanks to the existing legislation, 
receives a windfall for leaving the marriage. Certainly it is not 
the intent of the legislation to financially benefit a person for 
leaving family responsibilities behind.
<P>
	The Income Tax Act as it now exists for reasons I have just 
mentioned contributes to a perception that there is little 
legislative support for families torn apart by divorce. This 
situation is intolerable. Ultimately it hurts the children.
<P>
	The present system as I see it is flawed for two reasons. The 
first is allowing the ex-husband to claim a tax credit for his 
maintenance payments and the second is taxing the ex-wife for 
the amount she receives. Both of these problems show a failure 
of the government to encourage or recognize the importance of 
stabilizing the family unit and responding to the ongoing 
responsibilities of caring for the children involved.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	The motion my colleague has proposed recognizes this 
inequity to be sure and attempts to redress it. However, I am 
concerned that her motion fails to be equitable. The pendulum 
may have been too far on the side of inequity, but the answer is 
not to swing it all the way in the other direction.
<P>
	What is needed is some real compromise that will ensure 
ultimately an effective standard of financial support for the 
children who are affected and that will treat all affected parties 
fairly.
<P>
	The motion allows the recipient, regardless of his or her 
income, to not have to claim the maintenance he or she receives. 
It is the lack of recognition of the income component received 
that is inequitable.
<P>
	There should be a means test applied to the recipient in order 
to determine when and if he or she should pay any tax on the 
maintenance payment. This could be done quite simply. I 
suggest a recipient should pay no tax on maintenance payments 
up to $1,000 a month. Any maintenance payments over $1,000 a 
month should be included as taxable income by the recipient 
parent.
<P>
	The changes I would like to see to this motion would in effect 
see no tax being paid on the amount that is paid in child support 
up to an acceptable limit by either the custodial parent or by the 
spouse providing the support. My suggestion is that the child 
support payment not be taxed as part of the income of the 
custodial parent unless that amount exceeds $1,000 a month. For 
example, if it was $1,200 a month, the $200 per month would be 
added to the income of the recipient and that portion would be 
taxed.
<P>
	This may not result in loss of government revenue over all, 
but it is really too early to tell what the net effect may be. It is 
unclear at this point if there would indeed be a net tax loss 
through such an approach. In fact, in the long term it may ensure 
greater financial support for the children.
<P>
	I spent quite a bit of time over the break developing this 
particular thesis. Perhaps it is not quite the same approach my 
colleagues on this side of the House have taken to this point. 
However I felt it was also very important to express my views on 
behalf of those constituents who have approached me for a very 
long time on this matter.
<P>
	In conclusion given that the motion refers to changes in the 
Income Tax Act, I must mention the following. My colleague 
wishes to make the Income Tax Act more fair for all parties. A 
good place to begin is with a flat tax system. It could be the case 
that if such a flat tax were implemented then we would not have 
to be looking at yet more complicated changes to an already 
complicated tax system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of Motion No. 14, 
introduced by my colleague, the hon. member for Nepean.
<P>
	The motion urges the government to amend the Income Tax 
Act so that child support payments are no longer considered 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3555"> 3555 </A></B>
<P>
taxable income for the recipients. This debate presents an 
opportunity for Parliament to correct a contentious longstanding 
problem with the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	The provisions in the tax legislation which provide for tax 
deductible child support payments were brought into force in 
1942. Canadian society has progressed a great deal since the 
1940s, but unfortunately where the issue of child support is 
concerned the tax laws have lagged behind the new realities of 
today's society.
<P>
	In Canada today there are nearly one million single parent 
families, or 20 per cent of all families with children. Eighty per 
cent of these one parent families are headed by women. Over 
half of these households live in poverty. Although they represent 
a small number of Canadian households, only 3 per cent, these 
single parent families headed by women bear 17 per cent of this 
country's total poverty burden.
<P>
<B>(1840 ) </B>
<P>
	The issue we are debating today involves more than changing 
legislation. The fundamental issue in this debate is justice for 
single parents, especially single mothers.
<P>
	During this debate we must examine the intent of the current 
legislation and the effect it has on today's families. Because 98 
per cent of child support recipients are women, it is fair to say 
that the present child support provisions in the Income Tax Act 
have a detrimental effect upon women and children of single 
parent families.
<P>
	The tax treatment of child support payments actually 
decreases the ability of single parent women to support their 
children after separation and divorce. It creates even greater 
disparities between custodial and non-custodial households. 
The income of support payers is roughly double that of 
recipients and their dependants.
<P>
	It is a fact that after divorce women and their children tend to 
suffer a decline in their standard of living while the man's tends 
to rise. With 57 per cent of single parent families headed by 
women living below the poverty line, the Income Tax Act must 
be changed to reflect the realities faced by single parent families 
in the 1990s. By changing the legislation the government would 
be helping to foster a healthy environment for children of single 
parent families.
<P>
	The finance department views the tax deduction provided to 
child support payers as an incentive to make support payments. 
However, the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of 
Women has stated that studies show child support payment 
default rates as high as 85 per cent.
<P>
	Furthermore the finance department feels that the current 
deduction also encourages higher support payments. Since 
taxable income is shifted from the payer who is presumed to be 
in a relatively high tax bracket, to the recipient who is presumed 
to be in a lower tax bracket, there results an overall tax saving 
which will lead to greater resources and therefore increased 
support payments. In reality this is rarely the case.
<P>
	When the original legislation was written 52 years ago the 
assumption was that the custodial parent, the mother, had less 
income than the payer, the father. Today this assumption is no 
longer always valid. Even though women comprise a large part 
of today's workforce wage disparity still exists, yet this is not 
reflected in the current taxation structure.
<P>
	The only way a single parent mother can benefit from the 
current legislation is if she happens to be in a low income tax 
bracket. Fortunately, Canadians have been working toward more 
equal treatment of women in the workforce and equal pay for 
equal work. The current tax situation impedes this progress for 
single parent working mothers by chipping away at their income 
and thus increasing their burden.
<P>
	Studies by the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of 
Women have shown that in 49 per cent of situations the child 
support payer's tax saving did not exceed the recipient's tax 
obligation which resulted in no overall tax benefit. In 20 per cent 
of these cases the child support provisions in the Income Tax Act 
actually decreased the resources available for child support.
<P>
	The Income Tax Act needs to be amended so that it reflects 
current realities and provides support where the support is 
needed most, with the custodial parent. In one parent families, 
the non-custodial parent is given a tax incentive even though the 
parental responsibilities remain.
<P>
	When a divorce occurs neither parent's responsibility toward 
their children changes. Child support payments should therefore 
not be considered taxable income of the custodial parent, but 
merely a continuation of the responsibility of the non-custodial 
parent for the care and maintenance of the children involved.
<P>
	I have touched upon some of the points surrounding this issue 
but I would like to come back to my central theme which is 
justice. Most one parent families are headed by women. The 
majority of these households live below the poverty line and 
bear a disproportionate amount of this country's total poverty 
burden. The current Income Tax Act only contributes to this 
unfortunate problem.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	Clearly this is not justice. We have an opportunity to take a 
step toward fairness for women and for single parent families. It 
is my sincere wish that this motion be adopted by the House and 
embraced by the government in the form of amendments to the 
Income Tax Act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West):</B> Mr. Speaker, what we are 
discussing today is a 1942 tax law which defines the regulations 
for child support payments following a divorce settlement. I am 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3556"> 3556 </A></B>
<P>
pleased to join the debate because I believe that a wise society 
should strive to give its children the best possible start in life.
<P>
	Canadians were appalled when in 1993 the United Nations 
committee on social, economic and cultural rights blasted 
Canada for the fact that half of all single mothers and their 
children live below the poverty line. In conclusion the report 
stated that Canada has not outlined any new or planned measures 
to remedy the situation.
<P>
	The question we are debating today is whether the tax laws 
should be altered in the interest of fairness where child support 
payments are concerned. As our system stands presently, payers 
of child support are given a tax break, whereas recipients of 
child support, the mothers who have the custody of the children, 
are required to treat those payments as taxable income.
<P>
	I ask the public, my colleagues and the bureaucrats who 
defend this 1942 regulation to clarify in their own minds 
whether it is the principles of the income tax system or whether 
it is the rights of children that must be defended?
<P>
	Fifty-two years ago when the policy was developed there 
were 10 tax brackets for Canadian citizens. The parent paying 
support was usually in a higher tax bracket than the recipient 
parent. As a result it was determined that providing the donor 
with a tax break while taxing the recipient in a lower tax bracket 
would reduce the total amount of taxes paid on this sum.
<P>
	At the same time these bureaucrats reasoned that allowing the 
non-custodial parent to deduct payments from their taxable 
income would provide an incentive to maintain regular 
payments. While this is convincing in theory, it fails miserably 
in practice.
<P>
	The speakers today have waxed eloquent on the outdated basis 
of the child support taxation policy. In 1942 it was likely that by 
giving the non-custodial parent at tax break and taxing the 
custodial parent more money would end up benefiting the 
children. Today it is much more likely that both parents fall into 
the same tax bracket.
<P>
	We must decide, given the 1990s setting, which parent will 
benefit from this subsidy. I believe that the mother who is in 98 
per cent of instances the recipient of child support should not 
have to pay taxes on her child support payments.
<P>
	Although it is true that women still on average earn less than 
men, they are much more likely than before to be in the same tax 
bracket as their former spouse. As pay equity legislation takes 
root we hope women will reach parity with men's wages in this 
country. Therefore a child support system which assumes that 
women make less than men is anachronistic and must be revised.
<P>
	The revisions we seek are those that will divert moneys from 
the tax system to the children. In Nova Scotia one in five 
children lives below the poverty line. These proposed changes 
would be one small step to help those children.
<P>
	One alternative that has been proposed and that is currently 
before the courts offers that income be considered the child's 
income and be taxed accordingly. Another option is for the 
parents of the children to negotiate among themselves the tax 
break they generally receive to ensure this is channelled toward 
the children's expenses.
<P>
	Discussion of the intricacies of the tax system or tax reform 
should not sway us from the larger issues at play here. A report 
by Ellen Zweibel and Richard Shillington for the Policy 
Research Centre on Children, Youth and Families stated that the 
basic pre-tax child support amount being awarded is stunningly 
low.
<P>
	Our government will prove its commitment to youth by 
following through with the promises in the red book.
<P>
<B>(1850 ) </B>
<P>
	Apprenticeship programs will ease the transition from school 
to work. We are establishing a youth services corps and we are 
restoring full funding to the national literacy program. But we 
must start earlier. We must invest all available resources in our 
children during their formative years.
<P>
	A House of Commons resolution in 1989 to abolish child 
poverty by the year 2000 was adopted by the entire Parliament. 
We must recommit ourselves to this challenge and redouble our 
efforts.
<P>
	In 1991 more than 1.2 million Canadian children were living 
in poverty. I was involved for five year in the metro food bank 
society in the Halifax-Dartmouth area and I know that 
sustainable and systematic changes are needed.
<P>
	In 1992 an estimated 900,000 children were fed by one of the 
436 food banks across this country and these numbers are 
growing. As a matter of fact in 1980 there were no food banks in 
Canada and now we have more than 400 food banks. That is 
astounding and appalling.
<P>
	To reverse this frightening trend we must make the required 
changes to the Income Tax Act so that children are not 
financially devastated by their parent's divorce or separation. 
We must ensure that fathers, and in 98 per cent of cases it is the 
father who is the payer, keep up with their child support 
payments.
<P>
	Some insight into the breakdown of the whole system can be 
derived from statistics from the legal world. In Nova Scotia the 
family court system administered maintenance payments for 
about 13,000 families. In 1990-91 that court issued 7,000 
summonses to individuals who had failed to pay court ordered 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3557"> 3557 </A></B>
<P>
support. These are not meaningless numbers. For each summons 
there is a story of hardship.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that the tax break for non-custodial 
parents was meant as an incentive-some incentive. Fifty-two 
years later child support dodgers are rampant in our society. We 
have made some inroads in this area. There is legislation in 
every province to garnishee wages from defaulters. That is not 
enough. A lot of work is needed to standardize child support 
levels and enforcement mechanisms across this country.
<P>
	Loopholes abound in our system of taxation with no clear 
rationale for who benefits and who does not. Commons sense 
tells us and groups that have coalesced around this issue insist 
that women despite gross-up payments should not be paying tax 
on child support payments. Adopting this resolution as the 
shared opinion of this House is a positive step, one that makes 
sense.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to congratulate the hon. Member for Nepean for 
introducing a bill to amend the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	Her amendment deals mainly with regulations dating back to 
1942, that are 52 years ago, at a time when child support 
payments were paid to the mother, who generally had custody of 
the children. It allowed the father to deduct support payments 
from his taxable income.
<P>
	As you know, the Divorce Act is administered by the 
provinces and the amount of child support is determined by 
provincial court judges.
<P>
	We also know that, compared to 1942, the number of divorces 
is very high. This is regrettable, but this is a fact of life in our 
society.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have a report from the federal-provincial-territorial family 
law committee that suggests that if tax implications are to be 
taken into account there are number of issues to be considered. 
There is no guidance in the Divorce Act nor provincial or 
territorial legislation as to how the calculations should be made 
or how the benefit of the deduction should be shared between the 
parties.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	Reference is made to a Divorce Act evaluation from May 
1990 from the Department of Justice that stated: ``It is important 
to consider this issue in the context in which it actually occurs, 
namely that two-thirds of Canadian women and children live in 
poverty following divorce''.
<P>
	I am going to take the liberty to read parts of a letter I received 
from a constituent of mine after getting permission from this 
person to read extracts. Mrs. Jackie Cloutier wrote to me 
regarding the taxation of child support. She is proud to give me 
permission to read these extracts from her letter: ``Taxing child 
support in the hand of the already impoverished parent is wrong. 
Many women like myself lose up to two-thirds of their child  
support to income tax. We do not live in fancy homes or drive 
fancy cars. We do not take lavish vacations. We cannot afford to 
plan for retirement. We struggle every day to make ends meet, 
most often living from pay cheque to pay cheque and regularly 
running out of money at the end of the month. Every year in 
April we are faced with this unnecessary debt to Revenue 
Canada''.
<P>
	She concludes, and I jumped some parts of her letter: ``The 
report released by the United Nations on the status of women 
and children in Canada clearly stated that we are living in 
poverty. Please take the necessary steps to change this law now. 
Don't let another year go by where women and children suffer 
needlessly at the hands of the tax system''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Therefore, I am pleased to support the initiative of my 
colleague from Nepean and to ask the federal government that it 
change the Income Tax Act to exempt child support payments 
from taxation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ETHANOL">ETHANOL</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jim Jordan (Leeds-Grenville):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to participate in the adjournment proceedings tonight 
in accordance with Standing Order 37(3) on the subject of 
ethanol.
<P>
	The ethanol gasoline mixture to replace regular gasoline has 
been highly successful in western Canada and for many years 
highly successful in the United States. The proposed ratio of mix 
here in Canada is 90 per cent gasoline and 10 per cent ethanol, 
that is a 90 per cent non-renewable source of energy and a 10 per 
cent renewable source of energy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3558"> 3558 </A></B>
<P>
	This fuel mix has been available in western Ontario and is 
now becoming available in eastern Ontario. There is talk of a 
plant, and hopefully it will materialize, in my own riding of 
Leeds-Grenville. The manufacture of ethanol started with a 
group of farmers, about 135 farmers, who got together and each 
threw in $2,500. I think it shows commitment.
<P>
	We can talk about the advantages of using ethanol mixed with 
gas and we can do it from various viewpoints, but a former 
colleague of mine, the hon. Ralph Ferguson, was a pioneer of 
blended fuel in this House in the last Parliament. I became 
interested in blended fuel from listening to the hon. Ralph 
Ferguson, the former Minister of Agriculture, because he spoke 
on it many times. I think maybe we could name it Fergie's fuel 
because whenever you got talking to Fergie he would want to 
promote the idea of ethanol. He really believed in it as a source 
of energy for Canadians.
<P>
	Because of the time restraints I have to summarize a bit. The 
biggest winner in the blended fuel business is the environment. 
There is no question about that. The exhaust from a car using 
blended mix will contain 30 per cent less carbon monoxide and 6 
to 10 per cent less carbon dioxide. The manufacture of ethanol 
from grains, primarily corn but it can be other grains, makes a 
great market for corn farmers and for farmers in general.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	One gets about 10 litres of ethanol from a bushel of corn. The 
byproduct, once the starch is removed from the corn to make the 
ethanol, is an excellent source of feed for beef and dairy cattle. 
The ethanol is manufactured from a renewable resource, so there 
is a real plus for everybody. That is not the case with fossil fuels.
<P>
	What prompted my original question to the Minister of 
Finance is the cost of production. That is the problem. If we 
applied the federal excise tax to ethanol and put the provincial 
excise tax on ethanol, the product would be just out of the 
question. It would be too costly. People would not buy because 
of the price. Nobody would choose it as an alternative fuel.
<P>
	We would miss the manufacturing of it, the sale of it and 
everything that is associated with it but most important, we 
would miss the environmental advantages of this friendly 
product. The assurance I got from the Minister of Finance was 
okay as far as it went, that the government would not impose an 
excise tax on ethanol.
<P>
	Governments come and governments go and these people are 
looking for a little more assurance than that. What the ethanol 
industry wanted was assurance similar to the one that Ontario 
gave the industry not too long ago. The Government of Ontario 
announced that if a future provincial government wanted to 
reimpose the provincial excise tax on ethanol, the 
manufacturers would be compensated. The ethanol industry is 
asking for that kind of assurance from the federal government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to participate 
in this discussion of an issue important to many members of the 
House.
<P>
	Hon. members are no doubt aware that the 8.5-cent per litre 
excise tax exemption for the ethanol portion of gasoline fuels 
was introduced in the 1992 budget to provide ``a level playing 
field in the taxation of alternative fuels''. Prior to 1992, federal 
excise taxes on motor vehicle fuels did not apply to propane, 
natural gas or pure methanol or ethanol used as motor vehicle 
fuels. However the excise tax was imposed on all gasoline fuels, 
including ethanol and methanol blends.
<P>
	The exemption from the excise tax for the ethanol and 
methanol portion of blended fuels was introduced to ensure that 
all alternative fuels were subject to the same federal excise tax 
treatment during a period of technological and marketing 
development of these fuels.
<P>
	I should note that the excise tax exemption is limited to 
gasoline blended fuels that use ethanol and methanol made from 
renewable feed stocks such as corn, grain and wood. Ethanol 
fuels derived from biomass offer a number of environmental 
benefits that generate, for instance, lower levels of carbon 
monoxide than in the case of gasoline.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The excise tax exemption for gasoline-ethanol blends 
continues to be entirely consistent with the government's 
current policies on the tax treatment of alternative fuels. 
Therefore, I would like to assure members that the ethanol and 
methanol that are produced from biomass and used in 
gasoline-type fuels will remain exempt from the 8.5 cent per 
litre excise tax during the course of this government's current 
mandate.
<P>
	By encouraging the blending and marketing of 
ethanol-gasoline blends, this commitment should be of 
significant assistance to Canadian ethanol producers. It should 
also benefit the agricultural sector by providing additional 
domestic markets for grain and corn, as well as the potential for 
new markets for wood and agricultural waste products.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="YOUTHACTIONPLAN">YOUTH ACTION PLAN</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, on April 14 last, I 
put a question to the Minister of Human Resources Development 
concerning his youth action plan.
<P>
	Instead of answering my question about the jurisdictional 
conflicts arising from his action plan, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development merely criticized the fact that I was 
denouncing his action plan. This is rather odd, since I thought it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3559"> 3559 </A></B>
<P>
was the duty of an opposition member to criticize the 
government's actions and that this was not the least bit unusual. 
This is what I was told. Yet, there was the minister criticizing 
me.
<P>
	I felt an even greater duty to criticize the plan since it 
represented another intrusion into an area of provincial 
jurisdiction, namely education. Let me show you what I mean.
<P>
	First, let me read the title of the action plan. I have no problem 
with the first part of the title, ``Youth Employment''. This is, 
admittedly, an area of shared jurisdiction.
<P>
	The second part of the title reads as follows: ``And Learning 
Strategy''. Can this title make it any clearer that education is 
involved? May I remind hon. members that education is an area 
of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. Yet, there was the Minister 
of Human Resources Development announcing on April 15 last 
a strategy which is one more example of federal intrusion in the 
field of education.
<P>
	Let us begin by examining the first measure, Youth Service 
Canada. The first stream identified as a priority area for projects 
is community development and learning, to quote the action 
plan, ``in the area of education''. No effort whatsoever is made 
to hide the fact.
<P>
	A second Youth Service Canada component which pertains to 
education is the education voucher. Following a period of 
service lasting nine months, participants receive a bonus of 
$2,000 in the form of an education voucher.
<P>
	The second measure is the Youth Internship Program. This is a 
new title designed to avoid any reference to apprenticeship 
programs. We now speak of youth interns. What does the action 
plan have to say about youth interns? In the second paragraph, it 
says that ``the federal government is acting to implement new 
entry level training models''. Further on, on page 6, third 
paragraph: ``The standardization of existing training plans will 
ensure that programs are based on common standards and thus 
have applicability across Canada.''
<P>
	I will skim over the Summer Employment Program which 
poses no problems as far as jurisdiction goes, as well as the 
increases in student loans, although I would like to mention here 
that among students, notably those in Quebec, 16 per cent are 
unable to repay their student loans and are forced to seek 
protection under the bankruptcy legislation. And what is the 
minister doing? Well, he is increasing the level of indebtedness 
of students.
<P>
	On page 11 under Learning Initiatives, mention is made of 
setting national training goals, of updating existing training 
measurement tools, of putting multimedia resources and 
computers in place in schools, of facilitating the dissemination 
of information on key learning issues and, finally, of 
maintaining the stay in school program. All of these are 
education-related initiatives.
<P>
	Following the unveiling of this program, three provinces 
decided not to attend the federal-provincial meeting scheduled 
for the following Monday. That very same day, the Liberal Party 
and the Parti Quebecois joined forces in the Quebec National 
Assembly to unanimously pass a motion calling upon the federal 
government not only to refrain from any further intrusion in, but 
also to withdraw from the field of manpower training.
<P>
	Finally, last Friday, the <I>Conseil permanent de la jeunesse</I>, a 
paragovernmental agency in Quebec, held a press conference to 
denounce as well federal intrusion in the area of manpower 
training. I would have liked to put my question to the minister, 
but I see that his parliamentary secretary is not present. I hope 
that someone is on hand to speak on his behalf. Normally, we 
should get an answer to our question.
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	When will the federal government withdraw from this field-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General):</B> Mr. Speaker, the federal government, like the 
Government of Quebec, is committed to investing in Canada's 
youth, especially by providing our young people with the 
knowledge and skills needed for the jobs of tomorrow.
<P>
	In so doing, the federal government does not intend to 
question provincial jurisdiction over education. It is the 
government's intention to help young people in this country 
through programs that complement, and I do mean complement, 
those that the provinces offer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In fact there have been ongoing discussions with all the 
provinces on all four components of the youth employment and 
learning strategy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The federal government's role is more that of a presenter. The 
provinces will take part in implementing pilot training projects 
for young people. These projects will be based on current 
provincial programs and will respect provincial priorities.
<P>
	We will also encourage the provinces to establish, adjust or 
propose mechanisms in addition to the three which already exist 
in the youth training program, namely sectoral initiatives, 
work-study co-op program and project-oriented training.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	With regard to internship in Quebec, we have received very 
positive feedback from the province and the provincial 
education ministers on youth internship programs.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3560"> 3560 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our government wishes to harmonize its training initiatives 
for young people with those of Quebec and other provinces. We 
will pursue productive and effective discussions with the 
provinces to find the best ways to help all young people 
wherever they live in Canada.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="VIARAIL">VIA RAIL</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on March 24, 1994, I questioned the Minister of 
Transport on the rationalization of VIA Rail operations. The 
minister gave me the following answer:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If there is no dramatic improvement in VIA Rail's ability to provide service 
within the budgets allocated by the federal government, then some major changes 
will certainly be made.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I urge the minister to consider the November 1989 report of 
the federal Liberal task force on VIA Rail, whose members 
included over 15 Liberal members now sitting in this House and 
which made recommendations on what VIA Rail should do and 
on what could be done to make it profitable and efficient. One of 
the conclusions was this: ``We must however show foresight by 
immediately introducing a program of expenditures-they were 
not talking about cutbacks or rationalization-of investments 
aimed at upgrading the whole VIA Rail network''.
<P>
	This report signed by more than 20 federal Liberal members 
shows how they felt about all this. The Minister of Transport 
would be well advised to consider it and perhaps to make it his 
policy to ensure that VIA Rail becomes profitable and efficient 
in the future, so that we in Eastern Quebec can stop working 
desperately to keep our rail service, as we have been doing for at 
least 10 years.
<P>
	I urge the federal government to assume its responsibilities in 
this area before dealing with education and other issues. It is 
always advisable to look at the consequences of our actions to 
see if we did the right thing. I am thinking in particular of the 
hon. member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine who has 
a major responsibility in this area because rail service in his 
region is cast in doubt year after year. The whole line that goes 
as far as the Maritimes is also called into question year after 
year.
<P>
	One would think that, when federal parties go from being in 
opposition to forming the government, their vocabulary 
suddenly changes and they start defending regional 
underdevelopment, when we could turn rail line development 
into an important tool to provide our regions with the basic 
transport infrastructure needed for the development of small and 
medium-sized businesses in our communities, thus contributing 
to local growth, instead of always being on the defensive and 
only seeing the little cuts that can be made here and there.
<P>
	What I found rather surprising is that when the Liberal Party 
of Canada was in opposition, their recommendations were, for 
example, to improve the equipment and infrastructure; to 
upgrade and introduce high-speed trains-they settled for low 
speed instead; to revive track-guided buses; to make fares and 
schedules more flexible; to involve the public.
<P>
	In this sense, we think it is important to impose a moratorium 
on the elimination of rail service in Eastern Canada, as was done 
in Western Canada. Especially since we know that, in a 1989 
report written in the last Parliament when it was in opposition, 
the government advocated involving the public in the future of 
VIA Rail. I would ask the current government why it does not 
honour the commitments it made when it was in opposition. We 
are not talking about independent members but about an official 
report of the national Liberal caucus, several members of which 
are now ministers who should make appropriate representations 
to the Cabinet.
<P>
	I hope the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine will convince his 
government to stand firm and honour the commitments it made 
in the report of the national Liberal caucus.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to reply to the 
comments made by the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup. It is always important to put 
one's comments in perspective. The Minister of Transport did 
not hide the fact that the government has no other money to give 
to VIA Rail.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The future of VIA Rail will depend on the availability of 
financial resources both from the government and from 
passenger revenues and will be affected in large part by the 
outcome of the current labour negotiations that are under 
consideration now. After these negotiations VIA will present its 
plans to the government at the appropriate time and we will deal 
with them then.
<P>
	The government supports VIA's current efforts to maximize 
efficiencies of its operations before a decision is taken on the 
long term future of the corporation. For my friend's 
information, VIA has made fantastic gains in the past three 
years in terms of efficiencies in its operations, in terms of 
manpower, in terms of locomotives, in terms of equipment. 
They have made great gains but more can be done.
<P>
	Clearly there can be no immediate service changes. VIA must 
present a proposal to the government. I repeat there can be no 
cuts without the government's approval.
<P>
	It is very important that the Canadian people and goods be 
moved efficiently throughout the country. Canadians want to see 
a workable, affordable transportation system. It would be 
premature to speculate on service changes, aside from the fact 
that VIA will operate a network which Canadians can afford.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3561"> 3561 </A></B>
<P>
	In addition, the member spoke about the Liberal task force. I 
was one of the co-authors of that task force, as many of my 
colleagues know. We will take some of those task force 
recommendations into account as the minister and the 
government take a look at the options available. We will also 
look at ways of modernizing the VIA network. We will look at 
those recommendations, as I said.
<P>
	More important, the member should understand that. He 
talked about whether the government should intrude in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction. This is one place where in fact the 
federal government would work with the provinces, as it has in 
Ontario. We would welcome co-operation with the Quebec 
government, municipalities, the private sector, community 
groups, all to come and play and be part of the solution so that 
we can maintain a viable national VIA network across the 
country.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 7.18 p.m., this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.18 p.m.)
