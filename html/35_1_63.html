	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate today a gentleman from the riding of Oxford for 
doing his part to protect mother earth.
<P>
	Mr. Stu Shouldice from Woodstock was recently inducted into 
the Recycling Council of Ontario's Waste Reduction Hall of 
Fame. Mr. Shouldice and his family regularly recycle 95 per 
cent of their household waste.
<P>
	Mr. Shouldice was reported to have said that increased 
recycling by all levels of government depends on the will of the 
people and how badly we want a pollution free world for our 
children.
<P>
	I congratulate this gentleman on behalf of this House and on 
behalf of all those who can learn from the example he has set.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay):</B> Mr. Speaker, on April 6 
last, Citizenship and Immigration Canada served the Garda 
family with a departure notice taking effect in a few days.
<P>
	Today, I learned from the office of the Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration that the minister will not intervene in favour of

must spare the Garda family the humiliating torments suffered 
by the Maraloï family. He must defer the notification of 
deportation as long as it has not been proven that the Garda 
family does not have to fear for its life, should it return to its

not be spent on golfing trips by government officials on government jets.</BLOCKQUOTE>

as we head toward Victoria Day weekend and the beginning of

House public concern over Bill C-46, the Contraventions Act.
<P>
	The Contraventions Act received royal assent October 15, 
1992 but to the disappointment of many Canadians it has not yet 
been proclaimed.
<P>
	The act sets out a ticketing procedure for dealing with minor 
federal offences. The act will allow enforcement officers to 
properly police Canada's inland waterways and ensure that 
residents and tourists can enjoy summer water activities in a 
safe and secure manner.
<P>
	The reason given for this delay has been the need to 
co-ordinate the bill's implementation among the provinces. I 
have been told that this process which has already taken 18 
months will take at least another 12. This delay of two and a half 
years means that more of my constituents will be at risk on the 
waterways. It is unacceptable and I urge the Minister of Justice 
to expedite the process.

UN is to consider a draft resolution proposed by the U.S. to issue 
a 15-day ultimatum to the Haitian military junta and reinforce 
the trade embargo. At the same time, President Clinton took a

killing innocent civilians.

<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who has 
just arrived. Can the minister give an update on the negotiations 
at the UN concerning the ultimatum proposed by the American 
president and can he indicate whether Canada supports this 
proposal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, naturally, we hope that a solution will finally be found 
to the long-lasting impasse in Haiti. We are making every effort 
to support the elected president, Mr. Aristide; we think he 
should return to his country. We think, as the American 
president said, that General Cédras and the chief of police of the 
city of Port-au-Prince must resign. We continue to believe that 
a total embargo is the only effective way to subdue the military.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we know that the Canadian policy is to suggest and try 
to convince the allies to impose a tougher military embargo. So 
far, however, the American president had not clearly stated his 
position, in particular on increasing the pressure he wants to 
exert on Haiti, since he is now hinting at armed intervention.
<P>
	I ask the minister whether the Canadian government endorses 
the idea of armed intervention as proposed by President Clinton 
in case the Haitian military rulers refuse to comply with the 
proposed ultimatum.
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, in response to questions, the U.S. president stated that 
he was not ruling out any option, any alternative. I must say that 
Canada did not contemplate the possibility of armed 
intervention, whether multilateral or unilateral, as we are 
convinced that stiffer economic sanctions would overcome the 
military junta and that it is appropriate to impose effective 
sanctions, which involves the participation and co-operation of 
the Dominican Republic in particular. We think it is still 
possible to make the military rulers resign without having to 
resort to armed intervention.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, according to the dispatch I read, President Clinton 
went further than what the minister said. He did not simply say 
that he was not ruling out any option, he specifically said that he 
was not ruling out the option of armed intervention, which is an 
important distinction when a U.S. president makes statements 
on such vital issues.
<P>
	I therefore ask the Minister of Foreign Affairs whether he can 
tell us today if his government received assurances that the 
proposed reinforcement of trade sanctions will not lead to an 
increase in black-market activities controlled by the military 
junta and the Haitian police.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is no doubt that Canada supports the return of 
President Aristide to Haiti.
<P>
	We believe that a total embargo could bring about the 
withdrawal of the military people who are holding a suffering 
population hostage.
<P>
	If the Americans and a number of other countries through the 
United Nations pass a resolution to bring a total embargo against 
Haiti, it is possible the embargo will not be a very long one. It 
will become very clear to the military people that they cannot 
stay there and they will resign in the following hours.
<P>
	It is time to show unequivocally the military people there that 
they cannot perpetrate the denial of the vast majority of Haitians 
who voted freely for President Aristide.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	As the Prime Minister is aware there is increasing evidence 
that Canada's health care system is in trouble: hospitals being 
closed, long lines waiting for surgery, provinces rationing 
services. At the root of the problems are inadequate 
arrangements for financing health care.
<P>
	Does the government acknowledge that health care financing 
needs to be completely reformed and that Canadians are now 
prepared to accept substantive amendments to the Canada 
Health Act?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the absence of the 
Minister of Health and on behalf of the Government of Canada I 
would like to commit the government to our full support for the 
Canada Health Act. It is a very important instrument in ensuring 
that every Canadian has access to health care, not because of the 
size of their wallets but because of the size of their health 
problems.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
gather that the government and the Deputy Prime Minister will 
not concede that Canadians would rather have major changes in 
health care financing than to suffer further cuts in services.
<P>
	For example, a Compas opinion survey on this subject is 
being released in Toronto today. It reveals that 58 per cent of 
Canadians are prepared to accept health care financing 
mechanisms not permitted by the Canada Health Act, even 
including user fees, in order to save health care.
<P>
	Does the Deputy Prime Minister accept that the Canada 
Health Act should be amended to permit the provinces greater 
flexibility in health care financing?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the member is on 
very dangerous ground when he chooses to pursue policies 
because of polls.
<P>
	I have a copy of another poll done by Insight Canada 
Research. This poll is from last month and states that only 16 per 
cent of Canadians support user fees.
<P>
	I would suggest to the member that he take a look at the red 
book commitments of the Liberal government. We will be 
meeting with our provincial counterparts in June to examine the 
whole issue of how we can better deliver health care, but we do 
not see user fees as a solution to the problems of Canada's health 
care system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we could argue all day about the validity of polls.
<P>
	I suggest to the ministers that if they contrast alternative 
financing mechanisms with the alternative of losing the service, 
a majority of Canadians favour the alternative financing 
mechanism.
<P>
	I ask the Deputy Prime Minister this simple question. If the 
choice is between further cuts in health care service or changing 
the financing provisions of the Canada Health Act, which 
alternative does the government prefer?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a false choice.
<P>
	If we look at one area of health which is of great concern to 
women, it is in the whole area of birthing. Anyone who has gone 
through the process knows that birthing is a natural part of life. 
It is not necessarily a medical problem. Provinces across the

<P>
	Yesterday at the annual meeting of the World Health 
Organization in Geneva, the Minister of Health said that the 
misuse of reproductive technologies like cloning and genetic 
engineering to choose a child's sex must stop.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	Does the Minister of Justice agree with his colleague, the 
Minister of Health, who at that prestigious forum emphasized 
the importance of criminalizing some reproductive technologies 
such as genetic engineering and cloning?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said as recently as last 
week in this House, the Department of Justice is working with 
the ministry of health examining the 300 recommendations that 
came from the royal commission on reproductive technologies 
in February. Very few of them actually deal with the justice 
system to the extent to which they recommend changes, for 
example, in the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Representatives of justice and health are preparing 
recommendations for cabinet arising from the royal commission 
and touching upon all of the issues in relation to reproductive 
technologies.
<P>
	Rather than deal piecemeal with this or that part of the 
proposals, my approach to date has been to await the completion 
of the work of those officials and bring forward to cabinet 
policies that we believe are in the public interest and that act 
upon the recommendations of the commission which spent a 
long time looking at these complex questions.
<P>
	In response to the hon. member, I say that rather than 
identifying policies a bit at a time we are looking at the 
recommendations as a whole. We will be coming forward 
through cabinet with the government policy probably in the fall 
of this year.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
minister realize that the government's slowness in acting to 
regulate and control new reproductive technologies proves that 
this issue is not a priority for the government, despite the 
minister's statement in Geneva, and that its inaction will have a 
major impact on ethics and research?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not believe that 
conclusion follows.
<P>
	First, it is a matter of priority. For example, we have designed 
topics and background materials for the meeting of deputy 
ministers in mid-June. Deputy ministers of health across the 
country will be meeting. We will be consulting them with 
respect to their views and the provincial and territorial 
perspective on some of these issues. We will be preparing 
discussion papers over the summer to elicit the views of the 
research community  on some approaches we can take to the 
recommendations of the royal commission.
<P>
	It is a matter of priority. It is not something we are going to act 
upon next week. We are going to consult. We take the issue very 
seriously. We will come forward with policies probably late in 
1994 to deal with these issues. They are matters of concern and 
of substance, but we are going to deal with them methodically.

	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, let us 
talk about women's health.
<P>
	A recent Halifax <I>Chronicle-Herald</I> article detailed the case 
of Mary, a single mother who was waiting for orthopaedic 
surgery. During this time she has been unable to work because of 
severe pain. In Mary's words: ``They are all talking about 
prevention but the fact that I have not had surgery is an example 
of not using prevention''.
<P>
	If this government is serious about prevention as a means of 
solving our current health care crisis, why does it continue to 
rely on rationing of essential health care with its huge cost in 
human suffering to shackle Canadians to an obsolete Canada 
Health Act?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fact is that the Liberal 
government is strongly committed to the establishment and 
accessibility of health care across the country.
<P>
	If we actually followed the member's advice and torpedoed 
the Canada Health Act, the difficult situation that patients are 
facing now across the country would be exacerbated because 
what we would end up with would be one system where if people 
had money they could get the operation and another system for 
those people with no money. We will not support that system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are not talking about torpedoing any act. We just 
want to make it better so that Canadians will have better health 
care for always. The system is broken. To fix the system we need

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

Canada Health Act is universality. One of the things that is

	When the member talks about rhetoric, he suggests that we 
make the Canada Health Act better. The fact is that the five

involved in the negotiation process?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

how do I know I am dealing with the rank and file? At the 
meeting where this was discussed two weeks ago there were 60 
chiefs all elected by the rank and file. There were 400 people, all 
from Manitoba, all accountable to the rank and file. They almost 
unanimously after getting their direction from the chiefs, from 
the rank and file, want self-government. They have been 
waiting 150 years for it and they are ready to move on it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, it

<P>
	Yesterday, the Quebec Minister of Industry and Commerce 
had a secret meeting with the federal ministers of Industry and 
Transport. According to the daily <I>Le Droit</I>, the review of drug 
patent legislation, the high-speed train issue and the 
construction of the Magdalen Islands ferry were on the agenda.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Transport tell us if, during that meeting, 
he gave a positive reply to the Quebec Minister of Industry 
regarding the awarding to MIL Davie of the contract for the 
construction of the Magdalen Islands ferry and the multipurpose 
smart ship?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
during the meeting with the Quebec Minister of Industry, we 
discussed of course the need to provide an adequate ship for the 
transport of people, goods, trucks and cars from Prince Edward 
Island to the Magdalen Islands. We informed the Quebec 
Minister of Industry that the government of Canada intends to 
ensure the safety of people making that trip, and we hope to soon 
be able to make a decision, in co-operation with the Quebec 
government, as to how we can best help these people who 
urgently need adequate and safe services.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
answer is exactly the one I was given last January 18.
<P>
	Now that the Minister of Transport is in possession of MIL 
Davie's business plan, as the Minister of Industry said Monday 
in this House, will he recognize that the two contracts for the 
``smart ship'' and the ferry are essential to MIL Davie's 
survival, and when can we hope to get an answer regarding these 
two issues?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
first, the hon. member will certainly realize that the Department 
of Transport is not responsible for the smart ship issue. 
However, those who are familiar with MIL Davie's history 
understand how important that industry is for workers.
<P>
	As regards the ferry between Prince Edward Island and the 
Magdalen Islands, the priority for the Department of Transport 
and the government of Canada is to ensure the safety of 
Magdalen Islanders and others who use the ferry.
<P>
	Obviously, the decision as to whether MIL Davie's recovery 
plan will work must be made by the Quebec government and the 
company itself, which is trying its best to solve its problems. 
There is no doubt that discussions will continue. I want to assure 
the hon. member that the issue of safety for people who 
currently travel on a ship which is causing enormous problems, 
the <I>Lucy Maud Montgomery</I>, must be settled and this is 
something we want to do as quickly as possible. The link with 
the future of MIL Davie makes things more complicated, but we 
try to be as understanding as possible.

the cases the hon. member has been referring to took place, if I

<P>
	Last week, in response to a question on the future viability of 
the Canada Pension Plan, the minister stated: ``It is certainly 
actuarially sound and has sufficient contingency funds within 
it''. Yet according to a recent OECD study on public pension 
plans we in Canada would have to dramatically increase 
contributions or increase the pensionable age by 16 years to age 
81 to make our plan actuarially sound.
<P>
	Could the minister explain the huge discrepancy between his 
statement and the OECD report?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

week we were talking about a report that pertained to the 
immediate situation of the fund which is actuarially sound. It is 
in full reserve and there is no contemplated need for major 
changes.
<P>
	The OECD study he refers to is one that projects a substantial 
change in the population of Canada over the next 20 years when 
there will be a much larger proportion of people at retirement 
age. It is for that reason the Minister of Finance announced in his 
budget that we would be establishing a major white paper, green

their future pensions will be safe.

that in the budget of last February the Minister of Finance 
clearly stated that we saw a need to look at the whole question of 
security in retirement programs for Canadians because of 
changes taking place in population and other factors.

my department are presently preparing the kinds of facts and

	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for the 
Minister of Justice who has been musing about banning private 
ownership of handguns.
<P>
	The 1,054,000 registered handguns in the country have a 
value of at least $300 million. Is the hon. minister considering 
compensation, or will big brother be going door to door and 
confiscating what is now legally owned property of Canadian 
citizens?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have made clear that I am 
going to work with my colleagues in caucus and cabinet to bring 
forward proposals to achieve stricter gun control in the country. 
I think there is broad support for more effective control, and that 
includes particularly handguns which are not used in hunting.
<P>
	Dealing more specifically with the question the hon. member 
has asked on compensation, that is one of the issues we have to 
look at. This party and this government are coming to these 
questions with an open mind. We are going to be sensitive to the 
ownership rights the hon. member has referred to and 
compensation is a matter we are going to be dealing with.
<P>
	I am aware of the issue. I do not have a response today because 
caucus has not dealt with it, nor has cabinet. However, I can 
assure the hon. member that the process is going to be 
undertaken and that we are going to develop a position on this 
very important issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia):</B> Mr. Speaker, for 20 years I had an 
occupational permit to carry a handgun as a field geologist in the 
mountains of British Columbia. I rarely used it. I rarely carried 
it but as a free man, as a Canadian, I had the right to make that 
personal decision myself.
<P>
	There are legitimate reasons for civilians to own these 
weapons. To some working people, including timber cruisers, 
prospectors, trappers, bank messengers and the like, they are 
tools, not toys.
<P>
	Will the minister listen to the advice of his own backbenchers 
and thoughtfully reconsider his position?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have three points very 
briefly.
<P>
	First there is no right in the country to bear arms. The 
ownership of firearms is a privilege which is accorded by 
government under certain strict circumstances.
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	I do not wish to make light of the point made by the hon. 
member but the fact is we are not after those persons. Let me put 
it this way. The object of any such measures would not be to 
make life more difficult for those who have legitimate reasons 
connected with their occupation to carry firearms. Rather, it is in 
recognition of the fact that the use of firearms, handguns in 
particular, in the commission of homicides has risen from 33 per 
cent to 52 per cent in the last four years.
<P>
	We will be thoughtful in the development of our policies 
through caucus, which is going to discuss these matters, and 
cabinet, which will form the policies that we will bring forward 
to the House.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADAWILDLIFEACT">CANADA WILDLIFE ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (for the Minister of the Environment)</B> 
moved that Bill C-24, an act to amend the Canada Wildlife Act 
and to make a consequential amendment to another act, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Natural Resources):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure 
and honour to be introducing today for second reading, 
legislation to conserve and protect Canada's wildlife, in 
particular amendments to the Canada Wildlife Act.
<P>
	Of all the responsibilities of Environment Canada one of the 
most important is the stewardship of wildlife.
<P>
	Canadians care very deeply about wildlife. One of the most 
powerful values that all Canadians share is our tremendous pride 
in Canada's environment and magnificent natural heritage. 
Canadians everywhere have a strong desire to protect and 
restore the various ecosystems that make up our environment. 
No component of our natural heritage is more precious than 
Canada's wildlife.
<P>
	The beauty of wild plants and animals, the idea of free 
creatures living in nature are very appealing to all of us. We 
value wildlife for many other reasons as well, for example, as a 
source of recreation, as an important social economic resource, 
as an integral aspect of the lives of native people, even as a 
potential source of medicines as yet unknown.
<P>
	This government and Environment Canada take the 
responsibility for wildlife very seriously. We are taking action 
to fulfil those responsibilities on a number of fronts.
<P>
	We are modernizing and strengthening federal wildlife 
legislation. At this very moment the government is drafting 
regulations which will enable it to proclaim the wild animal and 
plant protection and regulation of interprovincial and 
international trade act. These regulations are very important and 
will significantly  strengthen Canada's ability to protect its wild 
plants and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3888"> 3888 </A></B>
<P>
animals from poaching and smuggling and are now being 
developed under a consultative process that includes all 
stakeholders which is the way this government functions.
<P>
	As members will recall, on Monday we debated amendments 
to strengthen the Migratory Bird Conventions Act, one of the 
cornerstones of wildlife protection in Canada.
<P>
	In addition Canada and the United States are on convergent 
tracks in preparation for formal negotiation of amendments to 
the migratory bird convention.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	Let me now turn to the Canada Wildlife Act. The Canada 
Wildlife Act was passed in 1973. It authorized the federal 
government to undertake research studies on wildlife and in 
collaboration with the provinces carry out a vast array of 
conservation activities to help wildlife, including the protection 
of species threatened with extinction.
<P>
	While the act adequately responded to our needs back then, 
amendments are certainly required in order to reflect our needs 
today. To date wildlife conservation has focused on certain 
species or specific groups of species.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Today, we generally agree that we need a more comprehensive 
approach to conservation, an ecosystem approach, which takes 
into consideration all roles and values of ecosystems, including 
all animal and plant species and their needs in terms of habitat. 
This is indeed the recommended approach in the document ``A 
Wildlife Policy for Canada'' approved by federal and provincial 
ministers responsible for wildlife in 1990.
<P>
	This kind of approach is the basis for the amendments 
proposed to strengthen and update the Canada Wildlife Act.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For example, the current Canada Wildlife Act defines wildlife 
as all non-domestic animals. The updated act will expand the 
definition of wildlife to include all wild organisms. The new 
definition is consistent with wildlife policy for Canada. It will 
better enable a shift in research and conservation efforts toward 
a true ecosystem approach. It also puts the act in line with the 
convention on biological diversity which was ratified by Canada 
in 1992.
<P>
	The modernized Canada Wildlife Act will provide an 
extended framework to help protect all species in our 
ecosystem. It is important to note that with provincial 
agreement the new act will help preserve habitat. We found out 
through hard experience that it is almost impossible to save a 
single species of plant or animal in the wild without first 
preserving its habitat.
<P>
	Close to my own riding of Moncton we have seen this borne 
out. The Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve has been 
established at Marys Point. A sister reserve in South America 
has been established to protect the habitat of semipalmated 
sandpipers among other migratory species of birds.
<P>
	It is a healthy habitat that permits the survival of species. That 
is what the ecosystem approach is all about. You cannot talk 
about saving the eagle without also talking about water quality, 
about fish population and other habitat.
<P>
	This applies to Canada's marine environment as well. 
Traditional wildlife protection has focused on terrestrial 
wildlife species and their habitats. The marine application of the 
present act is set out at the 12-mile territorial sea limit. Critical 
wildlife habitat, however, including areas important to seabirds 
and breeding and feeding grounds for whales extends far beyond 
the 12-mile limit.
<P>
	The modernized Canada Wildlife Act includes provision for 
the establishment of marine national wildlife areas out to the 
limit of Canada's 200 nautical mile territory. Regulatory 
authorities related to activities in marine protected areas would 
be established.
<P>
	The extension of the Canada Wildlife Act to the 200 mile limit 
could help us significantly in sustaining the biodiversity and 
other associated benefits of marine ecosystems.
<P>
	No legislation can be effective if it cannot be applied and 
enforced effectively. Therefore the modernization of the Canada 
Wildlife Act will improve the administration and enforcement 
of the act in a number of ways. All of the administration and 
implementation provisions of the act are being updated, 
streamlined and made consistent with other federal 
conservation laws.
<P>
	Some of the more significant of these revisions deal with 
enforcement. Penalties are being toughened to reflect the 
serious nature of crimes, such as poaching and the destruction of 
protected habit that threaten Canada's wildlife heritage.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	Potential maximum penalties under the Canada Wildlife Act 
are being increased to a possible fine of $25,000 or a jail term of 
six months, or both. The act will provide more flexibility to the 
courts and enforcement officers in ways that will improve 
compliance and enforcement.
<P>
	For example, revisions to the act will provide authority for the 
issuing of court orders and will enable conservation officers to 
issue tickets for certain offences. This will give more options in 
dealing with offences and punishment so that the best and most 
efficient means are available to respond to the violations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3889"> 3889 </A></B>
<P>
	At the same time where a violation is of a minor nature, such 
as a record keeping violation, a ticketable offence can be 
created. Rather than requiring a court appearance, an officer 
will be able to give a ticket so that the ticket can be paid 
directly. This will ensure fairness and relate to the severity of 
the offence.
<P>
	Community service will become an option in the sentencing 
of convicted violators. This will encourage judges to assign 
penalties where they might otherwise be reluctant. If the 
community service relates to wildlife, as seems very likely, it 
will provide tangible conservation benefits as well.
<P>
	It will become possible to use court orders to prohibit the 
continuation of activities harmful to protected areas. Persons 
who have damaged ecosystems in national wildlife areas could 
be forced to pay the cost of remediation. It is under the authority 
of the Canada Wildlife Act that many areas of key significance 
to Canada's wildlife are protected.
<P>
	At present 45 national wildlife areas comprising 287,000 
hectares have been set up under the act. Although many diverse 
species are found in them, most current wildlife areas have been 
established for their importance as habitat for migratory birds.
<P>
	Furthermore, our national wildlife areas help Canadians meet 
many of their international wildlife management obligations. 
For example, our national wildlife areas help us meet our 
international commitments under the convention on wetlands of 
international importance, commonly known as the Ramsar 
convention.
<P>
	Canada also has commitments under the circumpolar 
agreement on the conservation of Arctic flora and fauna 
component of the Arctic environmental protection strategy, the 
global convention on biodiversity and a number of bilateral and 
multilateral agreements to conserve wildlife and habitat.
<P>
	All of these commitments would be difficult if not impossible 
to meet without our system of national wildlife areas and the 
Canada Wildlife Act. The revised act will help us and the 
international community to do a better job of preserving wildlife 
heritage.
<P>
	It is particularly appropriate to be speaking about the Canada 
Wildlife Act today. I want to use this occasion to call the 
attention of the House to the fact that Canada has recently 
received formal notification that the Creston valley wildlife 
management area has been registered as Canada's 32nd wetland 
of international importance under the Ramsar convention.
<P>
	Canada is a leading participant in this international 
environmental treaty that is promoting the conservation and 
wise use of wetlands the world over. In fact over 30 per cent of 
total wetland area designated under the convention is located 
within Canada.
<P>
	Our network of important protected wetlands now spans all 
the provinces and territories in Canada. The Creston valley 
wildlife management area, the latest Canadian Ramsar site, is 
the first to be designated as entirely owned and managed by the 
province of British Columbia.
<P>
	The Creston valley site covers 6,970 hectares on the 
floodplains of the Kootenay River. It contains fresh eutrophic 
lakes, ferns and lowland river delta wetlands. The Creston 
valley is a major feeding habitat for migrating species on the 
western flyway and regularly supports over 100,000 waterfowl 
during migrating periods.
<P>
	I and this government salute British Columbia for nominating 
this area which is vital to a wide range of international migratory 
species. Environment Canada is proud to have assisted the 
people of British Columbia in seeking the Ramsar convention 
designation for the Creston valley.
<P>
	Canada has committed itself to setting aside and safeguarding 
12 per cent of its total land mass as protected natural space.  Our 
national wildlife areas and the Ramsar convention sites are 
helping us to set aside that 12 per cent of Canada's habitat as 
protected areas.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	What about the other 88 per cent of Canada? Birds are 
independent creatures. They fly where they want to fly and often 
the places that are most important to them fall outside our 
Ramsar sites, national wildlife areas, national or provincial 
parks.
<P>
	We have to make room for wildlife in the other 88 per cent of 
Canada as well. We have to influence general land use 
management in such a way that we humans do not drive out the 
other species with whom we share our ecosystem.
<P>
	In this regard initiatives such as a North American waterfowl 
management plan are extremely important. Under the plan three 
nations, Canada, the United States and Mexico, are working 
together to preserve populations of wildlife and their habitat. 
The North American waterfowl management plan is a leading 
global example of a concept of wiser use that is promoted by the 
Ramsar convention.
<P>
	Under the plan, Canada has pioneered new and innovative 
ways to protect wildlife and habitat in the other 88 per cent. 
Under the plan concepts of wise use are finding their way into 
land areas and wetlands not under the direct control of 
governments.
<P>
	Numerous organizations such as Ducks Unlimited, the Nature 
Conservancy of Canada, and Wildlife Habitat Canada are 
effectively promoting stewardship by private ownership. 
Partnerships have been forged with farmers and many other 
landowners to protect wildlife and the habitat in our vast food 
growing regions. It has been shown that many of the practices 
beneficial 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3890"> 3890 </A></B>
<P>
to wildlife  also benefit agriculture, both economically and in 
such areas as soil conservation.
<P>
	In effect, the plan is exploring new ways to do business and 
provide leverage to federal funds. For example, every federal 
dollar invested in activities under the North American 
waterfowl management plan is matched by an additional $6 
from other donors of which approximately half comes from 
American sources. This type of leverage is possible because 
diverse partners and interests can gather together under the 
umbrella of the North American waterfowl management plan 
and develop and agree upon common goals and objectives and 
put into effect their shared vision.
<P>
	Shared interests can lead to shared objectives. Diverse people 
and organizations can get together and find, sometimes to their 
surprise, that they have things in common and can work toward 
the same goals. This type of bridge building, of people, 
organizations and governments working together is precisely 
the kind of co-operation envisaged by the wildlife policy for 
Canada and it is very important as we try to discover new and 
effective ways to take us toward the goal of sustainable 
development.
<P>
	In addition to agricultural partnerships, partnerships are also 
being formed with other major land use sectors in Canada. For 
example in Nova Scotia and in Newfoundland, North American 
waterfowl management plan agreements are in place. 
Bowater-Mersey and Krueger-Cornerbrach Pulp and Paper, two 
large forestry companies, manage and protect tens of thousands 
of acres of wetlands while maintaining profitable forestry 
activities.
<P>
	Clearly the North American waterfowl management plan 
exemplifies sustainable development in action.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Sustainable development is the key to long term economic 
and environmental health. By keeping wildlife populations in 
good health, we will be able to contribute to the social, cultural 
and economic well-being of Canada, as well as to the ecological 
and biological processes necessary to sustain life.
<P>
	A Statistics Canada study on the importance of wildlife for 
Canadians reinforces this opinion. In 1991, Canadian residents, 
and 1.8 million American visitors attracted to Canada by its 
wildlife, spent a total of $9 billion on sport fishing and other 
wildlife related activities.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians think that wildlife is important, and we engage in 
all sorts of wildlife related activities. In fact the popularity of 
these activities is at an all-time high. Over 90 per cent of 
Canadians participate in one or more wildlife related activities. 
We watch, photograph, feed, study and hunt wildlife. The 
billions we spend doing these things contribute significantly to 
national and provincial economies in the form of income and 
jobs.
<P>
	Given these facts, given the importance of wildlife to 
Canadians, it comes as no surprise that Canadians are highly 
supportive of wildlife and habitat conservation. Given the fact 
that 83 per cent of Canadians feel that it is important to protect 
endangered species and declining wildlife populations, it comes 
as no surprise that Canadians are willing to work together and 
work hard to try to preserve our precious wildlife and its habitat.
<P>
	Passage of these amendments to the Canada Wildlife Act will 
make the job a bit easier. I urge all members to support the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
middle of the 20th century, we saw our planet from space for the 
first time. Historians may eventually find that this vision had a 
greater impact on thought than the Copernican revolution of the 
16th century, which upset the human self-image by revealing 
that the Earth is not the center of the universe.
<P>
	From space, we see a small and fragile ball dominated not by 
human activity and edifice but by a pattern of clouds, oceans, 
greenery, and soils.
<P>
	Humanity's inability to fit its doings into that pattern is 
changing planetary systems, fundamentally. Many such changes 
are accompanied by life-threatening hazards. This new reality, 
from which there is no escape, must be recognized-and 
managed.
<P>
	This introduction, Mr. Speaker, is taken from the very first 
chapter of the Brundtland report dated 1987. We must, each and 
every one of us, recognize its importance and never forget it.
<P>
	We are here today to debate Bill C-24. This bill amends the 
Canada Wildlife Act, which was passed in 1973, and its purpose, 
as stated by the department, is, and I quote: ``to permit the 
Government to conduct wildlife research and to undertake 
various activities related to wildlife conservation and 
interpretation''. The provinces are responsible for managing 
wildlife, except for most species of migratory birds, fish and 
mammals.
<P>
	This bill, in somewhat the same way as Bill C-23, is bringing 
existing legislation up to date. It is basically an update, with a 
few new provisions. Nothing indicates, upon review, this bill 
might infringe upon the responsibilities of Quebec or any other 
province in Canada. But as I said earlier, we can no longer afford 
nowadays to ignore the environmental question, particularly 
with respect to biodiversity.
<P>
	We need only think of endangered species, as mentioned in 
chapter 6 of the very important Brundtland report, ``Our 
Common Future''. The introduction to this chapter reads as 
follows: ``Conservation of living natural resources-plants, 
animals and micro-organisms, and the non-living elements of 
the environment on which they depend-is crucial for 
development. Today, the conservation of wild living resources is 
on the agenda of governments; nearly 4 per cent of the Earth's 
land area is  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3891"> 3891 </A></B>
<P>
managed explicitly to conserve species and ecosystems, and all 
but a small handful of countries have national parks. The 
challenge facing nations today is no longer deciding whether 
conservation is a good idea, but rather how it can be 
implemented in the national interest and within the means 
available in each country''.
<P>
	All of us here in this House today are convinced of the 
importance of saving endangered species, as the countries which 
signed the Brundtland report were. The problem is how to do it.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	It is not necessary to point out that it is vital to humanity to 
save these species. Just think of agriculture, medicine and 
industry to see the economic importance of wildlife species. A 
recent Statistics Canada survey indicated that spending on 
activities of all kinds related to fish and other wildlife species 
contributed $11.5 billion to GNP and created some 250,000 
jobs. Protecting endangered species is vital for the whole 
economy, whence the recent terminology ``environment and 
sustainable development''.
<P>
	Governments have come to realize that it is impossible to 
separate economic development issues from environmental 
issues. Everything is interrelated and, again, we must aim for a 
global vision, a global position on environmental matters.
<P>
	What about hope in all this? Some people may accuse us of 
being idealistic and utopian, but one does not have to go very far 
to come up with several success stories. The decrease in infant 
mortality rates and the increase in life expectancy rates, in the 
number of adults knowing how to read and write and in the 
percentage of children attending school are some of the success 
stories allowing us to believe in the evolution and improvement 
of the environment. They seemed impossible to achieve but they 
were because of the goals set out in the bill. This bill applies to 
animals, wild plants and other organisms and to their habitats.
<P>
	We thus want to ensure that an element of the ecosystem 
essential to the survival of an endangered species is protected 
too. That is why the term ``wildlife'' was substituted for the 
word ``fauna'' throughout the bill.
<P>
	Extending the definition of fauna to all wildlife, in 
accordance with the Convention on Biodiversity ratified by 
Canada in 1993, makes environmental measures more 
consistent.
<P>
	A few examples from ``Our Common Future'' make us realize 
the economic potential of maintaining and preserving our 
ecosystems.
<P>
	First of all, there would appear to be plants containing 
hydrocarbons, not carbohydrates. Since some of these plants 
exist in regions which have become useless because of activities 
such as surface mining or hydrocarbon extraction, the same 
report says that coal, among other minerals, could be 
regenerated by soil cultivation of hydrocarbons. And, unlike an 
oil well, an oil plantation or fuel farm would never dry out. 
Imagine the savings, as well as the benefits from an 
environmental point of view.
<P>
	Let us take a look at corn crops in the United States. In the 
early seventies, some fungus seriously damaged corn crops, 
causing losses of two billion dollars. Recently, a primitive kind 
of corn from Mexico was discovered. This wild corn is 
perennial, while the other kinds are annual. Crossing this corn 
with commercial varieties of corn would translate into savings 
on ploughing and seeding. The genetic qualities of this plant, 
which was almost extinct, would allow savings of hundreds of 
millions every year in the United States alone.
<P>
	The preservation of wild species ensures our survival and 
allows us to make enormous savings.
<P>
	The amendments in this bill do not concern only endangered 
species. Indeed, the scope of the legislation is extended to 
include inland waters and territorial waters-we are referring 
here to the 200 nautical mile limit-so that the government can 
create protected marine areas to ensure the survival of 
endangered species. However, and this is very important for us, 
if provincial jurisdiction is involved, the federal government 
will have to come to an agreement with the province concerned. 
Moreover, this amendment will have the effect of significantly 
increasing the protection of our marine ecosystems, which are 
important for our wild species. Protecting ecosystems in an 
intelligent manner contributes to the major goals of sustainable 
development.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	Clause 13 of Bill C-24, which amends section 11 of the act, 
clearly defines the duties and powers of wildlife officers as well 
as their role with respect to the provinces. This provision 
clarifies the specific duties and functions of wildlife officers 
and others involved in this field.
<P>
	Clause 15, on the other hand, significantly increases the 
amount of the fines that can be awarded. These may range from 
$5,000 up to a maximum of $25,000 or to imprisonment for a 
term not exceeding six months. Hopefully, the new fines 
provided for in the legislation will discourage potential 
lawbreakers and poachers.
<P>
	Pursuant to the legislation, the minister may acquire lands for 
research, conservation and interpretation purposes involving 
migratory birds and, if it is in the national interest, other 
species, including endangered ones, in which case he acts in 
co-operation with the provinces. There are currently 45 national 
wildlife preserves in Canada covering a total area of 287,000 
hectares.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3892"> 3892 </A></B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to draw a parallel between the 
Canada Wildlife Act, Bill C-24 and sustainable development. 
Sustainable development is defined on page 8 of the Bruntdland 
Report as the ability of humanity to do the following, and I 
quote: ``to ensure that it meets the needs of the present without 
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their 
own needs''.
<P>
	The report also stresses the following point, and I quote: 
``There is a growing need for effective international 
co-operation to manage ecological and economic 
interdependence. Yet at the same time, confidence in 
international organizations is diminishing and support for them 
dwindling''.
<P>
	Therefore, it goes without saying that we on this side of the 
House support this bill designed to update the existing 
legislation and to clarify certain roles and responsibilities. You 
can rest assured, Mr. Speaker, that the Bloc Quebecois will 
continue to support initiatives that promote the environment and 
sustainable development, provided they are respectful of 
existing jurisdictions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the 
parliamentary secretary has stated, the purpose of Bill C-24 is to 
amend the existing Canada Wildlife Act.
<P>
	At the outset may I say as environment critic that the Reform 
Party supports these long overdue amendments to the act that 
was first proclaimed in 1973. Since proclamation there have 
been a few minor amendments, but by and large the act is much 
the same as it was when introduced 20 years ago. Canada's 
wildlife legislation clearly needs modernization.
<P>
	Bill C-24 is relatively simple and straightforward. However 
that does not mean we should just give it a rubber stamp of 
approval. This is the first real opportunity we have had in 20 
years to sit down to review the act clause by clause and to amend 
the bill so that it meets the needs of the 21st century.
<P>
	We must ensure the bill is all encompassing, for it is not 
enough simply to attempt to protect wildlife. I am pleased to see 
that the bill addresses a wider range of organisms. The 
broadening of the act to include all living organisms allows the 
government to protect all endangered species.
<P>
	Back in 1973 when the wildlife protection bill was first passed 
it was said that the world was losing one species per year. Today 
there are 258 species on Canada's endangered species list. Only 
last month 20 new fish, mammals and plants were added to the 
endangered species list.
<P>
	Some of these species include the western harvest mouse in 
the Okanagan and southern Alberta, the Pacific water shrew on 
the lower B.C. mainland, the King rail in southern Ontario, and 
the short-eared owl in most of Canada.
<P>
	These species are largely endangered by pressures from the 
urban and agricultural sprawl. Habitat loss, industrial pollution 
and urban development contribute largely to the plight of 
Canada's wildlife. However the broadening of the act to include 
endangered species should be tempered in its use and 
particularly in how it is applied.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	The United States with its endangered species act is not in my 
view the direction this country should be going. The 
amendments in Bill C-24 are appropriate as they cover 
measures necessary to protect endangered species without going 
to the extreme measures pursued in the United States. Too often 
the species in question, for example the spotted owl in the 
Pacific northwest, is simply the tool used to achieve another 
objective. In the case of the spotted owl the goal is forest 
preservation and the owl is simply used as a stepping stone to 
attain another goal.
<P>
	In Canada we must ensure that our legislation is directed 
toward the endangered species in question and that the revised 
act cannot be used or abused to achieve other goals.
<P>
	This will also require the co-operation and understanding of 
the provinces as there is an overlapping of jurisdiction. In 
protecting wildlife and wild organisms the act should be applied 
with care so as to avoid overstepping other jurisdictions. The 
wider discretionary powers granted to the minister by the bill 
must be exercised judiciously.
<P>
	I would now like to step into the past for a moment and draw 
on my previous experiences to show where areas within the bill 
are appropriate and long overdue.
<P>
	In my capacity as a forester for a large woodlands operation 
on Vancouver Island part of my duties included overseeing the 
land base of 250,000 acres. This involved dealing with many 
federal and provincial agencies, including fish and wildlife, and 
on numerous occasions dealing with wildlife offences.
<P>
	In our area of operation there had been a particularly 
successful transplant of Roosevelt elk from northern Vancouver 
Island to the Nahmint Valley where a series of severe winters 
had virtually wiped out the local elk population.
<P>
	During the mid-1980s, 13 young bull and cow elk were 
transported and released to join a single old bull who was the 
only survivor of the original herd. As an aside I want to say that 
old bull was delighted to see those cows coming off the back of 
the transport truck. Four of the cows were equipped with radio 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3893"> 3893 </A></B>
<P>
collars in order to study the migration patterns and habits of the 
elk. It was truly a  success story, and in four years the herd had 
multiplied to 24 animals from the original 14.
<P>
	There was also a sense of pride and ownership in the 
community as many different groups including wildlife clubs, 
provincial agencies, forest companies and the community at 
large had banded together to make this happen.
<P>
	Unfortunately this story has a dark side as four of the best 
breeding cows, three with radio collars, were shot illegally. To 
add further insult only the hind quarters of one animal were 
removed. The others were left to rot.
<P>
	The individuals responsible were subsequently caught and 
processed through the courts, but they only received extremely 
light sentences. The local residents of Port Alberni were 
particularly upset with the light sentences. My point is that 
although I realize the situation I described is within provincial 
jurisdiction, similar instances occur in federal areas such as our 
national parks.
<P>
	I am particularly pleased to see the bill address the areas of 
enforcement and punishment, for too often the penalty does not 
fit the crime. However the bill puts some teeth into areas that up 
until now have lacked strength.
<P>
	The bill increases penalties to include a maximum $25,000 
fine and a maximum six months in prison. It also creates 
indictable offences for the more serious infractions.
<P>
	However there is one area that does not appear to be covered 
in the bill. It is the illegal possession and sale of endangered or 
protected species animal body parts. We are all familiar with the 
plight of the African rhino. Its tusk brings poachers huge profits 
for its final use as an aphrodisiac in Asia. What we are not as 
familiar with is that this type of atrocity is also going on in this 
country.
<P>
	In my former job I have come across black bear carcasses 
where only particular organs were removed, the remainder of 
the animal abandoned. Why? It was because the sale of these 
animal organs in Asia brings big dollars where they are required 
in ancient remedies and tonics.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	Body parts commonly being exported to Asia from Canada 
include: black bear gall bladders, claws, paws and teeth; seal 
and sea lion genitalia; beaver genitalia; deer and elk antlers in 
velvet; and eagle and falcon beaks and claws.
<P>
	British Columbia currently has legislation directed toward 
possession and sale of animal parts. It is my hope that the 
minister will be receptive to examining those portions of the 
B.C. legislation that may be applicable to the bill, with the 
intention of further strengthening the Canada Wildlife Act to 
prohibit the possession and sale of animal body parts.
<P>
	Another area of the bill which has been updated is that 
pertaining to nautical wildlife. Whereas the old act applied to 
the old 12-mile limit, it has now been expanded to include the 
200-mile limit. This increased area of jurisdiction will play a 
key role in the protection of water mammals and fish stocks. 
Regulation making authorities related to marine protected areas 
have also been established in the bill, and this will allow for 
enforcement. Other administrative and implementation 
provisions such as inspection, search, seizure, custody and 
forfeiture are all provided for in the bill which will hopefully 
allow these provisions to be effectively carried out. However all 
these powers need to be exercised with discretion.
<P>
	Other areas that deserve comment are those directed toward 
the recovery of costs. In light of Canada's current financial 
situation it is most appropriate to recover costs related to the 
management of public lands and protected marine areas. It will 
mean reduced government expenditures and a more 
self-sufficient system. It will allow for greater financial 
sustainability in policy over the long term.
<P>
	In conclusion, we support the bill and look forward to 
examining it in detail in committee with the purpose of refining 
it to best deal with the wildlife concerns of the country into the 
next century.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport):</B> As we all know, Mr. 
Speaker, Canada is in many respects the envy of the world, 
particularly when it comes to the diversity of its ecosystems and 
wildlife and the geography that makes such richness possible.
<P>
	However recent studies have revealed that we have 11 
extirpated species under the general heading of mammal, bird, 
reptile, fish and plant. We have nine extinct ones under the 
general heading of mammal, bird and fish species. Under the 
general heading of at risk species we have 258 mammals, birds, 
amphibians, reptiles, fish and plants. This list is by no means 
exhaustive.
<P>
	The questions we have to ask ourselves in this important 
debate are: Why are so many species at risk? How come we 
already have so many extinct and so many extirpated species? Is 
it due to habitat destruction caused by humans? Is it due to 
thoughtless trafficking in animals because of greed?
<P>
	It seems habitat destruction and trafficking are the two major 
reasons. Whatever the combination of causes, it underlies the 
need to increase our efforts in protecting wildlife and ensuring 
that the destruction of wildlife and wildlife habitat destruction 
do not occur.
<P>
	The act is a good measure. It is a good step in the right 
direction. As others have already indicated it is very timely and 
badly needed. It allows, for instance, the minister to purchase, 
acquire or lease lands for the purpose of research, conservation 
and interpretation in respect of migratory birds and-this is the 
interesting angle-in the national interest and with the support 
of provinces other species including endangered species. So  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3894"> 3894 </A></B>
<P>
there is a broadening of a very important concept in relation to 
the acquisition of land.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	Presently in Canada there are 45 national wildlife areas 
encompassing roughly 300,000 hectares, as the member for 
Terrebonne already indicated in his intervention. The provinces 
have indicated to the federal government that the existing 
penalties are no longer appropriate and that administrative and 
enforcement procedures need to be streamlined. Because of this, 
a number of changes have been proposed.
<P>
	As the member for Comox-Alberni has already indicated, 
the definition is no longer limited to any non-domestic animal 
but includes wild organisms, animal, plant or other organisms 
and their habitat. The broadening of the definition encourages 
an ecosystem approach to conservation and brings the act far 
beyond the traditional approach for protection which in the past 
has been limited to just the higher order of animals.
<P>
	Much has been said by those who spoke before me on the 
establishment of protected marine areas. I also welcome these, 
because this step has potential positive implications for areas 
within the 200 nautical mile limit and provides authority for the 
protection of marine animals and mammals.
<P>
	Until now the marine ecosystem and its diversity has 
remained largely unprotected from the perspective of habitat 
protection and the application of the act has been limited just to 
the 12 mile limit. Therefore it has become critical that the 
wildlife habitat, including breeding and feeding grounds for 
whales and areas of significant concentration of seabirds be 
extended beyond the 12 mile limit. This is a very good 
development.
<P>
	I was very interested in the comments made by the member 
for Comox-Alberni on enforcement. One often wonders about 
the effectiveness of fines and whether the right level is achieved. 
Certainly there is no doubt that what is being proposed in the bill 
is an improvement. Until this bill is passed, enforcement 
agencies in the field are reluctant, we are told, to charge 
offenders because of inappropriate penalties and the time 
required to follow up in court proceedings.
<P>
	Hopefully the amendments will allow the wildlife officers to 
have broader authority in inspecting wildlife specimens, 
including the provisions regarding inspection, search, seizure, 
custody and so on. The minister will also have powers to appoint 
persons or a group of persons to be employed by the government 
as enforcement officers.
<P>
	While the amendments to increase penalties are welcome and 
desirable, they will mean very little if the necessary resources 
are not allocated to enforcement. At the present time the federal 
jurisdiction has only 30 enforcement positions, all of which are 
not filled. As the member probably knows, coming from 
Alberta, a lot of criticism has been directed through the federal 
government at the fact that enforcement powers have  been 
declining, as has the strength of the Canadian Wildlife Service.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary waxed eloquently at the 
beginning of his speech, stating: ``Canadians care deeply about 
wildlife''. He is right. The question is this: Can fewer than 30 
enforcement officers do the job? All they can do is answer 
telephone inquiries but not much more. Therefore this aspect of 
implementation and enforcement requires attention.
<P>
	Fines have been increased. I will not go into the details of 
what is being proposed but I have to ask this. What is the value 
of a polar bear, what is the value of a spotted owl, what is the 
value of a bald eagle once the species has entered the 
endangered category? The monetary value expressed through 
the fine is not adequate to express the damage caused to the 
totality of our culture when an endangered species is removed 
by one number.
<P>
	I am a bit puzzled about the effectiveness of the fines 
proposed, whether they go far enough in becoming really 
preventive. There is definitely an improvement in the proposed 
amendments to section 13 which make a person liable for a 
separate offence on each day on which an offence is committed. 
That is good. It will allow a court to multiply fines by the 
number of specimens in the possession of the offender. The 
member for Comox-Alberni made reference to possession of 
wildlife that ought to be taken into account when we go through 
this bill clause by clause.
<P>
	Section 13 allows the court to impose additional fines if the 
court deems that the person has made earnings from the offence. 
Although this will be difficult to prove it is a good step in the 
right direction.
<P>
	Clause 15 of the bill among other things adds a new section 
for special orders of the court which allow the court to order 
those convicted to remedy the harm, pay for remediation of all 
activity that could lead to repeat offences, perform community 
services and the like. That is highly commendable.
<P>
	Now we come to what is probably the heart of the bill. Section 
8 deals with endangered species. Here the minister has been 
given permissive powers, in co-operation with one or more 
provincial governments, to take measures as the minister deems 
necessary for the protection of any species of wildlife in danger 
of extinction.
<P>
	This terminology has good potential, but is it strong enough? 
Does this section provide adequate protection or do we need new 
legislation for the specific protection of endangered species? 
This is the question that ought to be addressed. I am sure it will 
be addressed in committee. If we do not come to grips with the 
question of endangered species and their protection, future 
generations of Canadians will not be able to enjoy them.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="3895"> 3895 </A></B>
<P>
	The International Union for the Conservation of Nature in 
January of this year in Argentina adopted an interesting 
resolution which in effect repaired a protocol under the 
convention on biological diversity which deals with diversity 
in the forest. It is a good step in the right direction.
<P>
	The question is this: How does Canada rank in the 
international sphere? Are we doing enough to protect species 
that cross borders?
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	What about the Porcupine caribou in northern Alberta and in 
Yukon territory? That herd resides and moves between Yukon 
and Alaska. While the Canadian land is designated as a wildlife 
area, one section of the calving region is in the United States. 
This land is described as 1002 lands and is very important 
because it is the calving ground of the herd and is in danger of 
being destroyed because of oil exploration.
<P>
	Therefore, should oil exploration be permitted on the north 
slope, which is this 1002 land in Alaska, or should it be, as I 
would of course argue in favour, banned for the protection in the 
centuries ahead of these particular herds which move across the 
border? This is a cross-border issue. We must, I submit, ensure 
that species and populations such as the Porcupine caribou herd 
are not threatened through exploration and exploitation of 
natural resources. Since this is an international matter I would 
urge the Minister of Foreign Affairs to raise it at the appropriate 
time in Washington.
<P>
	It seems to me as we look at this bill and the overall situation 
in the nineties that we need international agreements on the 
preservation and protection of water and land wildlife. We are 
losing species compared to the richness of 50 or 100 years ago. 
In other words, there is a constant attrition and diminution in the 
richness of species that can be documented.
<P>
	If future generations are to have any wildlife to enjoy, then we 
need to do much more for the species in danger of extinction and 
for the cross-border species in particular.
<P>
	I will conclude with a thought that I am sure troubles all of us. 
It is more than that, it is a reflection. I wonder whether fines, 
enforcement, laws and regulations can do the job. It seems to me 
that they can only go so far.
<P>
	What is needed as a complementary measure to Bill C-24 is 
an intensive education program. We have to have education 
aimed at all ages, an education aimed at all groups and promoted 
at all levels. Every Canadian should know what is endangered in 
our ecosystem, either on land or in the water, whether it is a 
plant, an insect, a mammal, you name it.
<P>
	Every Canadian through this educational effort should be 
mobilized to protect wildlife. Every Canadian should be asked 
to help in the protection of endangered species because in a 
democracy the most effective instrument is education.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, the bill 
the government is introducing this afternoon is aimed at 
amending the Canada Wildlife Act. Enacted in 1973, this 
legislation will be made more efficient by the new provisions. 
The environment is indeed an evolving sector in need of 
constant readjustment.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	I am very happy to take part in the debate this afternoon, being 
the fourth member of the Standing Committee on the 
Environment and Sustainable Development to speak on Bill 
C-24, immediately following its chairman, the member for 
Davenport.
<P>
	Over the past twenty years, this act had been left unchanged. 
It was intended, first, to allow the federal government to 
conduct wildlife research, and second, to protect wild animals, 
especially those on the endangered list. The amendments before 
us today appear to be quite justified since they are mainly aimed 
at giving more teeth to this piece of legislation regarding the 
protection of our wildlife. The proposed changes are in four 
areas.
<P>
	First of all, the amendments extend the act to cover the 
internal waters and the territorial sea of Canada up to 200 miles. 
Before, the limit was only 12 miles. This will allow the 
government to create protected marine areas across a larger 
territory. Among other things, such areas will serve to protect 
endangered species. It is of the utmost importance to be able to 
take care of these species since they are threatened by the 
pollution in our waterways, even if they do not come under our 
jurisdiction. Naturally, endangered species have no way to 
protect themselves against such negative impact, and we cannot 
pick up their distress calls if we are not in the field to notice the 
devastation.
<P>
	Another amendment deals with living organisms and 
throughout the French version of the act, the word ``faune'' is 
replaced by the expression ``espèces sauvages''. That way, 
animals, plants and other living organisms and their respective 
habitats, are all protected. If we care about the habitat of these 
wildlife species, we also make sure that all the ecosystem 
elements their survival requires will be protected as well. In past 
years, we focused on animals and only animals. From now on, 
this legislation will give the government all the authority it 
requires to protect the producers, the first links in the food chain 
which of course feeds the consumers. We will also deal with the 
decomposers to ensure perfect recycling.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3896"> 3896 </A></B>
<P>
	Plants are the first link in the food chain which nourishes 
herbivores and carnivores alike and which ends with man. This 
reminds me of the story about Isle Royale most of us have 
heard. Authorities had introduced herds of moose on that 
island. There were no predators so the moose multiplied at an 
alarming rate. What happened? There were too many, the whole 
herd was weak and sick, individuals were aggressive with each 
other, vegetation was scarce, the whole island was heading 
towards disaster. There was overgrazing, so the animals had to 
dig up plant roots in order to survive.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Fortunately and just in time, authorities who did not want to 
allow hunting, reintroduced on the island the moose's natural 
predator, the wolf.
<P>
	A pack of wolves was reestablished on the island. At the 
beginning, food was plentiful and there was a population 
explosion, while the moose population dwindled. However, 
after thirty years, a perfect balance was reached on Isle Royale, 
to everybody's relief.
<P>
	This is the kind of balance that humans and the government 
should strive to achieve. Previously, we did not protect habitats. 
We could also talk about clear-cutting. When hundreds and 
hundreds of contiguous hectares are ruthlessly stripped of all 
trees, clearly habitats are being destroyed.
<P>
	Animals must move out and search for a similar habitat. 
However, when they find one it is likely already occupied by 
other individuals of the same species. You know how it is, when 
you have a territory you try to defend it, to keep intruders at bay.
<P>
	Other times we see the total disappearance of a habitat, very 
often crucial for endangered species. This amendment is in 
keeping with the Convention on Biodiversity that Canada 
ratified in 1993. Several members already mentioned it.
<P>
	At the present time, the term used excludes domestic animals. 
As it becomes increasingly clear that all elements of our 
environment are closely interrelated, it would obviously be 
inefficient to protect a mammal or a bird when it cannot survive 
in its natural habitat.
<P>
	The third amendment defines the duties and powers of 
wildlife officers, who will have more leeway with regard to 
offenders. Although the hon. member for Davenport spoke at 
length on this earlier, I would still like to deliver this message.
<P>
	The last amendment deals with fines, which will be much 
higher. Provision is made for a $25,000 maximum fine or a 
six-month prison term or both for more serious offences.
<P>
	This measure, which is intended to discourage poaching, 
should be proceeded with. By the way, Mr. Speaker, when I was 
in my riding of Frontenac on the weekend, I read in the county 
newspaper, the <I>Courrier Frontenac</I>, that people who had 
burglarized dozens of cottages and summer homes were 
sentenced to less than  two years in prison-which is reasonable 
in my opinion-but since provincial jails are overcrowded, the 
journalist figured out that the time spent behind bars varies from 
1.8 to 24 per cent of the sentence.
<P>
	While listening to the hon. member for Davenport earlier, I 
figured out that six months in prison multiplied by 30 days a 
month amounts to 180 days. So 1 per cent of that would be 1.8 
days, let us say two days. The bill may provide for a prison term 
of six months but even if the judge sentences the offender to six 
months, it should be a little less with good behaviour. But if the 
prisoner only serves 1.8 per cent, 2 per cent or 4 per cent of his 
sentence, it is a little disappointing for the judge, and our 
wildlife officers will eventually lose all motivation.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	The Disraeli chief of police told me of the time he testified in 
court in Sherbrooke, some sixty kilometres away. On his way 
back, he stopped for a hot dog, french fries and a Coke and when 
he got to Disraeli, the man he had testified against and who had 
been convicted was already there. Maybe he spent too much 
time eating his hot dog! That just goes to show how sentences 
are not always appropriate.
<P>
	The measures proposed today will protect wildlife species 
more efficiently but will also ensure special attention is given to 
endangered species. The public already knows some of these 
species. The beluga whale, for example, at the mouth of the 
Saguenay, the bald eagle, the peregrine falcon, the prairie dog, 
the grizzly bear, the bison which was endangered just two 
decades ago.
<P>
	Allow me to go off on a tangent once again. I am lucky enough 
to live in the country. Last Sunday morning, for the first time, I 
saw a bald eagle on my land. I called my wife and children so 
they could see it and there we were, in front of the patio door 
with our binoculars, filled with wonder at the sight of that bald 
eagle. I hope it has a mate so they can reproduce on our land. All 
this to tell you that even if I have lived in that area for many 
years, last Sunday was the first time I had the opportunity to see 
there a bald eagle, which is the emblem of the United States.
<P>
	Other species are not as lucky. The preventive measures we 
seek to introduce will allow us to foresee the problems and to 
act, rather than react after the damage is done. Instead of waiting 
until some species are on the verge of extinction to do something 
to preserve them, we will be able to take measures to maintain 
their numbers at a level that poses no threat to their continuing 
survival.
<P>
	I will tell you another story. You probably know that the 
Government of Quebec had to legislate in order to save the 
beaver, the one on the reverse side of the nickel, the symbol of 
hard-working people. In Quebec, during the depression, beaver 
was actively trapped for its pelt or its meat. Times were hard, 
families were large and feeding them was not easy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3897"> 3897 </A></B>
<P>
	The government prohibited all trading in beaver pelts as well 
as trapping. Populations started to build up again. Maybe I have 
a keener eye than most but on highway 417, coming to Ottawa, 
about 15 kilometres from the national capital I see trees, 
trembling aspens, cut down by beavers. I noticed them again 
no later than Monday. This to say that beavers are now 
plentiful, they are on the outskirts of Ottawa and Hull, along 
the 417.
<P>
	I urge hon. members using this road to be on the lookout, they 
will see the fallen trees. Perhaps authorities will deport the 
beavers, the way they deported the Acadians, if they do too 
much damage along highway 417.
<P>
	I remind you also of the passenger pigeon which, in North 
America, has come to typify the devastating influence of 
humans on wildlife. It is now extinct. Of course it was not 
exactly a smart bird, it would come close to human dwellings. 
As I said before, people were poor and hungry. These birds were 
easy to catch and very good to eat.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Do not believe that the only purpose is to save some very rare 
species so that we can boast that we have rare birds in our 
backyard, as I was just telling you earlier about the bald eagle. 
Protecting their habitats lets our wildlife live in a healthy 
environment that is the best possible one for them.
<P>
	I will draw a parallel with Bill C-23 presented in this House 
last Monday. One amendment made to that act on migratory 
birds concerns embryos, sperm and eggs.
<P>
	One may question the importance of protecting these items 
and wonder even more what these items can be used for. If you 
look a little closer, you quickly see that with biotechnologies 
becoming more and more prevalent, it is good planning to 
regulate potential problems that may arise.
<P>
	This bill also amends a law that might not seem very 
important, except that saving our wildlife depends on it. If we do 
not want to always be in a race against time to protect our 
endangered species, we must take proactive measures.
<P>
	One possibly contentious aspect concerns federal and 
provincial jurisdictions, since they are not always clearly 
defined when it comes to the environment. Take the example of a 
non-navigable waterway, which is under provincial 
jurisdiction; if it were navigable, then it would be under federal 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that, under the provisions of this 
legislation, if the jurisdiction of a province comes into question, 
the federal government-and I certainly hope it will abide by the 
letter and the spirit of the law-will have to reach an agreement 
with the province concerned.
<P>
	To conclude, I think it may be worthwhile to remind this 
House that nature is exquisitely sensitive as well as 
self-contained. On this blue planet of ours, we have something 
called the food chain. This chain could be compared to the huge 
chains big contractors use on their power shovels. Every time a 
plant or animal species is extinghished, it is one more link being 
weakened. Eventually, this link will break. Naturally, it would 
be catastrophic if one of these links broke. That is what 
sustainable development is about, as my colleague from 
Terrebone so aptly described it earlier, based on the Bruntland 
report. If one of these links were to break, then our children's 
future and that of generations to come would be seriously 
jeopardized.
<P>
	It is well known that a chain is only as strong as its weakest 
links. So, seeing that some links are getting weaker, it is high 
time that we all worked together to make our planet a better 
place to live, basically. At this stage, I can say the government 
can, of course, count on the Bloc Quebecois' support. As my 
colleague from Terrebonne said, we will always endorse 
policies to protect our environment and make this planet a better 
place for future generations.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	We are growing old, so this will be for generations and 
generations to come.
<P>
	I will close on this, but I must tell you, Mr. Speaker, that by 
the end of the day, you will have become very knowledgeable in 
matters of the environment. I can see you listening with great 
interest to all the speeches made this afternoon on Bill C-24, 
including the remarks of four members of the Standing 
Committee on the Environment who have spoken so far, with 
perhaps a fifth one to come.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
over two decades ago Parliament passed into law the Canada 
Wildlife Act. This was a key piece of legislation in the effort to 
protect our country's wildlife. It enables the federal government 
to carry out wildlife research and, in co-operation with the 
provinces, to undertake a wide range of conservation 
interpretation activities for wildlife and its habitat including the 
protection of endangered species.
<P>
	Since 1973, however, we have seen far-reaching changes in 
our approach to environmental issues. These changes 
necessitate updating of the act. We have come to see the crucial 
importance of the interrelationships between these issues and 
the need to integrate the environment and the economy. We also 
recognize that the issues we face are complex. To address them 
successfully we need co-operation across jurisdictions and even 
across borders.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3898"> 3898 </A></B>
<P>
	This new understanding lies at the heart of sustainable 
development or sustainability. Sustainability recognizes the 
need to keep human activities within the limits of the 
ecosystem's capacity to sustain. It means integrating economic 
and environmental goals. It also means building a wide network 
of partnerships to achieve these goals.
<P>
	At the United Nations earth summit in 1992 the world 
community gave its support to sustainable development. In the 
area of wildlife it adopted the convention on biological 
diversity. Canada was one of the first industrialized countries to 
sign this unprecedented agreement.
<P>
	Signatories to the convention must regulate or manage 
biological resources to ensure their conservation and 
sustainable use and must establish a system of protected areas to 
conserve biodiversity. The convention calls for conservation 
efforts to consider all species within an ecosystem and requires 
countries to develop legislative provisions to protect 
endangered species.
<P>
	We have welcomed the new international commitment to 
maintaining biodiversity because wildlife has a special 
importance to our country and to the vast majority of our people. 
Canada is indeed fortunate in still having natural spaces largely 
untouched by development where wildlife abounds in a free 
state. We all take pride in our vast wilderness areas and the 
creatures that inhabit them. They help to define the identity of 
our country.
<P>
	As well, Canada's living natural resources make a major 
contribution to our economic well-being. According to a 
Statistics Canada survey on the importance of wildlife to 
Canadians in 1991, expenditures associated with all types of fish 
and wildlife related recreational activities contributed at least 
$11.5 billion to our gross domestic product. They generated $4.4 
billion in tax revenues and provided 250,000 jobs.
<P>
	The same survey shows that over 90 per cent of Canadians 
took part in wildlife related activities during 1991, devoting to 
them a total of 1.3 billion days and $5.6 billion. Those figures 
indicate that wildlife plays a major part in Canadians' 
recreational life. Further, 86 per cent of Canadians support 
wildlife conservation.
<P>
	For all these reasons we must ensure the health of Canada's 
wildlife. The amendments to the Canada Wildlife Act will help 
achieve that goal.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	The bill under consideration will broaden the scope of the 
Canada Wildlife Act to apply not simply to non-domestic 
animals but instead to all wild organisms. That shift will bring 
the act into line with the biodiversity convention.
<P>
	The bill will also make it possible to create marine natural 
wildlife areas, not only within the 12 nautical mile limit as at 
present, but all the way out to the 200 nautical mile limit. This 
will allow much greater  protection of the Canadian marine 
ecosystems important to wildlife.
<P>
	The amendments establish regulatory authorities for marine 
protected areas. They strengthen enforcement related 
provisions. They will help deter illegal activities such as 
poaching by setting a maximum penalty of $25,000 and/or six 
months in jail for serious offences.
<P>
	These changes will help ensure that future Canadians enjoy 
the same benefits we do from flourishing wildlife populations. 
However protecting Canada's wildlife is not a task for the 
federal government alone. To a large extent managing wildlife is 
a responsibility of the provinces and the territories. Only by 
working with them can the federal government promote our 
national wildlife objectives.
<P>
	Canadians can be proud that the different levels of 
government have a record of strong co-operation on wildlife 
issues. In 1990 the federal and provincial governments adopted 
the wildlife policy for Canada. This calls for effective 
legislation conserving wild animals and plants and ensuring that 
all uses are sustainable.
<P>
	It also calls for penalties that pose effective deterrents to the 
illegal use of wild species. More recently federal, provincial and 
territorial governments together have been developing a 
Canadian biodiversity strategy that will set out the manner in 
which Canada will implement the 1992 global biodiversity 
convention.
<P>
	That same co-operation is central to the Canada Wildlife Act. 
For example, the act provides for co-operative management 
areas on provincial lands. While the federal Minister of the 
Environment will have the authority to appoint provincial 
officers as wildlife officers, these appointments will be made 
only with the agreement of the provinces concerned.
<P>
	The amendments define the authority and powers of those 
officers and provide for inspection and search and seizure 
procedures in accordance with the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms. Federal and provincial governments will also 
continue their co-operation on the management of endangered 
species. That co-operation dates back to 1988 when the 
responsible government agents launched the RNEW 
organization and strategy.
<P>
	RNEW stands for recovery of nationally endangered wildlife. 
Its goal is to have all agencies and organizations work as a team 
to rescue species at risk from extinction and to prevent 
vulnerable species from becoming at risk. The need for such 
teamwork is all too clear because the list of species designated 
as endangered is growing ever longer while the list of recovered 
species remains all too short.
<P>
	RNEW brings together the directors of federal, provincial and 
territorial wildlife agencies plus the heads of three major 
national wildlife organizations: the Canadian Nature 
Federation, the Canadian Wildlife Federation and the World 
Wildlife Fund Canada. These officials set up a team to prepare a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3899"> 3899 </A></B>
<P>
management plan for the recovery of a particular endangered 
species, a plan  eventually to be carried out by the responsible 
governments in co-operation with universities and conservation 
organizations.
<P>
	Successes achieved through the RNEW program are 
gratifying, but they must not make us complacent. There are 
more cases by far in which Canada's wildlife populations are 
suffering from the effects of such problems as loss and 
degradation of habitat, overharvesting, poaching, disease and 
the impact of toxic substances. Yet the few successes are 
invaluable because they clearly show us the way forward. That 
way is through co-operation of the different levels of 
government and concerned groups outside government.
<P>
	The amendments to the Canada Wildlife Act reinforce that 
co-operation. They will enhance protection for Canada's 
wildlife and help us advance the goals of sustainability.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, in speaking 
in support of Bill C-24 I am going to take a somewhat different 
angle or attack to it than has been taken to this point.
<P>
	We have been speaking an awful lot about issues concerning 
enforcement, search and seizure and all of these things which of 
course have to be a part of an act if it is going to be workable.
<P>
	I would like to talk about some of the people in my 
constituency and I believe all across Canada who presently are 
involved, not in the enforcement but in the enhancement of the 
whole issue of wildlife.
<P>
	There is a network of people who belong to organizations like 
rod and gun clubs all across my province, indeed across Canada. 
In British Columbia some of the networking is interprovincial or 
international in scale. For example, there are the Rocky 
Mountain Elk Foundation, Ducks Unlimited, Trout Unlimited, 
Foundation for North American Wild Sheep, Canadian Wildlife 
Federation, and on and on.
<P>
	Simply stated, networks are people talking to each other, 
sharing ideas, information and resources. These networks which 
are fundamentally informal exist to foster self help, to exchange 
information, to change society, to improve productivity and 
work life, and to share resources.
<P>
	The hunters, trappers, guides and fishermen of Canada 
however are facing a crisis, a turning point in history. They have 
always been low key. Their way is not confrontational. Their 
way is to work in co-operation not confrontation. They not only 
value the privilege to carry out their sport, but also to work hard 
with real dollars to maintain healthy wildlife populations in 
British Columbia and across Canada.
<P>
	For example, within British Columbia there are 
approximately one million homes. Of this number about 50 per 
cent or half of them contain a hunter or fisherman, based on 
licences sold. Of course, there are also thousands of homes that 
contain non-hunters and non-fishermen.
<P>
	Then there is a number containing anti-hunters and 
anti-fishermen. The anti group is by far the smallest of the three 
categories, but you do get more publicity if you are anti. You do 
not necessarily have to know what you are talking about to get 
press. There is a feeling that only antis care about wild animals 
or fish. The so-called let them be group, they have a 
management by lobby philosophy. A lot of what they do has 
nothing to do with science. They are very simplistic and feel that 
if hunting and fishing cease, everything will be fine. They could 
not be further from the truth.
<P>
	It is my experience that hunters, fishermen, trappers and 
guides are very poor at getting their conservation message out. 
So in my small part I am trying to do exactly that.
<P>
	Most of the government wildlife agencies also have difficulty 
getting their message out. What we find is that the media seems 
to be mostly on the anti side of everything, particularly if it is 
spectacular and there is some kind of confrontation involved. 
Most of the material put forward by the media on the subject of 
wildlife management is so distorted that it is almost 
embarrassing when people take a look at what the real facts are.
<P>
	There is a desperate need for government to understand and 
provide public support for wildlife management through 
organized sportsmen. It is a positive thing if done the right way. 
Because of course we are always concerned in the nineties about 
being gender neutral or gender specific or whatever it is to 
express ourselves correctly, let me say that I was in a home in 
my constituency just a couple of weeks ago and was admiring 
some of the beautiful trophy animals they had mounted there. I 
was about to compliment the husband on that when it turned out 
that indeed the wife was the person who had gone out and done 
such an excellent job. I recognize that it is a growing sport and a 
growing interest no matter what a person's gender. Across 
Canada the impact of a century of hunting, trapping and sports 
fishing is quite well documented. As a matter of fact most 
wildlife species are more abundant now than they were 75 years 
ago.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	These species are all more abundant: the elk, the moose, the 
buffalo, antelope, mule deer, beaver, sea otter. As a matter of 
fact on Monday in this House when I was speaking on the 
migratory birds act I mentioned that in one part of my 
constituency they have very much an overabundance of grizzly 
bears. I suggest that probably the reason those bears are thriving 
as they are, even in an active logging operation area, is because 
many  of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3900"> 3900 </A></B>
<P>
the loggers are hunters and fishers and support this kind of 
wildlife and outdoor activity.
<P>
	Most rod and gun clubs stand for scientific resource 
management. They oppose management by lobby. Resource 
decisions rather than political ones should be made on the basis 
of scientific evidence. We must manage more intensely as 
population expands. Those who use the resource are the ones 
who really work for it on the grounds of purchasing and 
enhancing habitat for all species. Many funds are set up exactly 
for that purpose.
<P>
	I stand in support of the principles of Bill C-24. I believe that 
it will be an important part of the infrastructure required to give 
us the regulations or the ability to bring forward regulations that 
will help these dedicated people, indeed all Canadians, to be 
able to protect wildlife.
<P>
	There is an issue that keeps on coming up in this House and it 
is directly related to what we are talking about here. These rod 
and gun club people, these people who enjoy being out of doors, 
enhancing wildlife, indeed putting much of their own blood, 
sweat and tears into preserving and protecting wildlife also are 
hunters and they are under attack. They are very much under 
attack at this particular time.
<P>
	These are people who join these wildlife organizations, pay 
their dues, not only as membership fees, but pay their dues in 
terms of their time and energy and effort.
<P>
	These people currently are under attack by many different, 
probably well meaning people across Canada. I cite as an 
example one organization that purports to have ``over 5,000 
Canadians'' count as individual supporters of this particular 
organization.
<P>
	Let us compare this organization to the wildlife or rod and gun 
club organizations. I read from their bylaws where they say 
there shall be no membership fees or dues unless otherwise 
directed by the board of directors.
<P>
	What kind of commitment is there on the part of these people 
when they will not even put up their membership fee to be part of 
this lobby group to go after people who are currently enjoying 
the out of doors and the whole area of recreation in the wild.
<P>
	At the risk of perhaps putting too many things together, I also 
suggest that on the same page I read and I quote: ``Members 
shall apply for admission as such by completing a membership 
application,'' this is important, ``in such form as the board may 
from time to time approve or by otherwise representing to the 
corporation in a manner satisfactory to the directors that they 
are interested in furthering the objects of the corporation''.
<P>
	I am not a legal person. I have never been involved with the 
law but when I read this I say to myself that if I wanted to 
increase my membership list and I was not charging 
membership fees anyway, I would put out a petition in support of 
the objects of my corporation.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	When I receive this back under these terms and conditions, 
obviously these people are interested in furthering the objects of 
the corporation which is the ban of all guns.
<P>
	I suggest that when we compare the level of commitment of 
the people, the lobby, that is currently going after the 
law-abiding citizens who are members of rod and gun clubs who 
enjoy the out of doors to the commitment of the people who are 
spending time in the bush, who are going out and are enhancing 
our environment and protecting our environment, obviously 
they come down on one side and not the other.
<P>
	Further to that, yesterday I took part in a meeting between our 
party and this coalition and other supporters of the coalition. I 
was absolutely astounded to find that one of the people there 
said that we needed gun control to prevent suicide. Really, if our 
society is currently toying with the idea of legalizing doctor 
assisted suicide, what in the world are we doing on the other side 
of the coin harassing legitimate gun owners all in the name of 
stopping or trying to prevent suicide?
<P>
	I stand in support of Bill C-24. I restate that I stand in support 
of the principles of Bill C-24 because I stand in support of 
Canadians who are going out into the bush and making our 
environment better. I support them in every way. They are the 
people who make Canada Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have listened all 
afternoon with great interest to my colleagues, the hon. 
members for Moncton, Terrebonne, Comox-Alberni, 
Davenport and Frontenac, York-Simcoe and Kootenay East.
<P>
	I share the concern they have made known with regard to Bill 
C-24 and Canada's natural heritage. I hope I might add a little 
something in the way of information to the debate. I will be 
brief.
<P>
	Wildlife has helped shape Canada's identity. Wildlife related 
activity as the last speaker has just pointed out is a cherished 
recreational activity for a large number of Canadians. For native 
Canadians, wildlife harvesting is a vital component of an age old 
but sustainable lifestyle. For Canada's economy, as we have 
heard, wildlife activities make a contribution measured in the 
billions of dollars.
<P>
	All these are cogent reasons why we should protect Canada's 
wildlife. We shall be better able to do so with passage of the bill 
now before the House amending Canada's wildlife act. The 
amendments bring the act into line with our latest understanding 
of wildlife, with the latest international agreements, particularly 
the North American water fowl management plan, the Ramsar 
convention on wetlands of international importance and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3901"> 3901 </A></B>
<P>
global convention on biological diversity and with the planned 
Canadian biodiversity strategy.
<P>
	This modified act will recognize that an ecosystem approach 
is the best way of protecting wildlife. In other words, we can 
save wildlife by saving the habitat on which they depend. One of 
the key ways which our country is doing this is by establishing 
national wildlife areas or NWAs under the Canada Wildlife Act.
<P>
	The purpose of these areas is to conserve essential habitat for 
migratory birds and other species, especially endangered 
wildlife. At present there are 45 national wildlife areas covering 
approximately 287,000 hectares of habitat. Another six sites 
have been designated to become NWAs.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	National wildlife areas exist or are planned in all provinces 
and territories except Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island. 
These areas protect a wide variety of critical habitats.
<P>
	In British Columbia the wetlands of the Alaksen NWA and the 
Fraser River estuary are an internationally significant stop-over 
point and wintering area for large numbers of migrating birds.
<P>
	On the other side of the country Pointe de l'Est is one of the 
few remaining nesting sites in Quebec for the piping plover, a 
bird listed as endangered in Canada.
<P>
	At the Suffield NWA in Alberta the short grass prairie and 
sand dunes are home to the burrowing owl and the ferruginous 
hawk, both threatened species. Part of the endangered Arctic 
population of bowhead whales frequents Isabella Bay in the 
Northwest Territories, the site of a proposed marine NWA. In 
this case the opportunity to extend the boundaries beyond the 12 
nautical mile limit of this NWA depends directly on the passage 
of this bill now before the House.
<P>
	For each of these areas the Canadian Wildlife Service 
conducts public consultations as an integral step to preparing a 
management plan. The plan specifies which activities are to be 
allowed under permit within the NWA, for example, perhaps oil 
drilling, livestock grazing, or haying. The management plan 
may also specify how to improve habitat in such ways as 
planting native plants to provide food and cover for wildlife or 
digging ponds to make the landscape more inviting to 
waterfowl.
<P>
	Conservation is the main purpose of the national wildlife 
areas but it is not the only one. Under the Canada Wildlife Act 
public education and research, as the hon. member for 
Davenport pointed out, are also goals.
<P>
	In most NWAs visitors are allowed to hike, canoe, take photos 
and watch birds. Traditional uses may be allowed to continue. 
Some management plans provide for trapping, hunting and 
fishing. All these activities are carefully regulated to prevent 
declines in wildlife population levels and deterioration of 
habitats.
<P>
	In some NWAs research takes precedence. For example, at 
Scotch Bonnet Island NWA on Lake Ontario access is restricted 
because the island is used for long term studies of the effects that 
environmental contaminants in the food chain have on wild 
birds in the great lakes.
<P>
	At Polar Bear Pass in the Northwest Territories as well as at 
other NWAs the focus is on archaeological and biological 
research.
<P>
	Many of the sites protected as national wildlife areas have 
also been accorded international recognition. Cap Tormente in 
Quebec is one of several NWAs that are also wetlands of 
international importance under the Ramsar convention. The 
Shepody NWA in New Brunswick is a western hemisphere 
shorebird reserve.
<P>
	This international recognition shows that the world 
community appreciates the value of our national wildlife areas. 
This House must do the same by passing the amendments now 
under consideration.
<P>
	NWAs also involve key partners outside the federal 
government in the work to conserve our wildlife by conserving 
wildlife habitat. They are managed by the federal government in 
co-operation with provincial and territorial authorities as well 
as non-governmental organizations.
<P>
	Some important areas have been protected thanks to 
donations and leases from the Nature Conservancy and other 
non-government partners through land transfers from other 
government agencies or with the help of funds from other 
habitat protection programs such as those of Wildlife Habitat 
Canada and the North American wildlife management plan. 
Recently the establishment of NWAs has been a part of land 
claim settlements reached with aboriginal groups.
<P>
	All these groups have become involved because they know 
that while wildlife needs our protection, Canada equally needs 
our wildlife. This is a part of our heritage, a part of our present 
and it must be part of our future.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	As we work to make the transition to sustainable development 
we know that we must safeguard the health of our environment 
as a way of ensuring our prosperity. Wildlife provides one of the 
best indicators of environmental health. The signs are that we 
must do still more on its behalf because such actions ultimately 
benefit us all.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3902"> 3902 </A></B>
<P>
	That is why I strongly support the amendments to the Canada 
Wildlife Act. It will extend our ability to protect wildlife 
throughout Canada and in the oceans which wash our shores. 
This is in the interest of all Canadians. I urge hon. members 
to support this measure and give it swift passage.

	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry) </B>moved that Bill 
C-12, an Act to amend the Canada Business Corporations Act 
and to make consequential amendments to other acts, be read a 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to begin 
debate on second reading of Bill C-12, an Act to amend the 
Canada Business Corporations Act and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts.
<P>
	As a piece of federal framework legislation, the Canada 
Business Corporations Act helps promote the competitiveness 
of Canadian businesses. It is a key element of our national 
economic union and our internal market. The act must be kept 
up-to-date so that the government can use modern technology 
to provide better services and to improve administrative 
efficiency. It must also respond to the emerging challenges of a 
rapidly evolving global market.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This new law must be fair. The Canada Business Corporations 
Act will continue to provide a practical balance of interests 
among shareholders, creditors, management and the public.
<P>
	This House will recall that the CBCA came into force on 
December 15, 1975 in order to revise and reform the law 
applicable to companies incorporated to carry on business 
throughout Canada. At that time the CBCA was heralded as an 
exemplary act, a model to be followed in Canada and abroad. 
For nearly 20 years it has acted as a model and promoted order 
and fairness in the corporate environment.
<P>
	The CBCA is important to the competitive position of small 
and medium sized businesses as well as for the many large 
corporations registered under it. Over half of the top 500 
companies in Canada are registered under the Canada Business 
Corporations Act. Approximately 190,000 corporations in 
Canada are covered by the provisions of the act.
<P>
	However, after nearly two decades we need to update the 
provisions of the CBCA. Business practices and legal 
developments in a number of areas such as shareholder 
communications and the roles and responsibilities of directors 
have evolved considerably since the act was originally passed.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	Corporations today must take into account the intensified 
competition of an international marketplace and the 
globalization of capital markets. Our framework laws must take 
into account increased share ownership by institutional 
investors and the holdings of shares through intermediaries.
<P>
	The Canada Business Corporations Act must keep pace with 
the changes that are driving the competitiveness of Canadian 
industry. It must be amended to ensure that it will continue to be 
a useful tool for Canadian businesses and a model for others to 
follow.
<P>
	The legislation before us today represents the first of two 
phases that will reform the framework legislation which governs 
federally incorporated businesses. We are introducing these 
amendments now so we can move quickly on a number of 
technical but important reforms. They represent a first step in 
renewing the CBCA. They will be followed by more substantive 
revisions after consultations with all interested parties.
<P>
	Hon. members will note that the legislation before us provides 
for a parliamentary review of the CBCA within three years. We 
intend to introduce substantive amendments when the act comes 
up for review. Hopefully we will be in a position within 18 
months to proceed with the review, but at the very latest we will 
have an opportunity to review the need for further amendments 
within three years.
<P>
	In the meantime, Industry Canada will consult extensively 
with those who have a stake in the CBCA. We have prepared a 
consultation package and hope to complete our consultations 
and have draft recommendations ready for review by the 
government within 18 months.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The phase II consultation package deals with such issues as 
the liability of corporate directors, shareholders 
communications and other substantive issues. The package has 
been submitted to interested Canadians, including corporate 
executives, corporate law experts, institutional investors, 
shareholders' representatives, the accounting profession, 
business associations and other stakeholders.
<P>
	After we have heard back from those who have a stake in 
reforming the CBCA, we will recommend to Parliament further 
amendments to the act to reflect business and community needs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to emphasize that the legislation before us is a 
necessary first step. It enables the government to proceed with 
some important technical changes to the CBCA while we 
prepare for more substantive revisions. The primary objectives 
of the legislation before us lie in four areas and I would like to go 
over each of these briefly.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3903"> 3903 </A></B>
<P>
	First of all, the legislation provides for improved service to 
federally incorporated companies. It brings the CBCA in line 
with technological advances and permits the introduction of 
more equal service across the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the years that have passed since the CBCA came into effect, 
technology has revolutionized the way in which business is 
conducted. The drafters of the 1975 legislation could not have 
foreseen the day when, for example, fax machines would be used 
to transmit key corporate documents. They could not have 
known that, within a few decades, electronic data interchange 
would have the potential of reducing the paper burden for 
business.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I must confess that in my days of practising law here in 
Ottawa it was quite convenient to act as Ottawa agents for firms 
across the country as we delivered and collected documents 
from the corporations branch of the then consumer and 
corporate affairs department.
<P>
	I suppose I really ought to apologize to some of my former 
colleagues still in practice in Ottawa that we are now making it 
possible for firms across Canada to deliver their documents 
directly and electronically.
<P>
	My friend from Toronto says ``hear, hear''. The one benefit of 
the old rules was that we found ways to collect fees from Toronto 
law firms.
<P>
	The director who administers the CBCA through the 
corporations directorate of Industry Canada receives a variety of 
notices and documents from corporations, directors, 
shareholders and others.
<P>
	Many representatives of CBCA corporations have requested 
that facsimile transmission and electronic filing and issuance of 
documents be permitted under the act. The CBCA director has 
begun to accept some documents transmitted by facsimile, but 
there are certain impediments in the existing act to the use of 
modern technology.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	The amendments before us provide broad regulatory making 
power to prescribe the form and other details of electronic filing 
and issuance of documents. They authorize the CBCA director 
to deal with the technical details. These changes will result in 
eventual same day incorporation from all regions of Canada, not 
just the national capital region, thus again saving money to 
industry across the country.
<P>
	CBCA corporations and others will have easier access to the 
information that the corporations directorate provides.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to emphasize that while we want to amend the act 
in order to better enable the corporations directorate to keep 
abreast of modern information technology, clients will still be 
able to use paper-based communications if they prefer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The second broad area that the amendments before us address 
is the need to simplify certain corporate government procedures 
and record keeping and filing requirements. For example, the 
amendments will permit current directors to appoint a limited 
number of directors in the time between shareholders meetings 
if the corporation's articles so provide. While shareholder 
democracy is safeguarded by the limits placed on this power, the 
change will give CBCA corporations the flexibility to react 
quickly and with less expense to unforeseen events.
<P>
	Under the amendments shareholders can also elect a reduced 
number of directors at the same shareholders meeting that they 
approve the reduction. As the law now stands shareholders can 
vote to reduce the minimum number of directors but must wait 
until the next meeting to elect that reduced number of directors.
<P>
	Another amendment would permit the CBCA director to 
exempt the filing of specified classes of documents when they 
are publicly available elsewhere. This will reduce the burden of 
multiple filings of certain documents and thus the costs incurred 
by CBCA corporations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In keeping with the trend towards reducing paper and 
administrative costs for users of the CBCA, the amendments 
will establish a six-year period for which accounting records 
and files must be retained. Currently, the CBCA gives no 
direction to corporations as to how long such records must be 
maintained.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The amendments will eliminate public financial disclosure 
now imposed on large, privately held CBCA corporations while 
maintaining disclosure to shareholders. The CBCA currently 
requires public disclosure of the financial statements of 
privately held CBCA corporations whose assets exceed $5 
million or whose gross revenues exceed $10 million.
<P>
	Mandatory public disclosure of financial statements of large 
private corporations is not required by the provinces, nor is it 
required by the laws of our major trading partner, the United 
States. The CBCA therefore places federally incorporated 
companies at a competitive disadvantage and increases their 
compliance costs. This may discourage foreign businesses from 
establishing in Canada, certainly under federal jurisdiction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3904"> 3904 </A></B>
<P>
	Shareholders of privately held companies will continue to be 
protected because an audit can only be waived if all 
shareholders agree. Financial statements will still be prepared 
and sent to shareholders in any event.
<P>
	Financial statements of all corporations, not just those that 
are federally incorporated, must be disclosed to Statistics 
Canada through other legislation such as the Corporations and 
Labour Unions Returns Act. This information is publicly 
available on an aggregate basis.
<P>
	The third broad theme of these technical amendments is 
clarification. Some amendments have been introduced to clarify 
the language of certain sections of the CBCA through changes to 
the French or English versions or through the use of better 
terminology. For example, revised definitions of control and 
subsidiary are proposed in order to capture the whole chain of 
corporations under the ultimate control of a holding 
corporation, thus simplifying amalgamations and financial 
assistance within corporate groups.
<P>
	Finally, the fourth area addressed by the bill before us is 
efficient administration. The act now requires that before an 
administrative dissolution of a corporation can take place the 
CBCA director must give notice of the decision to dissolve a 
corporation in, among other things, a local newspaper.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	By removing this requirement for publication in a local 
newspaper the CBCA director will be able to move 
expeditiously against defaulting corporations. This will help 
encourage companies to comply with the public information 
filing provisions of the law. Also, the government will avoid a 
publication cost of almost $1 million over the next few years.
<P>
	The amendment will not affect the statutory requirement to 
notify directly the corporation in default and each director 
personally, nor the requirement to publish notices in the <I>Canada 
Gazette</I> and the <I>Canada Corporations Bulletin</I>.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To promote effective administration, the amendments before 
us also include provisions to strengthen the CBCA rules 
governing corporate names. For example, under one proposed 
amendment, corporations will be prohibited from using words 
such as ``Limited'', ``Limitée'' and ``Corporation'' in names 
other than their corporate names.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Industry Canada is committed to the continued modernization 
of the CBCA. We will proceed with the technical amendments of 
the kind I have outlined today. In the meantime we will continue 
to work with the Canadian business and professional 
communities to design more substantive changes to the law. Our 
overall objective is to help the conduct of business in Canada 
and to contribute to the competitiveness of federal corporations.
<P>
	The amendments before the house render the CBCA more 
efficient. They simplify filing and record keeping requirements 
and certain corporate grievance procedures and they allow for 
technological innovation.
<P>
	They also allow for improved service to corporations 
governed by the CBCA by reducing overall paper burden and the 
cost of compliance under the act. Overall they make the CBCA a 
more useful instrument to businesses and investors who use it.
<P>
	This government is committed to helping small and medium 
sized Canadian business. We want the CBCA to serve Canadian 
businesses in their bid to become competitive at home and 
internationally.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	They also allow for improved service to corporations 
governed by the CBCA by reducing paper burden and the cost of 
compliance with the Act. Overall, they make the CBCA a more 
useful instrument for businesses and investors who use it.
<P>
	I hope that my hon. colleagues from both sides of the House 
will join me in supporting this legislation and in helping ensure 
its speedy passage. Thank you.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I know late in the afternoon it is hard to find enthusiasm for a 
bill on the Canada Business Corporations Act and I do find 
myself concerned that I will contribute further to my generally 
perceived image of being rather dull and boring. However, it is 
the best we can do with the Canada Business Corporations Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before giving the floor to the hon. 
member for Trois-Rivières, I must make a statement concerning 
the time reserved for Private Members' Business tomorrow, 
May 5. The hon. member for Haldimand-Norfolk has informed 
me in writing that he could not present his motion during private 
members' hour tomorrow.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Since it has not been possible to arrange an exchange of 
positions in the order of precedence under Standing Order 
94(2)(a), I must direct the table officers to drop the item of 
business to the bottom of the order of precedence.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 94(2)(b), Private Members' Hour 
will thus be suspended tomorrow unfortunately and the House 
will continue with the business before it prior to Private 
Members' Hour.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to participate in this debate and I agree with the 
minister when he says that this bill may be part of the 
government strategy to sometimes be dull and boring. Indeed, 
this is not a romantic piece of legislation, and it does not 
generate a lot of controversy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3905"> 3905 </A></B>
<P>
	As you know, Bill C-12 is an act to amend the Canada 
Business Corporations Act and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, this legislation purports to amend the Canada 
Business Corporations Act. It allows for the implementation of 
technological innovations such as electronic filing and 
facsimile transmission of documents, it simplifies certain 
statutory procedures and record-keeping and filing 
requirements, and it makes the administration of the Act more 
effective.
<P>
	Its object is to modernize the federal Canada Business 
Corporations Act. This act, which was passed in 1975, is a 
commercial law regulating about 190,000 Canadian businesses 
which were incorporated under it.
<P>
	Half of the 500 largest businesses in the country were 
incorporated under that legislation. The government wants to 
amend the act in two stages, Bill C-12 being the first of those 
two stages.
<P>
	A review of this legislation shows, as we in the opposition see 
it, four major changes which will allow businesses to improve 
their operations from a technical point of view.
<P>
	The first of these changes is the fact that businesses will now 
be able to use electronic means to transmit documents. This 
should facilitate communication between businesses and the 
department.
<P>
	Another provision allows current directors to appoint, under 
certain circumstances and if the rules of the corporation so 
provide, a limited number of directors. It must be pointed out 
that until now shareholders were the only ones who could 
appoint the directors.
<P>
	The third change is to the effect that, from now on, companies 
will have to keep official documents such as accounting records 
and files for a minimum of six years. Obviously, we agree that 
this measure should help reduce the paper burden, but we 
wonder if a period of six years is sufficiently long.
<P>
	Finally, privately-held corporations will no longer have to 
disclose financial information. This measure is criticized by the 
Order of Chartered Accountants, which worries about the 
impact it will have on the accounting profession. We must also 
realize that this measure will remove an injustice that may have 
existed before, in that provincially licensed companies had an 
unfair advantage because they did not have to disclose such 
information; federally licensed companies will now have the 
same status.
<P>
	It is not easy to take position on such a slim bill. However, we 
must realize that, like other bills, it will take up a great deal of 
time and energy. That is why opposition members feel 
uncomfortable with this bill because there is still so much to do. 
There is so much to do with regards to the economy, to small and 
medium sized businesses and their development, that the 
government is not doing. Let us take, for instance, the  paper 
burden small and medium sized businesses especially must 
carry, just to serve the government.
<P>
	According to some studies, these businesses spend one out of 
five days dealing with government red tape. The government is 
aware of that, as it acknowledges in the red book. On April 28, 
the Minister of Industry announced a 29-member committee 
would be set up to study the issue of red tape among other things. 
As everyone knows, including the officials of his department, 
there have been numerous reports and the solution proposed by 
the government-it is like a reflex of this government-is to 
form a committee to study the issue; 29 people from coast to 
coast will consider the issue of government red tape. It is a waste 
of time.
<P>
	Some adjustments would probably be easy to make, however. 
Knowing how competent federal public servants are, they could 
consult with their provincial counterparts, including those from 
Quebec, who are very competent.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	Adjustments could be made to the program, and the procedure 
that companies must follow for exports, for example, could be 
simplified. Why not try to come up with ways to make it easier 
for small and medium sized businesses and others to export, 
which is vital for the economic development of Canada and 
Quebec? Why not refine what is offered to small and 
medium-sized businesses to encourage research and 
development? The Liberal Party of Canada made a big issue of it 
in the red book.
<P>
	Why not ask officials, without striking a committee, to find 
ways of streamlining the forms, of reducing the delays in order 
to help small and medium sized businesses effectively, tangibly, 
pragmatically to do research and development? We know how 
complicated it is; I worked on it before. It is extremely 
complicated for a company to qualify for research and 
development tax credits, for example.
<P>
	Easy ways must be found to help companies in that regard, 
just see to it. Companies must be helped to find ways to 
modernize their equipment, to give them the training that exists 
on the market to increase their productivity, to be more 
competitive internationally. Everything must be done to ensure 
that companies take the total-quality approach more and more. 
This is essential if we want our companies to be recognized, 
both here as subcontractors and internationally. Today, with ISO 
9000, there is an international standard to help make sense of all 
the complexity in the world and to identify the companies 
considered qualified by a third party and those that are not. All 
our companies must be encouraged to come up to the ISO 
standard.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3906"> 3906 </A></B>
<P>
	Even more serious, not only do we see no government interest 
or concern for these small things, which could really turn the 
situation around for small and medium-sized businesses if the 
government cared. Not only do we not sense any willingness 
on the part of the government, but we are moving backwards 
in areas such as military conversion programs, about which the 
government was very eloquent in its red book and made a lot 
of commitments. However, not a word about conversion was 
said by the minister, in the Throne Speech or in the budget 
speech, even though there are areas, in Quebec for example, 
where the military industry is very important. We will address 
the issue of the military industry tomorrow. The military 
industry must be revamped everywhere in the West, because of 
the evolution of the geo-political situation. As everyone knows, 
the Cold War is over, at least in the form we have known it until 
now.
<P>
	We must make some adjustments to help industries move 
from military to civilian production, but there is no 
co-operation in this area. The government does not seem to be 
really concerned, since all it did was skim over the issue in some 
of its speeches. However, we have companies in Quebec, like 
Oerlikon and Paramax, which are in trouble. They have lashed 
out against the government. They cried for help again fifteen 
days ago. Help us, because if you do not and we do not get any 
more military contracts, thousands and thousands of jobs will be 
lost. Only in Quebec, the military industry has already lost 
11,000 jobs in the last five years. These were high tech, high 
paid, and high-knowledge jobs. That is not the kind of jobs we 
can afford to lose in Canada and in Quebec, where the economy 
is already staggering, as we all know.
<P>
	The situation with MIL Davie is also very important for the 
Quebec City area. If I am not mistaken, it is the largest company 
in the Quebec City area and it depends on government contracts. 
It needs the help of the federal government through a project that 
would meet a need, and I am talking here about the Magdalen 
Islands ferry. There is also another project, the smart ship 
project, which is important for the future of Quebec and Canada. 
Among other things, this multifunctional ship will be used to 
help settle regional conflicts as well as for UN peacekeeping 
missions. These projects should be a priority, but the 
government does not seem to have the political will to move on 
them.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	This is an issue, and not only the Bloc Quebecois says it, since 
the Quebec Minister of Industry, Commerce and Technology, 
although he may be a Liberal and a federalist, has recently 
denounced the Liberal government by saying: ``You see, you 
even wrote it in the red book''. I heard it with my own ears on the 
radio. He was alluding to some form of political will by saying 
that it was nice to have written it, but what was behind  the text? 
Where is the political will? We have not heard anything about 
that since.
<P>
	It is not crying wolf to talk about this issue and to repeat that, 
if we do not do anything, we should be aware that we might have 
another brain drain, as we did in the late 1950s. Meanwhile, the 
Americans are developing their economy, they are here, they are 
everywhere, they are the giants and, as with the Avro Arrow in 
the late 1950s, they will come and get the best people from 
Canada and Quebec to develop their economy.
<P>
	Another issue where we are going backwards is the fight 
against unemployment and the so-called job creation. Drawing 
from the red book, the government implemented the 
infrastructure program, indeed, $6 million in Canadian 
investments, including $2 million from the federal government. 
This program is supposed to be the main action and, so far, is the 
only one coming from this government to fight unemployment. 
The number of unemployed stands at 1.6 million, and this 
program will create 45,000 jobs. We must suspect that a very 
good number of these infrastructure jobs are seasonal, 
temporary jobs such as repairing sewers, roads and bridges. This 
will create many temporary jobs; of the 45,000 jobs created they 
say that 15,000 will go to Quebec.
<P>
	They have nothing more to say and quite the contrary they 
brag about it. Weeks and months are passing by and this is all 
they have been able to find. They see this as a panacea and they 
think that this will solve the problem of 1.6 million unemployed. 
It is a shame to have so little imagination, to lack that much of 
the courage required to find another solution. I find this 
outrageous.
<P>
	If there were a political will, there is an initiative that could 
go ahead readily, whatever the Prime Minister thinks of it, and 
that initiative is the high speed train. The project, which would 
link Quebec City, Trois-Rivières, and Windsor, could go ahead 
immediately but the government went wrong in that case. 
During the election campaign, the Bloc Quebecois supported the 
cancellation of the helicopters contract and everyone agreed to 
that. There was nevertheless something implied in what the 
leader of the Bloc Quebecois, the member for Lac Saint-Jean, 
said. It was that we should take the necessary steps in order that 
the expertise and all the budgets allocated to the helicopters be 
used for immediate and imminent development of the 
high-speed train. The government retained a part of the 
suggestion, since it cancelled the helicopters contract but as a 
result, thousands of workers lost their jobs.
<P>
	I do not think this is the way to go to ensure economic 
development. We should note, and this is not coming from us but 
from the president of VIA Rail who said last week, and he should 
know what he is talking about, that the HST would create 
127,000 jobs over a period of 10 years. Furthermore, according 
to the scenario favoured by the president of VIA Rail, this would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3907"> 3907 </A></B>
<P>
require  absolutely no additional funds from the federal 
government.
<P>
	That project would have many technological spin-offs and 
create jobs of all types, high technology or more simple ones, in 
all regions of Ontario and Quebec. Its impacts would be highly 
beneficial, mainly, as you have guessed I am sure, in the St. 
Maurice Valley, if first, it is implemented, second, the line is 
built on the north shore and third, the HST stops in my riding, in 
the regional capital of Trois-Rivières.
<P>
	The third issue, and this one is dramatic because we can even 
talk about negligence in this case, concerns pharmaceutical 
products; the influence of lobbies is felt everywhere, most of all 
the lobby of Ontario members and ministers from the Toronto 
area.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	There are two types of drug manufacturers, those who create 
new drugs and do research and development, and generic drug 
manufacturers, who copy existing drugs. Most of the first ones 
are located in Quebec where they do research and development.
<P>
	Last Monday, I met a representative of the Canadian Drug 
Manufacturers Association. You need to know that it takes from 
10 to 12 years to develop a new drug, before it is certified, 
licensed, tested and what not. I am told that it costs an average of 
$360 million to develop a new drug.
<P>
	That industry is concentrated in Quebec. Bill C-91 was 
passed under the former government with the support of the 
Bloc Quebecois and over the opposition of the Liberal Party of 
Canada, although that party was divided over the issue. I could 
come back to that later. That bill extended to 20 years patent 
protection for drugs developed by those innovative companies. 
New drugs cannot be copied.
<P>
	The proposal before us would provide for an immediate 
review of Bill C-91 even though the bill itself specifies such a 
review will not take place before 1997. And this, again, much to 
the dismay of the Quebec Minister of Industry, Commerce and 
Technology, being the federalist and Liberal that he is, who was 
reported in <I>Le Devoir</I> on April 28, 1994, as saying: ``The federal 
government's decision to review the legislation protecting drug 
patents for 20 years is creating uncertainty and its 
indecisiveness is scaring away potential investors in the 
strategic sector of pharmaceuticals. A $50 million investment 
was to be announced last week but was postponed owing to the 
federal government's indecisiveness''.
<P>
	The Quebec manufacturers' association strongly opposed any 
attempt by the federal government to review this act.
<P>
	Finally, I will quote from <I>La Presse</I>, which is hardly 
sovereigntist and neither is its editor, Mr. Alain Dubuc, who 
wrote in an editorial comment yesterday: ``The research 
investments matter is neither a joke nor a multinational piece of 
cake. The Trudeau era policy''-this should ring a bell for the 
members opposite-``of eliminating patents was a disaster. 
Canada's pharmaceutical industry literally dies away, with 
research funding dropping to 3 per cent of sales, as compared to 
approximately 14 per cent in the United States, France and 
Germany. Bill C-22, which repaired the blunder, was a success; 
from 1987 to 1991, companies invested nearly $1 million, half 
of which in Quebec-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fontana:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. We all 
appreciate this history lesson but I thought we were on Bill C-12 
regarding the business corporations act. I am sorry, I do not see 
the relevance whatsoever of the member's comments with 
regard to Bills C-91 and C-22. I thought we were talking about 
Bill C-12.
<P>
	I wonder, Mr. Speaker, if you could direct the member to 
speak to the bill before this House.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I think that is the first time the 
relevance rule has been raised in this Parliament, as least when I 
have been in the chair, and it is a rule that the parliamentary 
secretary will know is observed more in the breach than in the 
respect.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member who had the floor could speak to the 
point, that is the bill presently before us.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to demonstrate that 
the government should have other priorities than Bill C-12 and 
should not tackle such things as reviewing the pharmaceutical 
legislation the way they have been doing. That is the point I want 
to make, and they are not through hearing about it. As far as I am 
concerned, I am not through talking about it.
<P>
	Bill C-22, which was tabled before Bill C-91 and cleared the 
air, was a success. Between 1987 and 1991, companies invested 
almost one billion dollars, half of that amount in Quebec, to 
such an extent that in 1991, research reached 9.7 per cent of 
sales in 1991 compared to the 3 per cent rate under Mr. Trudeau. 
While this is a marked improvement, it does not make up for lost 
ground.
<P>
	How can a country complaining because it is lagging behind 
in research by contrast to other countries and also because it is 
not part of some high tech industries manage without one of the 
major high tech industries? The red book recognizes that our 
research is lagging behind. I will come back to that later.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3908"> 3908 </A></B>
<P>
	We will not give up on the issue of pharmaceutical patents, 
which is critically important for Quebec. In fact, the 
pharmaceutical industry typefies Quebec industry. It is one of 
our finest industries, and we will not let the lobbying of 
members from Ontario, especially from Toronto, lower Quebec 
economy to such an extent.
<P>
	I think that something happened last week, when my 
colleague, the member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie, quoted 
Confucius when responding to the minister of Industry who 
himself had quoted Shakespeare, a bit nastily, I must say.
<P>
	The member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie quoted Confucius 
and said: ``Culture is like jam; the less you have, the more you 
spread it''. That struck me. I thought about it last week, if I 
remember well, while working on my lawn. I wondered why my 
colleague for Laurier-Sainte-Marie had quoted Confucius in 
those terms. After having given this matter much thought, I 
finally realized that it contained a message, a subliminal 
message. There was something symbolic about it. By ``jam'', he 
meant ``in a jam''. In a jam because of the failure of the 
government. Failure, especially if you make a report card after 
six months. I believe the government is celebrating that 
anniversary of its official and legal victory.
<P>
	If you take a look at the situation, I think ``in a jam'' is the 
right expression. Let us recall, for instance, the issue of 
cigarette smuggling. Without the determination of the Official 
Opposition, we might still be discussing this whole issue. In the 
meantime, smuggling was flourishing in Quebec, resulting in 
loss of revenues for the government-which, in itself, was 
terrible enough. Also, because of civil disobedience, a whole 
climate was created where everything was challenged-our 
institutions, the role of the government, respect of the law, even 
social peace.
<P>
	The government argued that there was no evidence of 
smuggling. It took weeks, but the opposition did not let go, and 
finally the government took the necessary measures.
<P>
	Take another example, the Collège militaire royal de 
Saint-Jean. Here again, I want to show you-in case the member 
does not understand -that there are more important things to do 
than discussing minor bills such as this one. And, in our opinion, 
when the government does act, it does not necessarily act in the 
right way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fontana:</B> Time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am allowed 40 minutes.
<P>
	When the government acts, we know the results.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> A fine mess, a jam.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau: </B>Yes, the military college was another fine 
mess. The Liberal government is forced to admit they have 
neither the desire nor the money to maintain the only 
francophone military training institution in America.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	In tomorrow's Canada, in order to receive military training, 
francophones will have to go to a most anglophone city-which 
is all right-that has no facilities to make them feel welcome. 
The government say they have no choice. They have neither the 
desire nor the money to go on. That gives an idea of the Canada 
in which Quebecers will have to live, if they decide to remain a 
part of it.
<P>
	What can we say about social program reform besides saying 
that again the government is in a jam? When one is obviously 
and deliberately taking it out not on unemployment but on the 
unemployed, not on poverty but on the poor, when the only thing 
we know about the government is that they will consult for two 
years-only to cut $7.5 billion in social programs at the end of 
the consultations, the situation is serious! When it is the 
unemployed and not unemployment, and the poor as opposed to 
poverty that are attacked, I say we are in a jam!
<P>
	As for manpower training, the federal government stubbornly 
wants to keep jurisdiction over it. However, everybody in 
Quebec, employers as well as union leaders, school board 
members, Department of Education or Quebec government 
officials, whether federalist or not, everybody agrees that 
vocational training should be entirely under Quebec 
jurisdiction. But no, the government, for reasons known only to 
itself, is stubbornly hanging on to manpower training, after a 
two-year study involving goodness knows who, whereas 
everyone in Quebec is saying that it should withdraw from this 
area.
<P>
	The last issue has to do not only with the government 
opposite, but with the federal system as well. I will not hide the 
fact that for sovereigntists like myself, it is very good news 
indeed to know what the rules of the game are in this country. 
The Supreme Court has just given us some idea of what they are 
with its ruling on telephony and communications where it said 
that however distinct Quebec might be, it had no rights over this 
field.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fontana:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I know 
that this member may not have much respect for this institution 
but I am sure he would have respect for the Speaker.
<P>
	I thought I heard the Speaker give some guidance to this 
member and ask him to stick to the subject matter which is Bill 
C-12. That is what we are discussing today. Opposition day is 
tomorrow. There are plenty of opportunities in this House for 
this member to speak about anything else he would like.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3909"> 3909 </A></B>
<P>
	Surely Canadians, taxpayers, who are watching this 
institution would expect that the hon. member would respect 
the wishes of the Chair and stick to the subject matter we are 
discussing today, Bill C-12, and not ramble on about 
everything that this House has done or will do in the foreseeable 
future.
<P>
	Again, Mr. Speaker, I ask for your guidance for this member 
who just does not seem to get it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Hon. colleagues, as I said a while ago, 
it is extremely difficult to say whether a comment pertains to the 
subject matter before the House or whether it does not. 
Therefore, I would ask all members for their co-operation in 
complying with the Standing Orders and speaking to this bill. I 
think that all members can appreciate how very difficult this 
situation can be for the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Let me congratulate my colleague on his 
intellectual rigour. It shows that he must not come to the House 
often. In fact, I have not often seen him here myself. Mr. 
Speaker, you will surely agree with me that it is difficult to 
discuss this bill for 40 minutes, given that it is a slim piece of 
legislation and, as the minister said, a rather dull and boring one 
at that. Furthermore, unless he talks nonsense, a member has a 
right to use his speaking time to discuss subjects which he 
deems to be timely.
<P>
	As I was saying, the Supreme Court handed down a ruling 
concerning telephony and communications which gives the 
federal government full jurisdiction. It is the federal system 
which is at issue here and I will not hide the fact that Quebecers 
are deeply interested in this subject.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	The federal system is at issue here. To say that 
telecommunications-telephony, for example-come under 
exclusive federal jurisdiction is to deny Quebec's 
distinctiveness, one of the key points of the Charlottetown 
Agreement, which by the way was unanimously rejected.
<P>
	In other words, for the hon. member's information, as 
Quebecers and Canadians must ponder the situation, I hope that 
Quebecers will realize that if they ever decide, in a referendum, 
to remain within Canada as a province, they will have to accept 
centralization.
<P>
	That is the conclusion to be drawn from such measures. 
Decisions concerning the military college, social program 
reform, manpower training, telephony and communications all 
reflect a growing tendency on the part of the federal government 
to centralize major powers in Ottawa, and to consider provincial 
governments henceforth as regional governments. This is the 
context in which Quebecers will be deciding, in a referendum, 
whether or not to keep Quebec in Confederation.
<P>
	In the time I have left, I want to come back more 
sensibly-my colleague will be pleased-to the issue of 
Bill-C-12. I said earlier that the government must have better 
things to do and you only have to look at all the statements and 
the promises of the red book to see what I mean. I want to quote 
what it says about research and development, technology, small 
and medium-sized businesses, and economic development. On 
page 52, it reads: ``It would also create a climate that encourages 
pre-competitive research in various sectors of the Canadian 
economy. A Liberal government will further strengthen R and 
D, especially in small and medium-sized business, by 
encouraging technology partnerships between Canadian 
universities, research institutions, and the private sector that 
emphasize the commercial applications of research and 
development''. For your information, Mr. Speaker, that is 
precisely what is going on in the pharmaceutical industry.
<P>
	Again, the red book says: ``A Liberal government will 
continue to support basic research, including the provision of 
stable funding for the granting councils, the National Research 
Council, and the Networks of Centres of Excellence''.
<P>
	It is so nice that I could go on and on. It is so very interesting 
but that goes back to last fall. Since then-and that is the 
complaint I have against this government-the government has 
not kept its promise-for which it was elected by Canadians 
from Ontario and the Maritimes, among others-but it 
introduced minor measures like Bill C-12. As I said at the 
outset, Mr. Speaker, it is a waste of time, a waste of energy and a 
waste of money to deal with such an issue.
<P>
	Reading the red book and seeing the negligence of this 
government, I am led to say that it is more and more obvious, 
and absolutely necessary, that people take charge of their own 
destiny all across Canada, and particularly in Quebec, in every 
region of Quebec.
<P>
	I want to tell you that as far as people of my riding, the riding 
of Trois-Rivières, are concerned, they have already started to do 
so. This is wonderfully exemplified by the re-opening of the 
former CIP Forest Products plant, which had closed down, 
causing the loss of 1,200 jobs, if memory serves me well. This 
plant has just re-opened, thanks to the involvement of the Fonds 
de solidarité des travailleurs du Québec; and if it has been 
re-opened, we must understand that it is because its workers had 
never given up. They made all the necessary representations, 
they made everybody aware that it was unacceptable that such a 
large plant, in a city like mine, Trois-Rivières, could close down 
for good. They managed to get the Fonds de solidarité involved. 
I take this opportunity to congratulate them for that.
<P>
	There are other areas where people of my riding have 
understood and are doing something. First of all, at the CEGEP 
of Trois-Rivières, which is famous for two things, its Centre for 
Metallurgical Technology and its Centre for Pulp and Paper 
Technology, two specialized  centres which are increasingly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3910"> 3910 </A></B>
<P>
serving the needs of metallurgical as well as pulp and paper 
industries all across Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	And secondly, at the Université du Québec in Trois-Rivières, 
there are also people with a sense of imagination and vision	who have set up a research group on small and medium-sized businesses to make sure that more universities know the problems of such businesses in order to better train young people and give assi
<P>
	In a field which has a very bright future, there is also a 
hydrogen research centre which, you have to admit, is a 
high-tech field. This hydrogen research centre is attracting 
more and more attention and, given the importance of this 
product for the future, could have a remarkable development in 
the coming years.
<P>
	Lastly, I would like to draw your attention, Mr. Speaker, to the 
fact that l'Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières is the only 
institution in all of Canada to offer a doctorate program in paper 
engineering. This is another illustration of our region's capacity 
to show its resourcefulness and its determination to take charge 
and make its presence felt more and more in Quebec as well as 
abroad.
<P>
	In closing, and my friend will be happy, I would like to talk 
about Bill C-12 and say that we all know that it is the first part of 
a two-part law, the second part of which will come in three years 
and address much more important issues related to the operation 
of small and medium-sized businesses, like the responsibility of 
directors, insider trading, for example, and take-over bids.
<P>
	It seems that these issues, and the government is still 
consulting, will be addressed in two or three years. The position 
of the Official Opposition is that we cannot oppose such a bill; 
although it is uninspiring, it is important in its technical aspects, 
and we understand that it makes technical changes which should 
improve the operation of our businesses. Consequently, the 
Official Opposition is for this bill, in spite of everything.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will address my remarks to the contents of Bill C-12. I resist 
corroborating the opinion that was expressed by the member 
opposite that if the bill is really not a major bill then it should 
not receive major debating time. If there are major points to be 
made then let us make them. However we have to be very careful 
not to abuse our privileges.
<P>
	Bill C-12 as I understand it represents amendments to the 
Canada Business Corporations Act which will govern 
approximately 190,000 Canadian federal business corporations, 
including over 50 per cent of Canada's top 500 corporations.
<P>
	This is the first phase of amendments designed to improve the 
competitiveness of Canadian business, simplify filing and 
record keeping requirements and certain corporate governance 
procedures and allow for technological innovation. The bill also 
begins the process of modernizing federal corporate law.
<P>
	Amendments to Bill C-12 are purported to be of a largely 
technical nature. While this is in essence true we feel certain 
amendments could have ramifications far beyond the technical 
level.
<P>
	We applaud those amendments to Bill C-12 that will result in 
simplifying filing and record keeping requirements and certain 
corporate governance procedures, allow for the technological 
innovation and better service to all regions of Canada, enhance 
the efficiency and effectiveness of the administration of the 
CBCA and clarify the language of the act through changes to the 
French and English versions and through the use of better 
terminology. It will promote good governance in corporate 
enterprises-at least that is what the intent is-facilitate 
efficient and flexible business management while protecting 
investors, including minority shareholders, and foster a fair and 
efficient marketplace.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	It is purported to provide flexibility for corporations to act 
quickly and with less expense to unforeseen events by 
permitting current directors to appoint a limited number of 
directors in the time between shareholder meetings, if the 
corporation's bylaws permit that to happen.
<P>
	We recognize that these measures are part of the 
government's commitment in the speech from the throne to 
focus on small and medium sized businesses. We encourage 
measures that are designed to improve the competitiveness of 
Canadian business. By encouraging internal trade within 
Canada and by helping business pursue an active international 
trade policy, we can place our federal corporations in a better 
competitive position.
<P>
	We would be pleased if the reforms that are currently within 
the amendments to the CBCA accomplish all of these 
objectives. Certain provisions however require closer scrutiny 
and should be noted.
<P>
	First, the provision to eliminate public financial disclosure 
for larger privately held corporations may allow certain public 
companies to transfer assets to private companies under their 
control and thereby avoid financial disclosures of these private 
subsidiaries.
<P>
	Sections 16 and 17 regarding financial disclosure, while 
apparently not significant to the minister, being simply of a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3911"> 3911 </A></B>
<P>
technical nature, should be recognized as a substantive 
departure from the current provisions. They  are not 
technicalities as suggested by the minister. They should be 
studied by the committee with a promise to consider moving 
them to the second part of the amendments to this act.
<P>
	Notice is hereby given as well that two other matters are of 
concern to members of our party and will be drawn to the 
attention of the committee studying the bill. They are, first, the 
new section, 258.2, which allows the director to exempt notices 
or documents from having to be sent to the director in the 
prescribed circumstances. This is potentially a very wide 
provision if the governor in council chooses to prescribe wide 
circumstances.
<P>
	We have been advised by department officials that this is 
intended to apply only to cases where documents are publicly 
available elsewhere. To make sure this is the sole reason, an 
amendment to that effect is required. The amendment could be 
something like this: ``If a notice or document is required under 
this act to be sent to the director must be made public by some 
other provision of or made pursuant to another act of Parliament 
other than this act, the director may, by order made subject to the 
condition that the other provision has been complied with and 
any other conditions the director may consider appropriate, 
exempt the notice or document from the requirement under this 
act that it be sent to the director''.
<P>
	The second amendment that ought to be looked at refers to 
section 8(2). This section provides a previously unregulated 
period for which records must be kept. The minister mentioned 
that presently the act is silent on this and that we need to 
recognize under the Income Tax Act and the provisions thereof 
that claims to be made by the minister may be made for six years 
back and the limitation on actions in contracts in most and 
maybe all provinces is six years after the cause for the action 
arises.
<P>
	In light of these provisions it seems strange to have a six year 
minimum, as longer record retention is generally mandated by 
other legislation and by common sense. It would appear to be 
better either to leave out this provision or to avoid redundancy 
and to have a longer period, say eight or ten years. Eight years 
would certainly cover the income tax provision and meet most 
contract litigation needs.
<P>
	There is a second reason why the provision which will see 
record keeping reduced to six years may be inadequate. 
Litigation procedures may be started after six years so the 
requirement should be, in our opinion, probably something like 
ten years.
<P>
	The second phase of the reforms that are being talked about 
here should also be referred to at this time. We are alerted that 
consultations for phase two reforms have apparently started 
already. They includes issues like the liability of corporate 
directors; shareholder communications both between the 
corporation and the shareholders and also among shareholders; 
citizenship and residency requirements currently imposed on 
boards of directors; financial assistance granted by the  
corporation to directors, officers, shareholders and others; and 
governing insider trading and takeover bids. Each of these areas 
are very substantive in nature and will require very careful and 
detailed examination and study.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Their importance to the federal business corporations and to 
Canada's competitiveness is clear. The expansion of directors' 
liability may be leading some qualified people for example to 
refuse board appointments. For a corporation to be successful, 
qualified people must be willing to serve on boards and once 
there to take bold steps in order to compete in the global 
marketplace.
<P>
	We also encourage commitment to continued reform. It is 
absolutely amazing this particular act has not been revised over 
the last 20 years. If we compare business practices of 20 years 
ago to today and the competition that exists out there I find it 
almost unbelievable that the act still fits. It does not fit too well 
and that is why it is before us today. So we are encouraging 
continued reform.
<P>
	The proposed amendments require the minister to submit 
within three years of this bill receiving royal assent a report to 
Parliament on the provisions and operation of the act, including 
recommendations for further changes to the law.
<P>
	We heard the hon. minister say about an hour ago that within 
18 months he expects to bring this forward. I certainly would 
encourage him to meet that deadline.
<P>
	In general we support the objectives of the bill. We recognize 
the government's efforts to meet one of its promises as set out in 
the speech from the throne. However we would caution the 
minister from viewing all of the amendments to this bill as 
technicalities. While in some instances this is essentially true 
there are other areas, as demonstrated in the text of my speech so 
far, that require closer and more cautious scrutiny.
<P>
	I am confident that once this bill is referred to committee, 
government members will agree that some safeguards must be 
implemented to protect shareholders, the corporate structure 
and finally the Canadian marketplace. Once this is 
accomplished I believe Bill C-12 will meet its objectives of 
promoting a fair and efficient marketplace and an economic 
climate that is conducive to sustained growth and job creation.
<P>
	We look forward to the referral of this bill to the committee. 
We will take the opportunity then to ensure that Bill C-12 meets 
its objectives in a manner satisfactory to all sides of the House.

	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (for Minister of Transport)</B> moved 
that Bill C-21, an act to amend the Railway Safety Act, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise today to 
present for second reading a bill to amend the Railway Safety 
Act. I understand there is agreement that we do all three 
readings hopefully before the hour of adjournment.
<P>
	The bill, which will help reduce accidents and fatalities 
associated with Canada's railway system, will create an offence 
for trespassing on federally regulated railway property.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	A similar prohibition in the Railway Act was revoked by 
proclamation of the Railway Safety Act in 1989. By 
reintroducing the prohibition we will put teeth into the Railway 
Safety Act by giving railway companies a strong deterrent.
<P>
	Effective and enforceable legislation in conjunction with 
public education should help reduce trespassing related 
incidents on railway lands. The three <I>e</I>s to enhanced railway 
safety are education, engineering and enforcement. I am pleased 
that this enforcement initiative will enable law officers, 
especially railway police who are empowered to enforce federal 
legislation, to charge trespassers found on railway lines.
<P>
	This legislation is clearly in the interest of public safety. 
Trespassing on railway property is one of the most frequent 
causes of fatalities and injuries related to railway operations. 
The incidence of accidents to trespassers is increasing. In fact, 
last year for the first time the number of trespassing fatalities 
surpassed the number of lives lost at level crossings in Canada.
<P>
	An estimated 100 people are struck by trains each year while 
trespassing on railway right of ways. Almost half of these 
people are killed and the remainder are seriously injured. Many 
of these people are habitual trespassers, and an unfortunate 
number of accidents involve young children and students. These 
are tragic statistics.
<P>
	The government has introduced this bill as a means of 
reducing the terrible consequences that can result from 
trespassing on railway lands. Trespassing commonly occurs 
near schools, parks, recreational facilities and commercial or 
residential locations which have high pedestrian traffic, urban 
areas such as Montreal and Toronto.
<P>
	The reasons for trespassing include shortcuts to commercial 
establishments, schools and residential areas, and the use of 
railway tracks by children as play areas. Unfortunately a railway 
right of way is a dangerous time saver and far too often becomes 
a deadly playground for young children.
<P>
	There is also a major problem of homeless people using 
railway property as living or resting areas. Many trespassers 
make use of railway property with total disregard for their 
personal safety and this is of major concern to Transport 
Canada.
<P>
	Fencing and highly visible signage put in place by railways 
have not been sufficiently effective in discouraging trespassers. 
Let me emphasize that the penalty provisions contained in the 
act are broad enough, up to $5,000 on summary conviction, to 
create a major deterrent to repeat offences.
<P>
	Reinstatement of the prohibition against trespassing will 
assist police in reducing the incidence of this dangerous practice 
on railway property and hence the number of accidents and 
fatalities. The onus for enforcement would rest with the 
railways through their police forces and there would be no 
demand on government's resources as a result of this 
amendment.
<P>
	The original anti-trespassing provision in the Railway Act 
was not included in the Railway Safety Act when the latter 
legislation was proclaimed in January 1989 because it was felt 
the matter could be addressed effectively through subsequent 
regulations.
<P>
	A review by the justice department has determined that due to 
the nature of the prohibition, the provision should be established 
as part of the legislation itself and not as a regulation. Transport 
Canada has worked with railways to improve safety in areas of 
heavy trespass; measures such as increased railway policing, 
barbed wire top fences and other steps to discourage trespassers 
have been introduced as a result.
<P>
	The amendment will not affect individuals such as native 
people and prospectors in remote areas who may need to cross 
tracks on a regular basis to reach trap lines and mineral claims. 
The purpose of the amendment is to enable railway police forces 
to take action in areas of continual and dangerous trespasses.
<P>
	In conclusion, let me emphasize that the federal government 
is committed to working with the railways to reduce accidents 
and fatalities associated with Canada's railway system. This 
addition to the Railway Safety Act strengthens this important 
piece of legislation and in conjunction with public education 
should help remedy the problems of trespassing on railway 
lands.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before recognizing the member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans I would like to ask the 
House if it is true the other parties have given unanimous 
consent for this bill to go through all three stages and be passed 
today?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3913"> 3913 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Official 
Opposition, I can confirm that there is such a consent.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Very well. Does the Reform Party 
concur?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Is the Reform Party prepared to give unanimous consent to the 
three stages passing today?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> We are, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
</B><B>(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
transport critic for the Official Opposition I would like to make 
a few comments on that bill. The first purpose of this very short, 
but nevertheless important bill is to ensure equivalence between 
the French and English versions of the Railway Safety Act. The 
second is to prohibit unlawful access to line works.
<P>
	I can tell you that I am doubly concerned about this bill. In my 
riding of Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans there is a rail line 
that people at CN call Murray Bay. It goes from Limoilou, in 
Quebec City, to Clermont, in Charlevoix, which means that it 
crosses the entire riding.
<P>
	While I was preparing my notes and rereading the bill, I 
remembered two events that I would like to share with you. They 
are tragic events for the families involved. Some two or two and 
a half years ago, in July, a 72-year old person was hit by a CN 
train in front of the Basilica in Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré, in my 
riding. I can tell you that in a community the size of 
Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré, such an accident creates quite a 
commotion.
<P>
	The second event, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Transport just mentioned, involved a child. Last 
year, a six-year old boy, on his way home from school in Ville 
Vanier, in the Québec-Est riding, was hit by a Via Rail train 
which was going through a residential area at high speed. There 
was a coroner's inquest. We are still waiting for his conclusions. 
I can tell you that listening to the testimony of the father, who 
was deeply affected, was heart-rending-I do not mean that the 
mother was not affected-but the testimony of the father left me 
with extremely painful memories. I can tell you that, as the 
father of two children, I was shaken.
<P>
	Having said this, I will refrain from saying that this is a good 
bill even if I would like to. I do not know if I am becoming a 
seasoned parliamentarian, but I do not dare say this was a good 
decision because when one does, there are usually ministers, 
whose good faith can be questioned, who are only too happy to 
mention in response to our questions: ``But you said the 
government had made a good decision in this bill''. So I will 
refrain from saying it. It is unfortunate that the rules of the 
British parliamentary system, and our friends opposite's vision 
of it, prevent me from saying this is a good bill, although I am 
tempted to say so.
<P>
	I can tell you why I consider this bill important. By the way, 
short lines are referred to as C.F.I.L. in French. Perhaps I should 
take this opportunity to enlighten my francophone colleagues 
from other provinces. Instead of using the expression ``short 
lines'' in French, we should say C.F.I.L., which stands for 
<I>chemin de fer à intérêt local</I>. We know that railway companies, 
whether it is CN or CP, are more interested in selling lines.
<P>
	I think that if we have local operators trying to make a profit 
with their line, it would be unfortunate to see railroad safety 
adversely affected. I feel that this bill, which guarantees a level 
of firmness regarding the implementation of certain safety 
standards, is a good piece of legislation. And as regards short 
lines, we, parliamentarians, will have to be watchful and ensure 
that operators comply with a minimum of safety rules.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	To conclude, I want to say that the Bloc Quebecois did not 
object at all to the grouping together of all three reading stages. 
We support this bill, which is primarily aimed at increasing 
railroad safety.
<P>
	I forgot to mention recreational use of land on which a railway 
line is situated. For example, in my riding, as in several others, 
snowmobiles make increasing use of that land. To some extent, 
this bill is to protect from themselves such people, who take 
unwarranted risks. As you know, the snowmobile was invented 
by a Quebecer, Mr. Bombardier. Its usefulness has been 
demonstrated and this invention has had an impact across 
Canada and throughout the world.
<P>
	In conclusion, we support this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we recognize this as an important but non-contentious piece of 
housekeeping legislation designed to improve rail safety. As 
such the Reform Party supports the bill.
<P>
	We support it going through three readings and we offer our 
co-operation in that regard. We do not wish to take up the 
House's time in any further debate or comment on it so that we 
can finish with the bill and get on to the more important and 
pressing matters coming before the House.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the second time, considered in 
committee, reported and concurred in.)
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> When shall the bill be read the third 
time? By unanimous consent, now?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (for the Minister of Transport)</B> 
moved that the bill be read the third time and passed.

Transport, I want to thank both parties for the quick passage 
of this very important bill.
<P>
	It does show that when an important piece of legislation needs 
to be put through the House in fairly quick order all parties can 
move, and I want to thank them.
