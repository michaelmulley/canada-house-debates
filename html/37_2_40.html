	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the House today to address the issue before us.  Clearly we have to look at the purpose of the process we are going through and the goals we are trying to achieve.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-10A contains administrative amendments to the Canadian firearms program. The goal is to streamline the program and reduce the costs while improving client service and continuing to meet our public safety objectives. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This program approaches gun safety in a practical and common sense manner.  It already is helping to keep firearms away from people who should not have them.  It is encouraging safe and responsible gun use by legitimate owners.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the Canadian firearms program is an outstanding example of a preventative approach to public safety.  Just last week, the Canadian Police Association appeared before the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in the other place to reiterate its support for this program.  In the Canadian Police Association's view, licensing and registration are important measures to reduce misuse and the illegal trade in firearms.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past decade, poll after poll has shown that an overwhelming majority of Canadians support gun control and support the important public safety framework of the Firearms Act.  Thanks to the implementation of a number of initiatives to simplify the administration and make the program more user friendly for firearms owners, Canadians are complying with the law.  The licensing phase of the program has achieved over 90% compliance, and over 70% of the firearms owners have registered their firearms.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program is already achieving higher levels of public safety for all Canadians.  Since December 1, 1998, over 7,000 licences have been refused or revoked by the public safety authorities.  The number of revocations is over 50 times higher than the total in the last five years under the previous program.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to the firearms act included in Bill C-10A will help to ensure that key public safety goals of the Firearms Act are met.  At the same time,  they will ensure that the administration of the program is more efficient, effective and client friendly.  These administrative changes will simplify processes and requirements for firearms owners by producing a more streamlined system.  For example, they will simplify the firearms licence renewals and registration process.  They will also make the border process more efficient by introducing pre-processing for visitors bringing guns into Canada.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been made about the costs of the program, but we have to put things in perspective.  This is a sound investment in the long term safety of Canadians.  We now have the opportunity to adopt amendments that will go a long way to achieving a more efficient and cost effective program.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of these measures is the proposal to stagger firearms licence renewals, which is intended to help avoid a surge of applications in five year cycles. Evening out the workload in such a manner would result in more efficient processing and significant  cost savings.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streamlining the transfer process of non-restricted firearms would also allow CFOs to focus their efforts and resources on their many other public safety functions.  Moreover, consolidating the administrative authority for all operations under the Canadian firearms commissioner would ensure more direct accountability to the justice minister, who would remain responsible to Parliament for the program.  This in turn would enhance financial accountability. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should keep in mind that this is not the time for delay.  It will cost more to operate the system the longer we delay.  This bill is needed to move forward with the cost savings measures that will lead to a more efficient program for Canadians.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a public safety program that is supported by a vast majority of Canadians and the policing community.  It is a program that is already achieving concrete results in terms of public safety.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill presents an opportunity to build on the achievements in a way that  is even more responsive to the firearms community and will reduce costs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the House to accept the bill that has been put before us and to go forward with this legislation forthwith.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-372868"></A><a HREF="#Int-372891"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-372860"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, we are here today in regard to the other place splitting the bill dealing with cruelty to animals and with the  Firearms Act, which we passed here in the House of Commons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of the operation of this place has already been dealt with by the Chair,  so I will not go into that in too great a depth other than to say  it seems that the other place is having a greater influence on the House of Commons than it should.  Of course the problem with this is that the members of the other place   do not have to go back to their constituents in the provinces, have a vote and in fact get a reaffirmation that the positions  they are taking are right.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of this firearms legislation, what needs to be made clear right off the bat is that before Bill C-68 was put forward in 1995,   Canada had very good firearms legislation.  It had good control over firearms and the people who used firearms.  There was good protection for society in general, both in the cities and in the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members might ask how I can make this statement.  They might ask if the gun  legislation that came through in 1995 is not the best legislation, probably, and if it did not fill a big vacuum.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact of the matter is, Mr. Speaker, you know me, as you are all-knowing about members of Parliament.  I was in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for 30 years.  I am darn proud of my service there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dealt with a lot of the social ills in this country, including abuse and assaults between individual people, some on a social basis in  unfortunate family situations and some in a criminal context. Before this billion dollar boondoggle of Bill C-68, how did police manage to handle the use of firearms if crimes were being committed?  How did they check out somebody who wanted to have a firearm, or somebody who not only wanted but needed to have a firearm, as in the case of farmers and ranchers in particular, or trappers and people working in the resource industry in remote areas of the country where there are wild animals that actually will attack and kill humans? We did not need the new law.  We needed to retain those we had.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is what we had before.  We had a firearms acquisition certificate.  Anybody who wanted to acquire firearms had to have a FAC, as it was called.  People got that by going down to the local police station where local officers would do the computer checks through the Canadian Police Information Centre. They would do checks on people's background and character.  They would know whether or not people were recorded as having any mental illness and/or criminal record.  That was already in place.  We did not have registration of every rifle and shotgun, but we did have the registering of handguns.  That had been done since the 1930s.  There was control of the handguns for the simple reason that handguns are easy to conceal inside a jacket or under a coat.  That is legitimate firearms control and that is what we had.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us say that a firearm owner had his or her gun stolen. The RCMP would get the firearm owner to give us the serial number of his or her firearm and we would enter that into a computer.  If that firearm had ever been  used in a crime or if it was recovered, we would be able to immediately find it.   However, that did not cost $1 billion. It probably cost a few million dollars to keep that system going. Those FACs are renewed every five years.</p>


	<A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1015)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the situation where someone believes that maybe a person will use a firearm for an unlawful purpose or to hurt himself or herself or someone else? I know from practical experience that police can go to a court of law to obtain an order to seize those firearms and/or to remove the person who might commit the crime against his or her family or whomever.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had  good laws that worked, that were economical and that prevented those crimes which could be prevented.  The problem with this legislation is that the Canadian public is given the impression that by registering every rifle and shotgun crime will be cut down. That is not the truth.  Criminals cut down rifles and shotguns which make them illegal firearms, according to the Criminal Code.  They become concealable weapons with which criminals commit the crimes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handguns are already registered.  If the registration system is so good and prevents crime, why does the City of Toronto have gangs and criminals shooting  each other and innocent bystanders on a regular weekly basis?  The registration system cannot and will not prevent criminal activities or criminals from acquiring firearms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should we do?  Do we take this $1 billion and  fight crime or do we take the $1 billion, like the government has, and spend it on a registration system and harass law-abiding citizens? I and the Canadian Alliance say quite clearly that if we had given that $1 billion to the RCMP back in 1995, it would have improved its computers and it would have had an excellent system with regard to handguns.  It would have used a lot of that $1 billion to go after real criminals. The money should have gone there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report of the  Auditor General was recently presented to the House recently.   It needs to be stated again in the House that is a scathing report.  The Auditor General has used words to the effect that never in the history of Canada has there been such a large cost overrun on a program, a cost overrun that even the Auditor General could not establish from the books.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auditor General originally took the position of the government at the time that this would be a $2 million system.  As she worked through it, she realized that the cost was around $1 billion and expected that it was likely much higher.  However the records of the government were so bad that she could not determine how much money had been wasted on the system.   There had been no accountability. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings us to the simple conclusion that throwing more money at this will not help. The system is still the way it is.  It is still broken.  It is still run down.  It still cannot be made to work. I think the arguments of the backbench members of the government seem to have finally reached the frontbench and that is, further money should not be spent on the system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other day the  Minister of Justice  asked that  $72 million be taken out of the supplementary estimates for the gun registry.  The members have not said it, but I think they realize that throwing good money after bad will not do the job.</p>


	<A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would be wrong with not passing the motion and not sending it back to the other place? Let us keep this firearm legislation here.  Let us make legislation that is effective in controlling crime, that makes wise use of resources and that is based on common sense and not some phoney Liberal value.  That is what we need.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have described  the sensible legislation which the Canadian Alliance would put in place.  We would still make fully automatic firearms prohibited.  People would not be allowed to carry around handguns willy-nilly.  However people could take their handguns  to the local shooting range. If people did not want to use them at the shooting range for a whole year, for instance,  that would be fine.  They are their personal property.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with this legislation, the government is saying to people that if they have not used their firearms for year, because they have not signed in and out of the shooting club, then they no longer need them and they will be taken away.  That is explicitly what it is saying it will do.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what is wrong with this legislation.  It is a deception that the government and the Department of Justice have used right from the start to achieve its real goal, which cannot be crime prevention because obviously it does not prevent crime.  Its real goal is to harass Canadians who have firearms either because they need them or for plain recreational purposes.  The government wants to remove as many firearms as is possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideal goal as put forward by the lobby group, which is a very small number of people who want the federal government to put this legislation in, is that no Canadians have a firearms.  The government understands that  free society is not made up that way.  A free society is made up of honest, decent citizens making a better country.  Just because people own guns does not mean that they are not decent, normal citizen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government planned that the registry system would protect Canadians.  Who is paying for that?  The gun owners.  Every blasted penny is being paid by people who own firearms.  That further goes to show that the goal of the system is to harass gun owners  and take away their firearms through the use of onerous laws made up of a whole bunch of little rules.  The costs for that are borne by firearm owners. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The governments  plan went a little bit awry when it tried to unload the costs onto the provinces.  At that time the provinces said that the system would not work.  They said that it was the most foolish plan they had ever seen and that would not participate or help the federal government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we saw the initial court cases in Edmonton, Alberta.  I recall very clearly the statistics the Department of Justice used.  Because it  did not have a good argument as to why the gun registry would help fight crime, it misstated and misused the figures, supplied by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, in court.  Subsequently, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said publicly that the statistics were not correct and that they had been misrepresented in court. As a result, that deception continued.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then  the Auditor General found another deception.  The Parliament of Canada was not being properly informed of the costs of the registry.  That is highly suspect. The ministers are even  saying to this day things that I think are questionable.  That is the best way that I can put it.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Justice said that the province of Ontario, at the time Premier Harris, and the province of Alberta, Premier Klein, were against effective gun control. I hate to quote from newspapers but that  is what the minister said. That is patently untrue.  It is as untrue as the statistics in the court case.  The premiers of the provinces want effective gun control and wise use of resources, as I described at the start of my speech.   I laid out how effective the system was before Bill C-68 and that is the system that I still purport we should use today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I would vote against the motion to send the bill back to the Senate for approval. The creation of a bureaucracy with a new commissioner of firearms reporting to the Minister of Justice instead of the RCMP will  be a mammoth cost also and it will do absolutely nothing other than to drive the costs up.  The minister will not answer our questions as to how much it will cost to finish registering of firearms and how much the system will cost every year thereafter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that Canadians, both gun owners and non-gun owners, have not given up the battle to have this legislation repealed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former justice minister who brought this legislation forward quite clearly stated that the war had been lost by the Canadian Alliance in 1995 and as result it should be ended. The Canadian Alliance is not the only one fighting this.  All provinces, firearm owners and people who are angry about the waste of their tax dollars are fighting it.  This battle is not over by a long shot; it will continue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a motion that I wish to put before the House, but before I do  that I wish to speak to the other part of the motion which concerns the cruelty to animals legislation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the cruelty to animals legislation, I only hope that, if the government sends it back to the Senate, that the Senate will retain the harsh penalties for cruelty to animals.  I and my party are in favour that anybody who is cruel to animals should  be hit with hard penalties.  Animals are relatively defenceless when they are dealing with humans and as a result need that protection.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stated goal here again is different than what the animal rights movement really wants. It does not want animals to be used either for food consumption or in any way other than their natural environment. I guess it would not even let us ride horses if  it had its way because that is not totally natural to the animal.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was talking about opposition to legislation.  The Canadian Cattlemen's Association, every farmer lobby group association and the university medical research people are against the legislation.  Millions of Canadians are against the legislation because parts of the bill do not protect farmers  in the legitimate use of animals. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, why would we not keep the bill  in the House and fix it here, rather than send it back to the other place? I guess that is to be dealt with by the House as  a whole and I suspect it will go back. Hopefully the Senate will do what we did not have the backbone to do in the House and that is make the cruelty to animal the best possible legislation.  I wish the other place well in that regard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made my points that both legislations are drastically flawed and  that the opportunity to do the right thing in the House is available to us once again.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government sends bills back to the other place to be dealt with,  it is abdicating its responsibility to do what is in the interest of all Canadians by the government and that is a sorry state of affairs. I wish to make an amendment in regard to this motion. I move: </p>

	Mr. Speaker, good morning. We are in favour of the amendment. I have been sitting in this House for nine years, since 1993. I always thought that a distinction should be made between the work done here in the House of Commons and the work done in the other House.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have never thought that the government, particularly the government House leader, would be so—I must say the word, hoping that it is parliamentary language--spineless as to ask us to collectively forgo our privileges as members of the House of Commons. What is happening here is quite significant.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that people in the gallery understand that we, as the elected representatives of the people, the 301 members of the House of Commons, are legislators. We have been elected here to represent the people. We are the ones with democratic legitimacy. We know our constitutional history. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senate, and I will have the opportunity to come back to this, is not  there to defy this House.  The Senate is there to review the bills that are proposed to it by the House of Commons, but the House of Commons is the real decision-making centre in our democracy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had already chosen to divide the bill earlier. We went through the whole legislative process we had to go through and we were at third reading stage. It may be useful to remind those who are listening to us what this legislative work is.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bill is introduced, which is the first reading, and everyone knows that this is something automatic; there is no debate at this stage. Then, there is second reading, where the principles of the bill are debated. At the end of the second reading stage, the bill is referred to a committee, one of the House's several standing committees of the House. Finally, there is the third reading stage, where we comment on the principles, once the  bill has gone through clause by clause consideration in committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill we are asked us to split, to divide into two bills, had gone through most of the legislative process. It was at third reading stage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What right does the Senate—which is made up of people who are not elected but appointed, as we know, through a partisan system, therefore people who for all intents and purposes do what the Prime Minister tells them to, because they do not represent anyone—have  to do this? The Senate is not there to defy the House. The Senate could not bring the government down. The other place cannot hold a vote of non-confidence. Not only are senators not elected, but they cannot pass bills that would lead to increased government expenditures. And now, they want us to suspend the democratic will of members of the House of Commons. This is unacceptable. We shall never accept this kind of process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is worse, the government is demonstrating complacency beyond what we thought possible.  We have seen that this government is servile. We have seen that this government is complacent. Nor is this the first time that the government is being spineless. We have seen how the government is unable to hold its own when important issues are raised. However, for the government to ask us to forgo our privileges by asking us to agree that this not be a precedent, that is beyond comprehension. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the government be so servile? How can the government cave in so shamelessly when it comes to our work at legislators? We know that we are not dealing with a courageous government. We are not dealing with a very active government. We are having problems getting legislation to look at.</p>


	<A NAME="T1040"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1040"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1040)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is the government not active, not interventionist, but when the time comes for us to do our job, it is prepared to abdicate the privileges we have in this House. This is unacceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that at such times we can rely on the Chair. The Speaker is the guardian of our freedoms. I do not know if Canadians and Quebeckers are aware of this, but if there were a world conflict and if Parliament were unable to sit, the Speaker would have an important role to play. In an emergency situation, such as an apprehended insurrection or any other calamity that would prevent Parliament from sitting, should we have to contact the British authorities, the only person empowered to do so would be the Speaker.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the Speaker is the guardian of our freedoms. When we see the Speaker and the Sergeant-at-Arms process in front of us with the mace, which is the symbol of our authority, we understand that we are invited to sit, that we are plenipotentiaries who can do what they were elected to do, which is to pass laws.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will never accept that the other chamber would ask us, at a stage as  late as third reading, to start the whole legislative process all over. This shows how anachronistic that institution is. Why, after three mandates, has this government still not deemed it appropriate to examine on the role of senators? Is it acceptable to have people who have no democratic legitimacy making decisions for their peers?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this House, there is a convention. We accept dissent, we accept diverging views, we accept the fact that we may not all agree on something, but there is a common base, in that all members are elected. All members have received the same democratic stamp of approval. All members who rise in this House do so on behalf of their fellow citizens. But the other place wants to interfere with our authority, with our legitimacy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will never, no matter how long I live, forgive the member for Glengarry—Prescott—Russell for the kind complacency, if not servility, that makes him so totally spineless when the time comes to defend our parliamentary privileges. He has the nerve to present this motion, even in its amended form. If there had not been an amendment, the government would have been perfectly willing to allow one of our privileges to be breached.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no greater privilege for members of this House than to organize how they operate as they see fit.  We agree that the executive, the government, has a role, which is to initiate bills. Once again, however, that is not the issue today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we are saying that we acknowledge the fact that the other chamber has interfered with how we operate, trampled our authority, shown disdain for the work done by parliamentarians.  Yet the government is asking us to say “This time we will accept it, but not as a precedent that will work against us later on”.  This is not possible.  We will not cooperate in such a ploy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not necessarily have anything against the bill.  The firearms issue does, of course, stir up a lot of passions.  We are familiar with the debate here, even within our own caucus.</p>


	<A NAME="T1045"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1045"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1045)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a Montreal MP, and of course have not received any representations about the firearms issue.  The only animals in my riding are in the Biodome, and they are pretty well contained.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do, however, readily acknowledge that some members have received many representations, particularly those whose ridings are in isolated regions, such as my friend, the member for Frontenac—Mégantic, where the firearms issue is viewed in  different terms than in Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, which is close to the inner city.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agreed that the right to bear arms is not in our constitution.  The right our citizens have under the constitution is to live in peace, free of violence and illegal search and seizure.  They have the right to be protected from physical violence and to have their physical well-being respected. No one in this House, no constitutional expert, could argue that the right to bear arms is a right under the constitution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed reasonable to us—</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. members:</b> Oh, oh.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Réal Ménard: </b>—because every person is entitled to  eat properly, and every person is entitled to the right to express himself  on a full stomach, and I feel that my rights in this regard are being violated at this very moment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this to say that gun ownership is not a constitutional right. It seemed reasonable to us to put registration mechanisms in place. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, when it was being debated in the House, many members raised legitimate questions regarding the cost of registration. We were told $15 or $20 million, but it has risen to a billion dollars.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I watched the news carefully and I was extremely pleased to see that government members are exercising their right to dissent, given that  one member questioned the current Minister of Industry's competence.  This was the sad spectacle of a kind of intellectual sparring match between two members of the Liberal majority.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certainly many members of the House who think that there is some truth to what the Liberal member said about  the Minister of Industry. However, these are all considerations that can be debated in public.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agreed to recognize in 1995, 1996 and 1997,  that owning a firearm is not a constitutional right, because of the fact that we live in a society sheltered from violence. The debate took place, the parties had their say, and we voted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the bill on cruelty to animals, we also had some reservations. I am sure members will recall, with joy and nostalgia no doubt, the excellent work done by the member for Berthier—Montcalm at the time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, as everyone knows, we will soon have the pleasure, I hope, of welcoming another member for Berthier—Montcalm, who will join the Bloc Quebecois caucus. I am taking this opportunity to invite all our fellow citizens from Berthier—Montcalm to go and vote on Monday. Let us not forget that there is nothing more precious in a democracy than to exercise one's right to vote. I remain fully confident that the voters of Berthier—Montcalm will put their trust in the Bloc Quebecois candidate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, let us go back to the essence of the motion before us. As parliamentarians, how could we accept that our rights as legislators not be respected?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though our parliament is a bicameral institution, which means that it is made up of two chambers, namely the House of Commons and the other place, we cannot accept that a bill that was introduced in this House, that was debated at second reading, at  which time members from all parties had an opportunity to speak, a bill that received serious consideration  in committee and that made it to third reading, should be amended.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As parliamentarians, we know that a member of Parliament shows his true worth in committee. Indeed, it is in committee that the real work of parliamentarians is done, because an expertise is developed, the process is less partisan, and we can of course work in the true spirit of cooperation and friendship that all parties should have.</p>


	<A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1050)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill came back for third reading. All the parties represented in the House expressed their opinions. We sent it to the other place. The Senate, with a shocking disregard for our  prerogative as members of Parliament, is asking us to review the bill's structure and to split it again. This is unacceptable. This would create a precedent.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proves to us in the Bloc Quebecois that it is high time we abolished this antiquated,  backward, outdated, antidemocratic, obsolete institution, which has absolutely no place in a democratic system. When it comes time to look back on the Liberal Party's record and history, we will see how devoid of moral fibre and courage this party has been in refusing to modernize our political institutions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other place should have been abolished long ago. Anyone making decisions for their peers should be democratically and legitimately elected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not what we are being proposed. They are proposing to ride roughshod over our prerogative. The Bloc Quebecois will never permit the other place to come here and tell us to do our work differently, as if the debate had never taken place, as if we were not elected representatives and as if we were not democratically elected. When I rise in this House, I can speak legitimately on behalf of the people of Hochelaga—Maisonneuve.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do parliamentarians know who the senators represent? What is the role of the Senate, in terms of democratic legitimacy? In truth, it does not have any.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, historically, people will say that when the founding fathers designed the federal system, they wanted to give the senators, in that other place,  a responsibility to protect minorities. You could tell me this, but this responsibility to protect minorities has nothing to do with the democratic legitimacy of the members of this House. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say it again, it is almost as if the Senate wanted to hold us hostage, to strangle us with a bear hug and prevent us from breathing democratically. This is out of the question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number  of institutions, such as the Senate and the position of Governor General, need to be rethought. They are not especially democratic. Granted, there have been some representatives of the Queen whose descendants have graced this House. This is perhaps the most useful thing they ever did for society. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let us agree that the Senate, the Governor General and anyone who is not democratically elected, are no longer legitimate  in the 21st century. I am thankful that the Canadian Alliance has moved an amendment that invites us to take a firm stand. If by some misfortune this amendment were adopted, I hope that all government members and the hon. members of this House will understand the precedent that would be set. Imagine how vulnerable we would be. What happened once could happen again and again.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If ever the Senate  were so ill-advised as to not approve bills referred to it or to refuse again to split a bill, the other place could claim a precedent and could say, “We did it for the bill on cruelty to animals and gun control; we could do it for any other bill”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am asking all those who believe in democracy, in our role as parliamentarians and in democratic legitimacy, to stop this trend towards disrespect for parliamentarians and to  vote against the motion. I am asking the hon. members to approve the Canadian Alliance's amendment, so that if the Senate ever wants to claim a precedent, we can say no.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have been vigilant and have exercised our prerogative as representatives of  the people.

	Mr. Speaker, as you know, there are five ways of amending the Constitution.  Sometimes this requires the consent of all provinces,  sometimes the 7-50 formula, consent of seven provinces representing 50% of the population.  Sometimes it needs the consent of the federal government and the province concerned, as was the case when we changed the language-based school boards. Sometimes it requires not just the consent of the federal government but also that of the province concerned and the adjacent province,  when boundaries are being changed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To abolish the Senate of Canada would of course require a round of constitutional negotiations.  The Senate is, in our opinion, an outmoded institution, one that has outlived its usefulness, an anachronism, with no justification for its existence.  The Senate should be abolished, and steps taken to ensure that all those who make decisions for their peers, all those who represent the public, are elected representatives. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Halifax explosion, at the time the largest man-made explosion ever, killed between 1,600 and 2,500 people and displaced thousands more, leaving them homeless and missing family and friends.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1991  the Parliament of Canada established the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women to commemorate the loss of these young women and to reflect on the reality of violence against women in our society.  This day has become a day to reflect, not only upon the losses but also to turn a thought to the many Canadian women and girls who live daily with the threat of violence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is equally important to remember that December 6 represents a day for communities to find concrete actions each Canadian can act upon in their own lives to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must commemorate, reflect and take action in our  own personal way.  We must help to put an end to the violence against women because it can and does affect all Canadians.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Militant separatists, such as Bernard Pilote, admit “People place less trust in our party's candidate than in the other party's candidate”. Jacques Brassard has almost conceded victory   in the byelection to the Liberal candidate. He says “They could win”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc has accomplished surprisingly little. They have been representing the riding for more than ten years, yet they have nothing to show for it.  One chair is all the Bloc brought back to Lac-Saint-Jean from Ottawa. One chair does not create jobs nor ensure regional   development.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious, Liberal candidate Gilbert Tremblay can  make a difference in the region. Next Monday, the Bloc will get the message. The riding of Lac-Saint-Jean—Saguenay will be a winner. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, Karl Marx once noted that history's great events happen twice, first as a tragedy, then a farce.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A modern case in point is the second leadership run by the former Liberal finance minister, the member for LaSalle—Émard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why a farce? Once he was opposed to free trade, then he flipped and not only supported free trade but expanded it.  Once he was going to abolish GST.  Not only was it not abolished when he was finance minister, but it was further entrenched by the creation of the HST.  At first he said that Kyoto did  not go far enough, then he said that it was a bad plan, then he said that we should consult the provinces and now he is going to vote for ratification by Christmas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While campaigning he said that  we needed to invest in our armed forces but he was the guy who gutted our armed forces for almost a decade.  He says that  we need to eliminate the democratic deficit but he does not even allow the free sale of memberships within his own party.  The last time he ran for the leadership he said that he supported an elected Senate.  Now he says that he is opposed.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says that the accounting scandals of Enron must be noticed and that we must have truth in accounting.  Where is the truth in accounting for EI? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About corporate responsibility, perhaps the former finance minister could tell Canadians why his company, Canada Steamship Lines, does not have its ships registered to pay taxes in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a credibility gap and this man should not be trusted.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, today has been marked as a day of remembrance, not just in memory of the horrific murder of 14 young women at École Polytechnique, but to remind us of our collective responsibility to protect the innocent and vulnerable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Violence against women also devastates the lives of those who loved them: their partners, mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, grandparents, friends and neighbours. The circle of sadness and grief is infinitely wide.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ugly echos of violence against women sound in the lives of far too many children.  Violence against women is violence against us all because members of a society are interdependent.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this day of special remembrance, I urge parliamentarians and all Canadians to renew their resolve to make the protection and safety of every member of our society a matter of utmost importance.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, today, December 6, is the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women. Surely, there is no need to demonstrate that violence against women is unacceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the various types of violence of which women are victims are specific manifestations of a broader social issue that requires unique attention and solutions. Violence can stand in the way of full equality for women in our society, and it remains a problem in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that all Canadian men and women recognize that violence is unacceptable, regardless of whom it is directed against. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This recognition should also not end when the sun sets today. It should be apparent every day of the year.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his request, less than 24 hours ago, all parties of the House agreed to withdraw the supplementary estimates of $72 million.

	Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Justice has acknowledged the criticisms in  the Auditor General's report and has agreed to accept the recommendations.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we cannot forget is the real end game here of the Canadian Alliance.  The real end game of the Canadian Alliance is to undermine a law that is supported by 80% of Canadians, which  went through this House and the Senate, and is working.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I wonder how many Canadians will still support the law when they realize that we were promised it would cost $2 million and it ended up costing $1 billion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me  ask the second part of the question since the minister is either unwilling or unable to answer the first part.  How much will the annual cost be to maintain the registry when it is completed?  That one is easier.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, what is interesting to note is in the last 24 hours other people from the law enforcement community have come forward to support this law and how effective it has been at reducing crime with weapons.  In fact, the commissioner of the RCMP said that the wider community in the country supports not only the law, but the gun registry.  </p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is obvious the minister is not answering that question.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the minister yesterday stated that all major spending for this program had been frozen, yet he said the registry will remain operational. How is that going to work?  The money has to come from somewhere.  </p>

	Mr. Speaker,  if we looked back at some quotes over the last few years we would  see a systematic attempt by the reform party,  now the Canadian Alliance, to undermine the law passed by Parliament.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former member for Crowfoot, remember him? He was another great member of the reform party. He released details about a loophole that would have allowed people to avoid the registry by leasing guns instead of buying them.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another former reform member from Cypress Hills--Grasslands, remember him? He said, “There will be many thousands of people who will resist this law, even with the  jail sentence staring them in the face.  I will be in there and  if I have to do a year,  fine”. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, on this national day of remembrance and action on violence against women, we remember the horror of the 14 young women who were so brutally murdered.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That tragedy compelled action, including the need to register guns to prevent violence against women. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we are faced with the staggering financial mismanagement of the registry, while at the same time services and programs to women have been cut.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the minister, will the government end this disgraceful record of mismanagement and restore front line services for women who are facing poverty and violence?  </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am glad the hon. member recognizes the fact that the country has a gun control law that works and  is effective, and no greater rationale for it is, of course, the ceremony that we have marked earlier, with  the tragic deaths of women in Montreal and the ones that have occurred in Vancouver. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, the minister is full of wishful thinking on what he would like to hear.  I think I very clearly suggested and put forward that the registry had been completely mismanaged.  Let us remember it was set up to prevent violence against women, while at the same time the homicide rate for young women separated from their spouses is double that for other women.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again I ask the minister, how does the government plan to deal with the mismanagement and also prevent the murders of more women?</p>

We work very hard at trying to find new ways of prevention.  The gun control legislation is simply one method that we have used.  We will keep looking for other ways and means of preventing those situations that occur and that the hon. member is concerned about.  </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  With the greatest of respect, I ask the Speaker to consider whether recent practices in the House might lead the Chair to look again at language which has historically been deemed to be unparliamentary.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I raise it because of the incident on which the Speaker has just issued a judgment.  I heard the language. I also heard the response by the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.  To state it very clearly, the issue not about--</p>

	I must conclude that the right hon. member is engaging in debate.  Sometimes the Chair, maybe because of the noise level or whatever, might have greater doubt. In the instance earlier today, there was no doubt that  I heard clearly the words  from the member, who has been asked to leave the chamber. This matter on that point of order and on that decision is over.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, my request is very specific and it is that the Chair undertake a review of language that is deemed to be unparliamentary.  I heard all the words that were exchanged.  There is no doubt that Mr. Speaker is correct that the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot used the language which he did not withdraw.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also the case that the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food made a statement that is not true and--</p>

	Again clearly we are getting into debate.  If there is to be review of  any rules regarding parliamentary language or other matters, I would simply and respectfully submit to the House and the right hon. member for Calgary Centre that they be dealt with in the Standing Committee of Procedure and House Affairs. That is where that matter will rest.</p>

	<b>Mr. Keith Martin</b>:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the Air Travellers Security Charge announced in the December 2001 Budget that took affect on May 1, 2002, and subsequent announcements by the Ministers of Finance and Transport that the tax would be adjusted downward if the government collected more revenue than necessary to improve air security: (<i>a</i>) what are the revenues from the tax; (<i>b</i>) how much of the revenue collected since May 1, 2002 has gone into (i) the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority, and (ii) general revenue; (<i>c</i>) if monies have gone into general revenue, how has this money been spent to improve air security; and (<i>d</i>) when will the Minister of Finance announce an adjustment to the tax?</p>


	<b>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, Lib.)</b>: <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, Revenue from the charge is reported monthly in <i>The Fiscal Monitor</i> published by the Department of Finance.  Revenue for the first four months of operation, April through July 2002,totals roughly $122 million, composed of monthly remittances of $20 million, $28 million, $34 million and $36 million, plus an estimated $1 million per month from the GST/HST. Based on collections to date, ongoing full year revenue from the charge, including applicable GST, is estimated to be in the range of $400 million to $420 million per year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total cost of the enhanced air travel security system is expected to be $2.2 billion through 2006-07. Budget 2001 provided that revenue from the charge would be maintained in line with expected expenditures on the enhanced air travel security system through 2006-07.  The government is committed to reviewing the charge over time to ensure that revenue remains in line with the costs of enhanced security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has begun the process of reviewing the charge.  The government has indicated that if revenue is projected to exceed planned expenditures through 2006-07, the charge will be reduced.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the government’s current five year forecast, which is based on ATSC collections and air traffic data observed to date, revenue from the charge is not expected to exceed the cost of enhanced air security as set out in budget 2001.  As such, there is little scope for reducing the charge at the present time.  However, the government’s change to accrual accounting, possibly as early as budget 2003, could provide an opportunity for reducing the charge.  Under accrual accounting, the costs to be recovered from the charge through 2006-07 may be lower than those set out in budget 2001.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to conclude my speech on this very important matter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week we have heard from government members who have stood in this place during debate and question period preaching doom and gloom if we do not ratify the Kyoto accord. The minister and other government members have acted  as if  they were the only people who cared about the earth or as if they were the only ones with children or who were worried about the future. That is simply not true.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Minister of the Environment, I am a trained lawyer. I  emphasize that I am not a scientist but  neither is the minister. Unlike him, I do not pretend to know exactly what effect human CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have on climate. I do not know. However, as recently as last week 27 climate specialists stated, “Delaying ratification for a short period so as to allow proper scientific consultations to take place will do absolutely no damage to Canada or the environment and is unquestionably the prudent and responsible course of action at this time”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included in this group  are presenters and reviewers of the 2001 IPCC report. The truth is  there are thousands and thousands of scientists on both sides of this debate and no amount of wishing by the Minister of the Environment can  make it otherwise. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kyoto protocol is not based on science;  it is based on politics, on a desperate desire for a legacy by the Prime Minister,  an expired prime minister. It is driven by fear and  an environmental industry that is every bit as self-interested as anyone else. It is certainly not based on a strong fiscal plan. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kyoto will be a body blow to the Canadian economy, its cost ranging as high as $40 billion and 450,000 jobs lost. The Minister of the Environment tells us in the House day after day, “Trust us. Trust me.  We will develop the plan.  We will work on the Canadian solution. Trust us. Ratify this accord and we will make it work. You have got to believe us”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at some of the facts. The government just took $1 billion and poof, out into the wind it went on the firearms registry. The firearms registry is bad enough. The government absolutely wasted $1 billion. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In British Columbia the provincial government used $450 million to build  three fast ferries and the people threw out that government. That party is now  down to two seats. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals took $1 billion to create a database. It is appalling. It is sickening. Now those guys  are telling us to trust them, trust them on the database. I heard someone from the government talking in question period today on the Sea King  helicopter procurement and I just about choked. He said, “We are accelerating the contract”. Two years ago they split the contract in two and now they are bringing it back together and saying,  “We are accelerating the contract, it will be quicker”, after  completely bungling the issue for  the last 10 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Liberals   say, “Trust us on the Kyoto accord” when the scientific community is split on it, when the entire Canadian industry  has concerns about it, and when we are the only country in the western hemisphere to buy into it. Our largest trading partners are not buying into it. Why? Because they know it is not the right way to go. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we should clean up our environment. Yes, we want to ensure that our environment is there for our children. Do we want to clean up our air? Absolutely. Do we want to try to reduce smog? Absolutely. Is that what the Kyoto protocol is all about? Absolutely not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government charades are  an absolute disgrace. After their record, the Liberals are  trying to pull the wool over the Canadian people's eyes. Since being elected in  1997, we have seen the $1 billion  boondoggle and   Groupaction contracts. The way the Liberals  blow money out of this place one would think  they had a printing press out in the lobby. It is absolutely incomprehensible to spend $1 billion on a database.</p>


	<A NAME="T1230"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1230"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1230)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They blow it off saying that they will fix the problem.  The Liberals have been around here since 1993 and they have screwed up just about every single thing they have touched.  It is time to throw those guys out.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 22 the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development released her audit on the government's environmental record.  It was a long list of failed environmental commitments.  The government says to trust it on the Kyoto accord.  Its past record on the environment  is dismal.  The government was reminded of its failure to reduce toxic chemicals, harmful airborne particulates, its failure to clean up contaminated sites on federal lands, and the list goes on. This is from the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the government says, “Trust us, believe in us. Just ratify the Kyoto accord and in the next year we will try to come up with a plan”.  Even its own numbers do not add up. It is absolutely incomprehensible.  The government wants Canadians to trust it after having  one dismal failure after another from the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commissioner also found that  strategies and plans for some issues were missing or incomplete, and that  objectives, targets and  timetables were fuzzy or missing, and in some of its strategies,  plans that did not exist.  Does this sound familiar?  Sure it does.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of the Environment stands up in question period day after day and waves his little green book and tries to cast insults on everyone saying that he is the only one that has any knowledge on  this issue and that the rest of us have none. We have read the minister's little green book.  There is one single number in that little green book of $1.6 billion.  The government has already spent that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no numbers.  There are absolutely no assessments.  The government has not done its homework, and the government says, “Trust us”.  There was $1 billion  in the HRDC scandal.  I am going to keep repeating this next one until I am blue in the face. This week it was $1 billion  for a database.  That is bad enough.  It is absolutely astonishing, but there is something   that  is even worse. The Auditor General pointed out to  Canadians that the  government had purposely hid it from Parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could anyone trust the government after one screw up after another?  The minute these revelations come to light the government goes into full damage control mode, full defence mode.  It is not okay.  We are here as the caretakers of the public purse.  We are supposed to have some sense of accountability in this place for how money is spent.  The government blows  $1 billion  as if it were nothing. It is unbelievable that the government members can look  Canadians in the eye and say, “Trust us”.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth is the Kyoto accord will not clean up the air. It will not  plant a tree. It will  not clean a stream.  The truth is the government has no idea, not a clue on how much it will cost Canadians.  The scientific community has been telling us it could cost $40 billion or $50 billion.  They have been telling us it could be 450,000 jobs.  The government does not have a clue.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government knows about as much about how much Kyoto will cost as how much it will cost to fulfill the firearms registry.  The government does not know how much the annual costs are.  We have been witnessing this in question period for the last two days.  The government does not have a clue.  The government cannot tell Canadians.  It has armies of people over there and it is in damage control mode.  They blew away $1 billion.  The government wants to  get through next week so that  when the House of Commons adjourns for two months, this issue will go away.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it will not go away.  It is  not only about the firearms registry, although  that is bad enough.  We in the Canadian Alliance believe we should be putting police officers on the street.  We should be putting those resources into our police agencies to reduce crime.  Then there would be greater safety.  Then we would not have the tragedies such as that which we witnessed years ago in Montreal, and today is the   anniversary.  We could reduce such  tragedies  as occurred in Vancouver.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe  we should be putting those resources into policing across the country, not into an ill-fated gun registry and blowing away $1 billion. We have to pound the message home that it is not okay.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government wants us to trust that it  will get Kyoto right and that it will come up with a plan. The truth is that it does  not have a clue. The Minister of the Environment has no idea what this will  cost. He wants us to trust him.  He has put all his eggs in  one basket, Kyoto. He has ignored environmental legislation. He has ignored cleaning up toxic waste sites. The list goes on and on, but he wants us to trust him.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can anybody trust the government after its dismal accountability for the Canadian purse? I note that the former  finance minister was the holder of the chequebook through all of this and   kept writing the cheques. They kept having to go back to  Treasury Board to quietly take more money out of different programs so they could fund another billion dollar boondoggle. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only legacy  the Prime Minister will  be left with will be billion dollar boondoggles, and this one tops the list: a billion dollars for a database.  It is enough to make anybody just about choke. Then it hides it from us. It is a disaster. Not one person in this country should trust the government.</p>

	Mr. Speaker,  with our neighbours  and  NAFTA partners to the south not signing the Kyoto protocol, with the huge border we share with the United States, and with so much of our industry and development concentrated along the 49th parallel, I wonder if the hon. member shares my concerns. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In British Columbia we have just seen a mill close in Fort Langley and move across the 49th, just south of the border, taking with it 56 jobs.

	Mr. Speaker, the truth is that in the Americas, Canada is the only industrialized country to sign on to the Kyoto protocol, or is about to ratify it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As most members in the House know, or should know, some 85% of our trade--the figure is debatable, plus or minus a per cent or two--is with our neighbours to the south. Billions of dollars a day go across the border in two way trade with the United States. We cannot seem to get it through the Liberals' thick skulls that this will  have a huge, disastrous impact on our economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other industrialized countries, such as Australia,  negotiated the Kyoto protocol at more than 8% of 1990 levels. Our negotiators' only mandate was to try to one up the Americans and they did not even do that. They negotiated 6% below 1990 levels. The worse thing is that it will   not  clean up the environment. It will create an economic disaster with our largest trading partner and it  will cost Canadians in the magnitude of half a billion jobs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member is absolutely right. The alarm bells should be going off for businesses in British Columbia and elsewhere in Canada. They should be panicking to throw the government as far as they can. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a Prime Minister who is more interested in demonstrating to the world that he is Mr. Green than any single worker in this country. We have a Minister of the Environment who is   trying to get this Kyoto ratification through at any cost.  He  wants us to trust that  his government  will be able to do it. The last thing we should do is trust them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians should fire the government as far as they can. Taking $1 billion and blowing it into the wind like it has a printing press back there is unacceptable. How can the government talk about  trust  when it hides  this from Parliament? It is    bloody disgrace.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I have listened carefully and with interest to the statements by my colleague opposite on the Kyoto accord.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask him a very specific question.  How does he possibly think  Canada will succeed economically if we do not develop the environmental technologies   to meet the ever increasing standards that we all realize around the world need to be met for our health and  to reduce energy consumption and therefore energy costs? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last 10 years California has  been increasingly raising its emission standards and building the environmental technologies to meet its own standards, which it then will sell to the rest of the world.  However, as we move into the future and try to meet California's  standards  we will have to buy its technology. When we raised our pulp emission standards in the early 1990s we bought  Scandinavian equipment because we  did not have the technology ourselves.  We did the same thing with  the Japanese automobile industry in the 1970s and 1980s when the first oil crisis occurred.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How on earth does the member think  we will become a  competitive trading country  into the future if we are going to be totally dependent on foreign technologies, largely American? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member talks about Kyoto not being accepted and ratified by the United States.  The American states are raising their environmental standards and developing the technology to meet them, which we will then have to buy from them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look to the future and not just look to the past in terms of this very backward thinking.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, with the greatest respect for the member, as he  pointed out, the people in the United States have this great technology but they do not have Kyoto.  My whole point is exactly what he is saying.  He made my argument for me. We do not need the Minister of the Environment's little green book, for which he does not know the cost of developing the technologies.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we be reducing smog?  Absolutely.  Should we be trying to clean up the environment?  Absolutely, 100%.  Every single member over here will support that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member said himself that if we do not ratify Kyoto we will have to buy the technology from the Americans. They are not ratifying Kyoto but  they will continue to develop their technologies. We have some of the brightest minds here in Canada. We can do it here.  However  we need a government that will provide the economic policies so that this country can flourish and  our economies will not lag behind.  We need a government that will put resources into developing these technologies, not blow the money into the wind, into a firearm registry that has zero accountability.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals  want us to trust them. We have seen billion dollar boondoggles.  We have watched  hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising contracts going to their  friends who donate to the Liberal Party.  Why should Canadians trust the government?  There is not one reason.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all due respect, the member made my argument for me. The minister's little green book will not develop these technologies.  However  we can develop those technologies if we have a strong, economic platform.  Yes, we can. We do not need Kyoto.  Kyoto will be another fatal disaster.  If the government ratifies this we will be back in the House a few years from now saying, “Oh well, we just threw another billion dollars up against the wall and we haven't reached our CO<sub>2</sub> emissions”.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts speak for themselves.  We only have to look at the record.  Do not blame me.  Look at the government's record of  mismanagement and   hiding.  It is an abuse of power and it blows it off like it does not even care.  It is in full defence, full damage control mode.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member who just spoke, and who I have the greatest respect for,  is from British Columbia.  He witnessed firsthand   what happened when the provincial government out there blew  $450 million on fast ferries.  The public was outraged, as it rightly should have been, and it threw those members out of government.  So far that party is  down to two seats.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same thing deserves to happen to the government.  It has no respect for the Canadian hardworking people who send taxpayer money to this institution.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I keep emphasizing that it is not about a gun registry, although, yes, we believe that money should be going into policing, it  is about a government that can blow away a billion dollars and have complete disregard for the taxpayer.  It could not care less about it.  It tries to sweep it under the rug.  It is wrong.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst thing is how did that billion dollars ever get in  there if it hid it from Parliament?  How did that happen? Did one of the ministers secretly go off and try to pull money from other departments?  Will we finally get to the bottom of the truth in this matter? For the government to take a billion dollars to create a database and hide it from Parliament, that is borderline criminal.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time we throw the government out.  It is time   Canadians show the government what it deserves.  When it stands up and says that we should trust it, how could anyone, even its own members, trust the government?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, every time I hear from the members of the flat earth society I despair.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before my hon. colleague  throws out the government, does he know which  party he will be in then?  Which world does he belong to?  Does he agree that we are part of an international community, that treaties are signed, not just by Canada but by a lot of countries?  In this case, over 93 countries have signed, including all our allies: Japan and all the countries of Europe.  He cites Australia.  I could cite Japan,  Sweden, Norway,  Finland, Germany and France.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he not think that we have a duty to other countries of the world that are polluted by us, including our own fellow citizens from the Arctic region, including my colleague from Nunavut who has spoken very eloquently many times about the changes in the Arctic?  Does he not think that we should do something for others for a change, instead of always looking inwardly to ourselves, as his party does in its silly  little cocoon   and  cannot see beyond Alberta and B.C.?  Does he not think that we have a responsibility toward the other people of the world as well and that is what Kyoto is about?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am still perplexed by these questions.  The government  wants to sign Kyoto because other countries have signed it.  Canada negotiated a bad deal.  Europe will trade emission credits within the EU and it  knows the shutdown of the industry in eastern Europe will make it much easier for it  to achieve its targets.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we should clean up our environment.  Nobody is disputing that but this ill-fated Kyoto accord would not do that.  I do not know what it will take for the government to understand that.  The Kyoto accord is about reducing CO<sub>2</sub> gases of which 95% are not man made, they are natural.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada does its fair share but it could do a lot more by ensuring we have a strong economy.  We have a very different country.  We have a large country with transportation issues.  Our trading partners are not signing onto this.  It is a bad deal and for the member to paint the Canadian Alliance as people who do not care is simply false.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will protect the best interests of the country and ensure there is a strong economy for Canadians.  We will do our part but we will not continue on the government's record of blowing money out into the wind as if it had its own printing presses.  It is time for Canadians to look at the record and give what the government justly deserves and that is to toss it as far as they can.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on the Kyoto protocol and represent the people of Nunavut on this important issue, I want to move the debate back to the topic at hand by putting a human face on the matter.  I want to talk about what climate change is doing to a way of life and culture.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inuit  and  northerners, people of the Arctic, live hand in hand with the environment and they are feeling the effects of climate change in their lives.  Their lives are  changing constantly because of the different factors that are happening in the world.  They are not immune to it.  They are experiencing it, just like every other group of people in the world. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The northerners and the people of my riding have been consistently supporting the government's intention to ratify the Kyoto protocol.   I am sure we have all seen the first ministers' conference where the Premier of Nunavut took a strong position and urged the Government of Canada to ratify the Kyoto protocol.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main reasons that people in the north are supporting ratification is that we are already experiencing the impact of climate change.  We are living the changes every day.  We all talk about the effect climate change would have on the people of tomorrow,  but I want to stress to the people  of Canada that the changes are happening now and we are feeling the changes today as I speak.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been documented by our people.  We have heard from different sources like  the hunters who  go out every day and see the changes.  My father is one of those people.  He has lived in harmony with the land.  He is 72 years old and has seen tremendous changes in our lives, not only affected by climate but also other factors.  This is  someone who I admire greatly and whose knowledge I trust. I would put my life in his hands because of his knowledge of the land, the climate and the weather. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and other hunters are telling us today that they cannot predict what the weather would be like day to day because all the traditional knowledge that they have, that they use to rely on to determine their survival, is not consistent today with what they know and expect of the weather because nothing is reliable as far as the weather is concerned. The changes are so drastic that their knowledge is undermined by what is happening today.   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talk about melting permafrost.  We live in an area where we do not have any basements for the houses because in some areas of the north we have permafrost only six feet below the ground. All our houses are built on this permafrost that is threatening to melt, as some people in Grise Fjord have noted. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government of Nunavut is doing a study on its own on the different changes that people are talking about.  It is documenting these changes. One piece of information received was that the glaciers were melting and this can be noticeably seen as the landscape changes before our very eyes.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area that we are hearing about is the way that travel is changing in our part of the country.  I can attest to that myself because the ice is melting so soon in the spring and freezing very late in the fall.  That affects how people go out and travel in our part of the north, especially with the lakes or sea ice freezing so late.  This  in turn affects the animals, mammals and fish and whether we can even count on the species being where we normally expect them to be at certain times of the year.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many of my interventions and speeches I always talk about how the people of the north are so adaptable, but I can say right now that these changes are happening so fast that we are caught in a time where we are finding it difficult to adapt.  One can imagine what effect this is having on other living things in the north.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the summit was taking place in Johannesburg we had people from the Arctic as part of the Canadian delegation. They were honoured to be there and that Canada recognized that the Arctic was one of the main indicators  of climate change. We were pleased to have that recognition because that is where most of the changes are being felt today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes that are happening today are very much a threat to our culture and way of life. We talk a lot about living in harmony with the environment.  If the environment were to change, then our lives would change. We are a group of people that have undergone many changes.  We feel that this is a direct threat to Inuit culture because of all the changes that are happening.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are put in actual physical danger because of the changes to the weather and ice conditions. This is undermining traditional knowledge that has been passed down for generations. If the climate keeps changing at this accelerated rate we fear great changes would happen to our way of life, the lives of animals and the Inuit way of life overall.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are concerned with the carbon dioxide emissions and how the temperatures might rise over the next while, even by 5°C in the summer, which may not seem like a lot, but to us it is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to health factors, we have the highest cancer rates  and we  have other detrimental health effects that people are experiencing in our part of the world. We have had many studies done where contaminants were reaching our people. These contaminants were coming from other parts of the world. We talk about pollution from different factories around the world and those contaminants were reaching the Arctic where the fragile ecosystem is greatly affected by these contaminants.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have different researchers telling the people of the north that they must keep eating their traditional foods even though they are contaminated today because the harmful health effects of not eating them are greater than eating the contaminated food.  That is the reality we have in the Arctic. We are being told to continue with the lesser of two evils. Even though we see contaminants from different sources from around the world entering the food cycle, it is still better for people to continue eating the traditional foods that we have always relied on for our survival.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different research has proven that there were harmful effects of contaminants entering  the breast milk of Inuit women. That is disturbing for us to hear.  Again people are telling us that it is healthier to continue to use breast milk even though they know there are harmful contaminants in the mother's breast milk. Those are the realities that we are living with today.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for the north, we very strongly urge the ratification of the Kyoto protocol because the expense of not doing something to improve the lives and the health of people is greater, and as a country we have to take the initiative  to deal with the harmful effects in the environment and to help with the survival of a group of people and their culture.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said at the beginning of my intervention, I want to put a human face on this debate. We very strongly support the ratification of the Kyoto protocol because we feel that our very culture and our way of life is at stake, on the top of the human life that will be affected if we do not do anything.</p>

	Mr. Speaker,  in her speech the member talked about contaminants that are affecting the health of people from her constituency. I think that is something that the government certainly should be dealing with.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ironic, I think, that this member would talk about the importance of dealing with the problem of contaminants affecting the health of her constituents and at the same time support the Kyoto agreement, because the Kyoto protocol has nothing to do with the contaminants she is talking about.  It has zero to do with that.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kyoto also has nothing to do with acid rain, nothing to do with the smog over Toronto or any of our Canadian cities,  and nothing to do with any types of pollutants that are in our water, our soil and our air.  It has only to do with carbon dioxide  and the other small amounts of greenhouse gases which combine with water vapour.  Water is the single largest greenhouse gas.  The theory is that is causing global warming.  It is unproven. She is supporting an agreement that deals with this unproven science about increasing temperature and yet in her speech she was talking about contaminants, which are absolutely not included in the Kyoto agreement.  They have nothing to do with it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does this member not support the position taken by the official opposition and others, which is to put government resources into dealing with real pollution problems like acid rain, pollution over our cities, smog and the types of pollution she is talking about, if it is in fact man-made?  Why is she not encouraging the government to put money into those resources, deal with those very real environmental problems and forget about for now, at least until the science is clear, something that is so uncertain as whether man is causing global warming?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the member why she does not support that.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we are debating whose angle is better, people's health is affected.  As a country we have taken a position to do something, and I feel that while everyone is trying to decide how we should deal with climate change, we are losing people to cancer and we are losing people's good health. I am talking about taking a move as a nation to deal with a very serious issue.  By ratifying the Kyoto protocol, I would say that we are on the move to creating solutions and getting people involved in the debate on how to deal with the other issues affecting us today.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I also listened to the member's speech with interest.  We of course have a lot of respect for the member and the community she represents.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She mentioned that hunters cannot rely on their traditional knowledge because of changes in climate.  We certainly appreciate that. Climate change is affecting everybody.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question really is about the fact of Kyoto dealing with CO<sub>2</sub> when only 5% of it is man-made and 95% is natural. The contaminants that the member mentioned, like the POPs that arrive in cold communities,  come down in the snowpack all over the world. In the Alps, in the Arctic and in the Rocky Mountains, we are seeing that contaminants come from hundreds of miles away. Sadly, Kyoto is not going to address these issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member surely should be aware, more than anybody, that Canada has a large land mass.  We have a very cold country.  We have heating costs for our homes.  We are an underdeveloped country.  We expect to see our population grow.  How can we realistically expect to go back to levels below 1990's when we have huge transportation costs and huge heating costs for our homes?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really, the question is this:  Is this Kyoto agreement going to help us with the objectives we are trying to achieve?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member who spoke previously mentioned that there are 33 million people in California  and they have low transportation costs.  There are as many people jammed into California as we have in the whole country.  They can afford to have lower transportation costs and shared transportation costs, like public transit.  That is very difficult to achieve in Canada with our numbers so spread out.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this effort actually going to achieve the objectives that we all want to see?  We want to see a reduction.  Surely it should be a made in Canada approach that does not bind us into buying credits in other countries and sending money out of the country in order to achieve unrealistic objectives.  Would that not be a more reasoned approach for Canadians, to find our own plan and deal with this in a responsible way?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of Canada having taken the initiative in ratifying the Kyoto accord.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a person of the Arctic who had to live with Chernobyl, as actually everyone else in the world did, we know that it did not happen in our country but it affected the whole world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to do this internationally because we cannot do it by ourselves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the Arctic circumpolar world have taken a position through the Inuit Circumpolar Conference that everyone has to come up with an international solution.  I am very proud of Canada for being one of those countries that has taken on this challenge and has moved forward.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen a decline in Arctic research.  I feel that  with the Kyoto protocol there will be more push for different kinds of research to be done internationally.  As much as we know that we have to deal with it in our own country, this is very much an international effort that all countries hopefully will recognize to come up with an international solution.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for her very informative speech.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, a question was asked previously about how the contaminants that the member spoke of were not dealt with specifically because Kyoto is focused on CO<sub>2</sub>. I would like to remind the member of this point and ask her opinion.  While we are making CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reductions, we are also making NO and NO<sub>2</sub> emissions reductions, we are making SO and SO<sub>2</sub> reductions and we are making particulate reductions, because we cannot isolate CO<sub> 2</sub> and say we are only acting on CO<sub>2</sub>.  When we talk about emissions we do not separate them out.  They all come together in a package.  What we see from a smokestack is not strictly CO<sub>2</sub>. It is all of these in combination, so we are actually dealing with that specific issue of the contaminants being put into our atmosphere. By reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and emissions generally, we are reducing all of those noxious chemicals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to hear the member's comments on that.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has taken this opportunity to bring some very interesting facts to the debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, from other initiatives we have taken, that  it is never a single avenue.  There are always ripple effects. I think that is a reason for the whole debate.  As much we say that the Kyoto protocol is to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions there will be other areas  within which research will be done and there will be other opportunities to deal with other pollution factors in the world.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can never single-handedly deal with one single issue because they all intertwine with each other.  I  look at the Kyoto protocol as a starting point from which other great initiatives can be taken.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I am proud that as a country we have decided to ratify this protocol and I look forward to the ratification before the end of the year.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time today with the member for Surrey Central.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a pleasure to rise today to address the issue of Kyoto. This issue is of great concern to Canadians. What concerns Canadians is the unknown. They have no idea what the plan will cost, no idea what costs will be put on them in the future, and no idea what the plan in fact is supposed to do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government says to trust it with the many unknowns of Kyoto and all will be fine. This is a government that has become, over the past 10 years, a government of distrust, and now it demands that the Canadian public place full trust in it with the Kyoto plan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten years ago, the Liberals promised Canadians they would solve the problem of the GST. They promised they would solve the problem of ethics in government. They promised they would solve the declining morale in the military. Ten years later, we know that fraud in the goods and service tax is running rampant. Ten years of Liberals at the helm have set new standards in ethics far more ethically challenged than those of any government it preceded. Ten years of spending less and less on the military have left Canadian soldiers feeling vulnerable and discouraged. Now there is a $1 billion gun registry boondoggle. What next?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broken promises have become a staple of the government. The Prime Minister is desperate for a lasting legacy. I suggest that the legacy of the Prime Minister will be based primarily on the promises he broke rather than the promises he attempted to keep.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have the promise of Kyoto. The government has promised the provinces that they will not bear an unreasonable share of the burden. It has also promised Canadian businesses that they will remain competitive. However, the government states in its documentation that it is impossible to be precise in forecasting the estimated economic impact over 8 to 10 years. It obviously has no clue as to the effect.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day Canadians are learning more about Kyoto and every day Canadians are asking more and more questions. Clearly, Canadians are growing more concerned about the unknowns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to address a few things that have been outlined in the Kyoto package sent to my office by government. One pamphlet is entitled “Challenge for Canadians”. This is what it states: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>On average, each Canadian generates just over five tonnes of greenhouse gases per year by driving vehicles, heating and cooling homes, washing and drying clothes and using other appliances. By making choices that reduce our GHG emissions, we are doing our part to address climate change.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its draft plan, the Government of Canada asks that every Canadian set the goal of cutting personal greenhouse gas emissions by one tonne.  It states: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Together, we can reduce our GHG emissions, just from small actions that we take at home, at work, or on the road.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps we should talk a bit about the need to make choices. When members of Parliament walk from their Parliament Hill offices to the centre block each day, we walk past the limousines of cabinet. It does not matter whether it is 30° below or 30° above: Those limousines are sitting there running. In the cold winter months they are running so that when the minister is ready to go, the car is all nice and warm.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> Even the environment minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Andy Burton:</b>  Of course. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During Ottawa's hot, muggy summers it is much the same. The limousines are running with the air conditioning on full blast.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government, and in particular the Minister of Natural Resources, says it is all about choices. The Minister of Natural Resources is telling Canadians to make better choices to reduce greenhouse gases. I ask the minister, is it his choice to keep his limousine idling outside the House just so he can have a warm seat when he leaves?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government plan states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>If every Canadian motorist avoided idling their vehicles for just five minutes a day, all year, more than 1.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, along with other toxic substances, would not enter the air.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministerial limousines are running for hours at a time, for hours, not minutes, as the government is asking Canadians to do. Each Tuesday the cabinet usually meets for three hours. On a typical Tuesday, that would amount to a total of more than 90 hours of idling time each week just for cabinet members. Interestingly enough, the plan states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Every litre of gasoline you use in your car produces almost 2.5 kilograms of CO2 as well as other pollutants.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can only imagine how many kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub> are being emitted by those idling limousines sitting mere metres from where I am standing right now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gets better. A major campaign put on by the Department of Natural Resources is entitled “The Idle-Free Zone”. The premise of this campaign is to help Canadians stop unnecessary engine idling. I wonder if the minister even knows about his own department's initiative. One can only wonder how the members of the cabinet are able to sleep at night knowing the absurd levels of hypocrisy they are emitting each day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the government expect Canadians to do their part when the federal cabinet is not prepared to follow suit?</p>


	<A NAME="T1315"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1315)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The department says that there is never a good time to waste fuel and generate greenhouse gas emissions by idling our vehicles. How is it possible for the natural resources minister to say one thing, yet completely do the opposite? Canadians will have a great deal of difficulty accepting this line of reasoning.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has become standard practice over the last 10 years from this administration is to ram one set of rules and regulations down the throats of Canadians only to live by a completely different set of rules. The choices being made by this cabinet today completely contradict the choices expected from Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians expect and  they demand leadership by example. Perhaps the Minister of National Resources should follow the words of Paul Graham, the Sudbury municipal project adviser whose words, ironically, are posted on the department's website:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Get your own house in order. You can't do anything with the public without getting your own house in order. The municipality must take the lead on issues like idling.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leadership starts at home. Hopefully, the Minister of Natural Resources has heard this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need for the Ministers of the Environment and Natural Resources to travel across this country looking for ways to reduce greenhouse gases. What they need to do is look at themselves and look at their colleagues around the cabinet table. The government is telling Canadians that if they really care about the environment, then they will need to exercise restraint, to become more energy efficient.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural resources minister is part of another departmental campaign entitled, “Idling gets you nowhere”. In the literature it says “unnecessary idling is expensive and causes environmental damage”. It also says “Don't count on public support if you idle unnecessarily”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance position is solid. Kyoto will not change a thing. The Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Natural Resources should come clean and admit this to Canadians. They are telling Canadians to conserve and reduce. Why should Canadians be expected to change their habits when the cabinet can simply ignore any responsibility? This is not responsible government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance is speaking for millions of Canadians who are concerned with Kyoto. Perrin Beatty, who represents Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, is one of those. The membership of his organization accounts for 75% of Canada's industrial output and 90% of its exports. When the government claims that Kyoto will not harm Canada's competitiveness, obviously it did not consult with the primary stakeholders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to read into the record what the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters had to say when the government released its plan: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The document acknowledges some of the concerns that have been raised by industry and by the provinces, but provides little more detail than the framework released previously. Canadians deserve a detailed plan that spells out the costs and necessary actions on the part of industry and individual citizens for Canada to achieve its target. There is still no clear indication of how Ottawa will address the remaining 60 megatonne shortfall. Nor is there a detailed outline of how much the incentives and programs will cost and where the funds will come from.The document says the plan 'must be a made-in-Canada approach that is based on collaboration, partnerships and respect for jurisdiction.' The acid test of whether the government means what it says is whether it will set aside its rush to ratify and give Canadians a chance to be heard first. It is far more important to get the plan right than to rush it through before Christmas.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an organization that represents a majority of Canada's manufacturers expresses caution, asking for the government to get the plan right instead of rushing it through, why will the government not listen? What benefit is it to government to ignore the interests of those who create jobs? Obviously Canadian manufacturers want and need more information. They need to know concrete statistics on the impact of Kyoto.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the Kyoto plan is simply an exercise by the Liberals for appearance purposes only. It is about saying one thing and doing another. It is about speaking out of both sides of the mouth. The government wants individual Canadians to do their part in achieving climate change objectives. The minister uses phrases such as “we expect, we hope and we intend”. These are not words of confidence. These are the words of a minister making up policy on the fly. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unacceptable to the Canadian Alliance. It is unacceptable to ordinary Canadians. The sheer hypocrisy of the Minister of Natural Resources alone will convince Canadians that the Kyoto plan is a scam. Leadership is living by example.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, what are the costs?  First, we do not have figures as to what it will cost the country as a whole.  However it has been estimated that the government wants us to go to R-2000 homes, insulate our homes more.  It wants us to go to smaller cars.  It wants us  to abandon  clothes dryer and go back to the clothesline.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accord is almost certainly to bring us increased costs for energy and for gasoline.  The estimate is that it will cost an average of $2,700 per Canadian family.  I have had questions from people in my riding about how much it will cost them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a contractor ask me recently what it would cost him for the cost of building a home and how it would cut in to his ability to survive and keep his income and livelihood.  In fact we have heard that up to 450,000 jobs are potentially in jeopardy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an ideological debate.  With so much of our industry concentrated along the border with so little potential gain to the environment, as industry moves south of the border to take advantage of economic energy opportunity there, really will we have achieved the goals that we want in reducing pollution or will we have just moved it a little a bit south of the 49th where it will continue to blow into Canada and continue to cause problems for us?  Is it not better to pursue our own energy efficient policies, wind power, energy alternatives like hydrogen and expand our hydro electric capacity?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could my colleague comment on that?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-373530"></A><a HREF="#Int-373533"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-373526"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Andy Burton: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, obviously there are huge concerns about the potential costs of Kyoto.  The government obviously does not know.  It is like the gun registry.  How much will cost?  What is the total cost?  Nobody knows.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not acceptable.  There is no question that there will be huge costs on the Canadian economy.  The right direction for Canada to go is to have a made in Canada plan, develop new technology, research and spend Canadian dollars.  It makes no sense whatsoever to send  billions of dollars overseas to third world countries to buy clean air credits.  Let us keep those dollars in Canada.  Let us create jobs in Canada working on new research and technology such as wind power, clean gas power and cleaner coal power.  There are all kinds of options out there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have huge resources in Canada.  We need to create jobs in Canada, not lose jobs.  Kyoto will cost Canada jobs.  That is absolutely counterproductive.  It is not acceptable.  I do not think Canadians will accept it.   We have to work toward creating jobs in Canada, based certainly on working toward cleaning up the atmosphere and greenhouse gases.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It needs to be made very clear that 95% of greenhouse gases are natural and 5% of the world's greenhouse gases are man made.  Of that 5%, 2% are Canadian and that is something like one-tenth of one percent.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not belittle the need for working on change and making things better but we have to look at  the cost benefit analysis. I do not think the government has a clue about where we are heading with this.  It is a terrible shame and a damned poor Christmas present for Canadians.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, when we talk about the possibility of creating new jobs and new technologies as a result of the need to meet this challenge of the environment, surely having a target is precisely what we want to have  to stimulate this kind of activity. To not have a target, I would suggest, would not give the kind of incentive to developing these new technologies that we know on which Canada is capable of leading the world.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, that is all very well said but targets without any idea of what it will cost to hit them is totally counterproductive.  We have to know where we are going with this.  We have to know what the cost will be  in terms of dollars, jobs and of lost opportunity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To simply say that we will do it and let the jobs move across the border to the lower 48th does not make any sense whatsoever.  It is not good for Canadians.

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise on behalf of the constituents of Surrey Central to participate in the debate on the motion to ratify the Kyoto protocol.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does protecting the environment mean?  It means clean air to breathe, clean water to drink, clean food to eat, clean surroundings to live in.  It means pollution or contamination free, pesticide or chemical free surroundings, no smog, no acid rain.  It means protecting our forests, endangered species and natural resources.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kyoto accord will not do any of these things.  Carbon dioxide is a naturally occurring substance that is  essential to plants and animals.  Kyoto restricts carbon dioxide emissions, not the air pollution that causes smog or acid rain, et cetera. The Kyoto accord does not deal with environmental contamination or controlling air pollution. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greenhouse gasses, which include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and sulphur dioxide, et cetera, comprise less than 1% of the air.  Water vapour, comprising 99% of greenhouses gases in the atmosphere, provides most of the greenhouse gas effect.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far science on the causes of global warming is not conclusive.  Global warming is a natural phenomenon that has been happening for millions of years.  There are other factors at play that account for global warming and need to be addressed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kyoto accord does not require Canada to actually make carbon dioxide reductions.  Therefore, being opposed to Kyoto is not the equivalent of being opposed to all efforts to curb climate change.  It is opposing a wrong political decision with a wrong approach to dealing with a serious problem without properly consulting and evaluating the repercussions and impact on Canadians and on the environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funding Kyoto would drain billions of dollars, and some from developing countries, away from worthwhile environmental concerns. The Kyoto accord will not cover countries producing two-thirds of man-made carbon dioxide emissions.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 160 countries are signatories to the protocol but imposes emission limits on just 38 countries.  Countries such as India, China and Indonesia have signed on but  they do not have to talk about reducing emissions until after 2012. Of the 38 countries, 13 have been deemed economies in transition and are essentially exempted from any deadlines for meeting targets.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifteen countries that are members of the European community are likely to meet their targets through creative accounting.  Six nations are extremely small and have equally tiny targets.  That leaves just four countries; the United States, Australia, Japan and Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the United States and Australia have already decided not to ratify.  China and India each spew as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every day as does Canada in an entire year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kyoto accord cannot come into force unless 55 countries that collectively produce 55% of the developed world's carbon dioxide emissions ratify it.  The U.S. abandonment of the treaty makes the backing of other signatories critical to the agreement's survival.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Countries that have refused to ratify are not required to reduce emissions in phase 1 of the Kyoto protocol.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority, 95% of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, is naturally occurring.  Of the 5% that is man made, two-thirds is produced in countries not ratifying Kyoto or are exempt from its targets.  There are no real penalties for those countries in the Kyoto treaty.  Countries that do not meet their targets have their overruns added to the next target like the interest on credit cards.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada accounts for only 2% of global greenhouse gases.  It will be the only country in the western hemisphere required to make significant reductions under the protocol to meet 1990 emission levels. Taxpayer dollars should be used for something worthwhile and for an effective cause, not for something ineffective or doomed to be a failure.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Liberal cabinet and the caucus are divided on whether or not the government should ratify the Kyoto protocol. Ministers of Natural Resources, Industry and Finance have varying and contradicting opinions about Kyoto. Some have indicated their reluctance to see the government ratify it at this time. Other Liberals have been sitting on the fence and watching their wet finger figuring out which way the wind is blowing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former finance minister and the Liberal leader in waiting could have shown some leadership. How can he oppose the plan and then promise to vote in favour of it? I  do not understand that. The Liberal record on protecting the environment and endangered species or dealing with pesticides, contaminations and pollutants is dismal. The Liberals have repeatedly broken their red book promises.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  provinces have no  confidence in the federal Liberal government. The provinces have not been provided with a plan, even though they must  find money to meet the targets. Conferences with the premiers have been postponed many times. British Columbia, for example, has  invested heavily in the past decades in clean, renewable hydroelectricity, which supplies 90% of the province's energy needs. British Columbia's per capita greenhouse gas emissions are the third lowest in Canada. Yet under the government's implementation plan B.C. would suffer the worst job and economic impacts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government has spent millions of dollars on so-called consultations. Despite this Canadians are generally poorly informed on the Kyoto accord. Some think the Kyoto accord is a model of a Japanese car like the Honda Accord, while others visualize images of huge plants and factories billowing great mushroom clouds of poisonous smog. Most people believe that the protocol would affect only big businesses. It is not a joke, but rather a very serious matter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government, because of the lack of a clear approach and plan, has been unable and unsuccessful in educating and informing Canadians about this most expensive initiative ever. There is no legislation in the pipeline, so how can we believe the government? To meet the 240 megatonne made in Japan commitment, the government acknowledges there is still a 60 megatonne gap and it has been unable to close the gap. The plan has a few flaws. The figures do not add up and the government does not have a plan. Just like Humpty Dumpty, the Liberals think Kyoto can mean whatever they want it to mean. This is a recipe for abuse, fraud and corruption. Kyoto is an inadequate public relations scam and fraud.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kyoto has never been about science; it has only been about politics. The only climate it would change would be the economic climate. Implementing the treaty would result in massive losses in jobs, productivity and wealth, unfairly affecting some regions of the country far more than others and devastating communities in the process. Job losses would be massive, about half a million. Domestic emission reductions alone could cost as high as $45 billion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kyoto protocol is unfair to Canadian industry and would put us at a competitive disadvantage internationally, particularly with the U.S. Businesses may simply move across the border to avoid the costs of Kyoto. With no public benefits or even global ones, we would all lose. It is a lose-lose proposition. In B.C. pulp mills could ship wood chips to the United States for processing rather than run mills in B.C. Consideration should be given to the Dutch example. A strong economy would result in better environmental protection.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must continue to conduct the necessary research to properly understand this complex issue. Clearly, today's climate change science does not provide a sufficiently robust foundation on which to base a significant and costly international treaty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should reduce real pollution as well as greenhouse gases which might be contributing to climate change by promoting: energy and resources conservation; transitional fuels such as propane, natural gas, ethanol and other biofuels; wind, solar and other alternative energy sources; and a society wide conversion to clean hydrogen fuel. We should  not leave the minister's car running and thus setting a bad example. We should also work on adapting to climate change, whether natural or man made.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance opposes ratification of the protocol, but supports policies that would lead to both a healthier environment and a growing economy.

We should find scientific reasons and invest in technology so we could make significant contributions for generations to come.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise in the House on such an important issue to the future of Canadians.  I will be sharing my time with the member for Ancaster--Dundas--Flamborough--Aldershot.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to describe the issue as people across Canada see it and as I see it.  About 90% of scientists agree that greenhouse gases contribute to global warming.  There are  about 10% who do not agree and have alternative theories.   An intergovernmental panel of 1,800 scientists has recommended a 60% reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.  We are looking at 6%.  This is a serious problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the evidence. The boreal forest out west is in recession. In the last five years Nova Scotia has had some serious storms.  Manitoba had four or five serious floods in the nineties.  There is also the unprecedented melting of polar ice caps.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a problem which we can try to ignore.  There are some members who claim we should do nothing about greenhouse gas emissions because they say they are   not a problem.  The argument that greenhouse gas emissions do not contribute to global warming is absolutely false.  Let us recognize at least among us here that this  is an issue. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some members look at this issue as a problem, and preach doom and gloom.  I and many members of our government believe this is not a problem, but rather an opportunity for Canadians and for Canadian industry as well. Opposition members should get down off their  soap boxes and stop preaching doom and gloom for the Canadian economy.  Let us look at this as an opportunity and progress as opposed to doom and gloom.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1973 the head of Ford said that the company and the industry were forced to install catalytic converters in cars to reduce air pollution.  This would cause Ford to shut down and reduce gross national production by $17 billion, increase unemployment to 800,000 and decrease tax receipts of $5 billion at all levels of government. This would result in some local governments becoming insolvent.  Some years later that same leader in the American industry said his company was continuously faced with great opportunities, brilliantly disguised as insoluble problems.  That amazing and accomplished leader of industry was Mr. Lee Iacocca. This was an example of how people who preached doom and gloom at the beginning, but  through time and actuality realized it offered solutions and opportunity for industry, private citizens and governments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been predicted that 60,000 jobs would be lost as a result of the Kyoto implementation.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> It is 450, 000.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Andy Savoy:</b> Mr. Speaker, various people have predicted 60,000 jobs, others 450,000, depending on whose estimates we look at.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk about the cost of inaction. Let us talk about quantifying those costs of inaction in terms of health costs and  costs to various industries such as the insurance industry.  Let us talk about the opportunities such as helping new industry evolve in Canada and becoming a centre for environmental technologies geared toward greenhouse gas emission reduction.  Those opportunities have not been quantified.  In fact, if we look at the cost, often the cost of inaction is not mentioned whatsoever.</p>


	<A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1340)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There would definitely be health impacts by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.   We are not only talking about CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.  When we reduce emissions, we are reducing all emissions and CO<sub>2</sub> is certainly the target.  However, we are looking at and dealing with NO and NO<sub>2</sub>, and SO and SO<sub>2</sub> in particular.  They all have levels of chemical loading in our atmosphere that are serious.  It is not only CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, there are many other types of noxious chemicals as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can agree there is a problem. Most members would say greenhouse gas emissions and global warming are issues that must be dealt with. If members talk to their constituents they would also say that yes, we understand there are issues around global warming. Where should we go from here because we know there is a problem?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intergovernmental panel consisted of 1,800 scientists.  It talked about a 60% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.  We are talking about 6%, which is modest. The question is, where do we go from here?  How do we implement this? How do we work with industry, governments, and various stakeholders to bring in an implementation plan that would be as user friendly and built on consensus as possible?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a round table in my riding specifically on Kyoto.  Some of the recommendations that came from industry, government, and individual citizens were heartening to see. They came up with a number of recommendations and thoughts on this issue. One gentleman, for instance, said that he had solar panels installed in his summer cottage to heat his water, operate his lights and heat his home in general. He said the payback on that looked like it would be about six years. It is heartening for me to see people looking at those opportunities, coming up with their own solutions, and in fact working with renewable energy technologies like solar power.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other renewable energies that we could look at: geothermal technology, ethanol and biofuels. Coming from an agricultural riding I am happy to see that biofuels offer an opportunity.  Farming is very difficult and farmers are going through rough times. We know they face international market conditions that are difficult. Farm profits are decreasing.  We have seen problems with smaller farms as well.  There is a reduction in  the numbers of smaller farms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biofuels would offer farmers an alternative revenue source because they do have the input or the natural resource to put into a biofuel process. That is something that we can explore and that is good news for the agriculture sector.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is wind energy. California has made great strides with wind energy. Prince Edward Island has 11 wind turbines that are working very well.  They are feeding into the provincial grid system and doing a great job of it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other example that was mentioned at this round table was how hot water heaters are some of the least efficient appliances in our homes.  Why is that so?  It had not been significantly questioned before.  Issues like this were brought forward by citizens who were concerned and I thought that was commendable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Habitat protection for species at risk was mentioned. I had a hard time equating that with Kyoto.  However, people said that we could look at our forests and reforestation to help rebuild habitats.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to voice my support for Kyoto. We should look at creating an implementation plan where we look, on a regional basis, to come up with regional solutions involving the consultative process.  We should bring all sectors, industry, municipalities, provincial governments, the energy sector, the resource sector, the citizens coalitions and non-governmental organizations around a table, to develop a regional approach that would address the regional issues and challenge this group to come up with solutions in conjunction with the federal government.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cannot be a top down process.  The implementation plan must be a “community up” process in my mind, where we build consensus among all the stakeholders around the table, bring them to Ottawa and hash out a plan.  </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his intervention.  We do get a little enthusiastic about some of our discussions around here and there is quite an ideological debate going on about how we should proceed to address some very important issues.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member mentioned that jobs would be created to offset the losses in industry.  Jobs would be created by innovation and by advancing energy alternatives.  Is the member implying that the only way to achieve these job gains in energy alternatives is by signing on to the Kyoto accord, which is outside of Canada?   </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned alternatives, and some good ideas came forward, such as wind, hydro, hydrogen, solar energy, geothermal, ethanol and bio-fuels.  He mentioned someone in his own riding who used solar panels to greatly increase the efficiency of his home.  But that was done, might I suggest, without Kyoto.  It has been done already. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have talked about what happened in California, where great strides are being made in this area toward energy alternatives, but that was done without Kyoto.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are great penalties associated with Kyoto if Canada does not reach these unachievable or unrealistic targets.  They are very difficult targets.  We do not know how we are going to get out there without a plan.  If we do not reach them, there are very severe penalties to our economy and that will require emissions trading abroad and transfers of great sums of money from our  country to other countries.  Therefore, would it not be better to spend that money by investing in this country, advancing the concerns and alternatives that we are all interested in?  </p>

	Mr. Speaker, one aspect I would like to address immediately is U.S. support for Kyoto.  In fact, the Attorneys General of 11 major states, including California, New York and Massachusetts, wrote to President Bush deploring his current policy as failing to mandate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.   They stated:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>To fill  this regulatory void, states and others are being forced to rely on their available legal mechanisms...[which] will necessarily lessen regulatory certainty and increase the ultimate costs of addressing climate change, thereby making the purported goals of the Administration's current policy illusory.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is widespread support for addressing climate change, but I think the process is what we should be focusing on.  I feel that the goals, at 6% below 1990 levels,  are very modest, and    I understand that there have been issues around consultation.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to focus on now in going forward is setting a target and trying to achieve that target in consultation, with industry, provinces, municipal governments, provincial governments, NGOs and citizens' coalitions around the table, so that  we can all work together to look at a solution that is implementable.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has to be done on a regional basis to make sure that regional interests and concerns are addressed.  Certainly in the case of Alberta, for example, which has a large oil and gas sector, we must take that into account in looking at job creation and opportunities for corporate growth in the oil sector. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that the issue here is not about the ratification, but more so about the implementation, in a consensus building fashion.  </p>

	Mr. Speaker, the hon. member mentioned the United States in his response.  In Sumas, Washington, there is a plant being built, just across the 49th.  We already have one plant pulling out of B.C. to move to this new location just south of the 49th.  A little community with 780 people will get 56 jobs from a formerly Canadian plant.  It will get all the hundreds of construction jobs.  There is a 600 megawatt power plant going in there, just south of the 49th, to serve this little community.  Presumably that power is destined for Seattle and California, but it is not legal for them to build the plant near Seattle or in California because of the pollution concerns there.  Yet it is being built just south of the 49th.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the hon. member really not think that with our dependence on the U.S. for our exports and our energy products a lot of our industry will just go south of the 49th?  Canada will still receive as much emissions or more and it will be at the expense of the Canadian economy and Canadian jobs.  </p>

	Mr. Speaker, again I thank the hon. member for his question.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If what he has stated, that lesser degrees of environmental compliance or regulations are the basis for companies to move to some constituencies from others, California would be bankrupt.  California is  one of the most progressive environmental communities in the world, certainly in North America.  We have seen California put forward a number of environmental issues and it was one state that said to the president that the developed countries should take the lead in combating climate change.  Developed countries should also commit to voluntarily stabilizing their emissions-- </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b>  It has as many people as we do in all of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Andy Savoy:</b> I understand, but just in closing, if we are trying to say that because of a different level of environmental regulations the exodus of companies from one jurisdiction to another will happen, then California should be an example because it has been this way for 20 years and California has seen wonderful growth.  </p>

	Mr. Speaker, the definition of leadership is to be willing to lead when the way ahead is unsure.  Anyone can go forward when the future is full of certainty, but few are prepared to go forward to show true leadership when the future is uncertain. I suggest, Mr. Speaker, that is the case with the Kyoto accord.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with countries,  as with prime ministers,  as with heads of corporations and businesses and as with ordinary people, when the time comes to lead, it has to be when one realizes it is necessary, one is called upon to lead, and the way ahead is unsure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been following the debate on Kyoto.  I actually have on my desk a  very thick file of all the speeches in <i>Hansard</i>.  There is no doubt that there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding what we are proposing to do about ratifying the Kyoto accord.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt in my mind that there is a huge political element in the lead-up to the Kyoto accord, that indeed there are some countries in the world that hope to see countries like Canada and the United States indeed sign on to the commitments involved in Kyoto to make them less competitive, so that these countries in the third world, or even in the second world, if we will, in Europe, can compete better with the products that are produced especially in North America.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There also is no doubt that there is dispute on the scientific evidence.  It is true that finally, after many years of debate, the consensus among scientists is that the climate is changing. But there is not consensus that the climate is changing because of world contributions of greenhouse gas emissions.  That is not proven. However, what is known, what is established, is that the world is under threat of pollution caused by human activity and that populations around the world are growing.  What is happening, and we saw it so well with the former east bloc countries, is that when the desire is to produce,  to manufacture at any cost,  there is a tremendous cost to the environment, an unacceptable price paid on the loss of environmental integrity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All we have to do is to go to today's East Germany or  Taiwan, for example, or many of the cities in the countries in the Far East and eastern Europe and  see the effects of unregulated pollution, where the rivers are poisoned and the air is poisoned.  Visitors from Taiwan will comment when they have been here in Ottawa  for 24 hours or 48 hours that they do not have to change their shirts because they do not have a black ring around the neck.  The air pollution  in Singapore, Mexico City and so many places around the world is very severe. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that the Kyoto accord is not really about carbon dioxide, because again we acknowledge that carbon dioxide is something that plants use and it is a non-poisonous gas that is  part of the natural environment. But the reason why one focuses on the question of carbon dioxide is that it is an indicator of other human-produced pollutants.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why it is so important, in my view,  that despite the uncertainty Canada stands up at the plate on Kyoto is that the leading developed nations have to lead on this, because the third world looks to us with great envy and sees us as the ones who have it all our way. They want to catch up and they want to compete with us in any way they can, and if that any way involves contributing to world pollution then that any way is what they will do.  So the developed nations have to lead the way on air pollution control is what it really amounts to, on cutting back on the pollutants in the atmosphere.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that whatever we do here in Canada is not going to account for that much difference in climate change. If we want to see where the real problems in air pollution are coming from, all we have to do is get on the Internet and get into those satellites that are looking down into the Middle East or Africa and see those natural gas flares that are blowing into the air in Saudi Arabia or Nigeria, or see the plumes of smoke from the forest fires and the clear-cutting in western Africa, in the Amazon and in Malaysia.  This is serious pollution. The only way that the western world, the developed countries, can get any kind of moral authority to persuade these other countries not to do this is to lead the way in  cutting back on the emissions that we ourselves create.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to lead. One of my great disappointments in this whole Kyoto process is the fact that the United States did not take the lead.  I believe that there is a tremendous will in the United States to lead in this particular way because  Americans and Canadians, North Americans, are renowned worldwide for the ability to innovate.  If there were any two countries in the entire world that could face this challenge and employ high technology and creativity to develop new strategies to control pollution, be it carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, or any of these things, it is Americans and Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is sad that the American leadership has decided not to go down this avenue that the rest of the world is calling upon it to do.  Therefore Canada has to take the lead.  We are the only G-7 nation that is prepared to take this kind of leadership.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really believe that when we made this commitment, and we are going into a world of uncertainty,   I think we will show that we can meet the challenges.  I would suggest that within a few years of going down that road, that road of uncertainty, I believe that the Americans will follow the Canadians.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened to what the member had to say.  I would simply reflect back to him what I have said to others when I have engaged in the comments on these debates and that is, it  is based on huge assumptions on all facets.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the environmental facet, one must recognize that carbon dioxide, which is the main element of the Kyoto accord, is the fourth element in our atmosphere.  As a matter of fact, nitrogen and oxygen comprise 99%,  actually it is 99.03%, of our total atmosphere.  Everything else is less than 1%. The next one is argon and following that is carbon dioxide at .033% by volume. Therefore, when  one says  that  carbon dioxide emissions will greatly affect our atmosphere, our weather, our global temperature, I think it is a huge leap of assumption.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,  Canada emits about 2% of man-made carbon dioxide.  The man-made portion of carbon dioxide production in the world is an infinitesimal amount of the total if we think of things like volcanoes and forest fires.  Every swamp that is rotting away produces carbon dioxide.  It is not reasonable to assume that the small proportion of carbon dioxide that is emitted by mankind worldwide can really have a sizable affect on the total amount of carbon dioxide in the world.  It is the same as   saying  that the oceans are too high so we had better  take a couple of cups of water out of them.  Numerically that would reduce the volume of water in the oceans, but it would be  an infinitesimal amount.  That is the first assumption.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then  the big assumption is that by actually reducing our production of carbon dioxide,  even by the percentage proclaimed here, it would have any affect at all. I think that is a huge leap. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a mathematician, a math physics major.  I did a little chemistry but probably only enough to be dangerous.  I think  we need to be very careful with what we are doing.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is are we ready to risk such huge economic repercussions for something that may  not make any difference at all?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the member for Elk Island really has demonstrated that he does not have a grasp of chemistry beyond early high school.  None of those arguments have any bearing on what I said.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  point is simply that we have to lead the way in struggling to create environmental technologies that combat all forms of air pollution.  There is no doubt.  If he had listened to my speech I would have acknowledged that carbon dioxide is not the ultimate problem. It is the problem of leadership. We have to get out there and show the undeveloped world that the developed world is willing to lead the way in reducing air pollution of every kind. It is a matter of the future of the world, the future of the planet, not a matter of a chemistry lesson that obviously the member opposite did not learn very well.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to stand today and speak to the Kyoto protocol, which  will be rammed through this place. Closure has been tabled so we know that Monday will be our last day to work with this.  I will be splitting my time with my colleague from Lakeland.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of folks out there have the mistaken  idea that Kyoto  will somehow limit the smog days and   will magically cure asthma for their kids, and so on. That is far from the truth. Kyoto has very little to do with what we know as pollution. The target is 240 megatonnes, that is  240 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> less than what we are producing now. There is a lot of speculation out there as to what that will do and what that will cost us as an economic country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It all came about based upon the Rio summit in 1992 and moving on to the 1997  meeting in Kyoto, Japan, hence the name. Before that meeting in Japan, the federal government, in its wisdom, did not consult with the provincial governments nor  the people of this country. It was    going to sign on to an international agreement but we did not know what it was buying into.  We did not know what we were committing ourselves to over the next 20, 30 or 40 years. No one really knew.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provincial ministers had a meeting in Regina, Saskatchewan, my home province. They  came up with what they felt they could handle and they presented that to the federal government. The problem was that when the federal group changed planes in Vancouver I guess they left it in the airport, because they did not honour the agreement that the premiers had put forward in Regina. They went over to Japan and proceeded to outbid the Americans. Their attitude was that whatever the Americans could do, we could do better.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has  us in a situation where  it has  signed us on to  a reduction from 1990 levels, that is 12 years ago, of 6% below what we were producing at that point. That will  make a change of about 30% of what we are at today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the big argument of whether that is valid or not, the problem is, is there an agreement that CO<sub>2</sub> is really the culprit? Is that what we need to go after? Is there really a greenhouse situation happening around the world? There are scientists on both sides of that argument and both sides have valid points, so we do not have sound consensus that this is really going on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the major players in the environmental movement, a fellow named Bjorn Lomberg from Denmark, has switched sides. He is saying that there is no conclusive evidence. As an economist he cannot rationalize why a country like Canada would commit to this sort of an anchor to drag along against the rest of the industrialized countries that are our trading partners.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Americans, the Australians and  over 100 countries went to the meeting in Kyoto.   It came down to Canada and Russia having to sign on to get the prerequisite 55 to make this thing fly. The Russians are waiting to see if Canada signs on, and then they will  because they know   we have to send them huge gobs of cash in order to make our commitments. It makes no sense at all to me that we can literally pass the buck. It is a get out of jail free card. We will send money to Russia because its emissions are down. Because it  closed a lot of factories as the Russian economy hit the skids, it says that it has  already met its requirements. It negotiated on that. Now the British are saying that they have changed all their factories from coal to gas so they have met their requirements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Australians went to the Kyoto meeting and negotiated an 8% increase, not a decrease. Since then they have backed off because their scientists are saying that this is a hoax. They are saying that the 1.4° variance that we have seen cured the ozone problem that we had. It was actually the extra heat that dissipated that hole and turned it into a myriad of little holes that are not a problem any more. They are saying that this is not the right way to go.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada produces 2% of the global emissions. That is within the margin of error so we may not be promoting that problem at all. There is just no sound science for us to do this. It is all about the Prime Minister making commitments in Kyoto and again in South Africa a few months ago, saying that he would  ram this through by the end of the year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have dragged our feet for five years. If there really is  a problem here  and a culprit   that we need to go after, why did we wait five years? In that five years the government has not discussed it with anybody. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister stood here today and said, “We have this little book. Read it. Understand it. The numbers are all in there”. The only numbers I can find are the page numbers. There is nothing in here that tells us what this will  cost. They have some wish lists here. They are talking about disposable income per household and they have it pegged at $68,000.</p>


	<A NAME="T1410"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1410"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1415"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1405"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1410)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I represent a lot of farmers who do not make 10% of that amount and this will really hit them hard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No studies have been done on the  industrial impacts.  The federal chamber of commerce has come out against this. It can see the downside of this but  nobody has  softened its fears that it will hurt the business community. We know it will, and  especially in my area of western Canada. We drill for and pump out the natural gas that goes to the United States to make it greener, which is    good for us and good for it, but we do not get credit for doing that in the Kyoto agreement because the United States is not a Kyoto signatory.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also in Saskatchewan mine some of the highest grade uranium which is turned into fuel rods so that France can make its Kyoto targets with its nuclear energy.  We get hit with the cost of the mining and the environmental damage that   goes with it but we do not get credit for helping France meet its targets.  Those are the  negotiations that should have gone on.  Where are the credits for what we actually do to help the global community do a better job?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last member talked about the third world countries looking for leadership. Certainly they are, but they are more concerned about having a full belly at night than they are about the flare on that natural gas well.  Let us get our  priorities straight.  Certainly we have to look after the environment, but their priority is eating and surviving to the next day as much as  it is worrying about environmental pollution. That is unfortunate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly there is a leadership role for Canada to play, but not at any cost, which  is what we are seeing here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government talks about the 2,000 UN scientists who promoted this and said that it was great.  They did some good work.  They came up with a variance in temperature of 1.4°C. That has happened over the last million years.  We can trace it up and down.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political spin was not good enough so     the bureaucrats and the politicians said that  it had to be higher than that or people would  not take notice.  What does the number in the book say?  It says that it could be as high as 5.8°C.  It could be but there is no science that supports that assertion, none at all.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since that time we have had 19,000 worldwide scientific community members sign on to what is called the Oregon petition, which is what turned the United States around from signing on. It said that there was no sound science, that there was nothing to say that this was for real, and that this has not gone on and on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are just too many things that drive us in the opposition to say that we had better have a look at this.   If we buy into this it will  hurt the third world.  If Canada's economy takes the hit that we think it will take  or even  half the hits that   the industry groups, the chamber of commerce, the CFIB and the manufacturers' association are talking about, we can no longer afford the half billion dollar Africa plan that the Prime Minister wants. We  will not be economically sustainable any more.  We will be scratching to feed our own folks, let alone help out the third world.  This could be a detriment if we were to really think about it in that vein.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government talks about building all our homes to R-2000 value.  In my former life in agriculture I did a lot of construction to pay for that farming habit.  We built  to R-2000 standards in 1980.  We have gone way beyond that.  R-2000 calls for R-12 insulation and double glazed windows.  We left that behind two decades ago. That is what is in this book.  That is how out of date this is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government talks about a CO<sub>2</sub> pipeline. From where to where? What are we going to do with it?  Alberta is already capturing CO<sub>2</sub> at wellheads, pumping it back into coal beds to extract the methane to get a good clean burning fuel.  Alberta is already doing that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  just visited southern Ontario.  Greenhouses there have a cylinder of CO<sub>2</sub> when they are getting their seedlings started and they crack it because it is fertilizer for plants.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North America  already is the largest CO<sub>2</sub> filter in the world. If we look at the slip stream coming in west to east and measure the CO<sub>2</sub> amounts on the west coast and  measure them as they go out the east coast, we have been a significant filter because of our agricultural productions and our reforestation.  We are already doing our part.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It just boggles my mind that we would forge ahead with this when no impact assessments have been done.   Just in the last couple of days we have seen with the firearms registry what happens when there is not consultation with the provinces and the affected groups. We get money thrown out the window trying to bury a problem. Kyoto is another example along that line of what will  to happen.     There is no plan, only we are talking tens of billions of dollars, not just one billion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In wrapping up, there is no way that we can pass the buck on this. Certainly Canada has a leadership role to play, but when we are the only industrialized nation in the western hemisphere to sign on to this, it is doomed to fail.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former natural resources minister, the member for Wascana, said, “If our American trading partners do not sign on to this, we shouldn't either because we are under the same umbrella of air”. What happened to that logic? That is the first thing I have heard from that side that made any sense and it has now been forgotten.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This argument is going to go on.  It is all about a legacy for the Prime Minister but I put it before members today that it is more about lunacy in our actions here.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-373606"></A><a HREF="#Int-373612"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-373589"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I would just observe, it is not about legacy for the Prime Minister.  It is about legacy for future generations on the planet.  The member opposite made reference to the flares and that people could tolerate the flares in the third world, that is the flares burning off natural gas into the atmosphere, in those countries where these flares occur because this is a way of keeping food on the table.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would point out to the member opposite that these flares are the result of international oil consortiums drilling for oil and burning the gas off with the agreement of the countries in whose territories they are operating.  These are governments that have made these decisions, the government of Saudi Arabia and the government of Nigeria.  These are the countries that somehow the developed world has to persuade to find that they would take other solutions that gain less for them in the short run and provide more for all of us in the long run.  In other words,  this is really not about carbon dioxide.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could concede many of the things the speaker opposite says but the reality is that this is all about Canada showing the leadership because our ally to the south, who should have been in this place on this issue, has not showed the leadership.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-373612"></A><a HREF="#Int-373617"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-373606"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Gerry Ritz: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I guess it comes down to what can we enforce on other countries if it is government to government?  Certainly we can show leadership. The Americans have not backed away from the thrust of what Kyoto is all about.  They have set their own targets.  They are doing a made in U.S.A. plan that targets 18%, virtually what they had agree to in Kyoto.  We could do the same thing, and I do not disagree with that, but let us have something that is Canada friendly, that is taxpayer friendly and that at the end of the day we have results we can measure.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with Kyoto is that we have six billion people living on the planet.  One billion out of six billion are under the Kyoto protocol.  It is doomed to fail.  I talked about us being the only industrialized country in the western hemisphere that is hamstrung with a deal that will limit us. We will have jobs and industry leave to Kyoto friendly climates. Rightly or wrongly they are going to do that.  They will take the path of least resistance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I watched a documentary the other night.  There are 100 manufacturing companies in southern Ontario that are now setting up businesses, counterparts, in China.  There are several reasons they are doing that.  There is a large, cheap workforce.  They need the products they  develop right there so they get close to the market but it is also not covered by Kyoto.  They can do what they need to do to make a buck at the end of the day and create those jobs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my mind Kyoto is totally the wrong target.  We spend all of the time, energy and money chasing the rainbow of CO<sub>2</sub>, the nasty thing it is, and we forget about the 1,200 toxic sites that the Canadian Environmental Assessment  Agency has outlined for us.  It catalogued them, including the Sydney tar ponds.  We spent $60 million studying that green guck out there and have not come up with a solution.  </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are targeting Kyoto.  We have a straw man who  we are chasing, just like gun control.  We are chasing guns instead of the bad guys.  Here we are chasing CO<sub>2</sub> instead of the really noxious stuff that we need to so that we have a healthy climate and so that we have an economy that can afford to do some handouts for the third world and show some leadership in whatever area they want us to lead.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the other night just for my recreational relaxed reading before I went to bed, I was looking over the Kyoto accord to see what it actually said.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing rather amazed me, and I am surprised that the Liberals have not glommed onto it.  There is an international committee that is set up and it is in its sole discretion going to determine whether a country has been meeting its targets. That means an international organization has the right to tax us.  We totally lose our Canadian sovereignty in that particular case.  Does the member have a comment on that aspect of Kyoto?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-373622"></A><a HREF="#Int-373627"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-373617"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Gerry Ritz: </b>

	Mr. Speaker, that is an excellent point.  We rail in this place about our sovereignty and how we need to be in charge of our own destiny, yet we sign it away in a situation like this where we cannot begin to maintain it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the Deputy Prime Minister said that we would ratify it and just never do it but that damages the leadership capability of the country in the rest of the world.  We would be a welsher.  We cannot do that.  If we decide we are going to go on something like this we had better damned well be there.  We cannot turn our back on it, make this thing happen, foist it on other countries and then not implement it.  God help us if we do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest problem we will have is ratifying it.  The penalties include another 30% in emissions tacked on and no more emissions trading credits.  Again we are hamstrung.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-373627"></A><a HREF="#Int-373637"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-373622"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Leon Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise and speak on the Kyoto accord today.  The ratification of Kyoto is an extremely important issue.  However  in listening to the speeches over the past few days, a lot of what has been said has really nothing to do with the Kyoto protocol.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many members referred to saving the planet.  Any of us who have seen an environmental problem which is a threat to the planet obviously would do anything at any cost to save the planet.  However, that is not what this is about.  Today in the 10 minutes that I have I will to try to explain what Kyoto is about, what it would do in dealing with any real pollution problems and briefly what the economic impacts could be.  I think those are the things Canadians want to know about.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Kyoto targets only carbon dioxide and to a much lesser extent methane and nitrous oxide. Combining these with water vapour creates the greenhouse gases that help control the temperature to some extent on the earth's surface.  Kyoto is talking about those are the greenhouse gases.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, clearly carbon dioxide is not a pollutant.  Plants depend on carbon dioxide to grow.  If we wish to grow plants for food, they need carbon dioxide.  To raise our animals we need plants that use carbon dioxide to grow.  Clearly CO<sub>2</sub> is not a pollutant and it should not be referred to as that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some government members have said that by controlling CO<sub>2</sub> we are also controlling some real pollutants.  These members acknowledge that CO<sub>2</sub> is not a pollutant.  They say that if we are controlling CO<sub>2</sub> because of the basket of pollutants that is released,  CO<sub>2</sub> being part of other substances being released and are real pollutants, then the Kyoto protocol, if implemented, would help deal with real pollutants.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If those real pollutants are what the government is concerned about, then why do we not put in place a policy that deals with them directly and not just as some ancillary or auxiliary part of an agreement?  This has nothing to do with the Kyoto protocol.  Why not focus on real pollution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will argue and make the point that if Kyoto is implemented, it will lead to greater pollution of the planet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, with the U.S. out of the agreement, pollution in greenhouse gas emissions would actually rise if Canada were to implement the treaty.  Many energy intensive operations in the United States use a far higher percentage of electricity generated from relatively high polluting, coal fired stations than is the case here in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, if we are to ratify Kyoto, when the United States has said it will not, we will be exporting industry and jobs to the United States, where the U.S. will be using coal which will pollute our atmosphere in a very real way.  Therefore Kyoto will actually lead to an increase in pollution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is worse, many industries will move their operations away from Canada to developing countries which have little or no control over serious pollutants which threaten human health and the national environment.  Countries such as China, India, Brazil are exempt from emissions controls.  In fact, nations exempt from Kyoto's provisions or are not ratifying it produce 80% of the emissions of greenhouse gases and a much higher portion of actual pollutants as well. If we are to export industry from Canada to these developing nations, we are in fact leading to the pollution of this planet, not the opposite.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, there is a real concern that the actions necessary to implement radical carbon dioxide reductions would result in technological switching to emissions with higher pollution.  Therefore, if we were to implement this agreement, we are in fact increasing the pollution of the planet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, economists say that Kyoto could lead to a recession in Canada and, as with every recession in any developed country, this recession would lead to a reduction in existing environmental programs. Clearly the money would not there in the economy to pay the taxes which would be used on dealing with genuine environmental problems.  </p>


	<A NAME="T1425"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1425"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1430"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1420"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1425)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of Kyoto in Canada will lead to higher pollution of the planet. The debate I have heard on this issue ignores these clearly fundamental  points which  have to be made. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this is being talked about because of what I would call bad science. There is only a small fraction of climate scientists who are prepared to  commit themselves to the idea that humans are  causing significant climate change. Many eminent scientists, including meteorologists who study weather patterns, claim that any warming we are experiencing falls well within cyclical norms. This is something the government does not often talk about, but it is a reality. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From looking at glacial ice cores they have found that  what is happening right now with CO<sub>2</sub> levels falls within norms that have been reached over the past few hundred thousand years. They have also found   that the CO<sub>2</sub> levels now are not as high as they have been at times over the past few hundred thousand years. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my knowledge, unless there was a human race before us  that I do not know about, man was not involved in raising those CO<sub>2</sub> levels a few hundred thousand years ago, yet the CO<sub>2</sub> levels were higher then than they are now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This whole debate on the  Kyoto issue is taking place due to bad science. There are a lot of other examples and quotes from people such as Dr. Madhav Khandekar, a former Environment Canada scientist, who has said  the same type of thing.  The environment minister, the Prime Minister and other people who    claim that the blizzards,  droughts and all those things somehow come from an increase in greenhouse gases, I believe, are being   fundamentally dishonest with Canadians. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientists argue that is not the case. I do not think it is healthy for debate when   people in the government make radical, extreme statements like that because  factually speaking, it is simply not the truth. How can ministers, people who are supposed to be responsible, make those kinds of claims?  I would argue they cannot, in good judgment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stress that if implemented, Kyoto will damage our environment further and  that this whole thing is based on bad science. I want to take a couple of minutes to talk about what the fallout of  implementation of Kyoto could mean.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people back home say Kyoto is just another national energy program, which damaged Alberta in a way that very few Canadians understand.  My brother lost a  rapidly developing  business directly as a result of the national energy program.  Family members lost jobs as a result of the implementation of the national energy program. It hurt Alberta, and Saskatchewan to some extent, in a way that is hard for anyone else to understand.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Kyoto like the  national energy program? No, it is different. Although it will hurt Alberta more than any other province, it will hurt every single Canadian across the country. That is what makes it different from  the national energy program. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can look at how it will hurt. According to experts, the cost of the average home may  increase by $30,000. That is the  figure being used. Every  individual, including those on fixed incomes, may see their electricity bill increase  100%. The cost of fuel at the pumps over the next few years  probably will double according to many of the experts. Other costs that people have every single day just to survive will increase  dramatically due to the implementation of Kyoto. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that, combined with the reality that Kyoto  will make pollution worse and  not better, and that it is  based on very doubtful science at the  best,  should lead us to not support the government when it pushes ratification of Kyoto through next week.</p>
