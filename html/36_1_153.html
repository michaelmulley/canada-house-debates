<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>MOTIONS IN AMENDMENT 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK18">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-53 be amended by adding after line 22 on page 2 the 
following new clause: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“2.1 The purpose of this Act is to increase the 
availability of financing of small businesses, which would not 
otherwise have access to financing.” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Mr. Speaker, I would point out that the Bloc Quebecois 
voted for the principle of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We thought it would reform the situation so SMBs would have more 
ready access to the government guaranteed capital they need but 
would not otherwise have access to under the usual credit 
requirements.  That was our understanding. 
This in fact is what the minister said initially when he 
introduced the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Oddly enough, this bill, entitled an act to increase the 
availability of financing for the establishment, expansion, 
modernization and improvement of small businesses, contains no 
provision stating that this is indeed the intent of the bill. 
Given this obvious discrepancy, the Bloc Quebecois decided to 
propose an amendment indicating clearly the purpose of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Federation of Independent Business, the main voice 
of small and medium size businesses needing financing, repeated 
to us that the bill should make it easier for small and medium 
size business to obtain funding.  The president of the Canadian 
federation stated at a press conference a few months ago that 
29% of businesses reported having great difficulty obtaining 
credit. 
Very small businesses and new businesses have the hardest time 
getting this financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of Bloc Quebecois members conducted a survey among 
small and medium size businesses. Out of the more than 800 small 
businesses that replied to these seven members, 89% said it is 
difficult or very difficult to get financing. Yet, the Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business feels that, because of the 
greater competition generated by the active presence of the 
caisses Desjardins, the level of satisfaction in Quebec is high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that accessibility is the main problem. Given that 
the act is entitled “an act to increase the availability”, it 
must provide, in its body and not only in the regulations, that 
such is its purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in no way saying that lenders should not be serious, on 
the contrary. But all of us here know that it is always easier 
to lend to a well established business whose profitability has 
been recognized for years, than to entrepreneurs who are just 
starting up, who have put all the winning conditions on their 
side, but who have to prove that theirs will be a profitable 
venture. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1015"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we hope all members will support this provision. 
Otherwise, given that a whole part of the act will now be 
included in the regulations and thus come under the exclusive 
authority of the minister, there is a risk that not only will 
the act fail to increase availability of financing, but that it 
will in fact reduce such availability. I am convinced that no 
one here wants that to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that small and medium size businesses create jobs. We 
will go back to the need to look at this capability, which has 
been recognized by everyone. But if these businesses are to 
continue to create jobs, they must have access to the credit 
they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not normal to have so many small and medium size 
businesses find such access either very difficult or difficult. 
However, we can understand why when we look at the sectors in 
which they operate. 
There are some sectors where it is easier. A new optometrist 
setting up a business is likely to obtain credit fairly readily. 
It can, however, be very hard for a small business involved in 
the production sector or high risk sectors such as new 
technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government loan guarantees ought not to apply only to loans to 
businesses that would have obtained them anyway.  Nor should 
they lead banks to assume bad risks.  That is not what we are 
saying. However, we are saying that, given appropriate careful 
consideration, small and medium size businesses must have access 
to credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to some people, things are getting easier.  Credit is 
even available on the Internet from a certain bank.  But it must 
be pointed out that ING bank, the one referred to, charges a far 
higher rate of interest and, according to what we have been 
told, loans only to businesses with proven profitability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am trying to say here is that this bill is indispensable, 
because some businesses would not otherwise have the necessary 
credit to develop, to create jobs, to continue in operation, and 
sometimes to grow significantly.  We support this bill because 
we are aware of how important it is, but its purpose must be 
clear.  That is what the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business has told us on numerous occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to call on people's sympathy, but we need to know 
just how risky it is for an entrepreneur to launch a business. 
In French we say “launch themselves”. I am not sure how that 
comes across in translation, but there is a reason for saying 
“launch themselves”.  It shows the big chance the entrepreneur 
is taking.  He puts all of his energy into it, often investing 
everything he, his family and friends have been able to 
accumulate with great difficulty. 
It is therefore important, when he has done everything possible 
for himself, for him to be able to have access to a guarantee so 
that he may obtain a loan that would otherwise not be available 
to him.  I therefore invite my colleagues to support this 
amendment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, 80% of the small businesses surveyed by us say that 
this guarantee must apply to businesses that would not otherwise 
have access to financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope, speaking for small and medium size businesses, that this 
House will agree to having the content of the title reflected in 
the bill itself.

<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to have 
the opportunity to speak to this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During debate of this bill in committee a lot of the discussion 
centred around the same thoughts as put forward by this motion. 
The motion says very clearly that the burden of proof will now be 
on small businesses to prove that they have gone elsewhere and 
were totally rejected.  From my understanding, only those who 
have been totally rejected will then be able to apply under the 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time we have an incremental amount of about 56%. 
This was talked about in the report and in the auditor general's 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wording of the proposed amendment would create a program of 
100% incrementality.  I know we continue to move in that 
direction.  There is always a desire that the Canada Small 
Business Financing Act be applied to small businesses in high 
risk areas in order to start new types of businesses and expand 
small businesses.  I have a concern about this motion making it 
100%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general on numerous occasions has expressed the fact 
that the more the program is opened up and the more we insist on 
incrementality, the greater the losses are going to be. A balance 
is required to be struck when we have a program like the Canada 
Small Business Financing Act and the intention of the government 
to have a full cost recovery over time.  The proposed amendment 
would limit the goal of achieving cost recovery over the 10 year 
life of loans under the program established in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry Canada will continue to monitor the incrementality and 
the cost recovery through independent studies to ensure that 
these two elements remain in balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the members of the standing committee who have debated 
this bill very thoroughly are very concerned about having proper 
statistics and data on an ongoing basis.  Although the bill 
insists on a review every five years, the Standing Committee on 
Industry will be bringing this up on an annual basis in order to 
make sure we have good reports and understand what needs to be 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Approving Motion No. 1 which would force 100% incrementality 
starting with this bill next April would not be fair to the small 
businesses across Canada that continue to seek small business 
loans because of their high risk factor.  We want to protect the 
new small businesses coming on stream and those that want to 
expand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that my colleagues not support Motion No. 1. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the official opposition is opposed to this motion but for reasons 
somewhat different than those of my hon. colleague from the 
Liberal Party. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1025"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT5"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT5"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1025

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially the motion states that the purpose of the act is to 
increase the availability of financing to small business.  That 
is a noble thing and something certainly we in the Reform Party 
would all like to see because we favour any measures that would 
assist small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that this entire approach, an act, a government 
band-aid solution to a problem, is not the answer.  Businesses 
have a problem in financing their enterprises right now, but the 
reason is not because of a lack of a government program or an 
inadequate government program. The reason is much deeper and more 
far reaching than that.  It is because of government 
mismanagement of the entire economy in general, but specifically 
because of the high taxes individuals and businesses are 
subjected to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the employment insurance premiums are fully 
one-third over and above the break-even point of the EI fund. That 
places a great burden on businesses.  The average Canadian worker 
pays $350 a year over and above the break-even point of the EI 
fund. The average employer pays $500.  Per employee, per working 
Canadian, that is $850 over and above the break-even point of the 
EI fund.  What does the government do with that money?  It spends 
it on programs, useless, meaningless programs, I might add, 
grants and giveaways to special interest groups, subsidizing 
things like VIA Rail, CBC and on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  What is wrong with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was just asked what is 
wrong with that.  I would like to explain what is wrong with 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September a constituent of mine called me and said “I work a 
9 to 5 job.  I make $30,000 a year.  I have a wife and three 
kids.  The fellow who lives down the street from me is on welfare 
and makes more money than I do.  Explain that to me”.  I said 
that first I would have to verify this and told him to send me 
his tax returns. I verified his income and his monthly take home 
pay after taxes. I checked with social services in Saskatchewan 
as to what an individual in the same circumstances would be 
making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituent was not quite right.  He is $220 a month better 
off than if he were living on welfare. But he has to drive to 
work every day.  He has to put gas in his car.  He has to 
maintain his car.  Not only that, on social services a person has 
full medical benefits which are not available to ordinary working 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the point.  This country's tax system is so repressive 
that people do not have a reason to go to work.  They are better 
off to sit at home on welfare. It amazes me that the Liberals can 
sit over there and somehow justify that or think it is okay. Not 
only does the excessive taxation result in a situation where 
people do not even have the incentive to go to work any more, but 
it is affecting businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I used the employment insurance fund as an example. Fully $5 
billion a year is taken over and above the break-even point of the 
EI fund and dumped into government spending programs. That is 
what is wrong with those spending programs. The gentleman asked 
what was wrong with financing CBC and VIA Rail. In a utopian 
perfect world it would be great if we could finance a railway and 
have a wonderful state-run broadcaster.  But in the reality of 
today's world, in the reality of the extremely high taxes that it 
takes to fund those types of things, the consequence is that we 
have tax system so repressive that people are better off to sit 
at home on welfare than they are to go to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is wrong with those programs.  That is what is 
wrong with a government that spends far too much money and 
involves itself in far too many programs in areas where it has no 
business being.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I get back to the small business financing act.  If the Liberals 
would just downsize government, get their little fingers out of 
every program they want to devise and spend our tax dollars on, 
and cut taxes, we would not need a government program to cover up 
or try to be a solution for the problem created by their high tax 
regime.  That is so simple yet they do not understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party would drastically downsize government.  At the 
same time we would focus spending on areas that matter like 
health care and education.   We would increase funding to those 
areas.  We would substantially cut government spending so 
Canadians would pay less tax and would have reason to go to work 
because they would have a lot more take home pay.  They would be 
able to finance their business enterprises much more effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is not access to more debt.  This program purports 
to assist businesses in putting themselves further in debt.  The 
problem is access to their own equity.  The government is taking 
all the profit in the form of taxes.  That is the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is not a government program that provides a taxpayer 
backed guarantee to businesses that cannot gain financing.  The 
answer is to cut EI premiums to the break even point.  The answer 
is to cut the size of government and to lower income taxes and 
capital gains taxes so there will be venture capital and 
businesses will have more equity.  In turn they would have no 
problem financing their business ventures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a fundamental principle that Liberals do not 
understand.  A dollar left in the hands of an entrepreneur, a 
consumer, an investor or an ordinary Canadian citizen is far more 
productive than that same dollar being taxed out of their pockets 
and sent off to Ottawa to be administered by a bureaucrat, a 
lobbyist or a politician.  That is a very simple fact but the 
Liberal government does not get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe I do not give the Liberals enough credit; maybe they do 
get it.  They are so wrapped up in their world in Ottawa, in 
their bureaucracy, in the big leviathan they have created that 
they have lost touch with reality.  They do not address the true 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that were not true, how could they possibly be contemplating 
raiding the employment insurance fund?  That fund was paid into 
by workers and employers for the insurance of employment, but the 
Liberals cannot resist getting their greedy little hands on that 
money and diverting it to places where it does not belong and 
violates the law of the employment insurance fund.  In order to 
do that they will have to change the law, and they will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need to oppose that.  Every working Canadian and every 
employer in Canada must understand they are being ripped off, 
that it is unfair and that it is harming them.  It is harming the 
economy and it is harming business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is noble in the sense that it states the purpose of 
the act is to increase the availability of financing to small 
businesses.  I agree with and support that statement, but the way 
to do it is not through yet another government program.  The way 
is to get government out of people's lives, to downsize 
government and to cut taxes so businesses can truly have access 
to more of their equity and therefore to more financing. The 
answer is simple.  I implore the Liberal government for once to 
open its eyes to that fact and to do what is right.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is amazing what Ottawa does to people. 
My friend from Saskatoon—Humboldt talked about the Liberals 
never leaving Ottawa or being captivated by Ottawa.  I do not 
mean this in any personal way to my friend from 
Saskatoon-Humboldt, but members of the Reform Party came out 
yesterday with the comments that they have decided to support the 
bank mergers.  I wonder who on earth they would have spoken to in 
the country to come up with this conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Where did you read that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  That is what I heard, that members of 
the Reform Party said they would like to have some more 
competition in banking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That is the point.  We need more 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>   However the competition is not coming 
so in the meantime it should be no to bank mergers.  Talk about 
somebody being seduced by Ottawa, being captivated and overcome, 
or being Ottawa-ized.  It is something like being customized or 
whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something else puzzles me.  My friend from the Reform Party says 
if we had the perfect world, as the Reform Party would describe 
it, we would not need this legislation.  We do not have the 
perfect world and we probably will not have the perfect world by 
the end of the week, by the end of the year or even next year. My 
friends from the Reform Party would have to agree that their 
perfect world will not happen soon, but in the meantime should we 
do absolutely nothing to help the small business sector? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Absolutely.  Reduce taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  My friend is saying that we should do 
absolute nothing.  The point is they are not the government but 
they say we should have a perfect world.  Soon my friends in the 
Reform Party will say we do not have the perfect world but we 
should do away with pensions.  In a perfect world we probably 
would not need pensions or a medicare system.  We do not have a 
perfect world and that is why we have governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the legislation do?  Is it new legislation?  No, it is 
not.  The legislation has been around for a long time. Some time 
ago somebody acknowledged the fact that a lot of creative small 
businesses, real entrepreneurs, people with good creative ideas 
could not get financing from traditional lending institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banks would not listen to them.  The banks could not care 
less about a young person with a great idea.  The banks or 
financial institutions could not care less about a new 
entrepreneur who arrives with creativity and energy but could not 
get financing because he did not have the capital to put up for 
security or because he was too creative.  The government of the 
day had to come up with something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It asked what it could do to encourage financial institutions to 
support people who create things, lead the way, are on the 
cutting edge and build the country.  What could it do?  The banks 
were not being helpful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government introduced the Small Business Loans Act. 
Basically the legislation said that if one had difficulty 
accessing financing from traditional lending institutions the 
government would provide support in terms of a guarantee.  If the 
bank felt that a group in its judgment was too risky, we would 
share in the risk, society and the bankers or society and the 
lending institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked to small business representatives, individuals 
and the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.  We have 
asked what they think about the program.  They say their members 
like it.  I recognize they only speak for 90,000 small business 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A small business organization from Halifax to Inuvik to Victoria 
could not be found that would not say it liked the program.  Most 
federal government programs are bogus when it comes to helping 
small business.  I am prepared to say that most programs are 
fluff.  Most programs sound good but do not work.  There are two 
or three that work well and this is one of them.  That is why I 
cannot understand my friends in the Reform Party saying they do 
not support it.  It is a mystery how they can say that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair country.  It is a free country.  They can support 
what they want but it mystifies me.  I ask the next Reform 
speaker to explain in some detail why they do not support it. 
I realize that they say if we had a perfect world we would not 
need it.  We do not have a perfect world.  We will probably not 
have a perfect world for another few weeks or months or years or 
decades.

election, with the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  My friend from Saskatoon—Humboldt is in 
the wrong profession.  He belongs at Yuk Yuk's on Friday and 
Saturday nights.  He is a stand-up comic.  He said the Reform 
Party would form the government in the next election.  This is 
the ultimate form of hilarity and comedy.  He is a great speaker, 
but he is in the wrong place.  He will have great audiences at 
Yuk Yuk's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats will support the amendment.  It goes to the crux 
of what the legislation is all about.  The legislation is about 
helping small businesses but not any small business.  If a well 
established small business that has been doing well for a number 
of years wants to expand into a new area, getting support from 
the financial sector is not a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend from Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre has been a small 
business operator.  He has been liaising with the small business 
community from coast to coast for many years.  He would concur 
with what I say.  For many small businesses accessing capital is 
not a problem.  For others it is a problem, particularly the 
sector we want to see expand and build.  I am referring to new 
businesses, young businesses that reflect the emerging new 
economy of the country.  They are often a little short of hard 
assets and have difficulty accessing funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment acknowledges that group.  It acknowledges people 
who would otherwise have difficulty accessing financing.  I am 
not referring to small business individuals who can easily access 
financing.  They do not need help.  It is the ones who have 
difficulty accessing funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where I differ from the parliamentary secretary.  Why 
not make the legislation exclusive and have it available only for 
small businesses that cannot get funding elsewhere and help them 
particularly?  All of those that would normally get bank loans 
anyway do not need the help.  They could probably get loans at a 
lower rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not make the legislation available only for business 
entrepreneurs, business investors and creative people who simply 
cannot find financing through traditional agencies?  We as a 
society want to see these folks expand and grow and to see our 
economy grow.  When the economy grows, jobs grow, the economy 
prospers, the tax flows in and the country gets to be a better 
place.  That is what it is all about.  That is what the 
legislation is all about.  That is why the amendment makes a lot 
of sense to me.  The auditor general has reminded us from time to 
time that was the problem and the amendment acknowledges it 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I beg my friends in the Reform Party to change their position on 
the legislation.  To my knowledge the Bloc Quebecois supports it. 
I think the Conservatives support it.  Presumably the government 
supports it because it is behind the initiative.  We in the New 
Democratic Party support it.  We need to send a signal to small 
businesses and say that we are behind them.  We want to 
particularly help small businesses that cannot access financing 
from traditional sources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my Reform friends to get behind parliament and join with 
us to say that the small business sector is where the action is. 
The small business sector is where the jobs are being created. We 
are behind small businesses 100%.  We want to support them. We 
want to encourage them.  We want to nurture them.  That is why we 
should all be supporting the legislation with enthusiasm.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to address Bill C-53, an act to increase the 
availability of financing for the establishment, expansion, 
modernization and improvement of small businesses. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1045"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members should support the amendment proposed by the 
hon. member for Mercier, since the title of the bill itself 
states that its purpose is to increase the availability of 
financing of small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Mercier proposes that this financing program 
apply to businesses that would not otherwise have access to such 
financing. This would allow increased financing to businesses 
that are in trouble. I do not understand why the Reformers seem 
to disagree with this amendment. They said repeatedly in this 
House that the act should apply only to businesses that would 
not otherwise have access to financing. This is precisely what 
the hon. member for Mercier is proposing in her motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Businesses that have access to the financial and banking 
institutions' regular program do not need this legislation to 
get financing. In fact, it would not be to their advantage to 
use this program, since the interest rate charged to businesses 
is 3% higher. Therefore, it seems that businesses should use the 
other types of loans offered by banking institutions. As a rule, 
the government should not take the place of banking institutions 
that play a role in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers who support that view should realize that the banks 
would only be too happy if this were the case. 
For once we agree, to some extent, that we should leave it to 
banks and financial institutions to deal with regular loans, as 
they do a fine job of it. In my mind, banks include the caisses 
populaires, because half of the loans made in Quebec went 
through the caisses populaires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will let the Reform Party clarify their position. However, as 
far as I am concerned, they are contradicting themselves. They 
seem bent on an ideology where government should completely 
withdraw so that individuals have so few taxes to pay, if 
any—not no taxes whatsoever, as government would disappear—or 
play such a diluted role that its presence would be 
insignificant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not surprisingly the NDP believes that government should take 
action in a number of areas, including small business. In Canada, 
98% of all businesses are small businesses with fewer than 100 
employees—and the percentage may even be higher because the 
statistics are not necessarily up to date—yet they account for 
45% of all job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much talk about large corporations. That is fine, but 
large corporations do not need such a program. They have access 
to other financing sources. This program is suited to the small 
and medium size businesses that lost significantly fewer jobs 
than larger ones did during the recession, in the early 1990s, 
and created a significantly larger number of jobs in the 
following recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small businesses ought to be encouraged, on account of the 
various sectors they are involved in within the global economy. 
I am thinking of the agri-food industry, for example, including 
fisheries and forestry; in Quebec, 90.1 % of this industry is 
controlled by small and medium size businesses. 
The forestry and agri-food sectors are active in the various 
regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Bloc Quebecois critic for regional development, this 
program to enable small businesses—especially in the regions, 
outside large urban areas—develop, have access to financing and 
create and maintain jobs for people in the regions, especially 
young people, is of great interest to me.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative member for Chicoutimi, whom I saw just now, 
knows what I am talking about, when I refer to the 
Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean region.  We have all kinds of problems in 
keeping young people in the region.  Who does most to keep them 
in the regions?  Small business, the target of this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the construction sector, 88.2% of jobs in Quebec are in small 
and medium size companies with fewer than 100 employees.  In the 
real estate sector, 73.6% of businesses are small and medium 
size.  In the wholesale sector, 66% of jobs in Quebec are in 
small and medium size businesses. 
In Quebec, in the retail sector, which is important in rural 
municipalities, in small municipalities or in big city 
neighbourhoods—small businesses are the ones closest to the 
population and provide more personalized services—59.7% of 
businesses are small and or medium size. Also, 53% of the 
companies providing services to other companies are small 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a bill to be a good one, it must meet several criteria. It 
must be recognizable by its title.  We agree with the title I 
read earlier.  This is a bill to increase the availability of 
financing for small businesses.  A title is all very well, but a 
bill must be real, must go beyond a mere title.  Its clauses, 
its content and its regulations, if possible, must go with the 
title. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suprisingly, in this case, while the purpose of the bill is to 
increase financing, not a single clause—I have read and reread 
them, because I am a member of the Standing Committee on 
Industry, where we studied the bill clause by clause—is 
consistent with the purpose.  That is why the member for Mercier 
and I are requesting greater access be provided for those really 
needing it, those who would not otherwise have access to the 
regular bank financing programs.  The government must give them 
its endorsement, because the government is not doing the 
lending.  People have to understand, this is about guarantees of 
financing.  The government is a guarantor, with restrictions and 
with control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the role of the executive.  It may not be the role of 
the legislators, but it is the role of government, through the 
executive, specifically the minister and his officials, to 
ensure that the banks see to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So that is why this has to appear in the bill.  We will talk 
more about it when we consider the other amendments, those 
proposed by the government and the Reform Party, which are 
intended to add controls and restrictions and which serve to cut 
the program that existed in the past.  We in the Bloc Quebecois 
want a better law, one more appropriate to the objective.  This 
law must make financing more available and not reduce it, limit 
it or make it unobtainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act includes so many conditions that, in the end, financial 
institutions may decide to make financing available to 
businesses that present no risks, but that could have access to 
other sources of financing. I find it very contradictory that 
this would be done in the context of a bill. Our objective is a 
good one and we are acting in good faith. When the bill was 
introduced in the House, we agreed with its principle at second 
reading. We still do, but we are now a little suspicious and 
sceptical, because we realize that the amendments proposed by 
the Reform Party would in the end restrict the scope of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We oppose restricting access to financing for small businesses. 
Rather, we would like to see such access increased. I hope the 
government will listen to our representations and realize that 
our proposals are in line with the bill. Our amendment, which 
was accepted by the clerk and by the Chair, is consistent with 
the bill and this brings to a close—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I always enjoy having the opportunity to speak in the 
House on this bill.  It was the first or second small 
business bill that I ever spoke on when I was in opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was a member of the opposition it was the first time that 
our party supported the Conservative government's amendments to 
the Small Business Loans Act.  Support was unanimous at that time 
and we put the bill through the House in a day.  When I listen to 
the Reform Party saying it is not supporting this bill, I am 
absolutely mystified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Reform Party member said in his speech concerning the realm of 
taxes that taxes are so repressive in this country. That is the 
issue. On that point I support the member.  If the Reform Party 
had any consistency or any real commitment to some of its core 
public policy thoughts it would help create a real debate on the 
issue of tax reform.  It has been the most inconsistent, on 
again, off again attempt to try to advance the debate on tax 
reform that I have ever seen in the House.  To try to weave 
something to do with tax reform into a small business act is a 
non-starter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighty per cent of the new jobs created today 
come from small business men and women.  This is the 
entrepreneurial energy, this is the realm where we get people 
rolling up their sleeves and doing a hard, honest day's work. 
This is not the realm of paper pushing.  This is not the realm of 
speculating on our dollar.  This is the small business realm 
which is carrying the country right now.  Any attempt to 
reinforce the small business realm has to be supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to see the Bloc Quebecois, the Conservatives and the 
NDP member for Kamloops, who is responsible for building linkage 
with the business community, supporting this program; everybody 
in the House but the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party founded this legislation some 26 years ago 
under the leadership of Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. 
We are happy to continue to be the warriors for small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Say it with a straight face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  I can say it with a straight face. 
It is the same with bank mergers.  I hear today that the Reform 
Party is now supporting the bank mergers.  Can it honestly 
believe that a further concentration of power for banks will be 
beneficial to small business?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is now supporting the bank mergers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we had to get into the Small Business Loans Act in 
this country was because the banks were not taking on the 
challenge of helping young people with ideas to create new 
businesses.  That is the purpose of the Small Business Loans Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a risk loan.  There is no doubt about it.  But look at the 
loan loss in the Small Business Loans Act file for the Government 
of Canada.  In relation to the number of jobs created and the 
benefits, it is minimal.  Yet today we hear Reform members saying 
that they will stand in their communities and say to all the 
small businessmen and women that they do not support the Small 
Business Loans Act.  I cannot believe it, but that is the 
position that party has taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Reform Party came to the House I will never forget the 
opening remarks of the leader.  He said “We are going to bring a 
new sense of decorum to the House of Commons.  If we see 
legislation that we feel is constructive, we are not going to 
oppose for the sake of opposing.  We will get up, we will support 
it and we will speak about that legislation in a positive way”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a piece of no-brainer legislation.  It is legislation 
that is very much motherhood, and the Reform Party, for the sake 
of political expediency, is slowing down the process of putting 
Bill C-53 through the House of Commons.  This bill should have 
been through the House of Commons, all three readings, a month 
ago, but instead we have the Reform Party slowing it down.  The 
Reform Party is putting a drag on small business in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party will continue to be the warriors for small 
business in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Tax, tax, tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is a member of 
the Reform Party saying “Tax, tax, tax”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say to the Reform Party that we are three weeks away from 
the Christmas adjournment.  We are about five weeks away from the 
budget of Canada being locked in, which will be presented during 
the first part of next February. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a passionate believer in comprehensive tax reform.  I was 
hoping that the Reform Party would focus and get some 
constructive debate going in the House on tax reform.  Where have 
those members been?  They stand up the odd time and say “tax 
reform”, but when was the last time they had an opposition day 
in the House on tax reform?  When was the last time in question 
period they put 8 or 10 questions together on tax reform?  They 
hit it now and again, sporadically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those people over there are not interested in tax reform in a 
substantive way.  They throw it out now and again as though it 
were some kind of policy gimmick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To talk about tax reform when debating an amendment to the Small 
Business Loans Act is a diversion and we will not be suckered by 
it.  The legislation will go forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not mix tax reform with the Small Business Loans Act.  Any 
day that the Reform Party of Canada wants to have an opposition 
day, or any kind of debate on comprehensive tax reform, I will 
stand in the House and support that type of debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to stand this morning to debate report 
stage of Bill C-53.  I certainly had some things to say about 
this bill, but I now have much more since hearing the last couple 
of speakers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to start by addressing a comment made by the hon. 
member for Broadview—Greenwood that Reform supports bank 
mergers.  The reason we have trouble having meaningful debate in 
this House is because hon. members across the way and sometimes 
down the way like to take the smallest grain of truth and twist 
it, distort it and re-organize it until it says something 
completely different than what it was clearly intended to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give them the benefit of the doubt.  Perhaps instead of 
deliberately misrepresenting it they are just sort of buried 
under by the bull that comes from their own side and consequently 
they make an honest mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member put out a blanket statement that Reform supports 
bank mergers.  What he forgets is that there was a long, long 
caveat involved.  We said that if the banks opened themselves to 
more competition and showed that there would be benefits for 
small business and other people, then we were prepared to look at 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How he got from that position to the blanket statement that we 
support bank mergers defies imagination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I want to put it on the record that what I said I 
believed to be the truth.  I apologize to the Reform Party.  I 
did not realize that its support of the mergers had a whole list 
of qualifications.  I am sorry I did not add that list of 
“maybe”, “could be”, “might be able to support”— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sure the hon. member's comments 
are appreciated, but I do not believe it is a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member's comments are 
indeed appreciated.  It is very gratifying to see that no matter 
which side of the House we are on we recognize the attributes of 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning the opening statement made by the Leader of the 
Opposition when we first came to Ottawa, I too said “I am not 
here to oppose for the sake of opposition.  If they come with 
good legislation I will support it.  If it is not as good as it 
could be I will try to offer constructive alternatives”.  That 
is what we are here to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to address the comments made by the hon. 
member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, comments 
which must seem at first to anyone viewing this debate as a 
paradox.  Here we have on the one side members of the Reform 
Party, people who are clearly on the side, amongst others, of 
small business, the engines of the economy of our great country, 
and on the other side we have a representative of the socialist 
workers' paradise party speaking out on behalf of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would be hard-pressed to understand where he was coming from 
if we did not realize that he holds the only socialist seat in 
the interior of British Columbia.  Every other seat in the 
interior of British Columbia, a vast province, is held by the 
Reform Party.  He is the last holdout so, naturally, he has to 
align himself with those who would support Reform in his own 
riding because his strongest and best competition is going to 
come from the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly want to address the comments made by the hon. member 
for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, as well as the 
comments made by the hon. member for Broadview—Greenwood as to 
why we think, although we strongly support small business in 
particular, there is a problem with this bill and the whole 
approach that was taken to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we support small businesses having better access to money? 
Of course we do.  We just question whether they should have 
access to their own money that is being taxed away from them in a 
variety of different ways or whether they should have to go to 
the bank to borrow money to pay the taxes that the Liberal 
government has imposed upon them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give one specific example.  I have done it 
before in a different context, but I would like to do it today 
for the edification of these members and others who might be 
listening to this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I was elected to parliament I was a small business 
operator.  When the CPP tax adjustment, the most incredible tax 
grab this country has ever seen, was brought in, I tried to make 
a comparison.  How would that have impacted on me had I still 
been in business?  I was, I think, a fairly typical small 
business operator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I operated a small residential construction company.  I had some 
people who worked for me full time.  I had some people who worked 
for me part time, on an as need basis, as the various components 
of the house construction came due.  I sat down and analyzed it 
and I decided that, realistically, I had approximately 10 full 
time equivalents between my full time people and the number of 
hours that were put in by the various part time people.  Ten full 
time jobs.  The Canadian pension plan tax increase works out to 
about $600 a year per worker.  As the employer I have to pay my 
side of that, which is $600 for me.  That is $6,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I used to build about 10 houses a year.  My profit for house 
building was about $6,000 a house.  If I built 10 houses, my 
profit was $60,000.  Of course, I had expenses.  This tax 
adjustment increased my costs by $6,000.  It represented my 
profit on one of those houses.  Actually, it was not even 10 
houses.  I built eight houses a year.  It has been so long since 
I have told this story about the CPP tax adjustment that my 
business has grown, although I have not been there.  It was eight 
houses a year.  One of my eight houses I would have to build for 
the Liberal government.  It was profit out of my pocket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then came the workers' side.  I know my workers very well and I 
know that under these circumstances, had they still been working 
for me, they would have come to me and said “Listen, we know 
that the economy is not right, that you cannot give us a big 
raise, that you are not raising your prices to customers because, 
if you do, we simply will not be selling houses and we will not 
be working.  But we cannot afford another cut in pay.  So we need 
enough of a pay raise to cover the $600 increase in this payroll 
tax”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I did that, which I certainly would try to do for those 
workers, it would mean $600 per worker, multiplied by 10, which 
would equal $6,000.  That is my second house.  That is 25% of my 
gross profit just to pay the increase in one payroll tax.  It is 
not even to pay the whole payroll tax, the entire CPP, it is just 
to pay the increase.  It would cost me 25% of my gross income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we oppose this bill?  Because this bill, instead of 
addressing those very serious problems, says to small business 
“Yes, we have overtaxed you on your employment insurance 
premiums.  We are hiking Canada pension plan premiums.  We are 
doing all kinds of other things, but we are going to save the 
day.  We are going to come up with legislation that will make it 
easier for you to borrow money to pay us”.  That is why we 
oppose this provision of the bill and in fact the whole approach 
the government has taken to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should it be easier for small businesses to get access to funds 
they need?  Yes, it should be.  Any bill that does that in a 
realistic manner should be seriously looked at and considered. 
But we have to approach it with the concept of why they are 
borrowing the money in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I have lost, as one small businessman, 25% of my gross income 
because of the increase in a single payroll tax hike, then we 
have a different problem.  The solution to that problem is not to 
make it easier for me to borrow money to pay my taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the hon. member will consider it from that point of view. 
It is said to him and to all other people in the House and beyond 
in the most sincere manner.  We have a problem in this country. 
Small business has a problem.  Helping them to get further into 
debt to deal with this problem is not the way to solve it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that he will work with us in a very non-partisan way to 
deal seriously with the real problems that small business has and 
to find a realistic way out of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As he knows by the debt crisis the country faced and is starting 
to find ways out of, the way to solve our problem as a nation and 
as a government in whole is not to foist it on someone else, it 
is so that we can all do better together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member is grateful for the information he has 
just received.  I know the member has other points of view that 
will counter.  We can go off on tangents all over the place and 
say this does not agree with that.  We need a starting point. 
Today we are debating government's helping access for small 
business to borrow money.  That is the point of view we have to 
start from.  That is the point of view we have to stay on today. 
I hope all Liberals will reconsider their position in light of 
the facts that have just come out.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak to this bill, because its topic is, of 
course, of interest, and besides the kind of business addressed 
by this bill is worthy of attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do small businesses mean to us in Quebec and in Canada? 
These are our corner stores, our hairdressers, our 
professionals, our dry-cleaners, our restaurant owners, our small 
manufacturing businesses with three, four or five employees, 
very small businesses.  I believe it is our duty as MPs to take 
advantage of this opportunity to congratulate them for their 
labours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because they are so much a presence in our daily lives, we are 
not always really aware of them. 
When buying a paper, taking shirts or suits in to be cleaned, 
going to our dentist, we tend not to realize these men and women 
work very long hours and have a multitude of problems to deal 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are always asking themselves: How will I make the money 
last 'til the end of the month?  How can I gain a bigger market 
share?  Can I afford to buy out my competitor?  Do I need to 
think about a strategy agreement with the competition?  What am 
I going to do?  Sales are not picking up enough, and the bank is 
pressuring me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know how the banks operate these days.  The six major 
banks are making billions in profits.  As we say in 
Côte-de-Beaupré, when it's time to pull the plug, so long! 
You are reminded of your payments, and then you go belly up 
taking with you one, two, three or five employees with their 
families, parents, who do not qualify under existing employment 
insurance regulations. It is a one way ticket to poverty.  That 
is the reality of small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we should take this opportunity to congratulate and 
thank them.  There are some in my riding.  I know because I go 
there regularly.  Last week, we were on parliamentary recess, 
but we were not on holiday.  Even though Parliament was not 
sitting, I am sure that the 301 members in this House did not 
treat themselves to a week of holidays doing nothing.  We worked 
in our ridings, and I respect parliamentarians for this.  I am 
sure all 301 MPs worked hard last week.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are not sitting here, we are working in our riding. 
Since we in the Bloc Quebecois are sure the Parti Quebecois will 
be returned in the November 30 election in Quebec, we took the 
opportunity to meet people and talk with our constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pay tribute to these business people, to the 
SMBs in Beauport, Côte-de-Beaupré and Île d'Orléans, in the 
tourism sector and in all other sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to determine the Bloc Quebecois' position on this 
bill—I think all observers recognize that we are not interested 
in conventional politics—my colleague, the member for Mercier 
and Bloc critic for industry, developed and sold to caucus a 
survey to be sent to small businesses to get their opinions on 
certain matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 45 Bloc members in caucus could simply have said “We think 
it should be put this way”.  We wanted to consult and hear from 
those concerned about the topic, those on the front line.  We 
developed a survey, and in my riding of 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans we are doing 
the final compilations.  I have received some 70 or 75 
responses.  I want to thank all of those who took the time to 
fill out the questionnaire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was most useful. As my colleague, the hon. member for 
Mercier, mentioned earlier, I think we have received more than 
1,000 questionnaires, perhaps as many as 1,200 by now, and they 
keep coming in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hinted at the problems faced by business people; they do not 
always have the time, when they receive a letter from their MP, 
to immediately sit down and fill in a questionnaire. They set it 
aside until they have a minute available, often at the end of a 
long day. The owner of a convenience store that closes at 11 
p.m. may get around to this kind of thing around midnight or 1 
a.m. They must be commended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Responses keep coming in. We have received approximately 1,200 
so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on these questionnaires, we have been able to develop the 
Bloc Quebecois' position on Bill C-53. There were a number of 
expectations regarding this bill. One might have expected it to 
contain provisions to improve access to credit for small and 
medium size businesses in Quebec and Canada. 
One might also have expected a program making credit available 
to those who might not obtain financing otherwise. We also 
expected this legislation to provide business people with tools 
to finance their working capital in order to ensure the growth 
and development of their businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in this bill to improve the situation for small 
and medium size businesses. Regardless, given its purpose, our 
party will vote in favour of Bill C-53, as I think my colleague 
from Mercier indicated. However, we urge the government to very 
seriously consider the amendments put forward by the Bloc 
Quebecois to ensure that the legislation truly meets the needs 
of small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want the good news for these businesses to be only 
that the small business loans program is maintained, but rather 
that it is maintained and improved. 
The purpose of our amendments is to correct the deficiencies we 
have detected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be an opportunity for debate, at committee stage and 
again at third reading. We urge the government to seriously 
consider the amendments introduced in good faith by the hon. 
member for Mercier on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me emphasize a few, starting with the first amendment, 
dealing with section 2 of the act, to ensure the purpose of the 
act is clearly stated. To some extent, insufficient financing is 
worse than none at all, since the business cannot grow as it 
should. This amendment therefore endeavours to clearly define 
this program to provide financing that would not otherwise be 
available to small and medium size businesses.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our second amendment concerns clause 13 and is aimed at 
broadening the scope of pilot projects to include the financing 
of working capital in order to ensure the growth of small 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last two amendments we will be bringing forward concern 
clauses 18 and 19, and their objective is to go beyond the 
simple accounting vision of the small business loans program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After hearing the witnesses who came before the Standing 
Committee on Industry, we realize that not only are the 
macroeconomic effects of the program not measured, but they are 
not even known. Therefore, we are proposing that employment be 
taken into account in measuring the usefulness of this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to do more than just tighten up the old SBLA. The Bloc 
Quebecois believes that the accounting review proposed in this 
bill cannot be made without assessing the need for economic 
development. These amendments are vital to economic development 
and to job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I know you represent an Alberta riding. Look in 
your riding to see what type of businesses have created jobs 
over the last five years. Of course we would all like to see 
major industrial developments creating 2,000, 3,000 or 5,000 
jobs. Of course we would all like General Motors to open a plant 
in our own region and create 1,200 jobs. There is not one single 
member here who would be stupid enough to say “thanks, but no 
thanks”. We would all be happy about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But who has created jobs in Canada and in Quebec over the last 
five years? It is not large businesses. Just look at the 
numbers. 
I worked in the pulp and paper industry for 14 years. The number 
of workers in that industry has decreased considerably over the 
last five years because of modernization and automation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who creates jobs and economic development? Small and medium size 
businesses, and they need the encouragement of this government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am happy to speak on Bill C-53.  I oppose this bill, which I 
spoke to at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members have talked about bank mergers and the Reform 
Party opposing the bill for the sake of opposing.  That is 
garbage.  We are not opposing the bill for the sake of opposing. 
My party's leader was accused of something he did not do.  That 
is normal practice for them.  The media used to do that but have 
learned a lot and do not do it anymore.  Canadians have learned 
about that and my colleagues from the other opposition parties 
are learning that.  However, the Liberals are slow to learn. Some 
of the members will never learn, but let us forget about that and 
talk about the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 was put forward by the Bloc member for Mercier. The 
motion is similar to the motion proposed by the Bloc in committee 
during clause by clause consideration of the bill.  The Liberal 
MPs in committee saw it as a friendly amendment but they voted 
against it anyway.  We also voted against it, not because we are 
against increasing access to financing for small businesses but 
because we do not believe the way to do it is through taxpayer 
funded programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is entitled an act to increase the availability of 
financing for the establishment, expansion, modernization and 
improvement of small businesses, but that is not what the bill is 
about.  The Liberals have failed to change the bill to suit 
market needs.  The official opposition would support the 
modernization of the Small Business Loans Act, the precursor of 
this bill, the Canada small business financing act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to support improvements in financing for small 
businesses because we recognize that small businesses are the 
backbone of our economy.  They are the ones that are creating 96% 
of the jobs in this country.  However, the Liberals are proposing 
something which is not good enough. I will give the reasons why 
the official opposition is not supporting this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective of the bill is to increase the availability of 
loans to small businesses.  We mean incremental loans.  This bill 
does not provide significant additional loans to what is already 
being provided by the financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 a study showed that 46% of the beneficiaries would 
obtain loans anyway even if the SBLA was not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill does not address the lack of working capital 
availability for small businesses.  We are talking about equity 
of the businesses not debt financing.  We need better tools for 
small businesses. The Canadian economy has evolved significantly 
since 1961 and essentially this legislation remains unchanged 
regarding types of assets eligible for financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The service sector, knowledge based sector and information 
sector form a much greater part of our economy today and have a 
high net employment growth. Their needs are not addressed in this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 does not address those needs.  These questions 
require careful consideration in reviewing this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not provide for capital leasing which is important 
for small business. The bill does not provide adequate review of 
risk analysis. There is no provision for losses. The borrowers 
are not guaranteed.  The financial institutions are guaranteed; 
even if they make bad decisions their decisions are guaranteed, 
but small businesses are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason our party is not supporting the bill is because 
of the job creation record which is very bad.  According to the 
auditor general the displacement effect is negative.  The 
government is boasting that the Small Businesses Loans Act 
creates jobs but that is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not put a mechanism in place to control the 
financial institutions not to charge an administrative fee, which 
they are not entitled to.  They have been charging the 
administrative fee when the loans have been provided under the 
Small Businesses Loans Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important check should be that related borrowers do not 
abuse the system.  The larger companies will form smaller 
companies or subsidiaries and will abuse the system because of 
the threshold limit. The auditor general has found 23 examples 
where related parties will collaborate and abuse the system.  The 
act targets small businesses.  It is meant to support small 
businesses, not large businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Information on results provided to parliamentarians is not 
adequate.  It is not sufficient.  We cannot monitor the output. 
We cannot look at the results of the implementation of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry Canada does not audit any accounts until a file becomes 
a claim file.  When the file is a claim file it will be audited, 
but before that no one cares about it.  No one looks into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are a number of the reasons that the official opposition 
will oppose this motion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1135"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Federation of Independent Business has been saying 
that if the current abuses of the Small Business Loans Act were 
curbed and if the parameters of the program were restricted, this 
program would require less of an allocation of funds while being 
effective in meeting the program's objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thresholds for financing are too high.  The legislation 
defines small businesses as those firms that have up to $5 
million in sales.  What kind of small businesses are we talking 
about here?  We are talking about medium size businesses.  The 
Small Business Loans Act is targeted.  Its objectives are to 
finance small businesses, not medium size businesses and not the 
large businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Large businesses are getting enough subsidies from this 
government.  Twenty-five million dollars was given interest free 
to Bombardier, a firm in Quebec. Does the government give 
interest free loans to small businesses?  No.  Canadians know 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The job creation record and so many other things I mentioned 
will make sure that the official opposition is firm in its 
decision not to support this motion.  I will not go into more 
detail.  That is enough for members to learn something and to 
look into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until suggested amendments are addressed, how can any member in 
this House support the bill?  The department needs to clarify 
expectations and develop indicators of the program's performance 
in establishing, expanding, modernizing and improving small 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition is for small businesses but in the true 
sense.  We do not want to have legislation in place that has no 
teeth.  We do not want legislation in place just to give the 
opportunity to pat the government on the back when it is not 
doing anything good for small businesses.  Small businesses 
already pay high taxes.  We know how employment insurance and CPP 
premiums are killing jobs and killing small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the reasons the official opposition and I in 
particular will not support Motion No. 1.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise in this House to speak to Bill C-53 and to support Motion 
No. 1 moved by my colleague from Mercier: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-53 be amended by adding after line 22 on page 2 the 
following new clause: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“2.1 The purpose of this Act is to 
increase the availability of financing of small businesses, which 
would not otherwise have access to financing.” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the small businesses we are concerned about, and it is 
unfortunate to note that, while the bill is necessary and we 
support it, it does not meet all our expectations.  It contains 
no provision for further improving the situation of the SMBs as 
it stands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Bill C-53 does not give SMBs greater access to credit.  It 
does not make financing available to businesses that could not 
have it otherwise.  We must understand that, in the context of 
this bill, SMBs unable to obtain financing from the banks at the 
moment should not look for anything more from this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No mention is made of financing SMB working capital and, as we 
well know, this is a major problem in most SMBs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the issues in this bill are quite apparent in the reading of 
it.  It might be a good idea to remind ourselves of the 
importance of SMBs in our economy. 
In 1995, the most recent census year, SMBs with fewer than 100 
employees accounted for 99% of the 935,000 businesses operating 
in Canada.  That is huge.  This represents our business employee 
payroll.  They therefore employed 42% of private sector workers 
paying 38% of all salaries.  There is nothing small about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The SMBs are also fragile.  These same statistics indicate that 
15% of them go out of business in the first year of operation. 
More than half the businesses that existed in 1989 were no 
longer on the market five years later, when the census was done.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall, the Bloc Quebecois is in favour of Bill C-53, but we are 
very disappointed that the revision of this bill does not pay 
more attention to small business loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also add, as far as issues and context are concerned, 
that the wages paid by small and medium-sized businesses are far 
less than the impact they have on employment.  Average wages are 
therefore markedly lower than those of big business, and close 
to two-thirds of salaries in Quebec come from big businesses or 
major institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question may arise: “Do you have any proposals, do you have 
a position on this?” Yes, the Bloc wants to see legislation that 
serves small and medium-sized businesses. 
The amendments proposed by my colleague, the hon. member for 
Mercier, are intended precisely to enhance, to improve what our 
small businesses need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need provisions to improve access to credit for small and 
medium-sized businesses in Quebec and in Canada.  In two 
different surveys, including one by the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business, 29% of small and medium-sized business 
owners report that the availability of credit is one of their 
main preoccupations, if not the foremost.  In other words, 
one-third of small business owners are continually struggling to 
find or renew credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the second survey, carried out by Bloc Quebecois MPs among 
small and medium-sized businesses in their ridings, 89% of 
respondents report that it is very difficult, or difficult, to 
get credit at a reasonable rate. 
Only 10% of small and medium-sized businesses responded that they 
were able to find funding in their community with any ease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some small and medium-sized businesses—and we had proof of this 
when we met with the bankers and caisse populaire people—are very 
well known in their own little circle.  The relationship of 
trust between the lending agent and the new or potential 
business is therefore a given.  This is not the same when the 
small or medium-sized business is in a larger riding, or in an 
urban area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But that is not the only thing.  There has certainly been a 
change as far as the lenders are concerned.  A few years ago, a 
woman wishing to get a loan to start up a small business had to 
face a most ridiculous situation. 
The first question she would be asked was: “Do you have a 
husband?” The second one was: “Is he gainfully employed?” The 
third question was: “Can he secure your loan?” I am not going 
back to ancient history. This is very recent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, some institutions were more open and lent more and more 
often to women. It was realized that, because women were more 
concerned and had a greater need for security, there were fewer 
bankruptcies among women than among men. 
We have gone beyond that first stage and women are now able to 
get the loans they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But today there are others who are experiencing the same 
stressful situation, namely young people.  Our young technical 
school and university graduates are full of ideas.  They are our 
wealth and they are prepared to start on a small scale.  They no 
longer have this mentality of trying to get a job with large 
businesses or government organizations, since jobs are now very 
scarce in these sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do these young people full of ideas and initiative do when 
they graduate from university? They go to a banking institution. 
That institution will not ask them if they have a husband or a 
wife, but if they have a father or a mother. These young people 
go through the same process that we women went through, perhaps 
10 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that the process is so difficult. This is why 
we would like the bill to include a program giving access to 
credit to small and medium size businesses that would not 
otherwise have easy access to financing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I referred to young people. I also want to talk about innovative 
businesses and ventures, several of which make it. If EDP 
businesses had been prevented from getting financing, we would 
not be near where we are now. At the beginning, it was 
considered risk capital, but then it was realized that, on the 
contrary, this was a solution for many. It is also risk capital 
in the case of innovative people such as weavers. Who will 
finance a weaver? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to give businesses the means to fund their working 
capital, so as to ensure their growth and development. Some 
businesses sell tires. It is a seasonal industry. They have a 
tough time maintaining their working capital. The same goes for 
the horticultural industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these small and medium size businesses have fixed costs. 
They must modernize their operations, they have to deal with red 
tape, and they need accountants, legal advisors and other 
experts. These are all costs of doing business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the little country girl in me would like to tell you 
that Quebec's Solidarité rurale has said that one job in a small 
rural riding is equivalent to 1,000 jobs in a city.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to speak on this first motion, but I must say I cannot 
support it because the whole premise of this bill is wrong.  It 
represents a transfer of wealth from successful businesses and 
workers to people who want to be successful businesses and 
workers perhaps even in competition with the people who are 
providing the funding through their guarantees for the loan 
program to proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general in his report has already proved that it 
does not work to create jobs that way.  We do not create jobs by 
trying to take away jobs from someone else by robbing them of 
income and capital to expand their businesses.  So it is just the 
wrong way completely to go about the whole financing for small 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not deny for a moment that small businesses are a source of 
most of the jobs in Canada.  Like my colleague from the Kootenays 
who was speaking earlier, I have been a small business 
entrepreneur since the time I arrived in Canada in 1979.  I too 
had to find financing to start a business and to begin employing 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1980 when I was first starting up my business in Canada I had 
a new idea in telecommunications.  Because it was a new idea that 
the banks had never seen before they would not lend me any money 
to get started.  But never for a moment did it cross my mind that 
I should somehow lobby government to provide some sort of 
taxpayer funded protection for me to start my new idea.  That 
never even crossed my mind as an entrepreneur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found other ways to raise the money through private venture 
capital and people who would grant me a lease on a new business 
and so on.   I was able to get started without the banks.  My 
business was extremely successful.  It grew very well and I began 
to employ people. When it had grown to the size of about 12 
employees I sold the business and I moved into another area of 
business which relates to this bill very well. That business was 
financing small home based businesses through lease programs.  I 
actually filled through my small business one of the niches that 
the banks would not fill, to help small fledgling businesses with 
financing, in particular the ones that worked from home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of businesses these days are started at home. They have 
difficulty getting financing to buy their first fax machine, 
computer, office desks and all the equipment they need to be in 
business for the first time.  My company filled the gap by 
providing financing to that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem was that sometimes in order to finance the company 
we would have to put a mortgage on the person's home.  As soon as 
we did that in my company it became an investment, not a 
business, and we were taxed at 50%.  That was 50% tax on a 
business.  As a direct result of the government stealing away 50% 
of what we made by helping that small business it prevented us 
from investing in more businesses.   The government took so much 
off we did not have the capital to help more businesses.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am illustrating here is a very effective way for the 
government to help small businesses to get financing. It should 
not tax so heavily the venture capitalists and the people 
providing leases and mortgages to help small business. It should 
cut the taxes for that group and then that group is left with 
more capital in its businesses to help the fledgling businesses 
get started.  We are then not taking taxes from other successful 
businesses for these new ones to start being in competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, small businesses can always find financing if they have 
a good idea but it is the price of financing that becomes the 
issue.  What happens with this type of bill is that taxpayers end 
up subsidizing the price by providing guarantees to the banks in 
order to take more risks. Is that really a just sort of thing to 
do, to cause taxpayers to subsidize the price of money that 
people want to borrow for their good ideas?  I do not think it is 
a just way to approach the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accessing capital is the problem.  It should not be done through 
this type of bill where we use taxpayer funded guarantees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the member for Broadview—Greenwood mentioned that the 
loan losses were minimal.  That may well be the case.  I believe 
about 6% of the loans are in default at the moment.  However, 
that is really not the question.  The issue is not how many of 
these loans are in default.  It is whether it is the right way to 
go about lending money to small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is who should absorb these losses.  Should it be the 
taxpayers, the entrepreneurs, the venture capitalists or the 
creative financiers out there?  I think it should be the 
entrepreneurs, the venture capitalists and the financiers.  It 
should not be the taxpayers who absorb the losses.  That is the 
whole point.  This bill is the wrong way to go about helping 
small businesses with their finances.  All it does is use other 
people's money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have said hundreds of times over the past five years in 
the House, it is so easy for members on the other side of the 
House to take other people's money and hand it out to other 
people because it does not come out of their pockets.  The 
question I have to ask all members on the other side is if they 
had to finance a small business asking for money, would they give 
it the money out of their pockets.  That is what it comes down to 
in the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would be much better off encouraging the private venture 
capitalists and small lease companies like the one I ran before I 
came to this House.  We should help those companies by lowering 
their taxation in order to have more capital available to help 
these small businesses get started.  That is certainly the way to 
go about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about bank mergers a bit this morning.  Government 
members all went ballistic that maybe Reform would support the 
bank mergers if we got a few conditions imposed.  Why not make 
one of the conditions for a successful bank merger for them to 
provide some sort of venture capital at a higher risk management 
level for small businesses?  We have a magnificent opportunity 
here to talk with the banks and start bartering some conditions 
without having to ever put a single dollar of taxpayer guarantee 
on the line.  We could do it by bartering conditions with the 
banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are plenty of good ideas out there.  I hear them from my 
constituents all of the time.  There are other ways to approach 
this which is really why the Reform Party is opposed to this 
bill.  We really believe it is the wrong way to go about it.  All 
that will happen in the long term is that the amount of 
guarantees and the size of the portfolios will continue to 
increase until we end up with the taxpayer on the hook for more 
and more.  It could be completely avoided by approaching it from 
a different position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When banks take a look at these proposals that come before them 
from small business it is not because they could not care less. 
That is a common idea that we put forward but if I use my own 
example in 1980 when I was trying to get financing for my 
telecommunications business, I could tell that the bank would 
have liked to have lent me the money if it could have found some 
way to make it fit its profile and if it had the confidence that 
my idea was one that would work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to make the banks out to be ogres because they 
turned me down.  They made a sound business decision on the basis 
of the criteria on which they lend.  It is a loan officer's job 
to lend out money.  That is what they are there for. 
They keep their jobs by lending out money.  They want to lend 
money.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly do not hold a grudge against the banks for turning 
me down.  It actually missed out on making a tremendous amount of 
income because I took my business to someone else, to a private 
financier who made all the interest from the start-up costs as I 
got my business off the ground.  The profit went to other than 
the banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not always that they could not care less.  I do not 
believe loans officers have that attitude.  I think they do their 
best to lend if they can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament I have had people approach me from 
time to time who were upset that their loans were turned down or 
the loan applications were turned down or they had been to the 
federal business development bank and could not get financing. 
When I took a look at their situation, I would not have given 
them the money either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some people on the other side who think that 
entrepreneurs starting a new business should not have to take any 
risk, that somehow everybody else should take the risk but not 
the person with the idea.  We have to get a balance.  Some of the 
suggestions I made earlier in my speech would be good, practical 
ways to handle the situation and that is why I am voting against 
the amendment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to 
speak on this bill and on the amendment moved by the hon. member 
for Mercier. In so doing, she speaks for all would be 
entrepreneurs who cannot make sense of the financing assistance 
process for projects that may not meet traditional business 
criteria in our capitalist system. She speaks for the people who 
need a hand, a little extra assistance and special attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our duty to some extent, at the government level, to 
ensure attention is paid to this kind of project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all our ridings, we have people coming to see us with some 
interesting and dynamic projects, projects requiring the second 
generation assistance to small business that was and can still 
be provided through the SBLA program, but which we would like to 
see improved in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a great deal of competition to start up businesses at 
present. Many people have been told for years to get into a 
different line of work. Young people are being told they ought 
to start up their own businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the amendment moved by the hon. member for 
Mercier is to go beyond technical and housekeeping changes and 
give those who want to start up a business a real chance to do 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is particularly true in regions like mine, in KRTB and the 
whole Lower St. Lawrence region. 
There are business assistance programs like the self-employment 
assistance program to help establish what is known as very small 
businesses. What is also needed is programs that help businesses 
grow, through tailored support and follow up, to give those who 
are interested in starting up a business an opportunity to do 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This spirit, this willingness are not to be found clearly in 
this bill. We think it should be supported because it contains 
interesting provisions, but there is still room for improvement. 
It is possible to give it more of a social flavour to allow 
businesses to blossom in this country and to allow young 
entrepreneurs to go into business. These entrepreneurs are not 
necessarily young in terms of age, but there may be young 
entrepreneurs of 40 or 50 years of age who, after a career in a 
field where jobs have disappeared, see the opportunity to go 
into another field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not necessarily have all it traditionally takes right 
from the start. They may occasionally be rejected by banking 
institutions whose approach is based on accounting. One can 
understand this vision that financial institutions have, but we 
must ensure that, at the government level, we allow more and 
more businesses to open. Small and medium size businesses are 
the ones that create the most jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my region, for example, there is a multinational, Bombardier, 
that has a dynamic and interesting plant that is doing well. 
However, when the economy slows down or when business is a 
little slow, we must have people ready to fill the void quickly 
and to submit their projects. And we must listen to them so they 
can launch and carry out these projects.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is often a question of attitude in receiving the 
applications. To have an open attitude, financial institutions 
must feel the government is behind them to support this type of 
project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our first amendment, adding clause 2.1, is aimed at clarifying 
the purpose of the bill. In a certain way, insufficient funding 
is worse than no funding at all. Without sufficient funding, a 
business cannot develop as it could and as it should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a comment we frequently hear from people who started a 
business and who come to see us. They often did it with a 
maximum of energy and a minimum of resources. 
They manage to survive, but they would need an extra hand, 
particular assistance, a specific kind of assistance.  Help to 
really give people a hand up is not available at present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first amendment proposed by the hon. member for Mercier is 
aimed at clearly defining the program so that it will also 
provide financing to small and medium size businesses that would 
not otherwise have access to financing.  The door must be open, 
a chance given, the idea given a chance to expand and to be 
realized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps one of the ways to assess how relevant and effective the 
legislation has been, a few years down the road, would be to see 
whether fewer of the people who have set up businesses end up 
coming to see their MP feel frustrated because the program was 
not sufficiently flexible to give them a chance to get started, 
whether they have been getting a better reception when they go 
knocking at the door of the financial institutions and the 
development agencies because there is legislation covering 
financing, and whether this bill gives them more latitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation is particularly true for women.  A number of 
women in my riding come to me saying “It is a reality that we, 
as women, are more used to being straightforward in our personal 
activities, used to telling it like it is”.  They do not 
necessarily have the traditionally male salesman's gift of the 
gab, but when they come in to see their bankers they paint a 
very clear picture of the reality of the business they want to 
set up.  They are not there just to “sell” it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may have negative impacts for them at present, but it would 
be important for financial institutions to be more open to their 
needs.  Women with plans to open a business set out all of the 
advantages and disadvantages and to put everything on the table. 
They must not be penalized for doing so. 
Knowing the advantages and disadvantages, what counts is finding 
a way to deal with them and how help can be given.  The bill 
before us is one of the tools that can be used in this context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be flexible, providing opportunities to women with this 
sort of business proposal, who do not fit the traditional mould. 
We are not talking about equality in presentation, in 
organizations deciding on these matters, on loans in financial 
institutions.  People's attitudes need to change and we can help 
bring about this change by amending the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we can apply the same reasoning to young people. 
Special efforts have been made in Quebec, among other places, to 
develop job training.  We have started up the machine again. 
Five years ago, the last Liberal government almost stopped 
giving people job training; today we have started the machine up 
again.  These people we are training, who will be plumbers, 
carpenters, electricians and workers in new areas of technology, 
will need a boost to be able to start up businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twenty-five years ago, when people were working in these fields, 
they often worked for others.  Now, these people often have to 
take over the business and they need the right conditions.  Our 
bill on financing for small and medium size businesses needs 
flexibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can make sure, for example, in the case of people who are 
reaching the age of 55 or 60 and getting ready to sell their 
business, that there is a way young people can take over and 
thus provide for their family and help our regional communities 
to achieve their full potential.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Without questioning the entire bill, I think the Liberal 
majority should look very carefully at the constructive 
amendment proposed by the member for Mercier.  This amendment 
simply recognizes the fact that the government is responsible 
for more than rubber-stamping the decisions made by financial 
institutions.  It is responsible for giving small businesses a 
boost.

end, and this is why it needs improvement.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have been listening with interest to such terms as 
risk capital, investment and all other terms which the people in 
my constituency are using a great deal these days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last two days and in the week previous to coming back to 
the House a minimum of 13,000 small businesses located across the 
beautiful constituency of Souris—Moose Mountain are in deep 
financial problems.  They are not unlike other businesses in 
Canada.  They have a huge capital investment.  They also have a 
huge expenditure each year of operation.  They have reached the 
point in the last year where their annual income is down 70%. The 
bad news is that the forecast for these 13,000 businesses is that 
they will be down even further in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These businesses are sitting with a minimum of $500,000 or more 
in capital outlay with huge taxes, tremendous taxes which have 
gone up some 48% in five years.  The products they put on the 
market are literally worth nothing.  These primary businesses do 
not qualify for the same protection as the bill is talking about. 
They do not qualify under this type of loan.  They do not qualify 
under the loan guarantee.  They are simply sitting there 
suffering and many will close up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go to the cities and the towns and talk to small businesses. I 
ask what they would truly like more than anything else.  The 
other day I went to see the person who runs the Dairy Queen. It 
is great stuff; there are no calories in it or anything.  The 
owner of the Dairy Queen asked me to send some people who had 
change in their pockets so they can continue their spending 
habits.  I checked with the manager of another store and asked 
how were her sales this August compared to last August.  That is 
the month when parents get their kids ready to go back to school. 
Her response was that it was the worst August since the business 
was established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am referring to is directly related to the bill.  Because 
these 13,000 small business people are currently going down the 
tube they will pull down a proportionate number of other small 
business people in towns and cities with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring to our primary industry in Saskatchewan.  It is a 
high investment.  They vary in age.  Many of them, 70% in some 
areas, have to work for other businesses to support their 
businesses.  I conducted a research of three separate RMs and the 
lowest was 50%.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk about business loans, business ventures and 
everything else, but if the government does not take a look at 
how it will support Canada's number one industry which is going 
down the tube it is useless to have the bill before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I beg the government to take another look at the situation faced 
by these 13,000 farmers in my constituency, many of whom will not 
be farming next spring without some assistance. Other businesses 
will go as well. They get no guarantees.  They cannot draw upon 
money which is theirs.  They cannot take advantage of similar 
government programs.  I learned that under NISA they cannot even 
draw from their own accounts if they are working off the farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent three weeks trying to pacify young people of 40 years of 
age who are walking away and leaving what was left by their 
ancestors, leaving what was their dream.  While the government is 
taking a look at the bill I beg it to remember the 13,000 small 
family businesses in my constituency.  The bill may assist 
businesses but it will be an absolute failure unless it takes

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are debating Bill C-53, an act to increase the availability of 
financing for the establishment, expansion, modernization and 
improvement of small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the mind of the minister, it is just another version of the 
previous legislation. Several members from various parties, 
mainly opposition parties, have proposed amendments. 
Among these members, my colleague from Mercier proposed several 
amendments, one of which I find particularly interesting. I am 
talking about Motion No. 1, which was moved today, November 17, 
and which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“2.1  The purpose of this Act is to increase the availability of 
financing of small businesses, which would not otherwise have 
access to financing”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, the banks are not really interested in providing 
financing or lending money to small businesses that are not 
absolutely viable. In other words, it is a lot easier for a 
financial institution to lend money to Bombardier, for example, 
or to General Electric or to another big company like Loblaws, 
than to do so to a small business with assets of three quarters 
of a million or a million dollars. 
This small business often creates proportionally 10 to 20 times 
more jobs than these large multinationals that think more about 
money than about creating jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, I took part, with my colleague from Mercier, in 
a large poll in my riding. I polled more than 1,300 small 
businesses about the financing offered to them. I was amazed at 
the response rate I got and I realized that financing is 
essential and that it is also a concern for the vast majority of 
our small businesses. For example, when there is the slightest 
doubt, the interest rate on a loan goes up 1 to 3%.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, if a business must pay maximum interest, its survival 
becomes even more problematic. But there is worse. Someone 
phoned me last week, when the House was not sitting, and invited 
me to meet him and visit his small business. That person showed 
me a letter from a banking institution asking for additional 
guarantees or the institution would demand full payment of its 
loan within 48 hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bank is putting a gun to the head of this business owner, 
who employs 10 people in a small rural community. This is a 
major cause for concern. He turned to another lender who agreed 
to provide financing, but at a much higher rate than was to be 
expected at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our small and medium size businesses have the right to expect 
provisions that will increase access to financing for them, both 
in Quebec and in the rest of Canada. They are also entitled to 
expect a program that makes financing available to small and 
medium size businesses that would otherwise have a much harder 
time getting financing elsewhere. Such provisions would also 
provide entrepreneurs with the means to fund their working 
capital—and that is important too—to ensure the growth and 
development of their small and medium size businesses. These 
comments were made when I polled 1,300 of these businesses in my 
riding of Frontenac—Mégantic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-53, as introduced by the minister, does nothing to 
increase the availability of financing for small and medium size 
businesses. It simply changes how the government's total 
commitment is calculated, but there is no increase. The 
underlying principle that guided this review of the SBLA does 
nothing to meet the needs of small and medium size businesses. 
The government is much more concerned about figures. 
Bill C-53 does not help provide financing to businesses that 
would not otherwise have access to such financing elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that small and medium size businesses 
currently create many more jobs than large businesses employing 
500 or 1,000 people. There are fewer and fewer of these large 
companies, with the result that, overall, small and medium 
size businesses generate many more jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in 1994, businesses with less than 100 employees 
accounted for 41.2% of all jobs in Quebec. I imagine the 
situation is essentially the same in the rest of Canada. In 
Ontario, that percentage is a little lower, at 34.7%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past 20 years or so, in Quebec and many other 
countries, employment in small business has increased 
significantly, rising from 36% in 1978 to 45% in 1993. Everyone 
agrees, and the figures are there to prove it beyond any doubt, 
small business is number one in creating jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small business plays the most significant role in job creation, 
especially in agriculture, fisheries and forestry. We must 
recognize also that it adds value to regional production. The 
expectation is that the jobs will remain in the region.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take hog houses for instance. What good is it to have hog houses 
in a given region if, once hogs have reached their ideal weight 
for human consumption, they are shipped by truck or train over 
hundreds of kilometres to facilities where they will be 
slaughtered, processed and shipped overseas or sold for domestic 
consumption in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in the rural region where these hogs were raised, who had 
to live with the smell of the manure spread on the land, are not 
happy with just a few jobs. 
If the hogs could be slaughtered locally and if the carcasses 
could be processed locally, hundreds of direct jobs on the farm 
and in the hog industry could be created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing goes for the maple syrup industry, where we could 
do some processing locally. Instead of selling the syrup in 
45-gallon barrels, we could sell maple candies in beautiful 
gift-wrapped boxes, and things like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, throughout the country, small businesses have been the main 
source of job creation locally. For more small businesses to be 
established, they need to be able to obtain the necessary 
support and financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, before I came to the House, I got a call from 
Lac-Mégantic, where preparations are underway to set up Place aux 
jeunes. As you know, we raise and educate our children. 
They often choose to get some training or go to university in 
some of Quebec's larger cities and many of them never come back 
to the Lac-Mégantic area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, Nathalie Labrecque is working with the CFDC and the Comité 
jeunesse de la région de Lac-Mégantic, in the Granite regional 
county municipality, to set up a group called Place aux jeunes. 
With appropriate financing, we could provide our young people 
with the support they need to start up their own business.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak on Bill C-53 at report 
stage.  Once again, unfortunately, the government is using a 
band-aid solution on something that is exceptionally important to 
Canadians.  It is not getting to the essence of the issue and it 
is not dealing with the specific and effective solutions that 
could be implemented today to dramatically improve the health, 
welfare and economic future possibilities of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues have and will mention the flaws in the bill, that 
it is a band-aid solution and that it puts on the shoulders of 
Canadians a $1.5 billion liability. Instead of providing these 
small funds to businesses what the government should be doing is 
creating the climate to improve the business community in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now talk about specific, pragmatic and effective 
solutions the government can do in conjunction with its 
provincial counterparts to improve the economic situation in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start at the top, with fiscal policy.  The government can 
introduce a process for a 10% reduction in expenditures, not by 
putting it on the backs of the provinces but by truly reducing 
the expenditures within the public sector.  It can do this in an 
effective way by making sure that the good people it has working 
in the bureaucracy are able to do the jobs they are trained and 
tasked to do.  At the end of the day all the hard work they do 
will result in action as opposed to the situation we have now 
where most of us in parliament are running around in a circle 
because of all the work we have to do which does not result in 
action, as opposed to having a system where meetings, tasking and 
work actually result in action and outcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could also enact balanced budget legislation.  A balanced 
budget law could be enacted and I am sure the government would 
find a lot of acceptance on this side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have asked for a debt reduction plan for a long time.  The 
government has not set debt reduction targets yet.  It can and 
should do that.  By having and setting targets we have goals.  If 
we have goals, we have objectives.  If we have objectives we have 
something to shoot for. 
Right now there is absolutely nothing.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next thing it can do is stop providing loan guarantees to 
businesses.  We have created in North America a corporate welfare 
state where money is being given to the private sector, 
particularly big businesses, not little ones.  This is not 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should multimillion or multibillion dollar companies receive 
money from taxpayers?  That is what we saw in the case of 
Bombardier and other companies.  This is completely unnecessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has continued to fail in improving the taxation 
policy. I have gone around, as most of us have, and asked and 
consulted with the private sector, with small businesses. What 
did they say? They begged and pleaded for a reduction in taxes. 
They said  the government does not need to give them money but it 
needs to give them the ability to create jobs.  They cannot 
create jobs given the heavy tax burdens they have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we came here we have said that those tax burdens are 
killing jobs.  If the government does not believe this, let us 
look at where economies have worked and where they have not.  Let 
us look at economies where they kept high taxation and what they 
did after the taxation levels were lowered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>England and Ireland had high taxation rates and complicated 
rules and regulations but have reduced them dramatically.  As a 
result their economies are booming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some on the left like to cite the example of northern Europe. We 
need to look at Sweden.  Sweden had a very high tax policy and 
when it reduced those taxation levels the economy boomed 
dramatically. That is what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments and countries that pursue a high taxation policy 
kill their economies.  Governments that pursue a low taxation 
policy and lower regulations improve the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at our case.  My province of British Columbia is the worst 
place in North America to do business, bar none. Premier Clark 
likes to point his fingers to the far east and say it is the 
Asian flu.  Our economy was in trouble long before the Asian flu 
hit.  The statistics are there to prove that all across the 
resource sector and many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at Alberta and Ontario where they have lowered 
taxation rates, where they have lowered the rules and 
regulations.  As a result those provinces are improving 
dramatically in their provincial economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does British Columbia not do that?  More important, why does 
the federal government not do that?  Why do the feds not take it 
upon themselves to intelligently look at this taxation system, to 
look at what has worked before and lower the taxation levels that 
are weighing like a huge rock on the shoulders of Canadians, be 
it in the public or in the private sector? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a 20% reduction in personal income taxes, which can be 
done.  A marrying and harmonizing of the PST and the GST could 
lower this.  Also, why not look at a flat tax or a simplified tax 
system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was having meetings last week in my riding, as most of us 
were. People asked repeatedly why we cannot simplify the tax 
system. As individual citizens, many people require a tax 
specialist to do their taxes.  That is absolutely insane. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the Minister of Finance not work with the minister of 
revenue to put some of their people together to see how to 
intelligently simplify our tax system to make it fair and 
applicable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party has repeatedly suggested that we increase the minimum 
taxes somebody pays, lower the tax rates for everybody. We have 
proven that those in the lowest socioeconomic groups would 
improve dramatically.  We have to make sure they, most of all, 
are taken care of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, because taxation rates would be lowered all the 
way through, including the business sector and the upper levels, 
they would then have the ability and the tools to create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The left likes to talk about hitting the rich, hitting the 
businesses.  What happens when taxes are increased for the 
business sector?  They leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Comparing our taxation system to that of the United States, our 
primary competitor, a family of two income earners will earn 44% 
more in the United States than in Canada. 
That in part is contributing to the brain drain. We are losing 
our best and brightest.  It is also contributing to the loss of 
businesses.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the government can see that and it can act.  If the 
government were to act and consult with other parties, it would 
find agreement in pursuing this common agenda.  Why the 
government does not do this is beyond me.  I think it is beyond 
many Canadians who see what is going on try to understand why 
this is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other things can be done.  There are the regulatory policies. We 
have a great ability to institute regulations.  We have to 
analyze whether those regulations are actually working and if 
they are not, to remove them. Every government department should 
look to see whether regulations which have been implemented 
previously are necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now we are piling regulations on top of other regulations 
rather than trying to determine whether or not a regulation is 
necessary. There would be widespread approval if this year the 
government took it upon itself to rapidly develop a task force to 
look at these regulations, eliminate the ones that truly are not 
necessary, and then set up an ongoing process to evaluate the 
necessity of the rules and regulations that we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government needs to work with the provinces on 
labour policy.  Many rules and regulations in labour are not very 
effective. I would like the government to look at the U.S. 
experience with right to work legislation because where it has 
been employed there has been a dramatic increase in employment. 
There has been a dramatic increase in the order of $2,000 to 
$3,000 per person who is working in a state with right to work 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly encourage the government to work with the provinces 
on the issue of education. Our education system needs to be 
revamped radically in order to provide our young people with the 
opportunities they will require in the future.  I could go on at 
length about the education system. I hope I will have an 
opportunity later in the day to talk about that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this bill 
replaces the Small Business Loans Act in order to reform the 
Small Business Loans Program. The purpose of the program is to 
increase the availability of financing for businesses with gross 
annual revenues of up to $5 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is aimed at increasing the availability of financing 
for the establishment, expansion, modernization and improvement 
of these businesses by allocating, between the minister and 
lenders, portions of eligible losses incurred by lenders in 
relation to loans of up to $250,000 to such businesses for those 
purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will continue to be liable for 85% of the losses 
on loans not repaid, with the rest being the lender's 
responsibility. The financial conditions regarding the loans 
remain the same, that is 3% above the prime rate for variable 
rate loans, and 3% above the mortgage rate for fixed rate loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides for the continuous operation of the program 
subject to a comprehensive program review every five years. It 
limits the minister's aggregate contingent liability to $1.5 
billion for each five-year period. As for the department, it does 
not have to compensate lenders for losses incurred when its 
total contingent liability for the loans exceeds $1.5 billion in 
a five-year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also authorizes the minister to conduct compliance 
audits and examinations. 
A whole new series of measures are included in the legislation 
to provide for the audit and examination of various reports to 
verify that this act and the regulations are being complied with 
in respect of a loan, including that the lender has exercised 
due diligence, as provided in the regulations, in the approval 
and administration of the loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before the House authorizes the establishment and 
operation of pilot projects to determine whether the program 
should be extended to include loans to the voluntary sector and 
capital leases. The minister's maximum aggregate contingent 
liability in respect of each project is provided by an 
appropriation act or another Act of Parliament. The pilot 
projects have a maximum duration of five years.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the bill reforms the offence and punishment provisions. 
Anyone found guilty of an indictable offence is liable to a fine 
not exceeding $500,000 or to imprisonment for a term not 
exceeding five years, or to both. However, anyone found guilty 
of an offence punishable on summary conviction is liable to a 
fine not exceeding $50,000, where it was only $1,000 previously, 
or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to 
both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also provides for a comprehensive review of the program 
every five years, in consultation with Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After this brief overview, I would like to address the crucial 
issues underlying Bill C-53. 
The Small Business Loans Act is crucial to small and medium size 
businesses. Since these businesses are the engine of our 
economy, Bill C-53 deals not only with issues directly related 
to small business, but also indirectly with the issues of job 
creation and productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know how important small businesses are to our economy. A 
few figures tell all there is to know: in 1995, when the most 
recent recession hit us, small businesses with fewer than 100 
employees accounted for 99% of the 935,000 businesses in 
operation in Canada. These small businesses employed 42% of wage 
earners in the private sector and paid 38% of all wages and 
salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, small and medium size businesses are fragile. As a 
matter of fact, nearly 15% of them shut down during their first 
year of operation, and more than half of the businesses that 
existed in 1989 were no longer in operation six years later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, the annual rate of new business start-ups exceeds 
that of closures, allowing the renewal of this pool of employers 
and jobs. In many cases, this high rate of closure of small and 
medium size businesses is caused by insufficient credit. That is 
why governments, particularly the Quebec government, are forced 
to develop complementary programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the Bloc Quebecois supports Bill C-53. However, we are 
still disappointed by this review of the Small Business Loans 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the right to expect certain things in this review of the 
SBLA. For example, we had the right to expect provisions that 
would give small and medium size businesses in Quebec and Canada 
increased access to credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to a survey conducted by the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business, 29% of small business owners say credit 
availability is one of their main concerns. Moreover, according 
to a survey of small and medium size businesses conducted by 
members of the Bloc Quebecois in their ridings, 90% of them said 
it was very difficult or difficult to obtain credit at a 
reasonable cost. Only 10% said it was easy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also had the right to expect a program that increases credit 
availability for those small and medium size businesses which 
would not otherwise have access to financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same survey by Bloc Quebecois members, just over 50% of 
businesses feel that the small business loans program ought not 
to guarantee loans except those to small and medium-sized 
businesses which would not otherwise have access to credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we would have been justified in expecting this new 
legislation to give entrepreneurs the means of financing their 
working capital so as to ensure the growth and development of 
their businesses.  In fact, 80% of small and medium-sized 
businesses responding to our survey feel that the small business 
loans program should also cover financing for working capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what is there on this in Bill C-53?  Unfortunately, nothing 
that will make any further improvement to the situation of small 
and medium-sized businesses.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-53 does not improve small and medium-sized businesses' 
access to credit.  There is merely a change in the way the total 
government commitment is calculated, but in actual fact no 
increase.  The main reason behind this revision is not the needs 
of small and medium-sized businesses, but the accounting concerns 
of the government, unfortunately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-53 does not make it possible to provide funding to 
businesses which would not otherwise have access to funding.  By 
focussing its reform on accounting concerns, the government has 
not included in its assessment the macroeconomic effects of the 
loan guarantee program. 
It is in fact taking a step backwards in terms of the Small 
Business Loans Act by strengthening the requirement for 
diligence by the banks in according loans under this program. 
In fact, small and medium size businesses that cannot find 
financing with the banks should not expect things to be better 
under this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also no mention of financing of working capital for 
small and medium size businesses.  There is no provision on this 
in the bill, not even in what has been called the pilot 
projects.  However, small and medium size businesses have 
clearly expressed their needs in this area.  For these reasons, 
the Bloc Quebecois has proposed amendments to make a law that 
truly serves small and medium size businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want the good news for these businesses to be more than just 
the fact that the loans program is extended, we want it to be 
the fact that it is improved too. 
This is the aim of the Bloc Quebecois amendments, which attempt 
to respond to the major shortcomings we have noted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More is needed than simply tightening up the old legislation. 
The Bloc Quebecois considers that the proposed changes in 
accounting require an examination of the need for economic 
development.  These vital amendments are being proposed for 
reasons of economic development and job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are proposing an initial amendment to clearly establish the 
aim of the bill.  Insufficient funding, in a way, is worse than 
none at all, because the business cannot develop as it might, 
and, more importantly, as it should.  This amendment therefore 
is intended to clearly define the program so it may providing 
financing to SMBs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have other amendments as well, and I will leave it to my 
colleagues to tell the House about them. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise in debate today on Bill C-53 with respect to 
Motion No. 1 which was put forward by my hon. colleague from 
Mercier, that the purpose of this act is to increase the 
availability of financing of small businesses, which would not 
otherwise have access to financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make it perfectly clear at the outset what my caucus 
colleagues have already said.  The official opposition strongly 
supports small business, the principal job creator and generator 
of economic activity in this country.  There is simply no doubt 
about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that probably a majority of the members of our caucus 
have had direct involvement in small business or are small 
business people and understand the kinds of challenges that small 
business people face.  I think it is something members of all 
parties in this House share.  We all understand that small and 
medium enterprises without a doubt over the past 20 some years 
have been by far the major creators of jobs, prosperity and 
incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question we must really ask ourselves is what is the most 
effective policy that the government can adopt to promote the 
growth of small business.  There are really two basic approaches 
that can be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first approach is for the state to intervene and to take 
money away from people through taxation and in so doing to 
destroy their profit incentive, to destroy their efficiency and 
to destroy the potential creation of jobs in order to finance 
government support schemes like the Small Business Loans Act loan 
guarantees.  That is one approach.  It is an approach which the 
Liberal Party, the government opposite, generally supports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other approach is to say that government ought not to be in 
the business of picking winners and losers but that business 
people ought to be allowed to do business without extensive 
interference by government by means of taxation, regulation and 
legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is essentially the approach that we in the official 
opposition support.  For that reason we oppose the amendment and 
the bill because they go in exactly the wrong direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need rather than sarcastic comments from colleagues 
opposite is a vigorous policy which will unleash the unrealized 
dynamism of small and medium Canadian entrepreneurs.  There are 
hundreds of thousands of jobs waiting to be created in Canada 
today if only federal and other levels of government would get 
out of the way of people who are struggling to create employment 
through small business but are unable to because we face some of 
the highest tax rates in the developed world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We face them in payroll taxes, in capital gains taxes, business 
taxes and property taxes.  Canada has among the highest property 
tax rates as a percentage of our GDP in the entire OECD.  We face 
them in income taxes.  We face them in sales taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ask small business persons in the country and they will say they 
have become for all intents and purposes unpaid tax collectors 
for the government.  They have to collect the GST.  They have to 
fill out endless forms for the same GST which the government said 
it would abolish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Give them tax relief so that small business persons realize 
benefits after having spent their entire lives risking capital, 
their life savings, pouring endless and incalculable value of 
sweat equity into their businesses.  The government at the end of 
the day tells them that after all they have poured into the 
businesses, all the jobs created, all the risks taken it will 
take one third or more of the capital gains of small businesses 
through the pernicious, destructive, job killing capital gains 
tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were really concerned about creating a growth 
environment for small business and job growth through small 
businesses it would stop playing around the margins with this 
kind of state intervention, this kind of $1.5 billion taxpayer 
liability through the small business loans guarantees.  It would 
stop bureaucrats picking who are going to be winners and losers 
in the marketplace and it would let entrepreneurs be 
entrepreneurs, invest in their businesses and reap the rewards. 
Imagine that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me utter a word which may be unparliamentary, profit.  It is 
a good thing.  I know my colleagues opposite think it is a dirty 
word.  They do not like the words profit driven.  That sounds 
like an American concept.  We in Canada do not like profits. We 
like the bureaucrats absorbing those profits because members 
opposite think they know better how to spend those profits 
accumulated through taxes than do the small business people who 
pay them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the choice we face in the bill and in all the fiscal 
decisions we make here.  It is whether the bureaucrats and 
politicians know better how to pick and choose winners and losers 
among the hundreds of thousands of small businesses in the 
country or whether consumers and business people themselves know 
best how to create the conditions for growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say unequivocally and unapologetically that we like the 
profit motive.  It creates wealth, businesses and jobs, and we 
know that the kind of tax burden imposed by these tax happy, tax 
and spend Liberals is exactly what destroys the conditions for 
growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak to many of the interest groups that 
represent small business and various associations that appeared 
before committee in support of Bill C-53.  Let me be honest.  It 
is a constituency I am very sympathetic toward.  Many of them 
appear before committee and parliamentarians and say they want 
tax relief but they also want all these loans, grants, guarantees 
and diversification programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My message to those advocates of small business is for them to 
make a choice.  Do they prefer tax relief as the principal policy 
for small business or government intervention?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all my experience and after having spoken with thousands 
of small business people, I believe that ten times out of ten the 
majority of small entrepreneurs will say they prefer tax relief 
to government intervention, the kind contemplated in this bill. 
There is no doubt about it.  We cannot have both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The small business community and its institutional voices need 
to choose which direction they want to take. The only way 
parliament and the government will deliver the meaningful, 
creative and dynamic tax relief we need is if we get government 
spending under control.  The place to start and the first element 
of government spending which should be reduced or eliminated is 
direct government support for business, whether it is through 
grants or loans or guarantees. Maybe it is radical but I believe 
that a dollar left in the hands of a small business person is 
several times more effective, efficient and productive than that 
dollar taken away, circulated through a costly bureaucracy and 
spent by a bunch of politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at the experience in the country to see which 
basic policy option works.  We need to look at the experience of 
my home province of Alberta where we have maintained the lowest 
tax rates, no sales tax, the lowest small business tax rates and 
the lowest income taxes.  We have unbelievable economic growth 
there.  Let us cast our eyes to some of the eastern provinces 
where there have been very high degrees of government 
intervention, subsidies, loans, grants and guarantees for 
businesses.  What we see are stagnant growth rates and high 
levels of unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economic record is there for all to see.  That is why I call 
on all my colleagues to oppose this motion and this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak on the amendment moved by my hon. colleague for 
Mercier during debate on Bill C-53, an act to increase the 
availability of financing for the establishment, expansion, 
modernization and improvement of small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague's proposed amendment reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-53 be amended by adding after line 22 on page 2 the 
following new clause: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“2.1 The purpose of this act is to 
increase the availability of financing to small businesses, which 
would not otherwise have access to financing.” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be better prepared to speak on this bill, I asked that a poll 
be conducted in my riding of Rimouski—Mitis. Nearly 300 small and 
medium size businesses responded, answering a dozen or so 
questions to help us get a picture of their situation on a 
day-to-day basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly, we would have hoped for a rate of participation 
higher than 25%, but we must understand that, generally 
speaking, small businesses and extremely small businesses often 
do not have enough staff available to respond to all such 
inquiries. Much of their time is apparently taken up by 
mandatory paperwork; so, more often than not, when they want to 
participate in a democratic process like this poll, they do not 
have the time or staff to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something interesting came out of the information we gathered. 
More than 55% of the small businesses in my riding have been in 
operation for over ten years; 15% have been in operation between 
six and ten years; 25% between two and five years, and about 5% 
less than two years.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also interesting to note that 50% of these businesses are 
managed by men, 20% by women and 30% jointly by men and women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of small businesses started by women keeps growing. 
In fact, where previously 14% of small businesses had been in 
operation for more than 10 years, nowadays 32% have been in 
operation for less than 2 years. What this means is that women 
are setting up more and more small businesses, which in turn 
create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small businesses are a major source of job creation and economic 
development in our regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Respondents were asked how easy it was to get financing, based 
on their opinion or experience or that of their neighbour. 
Eighty-five per cent of them stated that it was difficult or very 
difficult to get financing at a reasonable cost, based on their 
own experience and that of other small business operators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those that said it was difficult or very difficult to obtain 
credit at a reasonable cost based on their own experience, we 
checked to see if there were striking differences between their 
perception of their own situation and their perception of the 
situation of others. Ninety-one per cent of respondents thought 
the situation of others was the same as their own or worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, 68% of business owners who said it was easy to obtain 
credit, based on their own experience, thought it was more 
difficult for other owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were intrigued by one thing in particular. Knowing the 
importance of small business to the economy of both Canada and 
Quebec, the government is now proposing to amend the existing 
act. 
Unfortunately, 70% of respondents to our survey—naturally we do 
not want to make any generalization—said they did not know the 
act that is being amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three questions dealt with the credit needs of small business 
owners. Question 6 sought to determine if the act should be 
accessible to all small businesses or only to those which could 
not otherwise obtain credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first instance, the legislation would apply universally, 
whereas in the second instance, it would be a last resort. 
Question 7 dealt with the notion of risk associated with the 
type of business or the type of project that needs financing, 
which has a direct impact on the level of risk guarantee 
provided under the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the act help businesses without taking into account the 
level of risk involved or apply only in cases where the level of 
risk is considered reasonable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, question 8 asked the opinions and the needs of 
entrepreneurs regarding the purpose of the loan guaranteed under 
the act.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection, ought the bill to guarantee only loans on 
equipment, real and personal property, or ought it to also 
include the working capital of a business? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixty-two per cent of our respondents felt that all small and 
medium-sized businesses ought to be able to avail themselves of 
the legislation, regardless of whether or not they could borrow 
money in other ways, or fund their projects in other ways, 
unlike the present situation, which limits access to only those 
which would not otherwise have access to funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see that a sizeable number of women are launching 
businesses of this type, one is entitled to expect a degree of 
openness in this area, since it is without a doubt almost 
universally recognized that women generally have far more 
difficulty than men in obtaining credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, 91% of owners believe loans guaranteed under 
the act should be made only if the risk presented by the company 
or its plan is a reasonable one. This shows how wise the people 
in my riding are, as they call for a more universal opening-up of 
credit, as well as for guidelines and for only reasonable 
projects to be funded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this research and in the responses that came from our 
constituents, we also found out some very interesting things 
about the reasons small and medium-sized businesses succeed or 
fail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will probably have a chance to speak again in this debate in 
order to provide more detail on the points of view expressed by 
the men and women in my riding. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to rise today to speak to Bill C-53. My colleagues 
mentioned some relevant points earlier as to why we are opposing 
the bill, especially my colleague from Calgary Southeast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Bloc have been talking this morning about the 
survey they have done and the feedback they have received from 
small businesses.  Those are the bases of their argument.  I have 
been running a small business for the last 15 years and what I 
will say is based on experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small businesses, as we have heard constantly, are facing 
financial crunches.  Access to credit for them is very difficult. 
Bankers present an opposite view, that they are working very hard 
to give access to small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On one hand we have constituents complaining.  On the other hand 
the financial institutions are saying that they are doing a great 
job.  Something is not right.  Let me tell the House why it is 
not.  From my experience banks do not understand small 
businesses.  That is the bottom line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the last 15 years I have been in business I was afraid to go 
to the banks to ask for money.  This fact has been recognized, 
but we cannot stop entrepreneurial spirit.  That is the strength 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have they been doing?  They have been using other means. 
Even the banking industry admits that they are accessing credit 
cards at high interest rates.  They are accessing from their 
friends at high interest rates.  Why? It is because banks have 
not fulfilled their needs, irrespective of what promises they 
have given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As usual, the government that wants to say it is doing something 
comes up with a program for giving guarantees so that small 
businesses can access funds. 
The program has been there for the last 25 years.  Why are small 
businesses still complaining that they cannot access credit 
despite the fact that the same legislation we are talking about 
has been in existence for the last 25 years?  It makes us wonder. 
Obviously there is something wrong.  My colleagues have already 
mentioned what is wrong.  The high cost of doing business is 
killing small businesses.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last 15 years I have been a small businessman I 
identified two costs that have been rising.  Profits have not 
been rising.  Competition is coming, but two costs have been 
rising. One is anything to do with the government, the 
bureaucracy. That is one of the single highest costs that is 
rising: taxation, user fees and government paperwork. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is the cost of doing business with the banks.  Banks 
have many means of raising their charges to small businesses. 
There are straightforward service charges.  They come along and 
tell them the service charges, but there are costs associated 
with overdraft privileges and high costs associated when cheques 
bounce, which is not their fault in any event.  This is a huge 
burden.  The economic climate of high taxation, bureaucratic 
interference and paperwork is killing the spirit of 
entrepreneurship.  As my colleague said, it hits directly at 
profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government said that it would abolish GST and we are still 
waiting for it to do it.  I know from experience that small 
businessmen are paying GST from their profits.  It comes out of 
their profits.  The government may want to say that the consumer 
is paying it.  Yes, the consumer was paying it, but businesses 
had to reduce their profit margins in order to accommodate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In principle I feel the bill is a great bill.  It is there to 
help small businesses.  It sounds excellent.  The government says 
“Here is the money.  We will guarantee it and the banks will run 
it.  You can access it”.   As I mentioned, we keep hearing that 
small businesses are having problems and the government is doing 
the same thing again.  We have a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his report the auditor general identified the problem. It is 
abuse by both borrowers and lenders.  Lenders look at it as 
another way of making money without taking any risk.  Who is at 
risk here?  Small businessmen are already at risk when they apply 
for loans and the Canadian taxpayer is also part of it.  There is 
a double risk.  The banks are have absolutely zero risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When banks look at applications that come before them they ask 
why they should take any risk and they transfer it to the 
government program.  They are fine; the chapter is closed.  Once 
in a while they will take care of it.  If they do not get it from 
the program they can get the money from the bank.  That is a very 
simple statement.  There is no initiative.  There is no incentive 
for banks to work in co-operation with small businesses when 
taxpayers' money is at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the bill in principle may be right, it is not the way to 
go. 
The way to go is to create the environment, economic conditions 
for small businesses to succeed, and they can succeed without 
government intervention.  Canadians have far more 
entrepreneurship and are far more willing.  They do not need the 
government telling them what to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In talking to people outside this country time after time they 
make the point that they do not want to come to Canada to invest 
because our payroll taxes are very high.  The business climate is 
not here.  Instead of coming forward with band-aid solutions, the 
first priority is to work toward creating an economic climate in 
which small businesses can thrive, an economic climate where even 
the banks will understand that they have a role to play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to the banks that will be running this program to take 
the interest of small business people into account.  They have 
done a terrible job in the past.  They should improve. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
read the intended purpose of act and then tell the House its real 
purpose: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this act is to increase the availability of 
financing small businesses which would not otherwise have access 
to financing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That gets to the whole point of it.  If its purpose is to 
increase the availability of financing to small businesses, 
should it be done by legislating it or by regulating it?  Maybe 
some members across the way or other colleagues in the House 
think it works that way, but just because it is legislated or 
regulated does not make it so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem for small businesses is not that they do not have 
the ability to acquire more debt.  Their problem is that they do 
not have enough equity.  The government continues to raise their 
taxes.  It likes to talk about how small business is the backbone 
of job creation, but since it took office in 1993 there have been 
40 tax increases.  The government is breaking the backbone of 
business.  The Liberals are taking baseball bats to the backbones 
of small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about how many different baseball bats the Liberals 
have brought in.  I will use the example of my home town of 
Calgary, Alberta.  Alberta has about 1.62 million workers. 
Alberta pays into employment insurance to the tune of about $1.8 
billion per year and only takes out $500 million.  That leaves 
$1.3 billion in the finance minister's coffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we divide those numbers it is about $750 per average working 
Albertan.  That is money that is not in their wallets. That is 
money that is in the finance minister's mountain high 
overpayments in terms of the EI fund.  That type of thing hurts 
small business.  I do not think that legislating and regulating 
banks to try to give out more money is the way to do it.  Why not 
do a favour for small business rather than try to regulate and 
legislate the banks?  That is what small business wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were to knock on the doors of small businesses in my riding 
I can bet dollars to donuts they would not say that the number 
one thing they want from the government is more legislation and 
more regulation telling them how to run their shops. 
They would say they want lower taxes.  That is what those 
Liberals across the way do not seem to understand.  They do not 
hear that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government said it was going to cut the GST.  The 
government said it was going to scrap, kill and abolish the GST. 
But no, this government has left that type of shackling on 
businesses in this country.  This government said it would do 
something about it and it did not do it.  It was a broken 
promise.  The government does not like hearing about it, but it 
is the truth, and the truth hurts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the sting and the venom of my tongue hurts the Liberals' 
virgin ears, that is too bad.  They need to hear the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST was supposed to be scrapped, killed and abolished. The 
Prime Minister promised so.  The Prime Minister is on tapes right 
across the land saying that he was going to do that if his 
government was elected.  But this government did not deliver. 
This government fell short on that promise to small business 
people in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government brought in 40 tax increases and its members 
pride themselves on having balanced the budget.  This government 
does not like talking about the $24 billion more that it brings 
in in taxes in this country.  Taxes have gone up.  The GST has 
stayed.  The government has raised CPP premiums and other payroll 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is milking small business people dry and 
it talks about legislating and regulating banks.  Shame on this 
government.  That is not the answer and this government knows it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does this government not give taxpayers and small business 
people in this country a break, rather than regulating them? That 
is not the solution and this government knows it is not the 
solution.  For those members across the way who own small 
businesses, they should know that is not the way to cure the 
ailments of small business in this country.  Small business is 
not asking or begging for more regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about priorities.  This government says it wants to 
increase the availability of financing to small business.  What 
is this government doing about corporate welfare in this country? 
Is corporate welfare somehow less important? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government spends $4 billion a year on corporate welfare. 
It gives money to its friends.  I have certainly talked about 
that with ACOA and other programs that go on under this regime. 
It gives money to people who have given campaign donations. 
There seems to be an interesting if not spurious correlation 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Liberal government can find money for those things, but to 
lower taxes we would have to twist the finance minister's arm and 
break it at the wrist and the elbow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government does not talk about corporate welfare very much. 
This government does not talk about the funding it gives to 
special interest groups.  Somehow that is more sacrosanct than 
cutting taxes for small businesses.  I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government gives money to crown corporations.  It believes 
that is more important than cutting taxes for small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do members know that the CBC receives close to $1 billion a 
year?  It has been cut down a little, but at one point it was 
$1.1 billion.  Somehow that is more important than cutting taxes 
for small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that some members are turning their tails and running. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has never come clean on this, but there are some 
in this country who are questioning whether Canada Post is using 
the money it gets from taxpayers for regular mail to 
cross-subsidize its courier services, e-mail and other things 
that it does in direct competition with Purolator Courier and 
other courier associations and businesses in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have the public sector competing with private sector 
businesses, driving them out of business, eating up their 
advertising, their revenue dollars and their clients, it is a 
shame.  This government happens to think that those types of 
things are more important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go through the 40 tax increases and the types of 
things this government has brought in.  It does not want to cut 
taxes.  This government wants to regulate and legislate instead 
of getting to the whole problem of equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government wants to give businesses more debt.  We can bet 
our bottom dollar on that.  We are asking for a little more 
equity.  When people pay taxes they are incurring debt.  If they 
have a debt already and they are paying more, they have to take 
on more debt.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I bet this government would like to give them more rope to hang 
themselves by.  I bet the finance minister gloats over the $24 
billion more he has taken in since 1993.  The finance minister 
and the rest of the Liberals love lining the government's pockets 
and building up hordes of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to go through some of these tax increases that seem 
to be more important and more sacrosanct than cutting taxes for 
small business.  Instead, the government is proposing legislation 
and regulations so that businesses have more rope to hang 
themselves by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government put a tax on life insurance premiums and extended 
it.  What has that brought in?  In the 1994-95 budgetary year it 
brought in $120 million.  It then got worse.  One would think 
$120 million in terms of tax on life insurance premiums and the 
extension was bad enough, but it went up to $200 million, $80 
million more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is all about taxing life insurance premiums.  It 
is not about cutting taxes for small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What else is the government into?  It is into income testing for 
age credits.  One might ask how much money that has brought in. 
In fiscal year 1994-95 it brought in $20 million.  In the year 
after that it brought in $170 million.  By the time we got to 
1996-97 it brought in $300 million.  Taxes keep going up and up 
with this Liberal administration, but I do not hear about it 
cutting taxes, lessening regulations and legislation.  That is 
the way it knows how to solve problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government also went ahead and made changes to the tax 
treatment of securities.  For every single one of these five 
years it has brought in $60 million more per year, for a total of 
$300 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that my time is up.  I could go on and on.  The 
solution is not to legislate and regulate to provide capital to 
businesses, it is to cut their taxes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak to the Bloc's Motion No. 1 and also to 
defend the interest of small business for the business people of 
Saanich—Gulf Islands and all of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too will read the proposed motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this Act is to increase the availability of 
financing of small businesses, which would not otherwise have 
access to financing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously they are at considerable risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the business climate in British Columbia. 
It is in an absolute crisis situation.  No matter who I talk to, 
people are losing their homes and their jobs by the thousands 
every day in Prince George, Cranbrook, Duncan, Lumby, Terrace. 
Mills are shutting down.  Every other day on the news we see 
another mill shutting down.  Some have suggested we will lose 
another 10 by the end of the year.  No matter who I talk to in 
these communities, they feel the largest single contributing 
factor for these job losses and their lives being devastated is 
government regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there is provincial government regulation, but there is 
also federal.  As these whole communities are being devastated, 
the small businesses are being driven out of business as well. 
That is what this government needs to focus on.  It has to create 
an economic climate in this country and in British Columbia for 
these businesses to be competitive and to succeed.  That is not 
happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program is not helping small business.  When I speak to the 
small business people in these communities, they tell me that 
they are overburdened by government regulation.  Small business 
people in my community tell me they get government forms every 
other day in the mail.  If it is not a GST report they have to 
fill out, it is a report from the Workers' Compensation Board for 
premiums, or a report for Canada pension plan premiums.  The list 
goes on and on and on.  It never ends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These small businesses are absolutely burdened with bureaucracy. 
That is what we should be focusing on to help these small 
businesses.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleagues have said, it is the responsibility of this 
government to create an economic climate so that small businesses 
can succeed.  It should not be raising taxes 40 times over four 
or five years.  It should not be raising payroll taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members like to stand and say “We have reduced EI 
premiums more than the Conservatives did”, but they do not tell 
us that they doubled Canada pension plan premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is choking the small business community.  What does the 
government do?  It says “We will bring in $1.5 billion.  We will 
be out there to champion the small business community.  We will 
make this money available”.  Government is not telling us that 
this is a huge liability for the taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this legislation is to help businesses which 
would not otherwise have access to financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we ask anybody in the business community what that means they 
will tell us that these are high risk businesses which probably 
will not make it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is that?  There are probably some poor business plans that 
are not going to succeed, but a lot of them could if this 
government would tackle the real problem instead of just trying 
to put a band-aid on it, thinking it will go away.  That real 
problem is reducing government bureaucracy and creating an 
investment climate for people to come in and take hold.  That is 
not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot emphasize this enough.  I speak to small businesses in 
my community.  They employ two or three people.  They show me the 
government forms they receive.  They have to hire a full time 
accountant just to look after their bookkeeping, to handle the 
government bureaucracy and all the different forms from all of 
the different departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are not just getting them from the federal government, they 
are getting them from the provincial government.  The list goes 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was ironic.  I did a radio talk show in my riding.  A 
representative of the federal Liberal riding association came in 
and said “Mr. Lunn is against small businesses.  He does not 
support the Small Business Loans Act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a pile of hogwash.  They do not understand the problem. 
They think that if they throw money at it the problem will go 
away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After spending a year in this House the one thing I have learned 
from this government is that it thinks that if it throws money at 
a problem it will go away by itself, without it having to attack 
the real source of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to emphasize what is going on in British Columbia. 
It is in a crisis situation.  If we go to any of the interior 
communities we will see people losing their livelihoods. They are 
losing their homes.  Why is that?  It is because governments, 
both federal and provincial, have created a climate through 
government bureaucracy and policies in which these companies 
cannot survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The spinoff, the rippling effect, the number of small businesses 
that are closing is staggering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the example of the softwood lumber quota.  The 
province of British Columbia has lost it through government 
regulations.  It is struggling to export its product.  It is 
forced into quotas by this government because of more 
bureaucracy, more government regulations, more paperwork. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite can shake their heads, but these are facts.  I 
invite any member of the government to go out to British 
Columbia, go to the small communities and to talk to these 
people.  Hear it from them.  Look at the devastation that is 
happening out there and then come back here and say “We need 
more than just $1.5 billion to throw at people with business 
plans who otherwise could not get financing from anywhere else”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to do something for these people.  What we see is 
absolutely not acceptable.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is a disgrace that I have to look at this legislation 
in the House and then go back to the people of British Columbia 
and say this is what the federal government is doing for you. 
They will say that I am their federal member.  I shake my head 
because these people are so frustrated.  What are they going to 
do?  There are real problems out there.  We need to start 
attacking the root of the problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will repeat that the government's responsibility is to create 
an economic climate in which businesses can thrive, profit and 
provide employment without government subsidies and taxpayer 
liability.  We are not doing that, although it is our role in 
this House to do so.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to discuss Bill C-53 and Motion No. 1 moved by 
the Bloc.  I will continue on from where my hon. colleague from 
Saanich—Gulf Islands left off in regard to what is happening 
today with small businesses and so-called small business loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is trying to infuse more money into a very bad 
situation.  I have listened to some of the speeches today.  Some 
members across the way have said how much they have done for 
small business, yet in the history of Canada the small business 
bankruptcy rate has never been so high.  How much help has this 
government given small business?  Why is our system not working? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program is already in place and the Liberals want to throw 
more money into it.  They know full well that it will not create 
a better climate for small business, that it will not help the 
entrepreneur go ahead.  Canadians are overregulated and 
overtaxed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last winter between Christmas and New Year's Day, I had a chance 
to get away with my wife for a few days.  We decided to drive 
down to the coast of Oregon.  A small business conference was 
going on there.  I met a couple of mayors and a bunch of council 
people from Lincoln, Oregon.  We got talking about the difference 
in business attitude between down there and up here in Canada. 
They told me of six new companies that had started during a 
two-week period.  They were started by Canadian entrepreneurs who 
had been chased out of this country by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on the other side ask about the American economy.  It is 
coming from our Canadian entrepreneurs who have been chased out 
of this country.  They have been chased out by those people, the 
government and its overtaxation and overregulation.  Do Liberal 
members think those entrepreneurs are happy there?  Do Liberals 
think those people want to invest $50,000, $100 million or $200 
million in this country?  They do not.  They have no confidence 
in the ability of this government to help them survive in this 
economic climate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals stand up day after day to say how great they have been 
to Canadian businesses. Let us take a look.  There have been 40 
increases in taxation since the Liberals have been in power.  I 
will say it very slowly for those on the other side.  That is a 
four with a zero at the end in tax increases.  And the Liberals 
say they are the great saviours of the Canadian business climate. 
Shame on them.  Shame on them for even standing up and saying 
that. It is total hypocrisy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is like any government before it, like the 
Conservative and Liberal governments before it:  “We will throw 
more money out there to make us look good.  We will have 
something to throw out there so we can say this is what we tried 
to do although it did not work.  We are so sorry it did not 
work”.  Governments have been trying this from day one in Canada 
and who has been paying for it?  The taxpayers, those who are 
sitting outside this House, those who are sitting up in the 
gallery. They are the ones who pay for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals sit on the other side and think they have money. 
They think they have their own money but they do not. 
The Liberals have the people's money.  They have the workers' 
money. Look after it for a change.  It is total hypocrisy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals campaigned that they would get rid of the GST and 
they would help businesses.  They said they would scrap the GST. 
What did they do?  They came along with a better idea, a bigger 
scam on the people of Canada.  They would harmonize the GST.  The 
cost went up another 3% through harmonization. Nice going Mr. and 
Mrs. Government on the other side.  Shame on them.  They cannot 
justify the 40 tax increases, so they will not mention them. They 
cannot justify any of them. They would sooner have a bill like 
this one which adds $1.5 billion more to try and address the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem has been there since the day the program started. 
People come to my office time after time wanting to know how they 
can access the money that is supposed to be there for small 
business loans.  It is not there. Most of them would be far 
better off going to their families and keeping the government and 
its regulations out.  What kills business is taxes and 
overregulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this government really wants to do something for the 
entrepreneur, for the business minded people, if it really wants 
to keep them in this country and not chase them across the line 
or to other countries like it is doing today,—it is called the 
brain drain—then start cutting the taxes.  Get out of their 
faces and let them go ahead and compete.  Get rid of the 
interprovincial tax barriers.  Start treating Canadians as human 
beings instead of digging into their pockets and taking their 
money any time it feels like it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am so pleased to follow my colleague now that he has the 
attention of some of the members opposite.  Hopefully they will 
listen to the continuation of the well reasoned arguments that 
our party has put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am troubled by this motion as I know many constituents are. It 
is such a sad reflection on the lack of leadership on the other 
side.  The best the government can do is to put forward a bill 
that puts the struggling small businesses further in debt and 
offers them no possible relief or hope.  This is not the way to 
increase the viability of small businesses in Canada.  If they 
were more viable, lenders would be lining up to make sure money 
was available to them.  This kind of motion makes it all that 
much more difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are small businesses having such a hard time?  A number of 
small businesses in Calgary Centre have spoken to me over the 
past year and they have listed their concerns.  Never have they 
come to me to say that they need more access to loans to get them 
further in debt. Every priority they have presented to me has 
related to taxes, taxes and taxes. They listed the property tax 
they pay and how high it is.  They listed the provincial taxes 
and the income taxes. The most painful of all is the payroll 
taxes.  It is particularly painful when they see, hear and read 
about a surplus they and their employees have paid into but they 
will not be given any relief in that arena by the finance 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Particularly troubling to me was one small business owner, an 
elderly fellow.  He and his wife ran an electronic shop.  He 
showed me on paper that he could actually make a profit but after 
paying taxes, he was in a losing position.  He lost money because 
of his taxes.  It is tragic especially when we sing the praises 
of small businesses being the engine of our economy and then we 
tax them into bankruptcy.  It is tragic.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard previously from members today about the rate of 
bankruptcy in this country.  Is this the best solution we can 
come up with for businesses that are going bankrupt? We are going 
to make the availability of more financing that they would not 
otherwise have access to drive these businesses that are carrying 
the tax burden further into debt through government loans.  Is 
that the best we can do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly that seems to be the best members on the other side 
can do, but that is not why we are here. We are here to see that 
these small businesses become successful and to give them some 
tax relief.  This component of our business community should be 
the first to receive tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of the Restaurant and Food Services Association in 
my riding has come to me more than once.  He has written to me. 
He has never asked for access to more financing.  Each time what 
he has asked for is relief from taxes. He has pointed out to me 
that the restaurant business is where many young people in our 
country get a start.  They learn how to work within a company, 
serve and build their job skills.  Yet restaurateurs are so 
burdened by payroll taxes that many of them are limiting the 
number of young people they hire and this is where our young 
people get a start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the other end of the spectrum, many professionals and people 
trained in our universities who venture out in small 
entrepreneurial enterprises carry the weight of a mountain of 
bureaucratic red tape and the tax burden.  That is one of the 
factors why this country is faced with a brain drain. Educated 
professionals look at the options and ask do they stay in Canada 
or do they go somewhere where their efforts are going to pay a 
dividend.  It is not here that they choose to stay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking that we get serious about some real solutions for 
small business.  It comes from a climate that allows small 
businesses to succeed, not to get further into debt, a climate 
that allows them to make a profit.  Some members in the House do 
not like to hear the word profit.  Allow small businesses to make 
a profit, to reinvest it back into their companies, to expand, to 
employ more Canadians.  Keep more Canadians here, young 
Canadians, instead of driving them across the border because of 
the heavy burden of taxes and government red tape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, that is not the answer.  We need to show leadership in that 
area and it is leadership that is sorely lacking.  That is why we 
are so concerned about this particular motion today and this 
bill.  It so typifies that lack of leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also point out that our country has the highest tax rate 
in the G-8, which is something we have mentioned before in the 
House.  Canadians are starting to hear it.  We hear the finance 
minister talking about surpluses, yet he is refusing to give 
Canadians the tax relief they deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the vibrancy in Alberta. Why?  Because Alberta has 
one of the most positive climates in Canada for entrepreneurs and 
business people to succeed.  People are moving to Alberta and 
they are succeeding in Alberta.  But the Liberal government 
refuses to take that as a lesson and allow for that kind of an 
environment to flourish in the rest of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refuse to accept the statement some would make that the 
success of entrepreneurs and businesses somehow means that those 
who are underprivileged or who are in need would be left out. My 
very own riding of Calgary Centre, the vibrant community of 
Calgary, in some ways is becoming the new business capital of 
Canada. I would say that the charities, the concern and the 
caring in that community is second to none in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not follow that just because there is business success 
somehow that means the underprivileged are forgotten.  I put 
forward the strong example of Calgary Centre, my own riding where 
just the opposite is true. When there is success in business and 
the economy is strong, the needs of the underprivileged are cared 
for that much better than when business is struggling and under a 
heavy burden of tax.

attention of the people in the gallery, those watching and 
hopefully the few members opposite who are listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My closing appeal for the young people of the country, the 
families that want to have a future, stay in Canada and have an 
opportunity to grow, raise a family and be strong contributing 
Canadians is that on their behalf instead of a weak approach of 
putting businesses further in debt that the government, 
parliament and all of us be committed to strengthening the 
economy through lower taxes, less government regulation and let 
the Canadian people flourish and build a stronger country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
privilege to follow an as erudite and eloquent speaker as the 
member for Calgary Centre.  Was that not a thrill to listen to 
him advocate on behalf of our young people, small businesses and 
to encourage the entrepreneurship of those who are aspiring to 
become big businesses?  That is tremendous.  I congratulate my 
hon. colleague who presented a very balanced view of what is 
happening in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about the entrepreneurship that is so characteristic 
of small business people.  The people who start small business 
are entrepreneurs in the absolute and best sense of the word 
because the entrepreneur is someone who takes his own initiative, 
motivation, ideas, learning, skills and abilities and applies 
them in a way that will make him some money, that will allow him 
to express himself, to get that self-actualization to the fore so 
that he can become that respected member of the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Entrepreneurs are the very people who are the most charitable in 
giving their time, money and skills to the community. Recently we 
had a fundraising dinner for the cancer clinic in Kelowna.  The 
fundraiser was populated by primarily small business people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did they do?  Ninety of these small business people raised 
$90,000 in one evening for the Kelowna clinic cancer centre. Is 
that not something to be proud of?  I think that is wonderful and 
we should congratulate them.  Those are the very same people who 
stand behind the United Way and have helped build the social 
conscience among the members of the community.  Those are the 
kinds of people who have that have the spirit and drive that says 
I want to help myself and I want to show the aggressiveness and 
the way in which I can build a better community.  That is what 
those entrepreneurs and small business people do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not all they do.  They are the source of most new jobs, 
with 85% created by small business people.  Is that not something 
we should reward? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the case perhaps this is a really good amendment 
because it is supposed to help small businesses. The interesting 
thing is that it says the purpose of the act is to increase the 
availability of financing of small business which would not 
otherwise have access to financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the purpose then I want to ask what has the 
experience been.  There was a Small Business Loans Act which had 
a purpose very similar to this one but how did it actually work 
its way out?  In many instances the financial institutions 
recognized that if they would grant a loan under the provisions 
of the Small Business Loans Act they would be able to collect a 
better interest rate and besides that they were absolutely 
assured that the loan would be repaid regardless of what happened 
to the business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that does not sound, smell, taste or look like a subsidy to 
the financial institutions I would like to know what it is. 
I think we had better really look at this carefully and say what 
are we really doing here. Are we subsidizing those big banks that 
had profits last year of $1.5 billion for one bank? They do not 
need the subsidy. But the small businessman needs a break.  He 
does not want a subsidy.  I have not heard a single small 
businessman say to me they want me to get them a subsidy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a specific case of a business that was doing very 
well.  It wanted to expand and did. It borrowed $250,000 to 
expand the business, put a new product line in place and to make 
it more efficient. What did the business discover?  It discovered 
that in another community that had the same market area as it 
did, the government came in with a subsidy for exactly the same 
business. Here we have an honest entrepreneur trying to compete 
with this big mammoth, giant government which gave this person an 
interest free loan. Is it any wonder that both those business had 
problems? That is the kind of thing we want to avoid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small business is also the centre of most new ideas and 
innovation.  If we look back on the communication industry and 
how it has flourished, where did it start?  We can look all the 
way back to Alexander Graham Bell.  Where did he start?  In big 
business?  He started as a tiny little business.  We can go back 
to the computer industry, back to the chips, back to virtually 
any of these things that are happening today. Where did they 
start?  They started as small businesses.  They did not start 
with the Small Business Loans Act.  They started not with a 
special subsidy. They started because they had a good idea, they 
had a few dollars and they put their enterprise to work.  That is 
how it works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this mean I am opposed to small business?  It is the exact 
opposite of that.  It gives small businesses the courage, the 
enthusiasm, the support, the level playing field so that they can 
compete fairly and squarely with other businesses so that the 
best person can win. Let us face it, that is what we want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is government's responsibility to create a playing field that 
is level, an environment that encourages distribution and 
advancement, that builds on the talents and skills of the people. 
That builds a nation.  The strength of a nation does not rest 
primarily on its natural resources.  It rests on the motivation, 
on the skills, the abilities and the knowledge of the people. 
Because that is where it rests, it finds its greatest application 
in small business.  That is where we need to look. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government should be ashamed that it gets in the way of 
small business with its bureaucracy, gets in the way of small 
business by not giving it the opportunity it should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us encourage this government.  It has done wonderful things 
but there are some things it is doing that are wrong.  That is 
what has to be taken care of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST should go.  The government said once it was going to go. 
There are all kinds of members over there who said it should go. 
Did it go?  No.  It harmonized the GST, which costs even more 
money.  That is a disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it that we now need to look at with regard to small 
business?  New jobs.  If there is one thing that would encourage 
our young people, the graduates, more than anything else it is to 
recognize that their skills, their abilities, their training will 
result if a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer I met with two university students, bright young 
people.  They came up with a truck and a trailer. On the truck 
they had wheelbarrows, rakes and other tools.  On the trailer 
they had some lawnmowers and other gardening equipment.  I asked 
them what they were doing. 
They said they got a little loan and bought this equipment and 
were in business.  Guess what happened.  At the end of the summer 
they had paid off the loan, paid for the equipment and saved 
enough money to pay for their next year's tuition.  They were so 
proud of being able to build the business. They were so happy and 
they are now putting that equipment to work during the winter, 
getting ready for the winter clearing of snow and things of that 
sort.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Virk family, displaying enormous courage, turned its pain 
into positive action supporting effective crime prevention tools 
such as my private member's Motion No. 261 which passed in the

program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It focuses on strengthening the bond between parents and 
children, particularly those between the ages of zero and eight, 
so that children will have their basic needs met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Headstart programs have decreased child abuse by 99%, youth 
crime by 60%, teen pregnancies by 50% and saved $30,000 a child. 
Headstart programs have also decreased the single leading cause 
of preventable and irreversible brain damage, fetal alcohol 
syndrome which plagues one-third of the people in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of care and I call on 
the government to act on the contents of Motion No. 261 and work 
with the provinces to implement a national headstart program so 
we will not see more deaths like Reena Virk's.

job at protecting this industry.

what can occur when we take fishing stocks for granted.  The 
results are that thousands of fishers have been forced out of the

generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not convinced that our fisheries minister has learned 
anything from past mistakes.  For months now I have tried to 
focus his attention on the serious illegal lobster activity going 
on in West Nova.  The minister is intent on believing that the 
problem has been addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fishers, along with regional DFO officials, continue to tell me 
otherwise.  It continues to be a serious problem that must be 
addressed before the lucrative West Nova lobster industry goes by 
the wayside like the northern cod fishery.

sign off on the finance minister's accounting trickery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general says the finance minister is improperly 
billing the taxpayer today for spending that will not happen for

billions of dollars from Canadians who want tax relief and debt

</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the point of even having an auditor general when this

recommendations? 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the accounting procedure that was followed in this case 
is the one followed in the private sector.  It is more open and 
transparent than that which has been recommended by the auditor 
general in the public sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe government has a responsibility to be as open and

even started yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a private business were to book expenses that have not yet 
been made to hide the true size of its profit, the revenue

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

Speaker, the finance minister is playing a shell game with the 
money of Canadian taxpayers.  He pads expenses with future 
projects to make the surplus look smaller so he can say there is 
no money for tax relief.  He cuts $7 billion out of health care, 
gives $2 billion back and thinks no one will notice there is $5 
billion missing.

how that money was spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last budget was one of the most important education budgets 
ever brought forth by the government.  We gave students a tax 
credit on their deductions.  At the same time we gave single

the finance minister should do card tricks the way he talks his

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government knows the auditor general is the top watchdog in 
the country to look after the government's books and he should 
obey them.  He has not done that.  Businesses and home owners 
would not be allowed to cook their books the way the government 
has.

and there would be an investigation.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>BUDGET SURPLUS 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK93"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday in this House the Minister of Finance confirmed his 
desire to continue to dip illegally into the employment 
insurance fund and admitted that he had deliberately 
underestimated the size of the budget surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—our projections would not be of our optimum performance, but of 
our minimum. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the minister assess his surpluses at a minimum, while 
dipping into the employment insurance fund to a scandalous and 
immoral maximum? 
<P><A NAME="LINK94"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what 
I said yesterday, and what I say again today, is that we intend 
to proceed in a balanced manner.  Every year since we came into 
power, we have cut employment insurance contributions.  Last 
year, we reduced taxes and put money into the sectors of the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an approach that works and one we will continue to use. 
<P><A NAME="LINK95"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
speaking of balance, one month ago the Minister of Finance was 
telling us there would not be a budget surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One week ago, his own department told us that, after six months, 
there was a surplus of $10 billion.  Why such a discrepancy? 
The answer is one of two things: either this minister is 
incompetent, or he refuses to debate with his colleagues, the 
Minister of Health and the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, in order to decide what to do with the surplus. 
Which of these is the right answer? 
<P><A NAME="LINK96"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin:</B> I have always said we would be going to have a 
surplus this year.  I said so in the economic statement. 
Moreover, Canadians need to be proud of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am still saying, and I would like to quote the senior 
economist at Mouvement Desjardins, is “The presence of numerous 
risks, both from the economic and the financial point of view, 
calls for continued caution”.  That is our position. 
<P><A NAME="LINK97"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
chief economist for the Mouvement Desjardins predicted a $15 
billion surplus by the end of the fiscal year, while this 
morning the Conference Board anticipated a surplus of $10 
billion. These are the true figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For three years now, the Bloc Quebecois has accurately forecast 
the situation of our public finances. This year, the surplus 
will, in our estimation, reach $15 billion. We are proposing to 
allocate $7 billion to the employment insurance fund, $6 billion 
to health and $2 billion to tax reduction, for a total of $15 
billion. This is our proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is this minister, who plays with numbers to hide the 
reality, proposing? 
<P><A NAME="LINK98"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, allow 
me to quote François Dupuis, the senior economist of the 
Mouvement Desjardins, who said “While the financial context has 
stabilized in recent days, we must not forget that the situation 
remains highly volatile. The presence of numerous risks, both 
from an economic and financial point of view, calls for 
continued caution”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are being cautious. The Bloc Quebecois wants to take us back

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, now 
that the minister is done saying things that make no sense, I am 
asking him what he has to say to the president of the Canadian 
Chamber of Commerce, who recognizes that there will be a surplus 
in excess of $10 billion by the end of the current fiscal year, 
who accuses the minister of playing with numbers, and who asks, 
on behalf of all Canadian entrepreneurs, that the Minister of 
Finance show a little more respect.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 
August the government rationalized yet another delay in honouring 
its pay equity debts to its own employees, claiming that further 
clarification was needed from the courts.  With today's federal 
court decision to throw out the Bell case, the pay equity issue

<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the basic issue has not changed.  There are two groups of women 
that would be submitted to two different systems of pay equity 
and we have to appeal to make sure the law is clarified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judge did not make a decision on methodology in the judgment

this government likes a decision it touts it and when it does not 
like a decision it studies it endlessly.  Obviously the 
government must have anticipated today's court decision as one 
possibility.  Surely the government had a plan.  Does the plan 
include paying its debts to its own employees or will it dredge 
up more excuses for more delays?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and

the union appealed when it did not like the judgment in the Bell 
Canada case.  In our case we cannot as a government treat two 
groups of women, the 20,000 women in the Bell case and the women 
in the public service, in different ways.  We still have the same 
problem.  We have two different methodologies and we still must 
ask the court to clarify the law.  We believe in the principle of 
pay equity but we must treat women, whether in the private sector

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA SMALL BUSINESS FINANCING ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK184">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-53, an act to increase 
the availability of financing for the establishment, expansion, 
modernization and improvement of small businesses, as reported 
(with amendments) from the committee; and of Motion No. 1. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to speak to this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this bill the government is taking a look at small business. 
It wants to provide more funds for small business. We would argue 
on this side of the House that what the government should do is 
provide the economic climate for small businesses to flourish and 
prosper in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I visit businesses in my riding.  I talk to employers who work 
very hard at their businesses and who employ a small number of 
employees.  They do not mention that they need a subsidy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the government's responsibility to provide an economic 
climate that would help to foster a positive economy for our 
country.  We know small business is the engine of job creation in 
Canada; it is not government but small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsidies can have the effect of rewarding one small business in 
competition with another with the other company's own tax 
dollars.  That does not seem to make sense.  It would make better 
sense for the government to focus on the things it can take care 
of, such as high payroll taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are very high EI taxes in Canada.  Today in question 
period we heard the finance minister openly defy the auditor 
general's report.  The auditor general said that the accounting 
practices the minister is employing are not proper and that he 
would not sign off on those government estimates.  Yet the 
finance minister stands in his place and says that it is okay, 
that the Liberals can do this, that they are the government so 
they can do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly the kind of thing small businesses would like to 
see changed.  They would like to see payroll taxes decreased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I know the hon. 
member for Dewdney—Alouette is having a bit of a difficult time 
but I can assure the hon. member for Dewdney—Alouette that he 
has the undivided attention of the Speaker if that of no one 
else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Does he read well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you.  I appreciate 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Transport indicates that I am reading my speech 
well.  I have no notes before me.  I am simply telling him and 
the government what the people of my riding are telling me. They 
are telling me that they are sick and tired of high payroll 
taxes.  Those payroll taxes are the taxes that are stopping them 
from hiring more employees.  It is those payroll taxes, which the 
Minister of Transport seems not to be aware of, that are causing 
employers in his riding and in my riding to work very long hours 
because they cannot afford to hire more staff to do the job.  I 
have talked to a number of such employers in my riding.  If he 
had any interest in the small businesses in his riding, he might 
do the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is currently overcharging employees by $350 on 
their EI premiums. Businesses are paying a whopping $500 more for 
each employee than they need to.  That means in a company with 10 
employees, each are paying $350 too much.  If they could keep 
that money they could spend it in the local economy and stimulate 
that economy even further.  With the current premiums and the 10 
employees, the employer is paying an extra $5,000 per year.  If 
it were a larger company with 100 employees, the government would 
be overcharging it by $50,000.  That is wrong.  It kills jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know, and the Minister of Finance has said this himself, that 
high payroll taxes are a cancer on job creation in Canada. 
Yet he goes ahead with these policies.  He barges ahead.  He 
defies the auditor general who has said that these accounting 
practices are not ones that he can agree with.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the issue of high CPP premiums.  We know that 
those premiums have had to be increased because of the 
government's mismanagement of the CPP fund.  We know that those 
payroll taxes are also increasing.  They are going to increase by 
73% over the life of those increases, over the six years that 
this government has implemented its plan of grabbing back more 
money from Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this government could do is take note of these types of 
payroll taxes and work to lower them.  It could do that.  It has 
the power and the ability to do that. We see other bills being 
brought forward by the government. However, issues that Canadians 
and small business people are talking about in lowering their 
taxes are being ignored. It is quite unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw that again today in question period when the Minister of 
Finance said that it is okay for the government to do that kind 
of thing, that it is well within the government's purview to do 
that.  The Minister of Finance is saying to Canadians and small 
business people that it is okay for him to extract extra cash 
from them, which is not needed for the EI surplus because there 
is already a large surplus there.  He is saying that to working 
Canadians. He is saying that to small business people in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the kinds of things the government should be 
addressing. We would encourage it to address those issues.  Those 
are the things that really strike at the heart of working 
Canadians and small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were really concerned about small businesses 
it would go about making changes and implementing policies and 
plans that would get the bureaucracy and red tape out of small 
businesses and allow them to flourish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was talking to small business owners in my riding I was 
quite surprised by the number who told me that they would like to 
hire more employees.  I know I mentioned this earlier but I do 
not think the government was listening.  They would like to hire 
more employees but they have such an incredible amount of red 
tape right now and are paying such high payroll taxes that they 
just cannot do it.  A number of them told me something very 
shocking and surprising.  They were on the verge of selling their 
businesses and going back to work for someone else.  They simply 
cannot put in the long 18 hour days any more. It is beyond their 
capability to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is sad because what that means is that those individuals 
who are creating the jobs are being saddled with such high taxes 
that the government is providing them with a disincentive to do 
better. Of course the better they do, the higher their taxes are. 
The more employees they hire, the more payroll taxes they pay. 
In fact they are overcharged for every employee, as I mentioned 
earlier.  That is hurting them.  It is simply not an effective 
policy.  It is the kind of thing we and small business have been 
asking the government to address for a very long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not see responses from the government.  We do not see it 
moving in this direction.  We see it moving in other areas that 
are not effective.  We have to assume then that the Liberal 
government is devoid of any new ideas, of any practical 
implementation of things within its power to put in place. It 
would be very simple for the government to do that.  It is a 
shame it has not taken the time to put those policies in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for that reason I cannot support the amendment or the 
bill.  I would encourage the government to focus on lowering 
payroll taxes and making life easier for small businesses because 
they generate the jobs in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in the House today to speak to Bill C-53 and to 
support the amendments brought forward by the member for 
Mercier. These amendments are aimed at making the act more 
responsive to the real needs of small and medium size 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the Bloc Quebecois is extremely disappointed with 
this so-called review of the Small Business Loans Act, we do not 
for one minute think that the SBLA should disappear. On the 
contrary. However, we want the government to be more attentive 
to the needs of small and medium size businesses in reviewing 
the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that small businesses are extremely important. 
Statistics reveal that large businesses no longer are and will 
no longer be the main creators of jobs. Small businesses will 
give opportunities to those who want to become their own boss 
and to succeed in a field in which they chose to specialize to 
create their own job and to create other jobs for people who may 
join their small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With my colleague from Mercier and several members of the Bloc 
Quebecois, I took part in a poll of small and medium size 
businesses in my riding because we know how important this act 
can be for them. It is a matter of life and death. 
We asked the interviewees very specific questions and the 
response rate shows beyond any doubt that the amendment put 
forward by the hon. member for Mercier indicates exactly where 
the small businesses stand right now and what they need in order 
to survive and if possible expand, and hence create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In answer to the first question, 90% of the small businesses 
responding stated that they find it very hard to get financing 
at a reasonable cost. Several of them added, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more often, we have to put up not only our own assets 
but those of our spouse. Our own recognizance is not enough. 
Banks often charge small businesses higher fees. Since the banks 
do not make a lot of profit on personal loans, they hike up the 
service fees that are not legislated. 
To increase the term of a loan from five to eight years does not 
make any sense. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not enough financing is in some ways worse than no financing at 
all, because the business cannot develop and expand as it could 
or as it should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question was used to find out if the Small Business 
Loans Act was well known. And 55% of the respondents indicated 
that they did not know the legislation very well and 45% knew 
about it, but the vast majority, more than 90% of the 
respondents, thought the legislation could be enhanced. I would 
like to quote some of the comments made most frequently: get rid 
of capital tax; there are so many criteria to have access to 
financing and to qualify that, in the end, we would not need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the fourth question, 95% of respondents felt that loans 
should be given for working capital and not only for equipment 
and assets and real property.  The pilot projects will provide a 
good opportunity to establish the options in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last question for heads of SMBs read “From your experience 
and according to your staff, would it be easier to develop SMBs 
if they had ready access at reasonable cost to management 
advice?”  The answer was 98% affirmative.  Also “In your 
experience, would there be fewer bankruptcies?”  Ninety-five per 
cent said yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these very eloquent reasons supported by a very enlightening 
poll in addition to arguments my colleagues have made, we tabled 
the amendments to improve Bill C-53 for SMBs, that is, to make it 
serve them, employment and productivity better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want the good news for these businesses to be not just the 
extension of the small business loans program, but its extension 
and its improvement.  The aim of our amendments is to respond to 
the shortcomings we and the SMB managers have noted.

Speaker, the Canada small business financing act deserves more 
scrutiny than what it will get and more critical comment that may 
not be listened to by the government as the bill proceeds through 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion we are discussing today by the member for Mercier is 
that Bill C-53 be amended on page 2 by adding in a new clause. 
Clause 2.1 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this act is to increase the availability of 
financing of small businesses— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where I start to wonder what is really meant by this 
amendment is when it states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—which would not otherwise have access to financing. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is a small business?  A small business is simply an 
individual, a man or a woman, who has an entrepreneurial spirit, 
a spirit of being able to say “I don't really want to work for 
someone else, I want to work for myself and, as a result, I want 
to start up my own business”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small business is the backbone of a lot of our communities. As a 
result, we need these kinds of people, these entrepreneurs who 
will stand up say they can make it work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that an entrepreneur who comes forth with a 
better widget, a better product, a new product that has never 
been thought of before, a service or an idea that needs promotion 
and development will need to access capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in accessing that investment capital his idea, his 
service, what he is thinking of, the job he may be wanting to put 
forward to create employment may not be good.  As a result, when 
the entrepreneur goes in for financing from the normal sources or 
even from relatives or their own investment sock they may have 
put away, they may find that the financial institution or the 
independent lender says their idea is not good enough and they 
are not willing to finance it. What the financial institution may 
say to the entrepreneur is that their idea has little or zero 
chance of success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem to me this amendment is then going to state that 
where an entrepreneur has no chance of success maybe the 
government will step in and kind of make sure they do get 
financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The country is littered with empty plants, both small and large, 
where government has stepped in and said it is great to be 
producing this bottled water in Saskatchewan.  There are 
magnificent magnesium processing plants in Alberta. Manitoba has 
certainly had its share of plants that started up, ran for a 
couple of years and then shut down because they were not viable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore have to be concerned when we see amendments like 
this which state that financing should be provided to businesses 
and entrepreneurs which otherwise have no access to financing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there are amendments and clauses in acts like that it is an 
open invitation to the government of the day to use the financing 
and guarantees of loans that are not economically viable or 
financially stable. It simply uses these special little sections 
to provide money to people who in lots of cases are looking to 
the government for support, and in return the government expects 
to get votes. That is why I have a problem supporting this 
amendment to Bill C-53. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that any time the government starts passing legislation 
it will cost money.  Every act costs money.  If it is not 
necessary or will not do the job it is meant to do then it should 
not be passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case financing a small business idea that is not 
economically viable and will not work is not where government 
should be priorizing its funding, or in the case where it does 
not put the money out directly where it guarantees the loan and 
ultimately ends up paying it off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of legislation can be seen in all manner of things that 
have been passed in the House in the last five years, probably 
even longer.  I refer to the Firearms Act which this year is in 
the neighbourhood of $130 million plus the $200 million the RCMP 
is expected to come up with for a computer system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the Canada small business financing act is 
certainly not to support money losing businesses and ideas.  The 
effect it has is to demoralize those business entrepreneurs who 
are making a go of it with a good idea and they see someone else 
have an unfair competitive advantage through government support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of government applies across the whole sector.  At 
present we see small businesses near agricultural communities 
suffering because of the cost of government on the agricultural 
sector.  Certainly it would help if the cost of government on 
agriculture were reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned to the agriculture minister today that many of the 
user fees and cost recovery programs the government has 
instituted over the years could well be set aside, either 
suspended and/or terminated.  That would leave more money in the 
hands of small businessmen like farmers. In essence they are 
small businessmen.  As they spend and the money flows through the 
economy everyone would have more capital with which to start 
small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The costs to small business are the same as in agriculture.  One 
could think of a hardware store or whatever in a small town. Some 
of the costs are applied to all business such as the GST and the 
employment insurance premiums that are taken off.  In this case 
there is a lot more paid in than is needed to keep the fund 
going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see Canada pension plan premiums rising all the time and we 
end up in 20 or 30 years with a pension that is so small compared 
to what we invested that we should have just saved our money in 
the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see business and personal taxes so high they are killing 
investment.  They kill the idea of a small business man or woman 
trying to get ahead.  It may be financed to get the business 
started but if it is killed after it gets going with taxes, 
employment insurance, GST and all these onerous taxes, why bother 
starting it in the first place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not support the amendment to Bill C-53.  I suggest to the 
government that it look at getting out and reducing the cost of 
small business.  That would have a lot more benefit than trying 
to finance some business that does not have a chance in the first 
place.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-53, an act to 
increase the availability of financing for small businesses which 
would not otherwise have access to financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You are aware, Mr. Speaker, of what small business is about if I 
gauge it right.  You have been involved in small business and 
know what is needed to run a small business: financing and 
capital.  I started thinking in layman's terms as far as a farmer 
is concerned.  If you ain't going to make it, why borrow more 
money and do it?  That seems to be the intent of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a saying on the farm that if government helps once we 
will survive.  If it helps twice we will get very sick and if it 
helps another time we will die.  That is possibly what is 
happening here.  If a businessman does not deserve or cannot be 
provided with financing by somebody, maybe death will be there in 
the long run anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to take anything away from entrepreneurs.  I give 
the example of a gentleman that I have known for a number of 
years.  He had some financial problems in his business venture 
and had to shut it down.  He got another idea which he felt was a 
deserving idea.  He required some financing from financial 
institutions but was turned down time and time again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not realize that this had been going on, but when I saw 
him he had started a business and was doing fairly well.  I asked 
him where he finally found an institution that would give him 
financing.  He said he never found one but had asked a couple of 
friends whether they would be part of what he was doing.  He 
found some private money and got started.  He was very 
successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked him what he had to do to persuade somebody that he was 
stable enough or entrepreneurial enough to start a business.  He 
said he had to pay 18% interest for the money.  That was what he 
had to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was honest, worked hard and made it.  If the money had come 
easily and he thought if he did not make it the government would 
back him up, I wonder if he would have put in the same effort and 
asked other people to advise him or to help him.  This is what I 
am talking about when I say that perhaps government helps too 
much.  It helps us to die, not to survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought a very interesting comment was made in the House the 
other day when we were debating the farm crisis on a motion the 
Reform put forward.  A question was asked of the agriculture 
minister who said that no farmer should be able to farm without 
getting a job on the outside.  That is the type of help the 
government wants to give to the farming industry.  Does it 
realize it is a small business compared to large manufacturing? 
That was a rather discouraging answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just heard the hon. member for Selkirk—Interlake talk about 
some of the fees assessed against farmers.  I will point out a 
very simple illustration on my farm in the last month or so. We 
grow some very desirable durum which the U.S. likes in its 
milling industry as far as pasta manufacturing is concerned.  As 
it happened we thrashed the durum and took it into the elevator. 
It was graded a number 3CW durum which is a fairly good grade for 
the pasta industry.  When we started hauling the durum to the 
elevator a few pieces of ergot were found in it, which is not 
desirable at all. 
It was downgraded it to No. 5 durum.  This was a setback to my 
boys on the farm.  It reduced the price of the product and 
probably would result in their bottom line being even more in the 
red.  They took a sample into the U.S. to be analysed and to see 
what the Americans would pay for very high quality durum with a 
bit of ergot in it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans took a look at it and said they did not mind, that 
they would take the durum.  It was a good idea.  We could go to 
the wheat board and get a buyback.  The wheat board would 
accommodate us and help us get a better price for the durum.  The 
Americans offered us $4.55 for the durum within the same distance 
of our farm as the Canadian elevator.  The initial price is $1.57 
for No. 5 durum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This meant we could triple our income if we could get a licence 
to export it to the U.S.  When we asked the wheat board for that 
export licence, it wanted to charge us $5.12 for durum which they 
said was rotten and no good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the way government helps industry and small business. It 
gets them on their feet then taxes them to death.  If our small 
business had the same type of tax relief as other industries in 
other countries they would be very viable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>American farmers get a $6 billion tax write-off just because of 
depressed prices.  That would help every farmer in Canada.  Not 
only would it help farmers, but they would have money to spend in 
rural communities where other small business people would 
benefit.  As well, more taxes would be earned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what we have come to.  The government gives the 
perception that it is doing something that is good for the 
country when actually it is destroying it with overtaxation, with 
trying to keep viable industries that probably should never be 
operating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be very fair.  I would like all businessmen or 
constituents with the idea of starting their own business to have 
that opportunity.  The best teacher they could have in life is 
running their own business and being their own boss.  It gives 
them the idea of how many sleepless nights it sometimes takes to 
earn a feeble living that is maybe less than they would get from 
the payment of wages in another profession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A level playing field, an opportunity to work within a system 
that treats everybody fairly and equally, is a must in democracy. 
That is why I urge the government to look at tax reduction and to 
look at creating level playing fields rather than giving handouts 
which we have seen do not work.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me a great deal of pleasure to address the 
issue of the availability of financing for small business which 
would otherwise not have access to financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I am pleased to speak to the issue is that it gives 
me an opportunity to advance the notion, as my colleagues have 
done, that the problem facing business today is not so much the 
availability of financing as it is the management of business and 
the high taxes that businesses must endure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example of what I mean to talk about.  About a 
year ago I received a phone call from a fisherman back home, a 
gentleman whom I did not know at that time.  He had been a long 
time participant in the fishing industry but was concerned about 
his ability to pay his bills that year, especially the mortgage 
on his boat. 
He had suffered from a poor catch and poor prices in the 1997 
season.  To his knowledge he had tried every opportunity or every 
avenue for financing that he could.  Some help was needed.  He 
wanted to know if I had any advice for him. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I gave him some directions on some of the lenders of last resort 
I know, some of which were government agencies.  I suggested that 
he try his luck at finding alternate financing for his vessel. He 
phoned me back a few weeks later and said that he had been 
successful.  He had managed to renegotiate a loan and felt that 
he would be off the hook and able to survive another year.  He 
was quite pleased with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I obtained a call from that same gentleman a couple of months 
ago after the conclusion of the 1998 fishing season, which was a 
disaster in British Columbia.  Again the request from this 
individual was for help.  He needed alternate financing for his 
vessel.  Otherwise he would lose it. I told him that I had given 
him the best information last year. If he cannot survive on that 
there is not much I can do.  The problem is not in the fishery 
itself but in the management of the fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at what happened last summer and consider 
some of the causes for the concern of the gentleman.  On June 19, 
1998 the Department of Fisheries and Oceans issued a backgrounder 
on the management of the fishery in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem last year which the minister expressed endlessly and 
with some accuracy was a concern about the viability of coho 
salmon, in particular coho salmon on the upper Skeena River and 
on the Thompson River.  In an effort to minimize catch 
opportunities, the minister proposed dividing the coast into 
yellow zones and red zones.  I will just read what he said on 
yellow zones in the backgrounder: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the yellow zones, recreational fishing will proceed as usual 
except all coho must be released.... Barbless hooks must be used 
when salmon fishing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fishing opportunities will be available in the areas they gave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Red zones were described as areas where there would be no 
fishing.  Let me read what he said about red zones: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—red zones are areas where upper Skeena and Thompson coho are 
expected to be prevalent. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In red zone areas salmon fishing will be restricted but 
opportunities will remain for all other finfish and shellfish 
harvesting.  Within the red zone small nearshore areas will be 
open to carefully monitor fishing salmon in order to determine if 
selective fishing for salmon other than coho can be conducted 
with the objective of zero mortality for the stocks of concern. 
Monitoring by independent observers will be employed to evaluate 
the ability to avoid encounters of coho.  If coho are encountered 
in these small experimental areas, the fishery will be moved or 
closed.  The location and times of experimental fisheries were 
set out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The backgrounder went on to identify area one on the north coast 
including offshore areas.  From June 16 to August 26 the waters 
of area one were closed to salmon fishing except for the 
nearshore areas from the entrance of Masset Inlet to Langara 
Island and a three-quarter mile ribbon around the island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the original documents presented by DFO scientists 
that whole area on the north coast was considered a red zone.  It 
is an area where coho were prevalent. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT69"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT69"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1545

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, in one area just off the northern part of the Queen 
Charlotte Islands there is a point called Coho Point.  That point 
was not named because of a lack of coho.  It was called Coho 
Point because that was an area of some coho prevalence when the 
fish were running.  That area in the rejigged management scheme 
allowed for sport fishing only.  It is an area, interestingly 
enough, where the Oak Bay Marine Group operates a large fishing 
lodge.  There are a couple of other lodges that operate in that 
area as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me and it seems to many other people that the big 
problem here was not a matter of trying to protect coho, but a 
matter of trying to provide some sport fishing opportunity for 
those people who are rich enough to be able to afford to attend 
these lodges.  It had nothing to do with protecting fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This preference did not stop there.  The department decided that 
it would promote sport fishing in that area.  It says in this 
same release that Fisheries and Oceans Canada is working with the 
Canadian Tourism Commission, the Sport Fishing Institute and 
Tourism B.C. to develop tourism and a marketing campaign aimed at 
encouraging recreational fishermen to come to British Columbia. 
It says that the CTC, the Canadian Tourism Commission, has 
already committed funding of $350,000 for this project and 
further federal support is expected shortly.  That further 
federal support did come and it was in the amount of several 
million dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a sense we should not complain too much.  It is federal money 
that is designed to help promote British Columbia business.  But 
let us go back a minute.  How is that money going to help the 
small boat owner who came to me in 1997 and said he could not 
afford to make the mortgage payments on his boat?  How is it 
going to help that fellow one year later when he came to me and 
said “Can you help me?  Can you find funding for me again?”  It 
will not to do him any good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fishing records in that area show that the interception of 
coho by the commercial fleet in 1997 was minimal.  It was 
something like 1,000 fish for the whole season.  But we have on 
record that day after day probably close to 900 coho were killed 
in this barbless hook sport fishery in that area.  To me that is 
a great problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It points to another shortcoming of the federal government.  The 
British Columbia job protection commissioner, in talking about 
the problems facing the commercial industry, recommended to 
fisheries management that some effort be made to promote the 
marketing of B.C. salmon.  That is most appropriate because this 
fall there were opportunities to fish chum salmon, but there were 
no buyers.  Fishermen were prepared to go fishing, but nobody was 
prepared to buy the fish.  That is pretty sad because that is a 
top quality food product which was allowed to go unharvested 
because there were no markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the federal government has made no effort to market 
commercially caught salmon in British Columbia.  That has to be 
seen as a huge problem for the fishing industry and it is one 
problem that is not going to be addressed simply by making more 
loans available.  Making more loans available in the commercial 
industry at this time is only going to drive people into the 
poorhouse further and faster.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I get little 
chance to talk about small business, which of course is the 
backbone of our country, and it is a privilege to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been fascinating to watch the Ottawa idea about how to 
help small business.  I think that people in Ottawa say that 
small business needs helps and their idea is to organize a 
government program for small business.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what I think small business in this country 
requires.  In fact, in my own community when I ask small business 
people what they need they say “The best thing for us would be 
to get government out of our way”.  I agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look for help for small business by getting government out of 
the way, by reducing red tape, by removing a lot of the 
barricades and barriers to their success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use an example of exactly what I think happens to small 
business when government gets in the way.  I am using a 
provincial example.  It has little to do with the federal 
government, but it is an example close to my own home and one 
that I think illustrates very well the issue of government 
interference in the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alberta government decided that primary resources were not 
sufficient, that we should branch out.  That, on the surface, 
sounds very positive.  In looking for secondary industry a 
fabulous idea came to the Alberta government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea came from a fellow with a good intellect.  He came up 
with a concept for smelting magnesium by a very high temperature 
electrical process.  This was proven by a very, very small 
experimental process in a laboratory.  It never had any large 
scale testing, but he convinced government officials that this 
was an extremely useful thing for Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alberta had cheap electricity.  We had good railroad access to a 
community close to my home of Okotoks.  There was magnesium ore 
not so far away.  This would be an absolutely perfect way to 
advance the fact that Alberta needed a magnesium industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That magnesium, of course, was in use in the automotive industry 
for tire rims.  It is a light metal, so it is useful for the 
automotive industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They built what I would charitably call an edifice, the MagCan 
plant, halfway between Okotoks and High River in a little 
community called Aldersyde, right on the railroad line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millions of dollars of taxpayer funds were spent on the 
MagCan plant.  Charitably speaking, it was a white elephant.  I 
suppose that if I stood inside the building it would be difficult 
in the MagCan plant to take a softball and toss it to the roof. 
That is how tall this building was.  It was full of expensive 
equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They brought magnesium ore all the way from British Columbia and 
piled it up.  It was quite a sight, glistening in the sun.  They 
brought in huge amounts of electricity, more electricity than is 
needed for a large city.  There were huge transformers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it came time to put the ore in the smelting process and 
flip the switch, it fizzled.  It flopped.  Zip.  Nothing.  That 
MagCan plant stands today with pigeons flying around this 
beautiful edifice of taxpayer funds all because some distant 
bureaucrat decided that this kind of process had a good chance of 
success.  It did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had that individual gone for private resources, they would have 
said “Do you think that little experiment on the lab table is 
really going to generate the kind of magnesium that we require? 
Don't you think we should have a pilot project that might be big 
enough to fit into a garage?  Don't you think maybe we should 
spend $30,000 proving this?  Don't you think you should come up 
with $30,000 out of your own jeans?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the way successful small business gets organized.  This 
individual put up not a nickel, not a penny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had another person come to me in my riding not so long ago, a 
fellow who had a great idea.  This idea was to put winglets on 
aircraft instead of de-icing fluid.  It was a fabulous idea. 
De-icing fluid is toxic.  These winglets would cover the wings. 
When the plane is ready to leave they take them off and there is 
no ice, no snow and no need for toxic chemicals.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said to me “Doc, where do you think I should go for funding? 
Is there a government program?”  I said “Is there what?  You 
wouldn't dream of going to a government program with this. 
Taxpayers' money should not go into this.  This is an investment 
opportunity.  That is where you should go.  I know three 
individuals”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went to those three individuals and they said to him “The 
tax system in this country is so tough that we have taken all of 
our speculative funds offshore”.  Where did he get his money? 
Offshore, away from Canada, away from a fair taxation system 
which we do not have, away from the entrepreneurial spirit in 
Canada which we do not have.  This is a sad story of a young man 
with a fabulous idea who had to leave this country.  He lived 
here, he breathed here, he wanted to pay taxes here, but he had 
to leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to give another example of how Canadian small business is 
treated here.  We are moving now into an area that is closer to 
home for me.  We have spent a lot of time going through the 
natural health products area over the last while.  My personal 
philosophy on this issue has been that the public should have 
access to natural health products if there is not proven harm, 
not proven side effects and not proven contamination.  People who 
want to look after their health with preventive measures should 
be allowed to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my surprise, I found that the health protection branch, when 
it decides for sometimes very arbitrary reasons to stop making a 
product available in Canada—it cannot be marketed, sold, 
distributed by wholesale or retail and cannot be used—allows the 
Canadian consumer a three month personal supply by mail order or 
by going to another jurisdiction, in particular the United 
States.  That is illogical to me.  If a product is not safe, it 
should say no, ban it and not allow it into the country.  If a 
product is safe, surely it would allow a Canadian retailer to 
market the product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have an example of a little pill called Stevia which has just 
been taken off the market in Canada.  It is a herbal sweetener. 
It has nothing to do with anything toxic.  People can pop it into 
their drinks to sweeten them.  But it does compete with another 
sweetener.  I suspect that might be the reason it would be taken 
off the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government getting out of the way of small business and 
providing an environment for small business is what we expect. 
That is what we look for.  That is what small business hopes for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need more government programs.  We do not need 
individuals who will tell us to use taxpayers' money in a 
speculative manner.  That is the last thing Canadians want.  It 
is the last thing that small business wants.  And it is the last 
thing that I will vote for.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today we are debating Bill C-53, the Small Business 
Loans Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now we are debating an amendment at report stage.  The 
bill has been examined by the committee, has come back to the 
House and some amendments have been proposed.  This is Motion No. 
1.  It is an amendment to restate the purpose of the the act.  It 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this Act is to increase the availability of 
financing of small businesses, which would not otherwise have 
access to financing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that what motivates this bill and this amendment is a 
recognition of the fact that capital is in short supply for small 
businesses in this country.  Of course, capital is what allows 
businesses to put infrastructure in place, to put inventory in 
place, to have proper computerization, to hire qualified people 
and to succeed.

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has long been a concern in this country that for a variety of 
reasons small businesses have had difficulty in obtaining the 
kind of financing they need.  Some people point to the fact that 
the big bad banks refuse to a large degree to take a chance on 
small businesses.  Unless a small business can secure a loan or 
prove it does not really need it, a bank will turn down the loan 
application.  There have been cases that would give merit to that 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banks have made some strenuous efforts over the last while 
to try to address that problem.  Many banks have ombudsmen who 
re-examine loan application turndowns which are felt to be unfair 
and too harsh by small business applicants. There has been some 
action on the part of the banks to be more proactive in this area 
and to be more responsive to the concerns of small businesses. 
The proof of how serious banks are about being more open and more 
responsive to the concerns of small business in their need for 
financing to some degree remains to be seen but the problem has 
been recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment proposes to essentially force banks and lending 
institutions to provide loans to small businesses.  It states 
that the purpose of the act is to increase the availability of 
financing of small businesses which would not otherwise have 
access to financing.  I assume that means banks would have to 
make financing available to small businesses that would not be a 
good credit risk in the ordinary prudent course of business.  We 
have to question whether that is a fair and reasonable 
requirement to place on the banks.  If lending institutions are 
forced to provide financing to dubious or shaky business ventures 
then everybody will pay the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Banks are not some enormous monster in a cave.  The banks are 
us.  Banks are people who own bank stocks.  Banks are unions. 
Unions have a huge amount of their pension funds invested in bank 
stocks.  They are pensioners in this country.  They are all kinds 
of people who have bank stocks.  If banks have to essentially 
give away money in the form of bad loans or unwarranted loans, we 
will all have to pay the price.  I do not think a lot of us, our 
pensions or our RRSP investments can take that kind of hit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am sympathetic to the plight of small businesses and 
their need for financing, the answer is not to have a forced draw 
or confiscation of bank moneys in order to finance small 
businesses with no ability to convince a reasonable lender of the 
merit or soundness of their enterprise or of their ability to 
repay loans.  Most reasonable Canadians would probably agree with 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question remains of what we should do for our small 
businesses that are obviously struggling, that do not have the 
necessary resources to keep up with technology or to rent good 
premises where they can do booming business.  There is a line in 
real estate that location is everything.  Another is hire the top 
people.  We all struggle with that almost every day in one way or 
another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My suggestion to this House and to the proposer of this 
amendment is that other factors can be addressed to assist small 
businesses in this dearth of capital and financing which is a 
real problem and a fact rather than forcing private institutions 
to cough up money against their better business judgment.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As other speakers have, I suggest that the biggest problem for 
our small businesses is that government stands by hovering over 
their profits, ready to pounce on them and confiscate a huge 
chunk of them as soon as they appear.  It is pretty hard for 
small businesses to pay the freight when government is sucking 
away their proceeds.  A large part of the answer is for the 
government to examine why small businesses do not have the 
capital and finances they need to succeed.  A large part of it is 
that government is taking too much in taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to concentrate on two taxes which are sucking the 
life out of small businesses. These are two payroll taxes, the 
CPP payroll tax and the EI payroll tax.  Those are the two taxes 
the finance minister when he was younger and more objective said 
were a cancer on job creation.  All of a sudden when the finance 
minister wants to look good and wants to look like he is getting 
out the red, he decides that putting small businesses in the red 
is better than him being in the red.  So he takes money from 
small businesses partly in the form of payroll taxes to make his 
books look good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the facts.  By the time the CPP payroll tax is 
phased in will cost every business roughly $700 more per 
employee.  That is in addition to what it will cost the employee. 
Let us look at the EI payroll tax.  The business will pay $500 
per worker more than is required to meet the benefit claims of 
the system.  In other words, the employer does not pay only the 
$500 per worker, but $500 of that is an overcharge necessary to 
meet the requirements of the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the finance minister do?  He wants to keep that money. 
Why does he want to keep that money?  He wants to make his books 
look good.  He wants to hoard it against an election so he can 
dole out to Canadians some nice goodies and say “Are we not 
wonderful?  Vote for us we will give you everything you want”. 
That is the way politics works.  What does this do to small 
businesses? It sucks the lifeblood out of them.  They are paying 
$500 per worker more for EI than they ought to.  They pay $700 
per worker for CPP premiums which may or may not keep a shaky 
system in place.  Those charges discourage businesses from doing 
business. They take money from businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my colleagues talked about how his house building 
business would lose 25% of its profit because of the CPP payroll 
increase alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have small businesses starved for cashflow and starved for 
finances.  What does the government do?  It sucks more money out 
of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the government.  Rather than put some piece of 
legislation in place that has a hearts and flowers approach to 
helping small business financing, let small businesses pay 
reasonable taxes, keep a lot more of their profits and prosper as 
will everybody else.  That would be a dimension of this debate 
which should be seriously considered by the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak on Bill C-53.  I will be 
restricting my comments to Group No. 1 amendments put forward by 
my hon. colleague for Mercier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-53, an act to increase the availability of financing for 
the establishment, expansion, modernization and improvement of 
small business, is this government's attempt to put a band-aid 
solution on a problem of access to financing for small business. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has helped to create that problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandate of the Small Business Loans Act is to facilitate 
debt financing for small, young businesses that would not likely 
obtain that financing under the current banking oligarchy in 
Canada.  This mandate, which will be maintained under Bill C-53, 
essentially dictates that the government and therefore the 
taxpayer should take on more risk than private lenders are 
prepared to incur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only reason the taxpayer is forced to incur that risk is the 
Liberal government has mismanaged and over regulated the banking 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even with the changes contained within Bill C-53, the taxpayer 
still covers 85% of any small business loan defaults. One of the 
amendments put forward by my hon. colleague calls on this 
taxpayer liability to be reduced to 50%.  I am sure members of 
this House have enough respect for the average Canadian working 
to support this proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether the members chose to support or oppose this bill, it 
must be remembered that the essential aspect of Bill C-53 is to 
provide high risk loans that the private sector cannot or will 
not provide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members of the House believe this is a fair risk to place on 
the shoulders of Canadian families they should support the bill. 
If they believe it is an unfair risk to place on the taxpayer 
they should oppose the bill.  Furthermore, if members believe the 
private sector can and should provide small business financing 
they should oppose the bill and force the government to make 
fundamental changes to the financial services sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two questions immediately came to mind after reviewing this 
bill.  Why should the taxpayers take on more risk than the banks 
and is there no other way to ensure that small businesses have 
access to much needed investment capital? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intervention by the government maintained by Bill C-53 will 
remove important market forces from the lending process and will 
lead to the funding of less viable business ventures.  This may 
help to garner political support for the Liberals but will do 
nothing to foster a healthy economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government seems to have no concern for average Canadian 
families struggling every day under the highest tax burden in the 
G-7.  Clause 5.1 of Bill C-53 illustrates the government's 
indifference to the fact that it is playing politics with the 
paycheques of Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This section refers to the minister's liability should a loan 
not be repaid. However, it is clear that the liability is that of 
the Canadian taxpayer.  It is not the industry minister's problem 
if high risk loans are defaulted on. It is the taxpayers'. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason I fully support the amendment and would include 
reference to the taxpayers in the legislation so that it is 
transparent to legislators just who is ultimately responsible 
should the loans under this act fall to default. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the issue of risk should be examined more closely.  Risk 
is a key element in the proper functioning of a free market.  If 
it is artificially lessened or eliminated from market 
interactions it leads to a misallocation of scare resources. That 
is, lending institutions will be less inclined, despite the 
provisions for due diligence contained in Bill C-53, to evaluate 
the long term viability of a business venture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation will lend itself to the financing of 
unsustainable market ventures and it is the taxpayers under this 
regime who will inevitably be the losers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is supported by the government's own statistics which show 
that the default rate under the Small Business Loans Act was 
about 5% while the private sector was at approximately 1%.  This 
is substantial when one considers the amount of money at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry department proudly claims that the taxpayer has 
only a $1.5 billion liability.  This is not an insignificant 
amount of money.  Canadian taxpayers are at their breaking point. 
Someone has to say enough is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone in this House understands the vital role that small 
businesses play in the Canadian economy.  Many of my colleagues 
from the official opposition are small business operators.  We 
understand the difficulties small business owners face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that high taxes and regulations come first to 
mind when I think of how tough it is survive in a small business 
climate.  If payroll and income taxes were lower, life would be 
easier for small business owners. 
However, the government does not care enough to do anything about 
these problems.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members of the House wish to stand and talk about their 
commitment to small businesses, then they should first return 
every cent of the EI surplus.  Until that time they have no right 
to speak on behalf of small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact of small business on the Canadian economy is 
substantial and Reformers have always supported the needs of 
small businesses.  However, Bill C-53 is not a debate about 
whether small business is valuable, it is a question of whether 
small businesses can get access to financing without the 
government intervening in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>High risk small business ventures can be financed in a 
competitive banking system, provided the lenders are not 
unnecessarily restricted from conducting their affairs in a 
manner that allows them to incur risk without incurring losses. 
It is really that simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is committed to getting the government out of 
the business of business and out of the pockets of average 
Canadian families, but this bill further entrenches the 
government's role in the banking industry.  We must push 
aggressively to change the industry so that small businesses can 
get access to financing without the government setting the terms 
of that financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-53 and its predecessor the Small Business Loans Act allow 
the government to ignore the real obstacles to small business 
financing.  No more taxpayer dollars should be placed at risk 
until the government has made substantial changes to the banking 
industry to create real competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point small businesses' access to finance can be 
reviewed and new legislation can be tabled if the government can 
demonstrate a legitimate market failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government just cannot seem to get the fundamentals right. 
Bill C-53 plays politics with the taxpayers' paycheques.  It 
demands that the taxpayer take on more risk than the banks by 
guaranteeing loans.  Let us get the government out of the 
business of business and off the backs of the Canadian taxpayers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as 
my colleagues and I said this morning, we oppose the bill.  We 
gave excellent reasons as to why the official opposition does not 
agree with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that since we do not have a majority the chances 
are that the bill will go through.  Therefore, my colleagues have 
come up with amendments which will bring more accountability to 
this issue and two motions were put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is to make sure that only one family member receives the 
loan.  As well the limit is being reduced from $250,000 to 
$100,000.  The average loan has been $65,000. Reducing the limit 
to $100,000 in no way will have a major impact but it will bring 
more accountability and ensure that the loan is given to small 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning I read a news item which said that the banks are 
going to set up a small business bank.  This came out of their 
desire to merge.  They have said to the small business people 
that they will set up a small business bank to address this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to see that the banks feel they have to do that. They 
have come up with an innovative idea.  I think it is a good idea. 
They are addressing that issue, but that is the whole point of 
what we have been trying to say.  The banks have to come up with 
innovative ideas to address the issue of small business 
financing.  It is not a bill like this one under which the banks 
can hide and not take any risk and say they are helping small 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate this morning by the official opposition has been that 
the private sector and in this particular instance the banks have 
to take more responsibility.  They have to come up with 
innovative ideas on how to finance small businesses.  They need 
to change their thinking. The banks have to change from thinking 
about how much money they can make. The banks must think of how 
they can be partners with small businesses to improve the 
Canadian economy.  That is the thinking that requires change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking with the vice-president of the CIBC.  He said they 
understand and realize there needs to be a change in thinking and 
that they would be working on it. 
I would just tell them that they had better hurry up so that they 
do not miss the boat.  The official opposition is asking for the 
banking sector to open up to more competition.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are ways the banks can work with small business. As I 
said, I have had experience with small businesses.  That is why I 
am saying that the way the banks can help small business is to 
set up advisory councils of business people who can advise the 
banks so they can broaden their criteria on how they give out 
loans.  And here we have another intervention by the state in the 
banks through this bill by saying the state is coming in and it 
will guarantee the loan.  The banks will shirk their 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned this morning, this kind of financing has been 
available for the last 25 years but still there are complaints 
out there that small businesses are having a hard time accessing 
funds.  This bill is not going to solve the problem of financing 
for small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some good news I mentioned earlier is that the banks want to set 
up another institution that will primarily address the needs of 
the small businesses.  Great.  It is a good idea. They should 
have done it a long time ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the overall picture the responsibility for the burden on 
small business is the economic climate created by the government. 
We have made it clear and we are saying it again.  The high 
level of taxation, which takes into account payroll taxes, the 
bureaucratic reporting and the huge amount of paperwork 
businesses have to do which is an indirect cost on small 
businesses is what leads them to ruin and stops an entrepreneur 
from putting time into the business to make it successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Business people are asking to be left alone so they can carry on 
doing their business.  That is what they want to do. Is the 
economic climate there for them to do it?  No. They are mired by 
government bureaucracy. They are mired by reporting structures. 
They are mired by this report and that report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I started a small business 16 years ago it was great fun. 
One would work hard, pay one's little taxes, pay one's employees 
and get going.  It used to be fun.  Today it is not fun.  It is 
becoming a burden. Today you have to think “Oh man, I have to 
send in this report.  I have to do this and I have to do that”. 
What a change over 16 years in doing business in this country. 
The blame lies partly with that side. And I am talking from 
experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am telling the government to create the environment and reduce 
the taxes.  The GST which the Liberals said they were going to 
remove is another big headache. The reporting structure of it is 
a problem.  We need to create the economic climate to let 
Canadians do their job and let Canadian businesses try.

responsibility of addressing the issues.  We hope the government 
will recognize that it has to create a climate in which small 
business can thrive.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
pleased to speak to Group No. 2 which contains Motion Nos. 2, 3, 
4 and 5.  The bill is about small businesses.  If there is a big 
storm the big trees fall.  Only the grass remains green and 
survives a big storm.  It is very important that we take care of 
small businesses at least as much as big businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no difficulty in supporting the motion, but one thing 
that is clear is that the Liberal government has had all the 
opportunities.  Some amendments were brought forward from 1993 
and so on, but nothing significant was addressed or taken care of 
to enable small businesses to get the benefits the act intended, 
not to mention that medium and big businesses borrow money from 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rationale behind Motion No. 2 which we are dealing with is 
that it is designed to prevent one family member who is part 
owner of a small business from taking out a loan if another 
family member has already done so.  The idea is that the system 
should be more equitable.  It should be fairer and should not be 
subject to abuse as it has been in the past according to the 
auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Small Business Loans Act each borrower has been 
limited to a maximum loan of $250,000.  The auditor general 
detected a few cases in the sample loan file where certain 
individual corporations with substantial common ownership managed 
to collectively obtain numerous loans far in excess of the 
stipulated maximum loan amount of $250,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one case, according to the auditor general, a group of 23 
related corporations managed to collect more than $4 million 
under the SBLA.  This is a gross abuse of the system.  Although 
Industry Canada had already notified lending institutions in 
writing that such loans would not be covered under SBLA after 
July 1996, detection of such cases by the department is difficult 
because of the lack of complete access to loan file information 
during review of submitted claims.  These practices are contrary 
to the intent of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general also noted that while the Small Business 
Loans Act specifically defined the eligibility conditions of 
those who may borrow under the program, there were no provisions 
designed to prevent a group of entities with substantial common 
ownership from gaining multiple access to loans under the 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general recommended a clarification of this issue to 
ensure the SBLA program meets the goal of providing financial 
assistance to smaller businesses within the acceptable risk 
exposure of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These practices are contrary to the intent of the act. Currently 
there are no provisions under the Small Business Loans Act to 
prevent this even though such rules exist under the Income Tax 
Act, which has provisions designed to limit access to the low 
corporate rate of tax for smaller businesses and to prevent abuse 
by the creation of a number of related corporations.  More rigor 
is needed to address the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to support Motion No. 3.  We know that the 
government is slow in learning, but I am the one who brought 
forward the issue in Motion No. 2 and No. 3 in the first debate 
we had on the bill. 
I am glad that it is learning but learning slow and I am glad to 
support Motion No. 3.  The rationale is that the amendment lowers 
the maximum amount of a small business loan from $250,000 to the 
pre-1993 level of $100,000.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Groups such as Canadian Federation of Independent Business made 
presentations before Senate and House committees which called 
into question whether the ceiling of $250,000 was too high. 
Industry officials concede that the average size of loans made 
under the old SBLA was only $65,000.  In view of this, present 
levels could be trimmed.  I am glad the government has learned 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem of column shifting appears to be more pronounced in 
loans over $100,000.  This could mean a number of things, but 
most likely there is an inverse relation: the larger the size of 
a loan to an SME, the smaller the bank's willingness to 
underwrite the loan.  There is an inverse relation between the 
amount of the loan and the willingness of the bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From its inception to March 31, 1993 the program made $339 
million in net payments to lending institutions over a 32 year 
period.  Following amendments to the Small Business Loans Act in 
1993 the program considerably broadened eligibility criteria and 
increased the maximum loan amounts per borrower from $100,000 to 
$250,000.  The auditor general noted it and it has been 
addressed.  I am glad that it has been addressed in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Federation of Independent Business which has over 
90,000 members has been saying that if the current abuses of the 
Small Business Loans Act were curbed and if the parameters of the 
program were restricted, the program would require less of an 
allocation of funds while being effective in meeting the 
program's objective.  The thresholds for financing are too high 
in the old SBLA.  The legislation defines small businesses as 
those firms that have up to $5 million in sales.  That is not 
small. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CFIB says that we are not talking about small businesses in 
this case.  What we are talking about is medium or large size 
businesses.  That becomes an alternative source of financing for 
medium and larger businesses, depriving smaller business of the 
facilities which are intended for them.  Small businesses are not 
being given any advantage compared to what medium and larger 
firms are getting from Bill C-53. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the size of the loan and the size of the annual sales of the 
business were reduced, we would have a system that serves smaller 
businesses.  We would also have a system with a drastically 
reduced rate of abuse, which is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in the beginning the government cares about larger 
businesses, not about smaller businesses.  When the storm comes, 
the government will remember that smaller businesses which are 
supporting our economy can survive any type of storm but the big 
firms are subject to falling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been giving big businesses all the big 
benefits it could give.  We know that Bombardier got $25 million 
worth of interest free loans.   We know that Bombardier or some 
other businesses like it have been getting all those facilities. 
Bombardier also got sole source contracts of $2.85 billion from 
NATO through the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Smaller businesses have been subject to abuse. They have been 
subject to high taxes by the government.  CPP and EI premiums 
have been so high that smaller businesses could not cope.  Even 
the government knows that $350 per employee and $500 per employer 
are being paid too much by the smaller businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I summarize by saying that I am happy to support Motions Nos. 2 
and 3.  Motions Nos. 4 and 5 are more of a technical nature 
rather than of any significant legislative importance.  We will 
be supporting Motions Nos. 4 and 5 along with Motions Nos. 2 and 3.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first I will speak to Motions 
Nos. 4 and 5 which reference the Fisheries Improvement Loans Act. 
After review of the act it was seen that reference to the 
Fisheries Improvement Loans Act was no longer required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several small business support programs were restructured in 
1987.  Fishers became eligible borrowers under the Small Business 
Loans Act and no new loans were made under the Fisheries 
Improvement Loans Act.  Loans that were still outstanding 
continued to be administered by fisheries and oceans and 
borrowers continued to make payments on those loans.  Some 85 
loans were still outstanding under the program when the bill was 
being developed.  It was decided that a reference to the 
Fisheries Improvement Loans Act was necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have subsequently learned that the loans still on the books 
under the old Fisheries Improvement Loans Act have declined to a 
negligible amount.  Given that most of these loans will soon be 
paid off the books, reference to the Fisheries Improvement Loans 
Act in the proposed Canada Small Business Financing Act is no 
longer required.  An amendment to the same effect was made to 
clause 3 when the bill was at committee.  I urge all members of 
the House to support these amendments as technical clean-up of 
the bill in its references to the fisheries loan act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been many comments with respect to Motion No. 3 which 
recommends the reduction of the amount that can be lent to small 
business from $250,000 to $100,000.  Much of the discussion has 
been referenced to the CFIB, that its recommendation was to 
reduce the amount to $100,000.  The Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business surveyed its members and found that over 49% 
supported leaving the limit at $250,000.  It notified the 
standing committee along that line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind everyone here, especially the official opposition, that 
other stakeholders like the Canadian Restaurant and Food Services 
Association, the Canadian Bankers Association and some 
independent witnesses in committee also spoke to maintaining the 
$250,000 limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was much discussion on related borrowers which is what 
Motion No. 2 addresses.  I am surprised the member for 
Saskatoon—Humboldt put forward this motion after all the debate 
we had in committee including a discussion of the preliminary 
regulations.  It was agreed among the bankers and the 
stakeholders, the CFIB, the Canadian Restaurant and Food Services 
Association and the department, that they would look at and come 
up with the respective regulation that would follow up on the 
auditor general's comments.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This process has started.  It is well under way and the 
regulations will be issued in due course, after the bill is 
approved, hopefully by all members of this Chamber, despite some 
earlier comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Motion No. 2, there are some 1,600 deliverers of 
what is now known as the SBLA, the future Canada small business 
finances act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the timing for regulation approval and training of 
between 1,500 and 1,600 deliverers, this item will be taking 
effect, as noted by all the people as discussions were held in 
the industry committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason, I would not now support going back on what we 
had said in committee and on what we had agreed to with respect 
to the regulations coming forward to change the items shown in 
Motion No. 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to speak to those motions.  Hopefully members of the 
official opposition will realize that there has been more fine 
tuning of this act.  The standing committee on industry had great 
discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the new NDP member on the committee, specifically the 
member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys.  I want to 
mention his contribution.  He took a great interest in this bill 
and has shown that he wants to be more involved with small 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope all of the opposition parties, when the time comes, will 
approve this bill for the benefit of small business rather than 
for political reasons. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this 
amendment is very positive.  I would like to refer, in 
particular, to the hon. member's comments just now about 
“related”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to be very careful about “related” and how we define 
it.  It is all very well to argue that we are going to have this 
very carefully defined through regulation and things of that 
sort.  I agree that has to be done.  However, there are times 
when “related” needs to be defined very clearly in the 
legislation itself.  Perhaps even this definition may fall 
slightly short of what is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer to a practice which has happened.  I do not know 
how often it has happened, but I know of at least several 
instances.  A company, which was not such a small business, 
needed capital of about a million dollars.  It discovered that, 
yes, there was a small business loan that it could get.  However, 
the maximum it could get was $250,000 and it needed $1 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With their ingenuity—and a lot of these small business people 
are characterized by their ingenuity—they said “How can we do 
this?”  They divided the company into four subsidiaries.  Each 
of those subsidiaries qualified for a small business loan. 
Subsequently, each of those four businesses borrowed to the 
maximum of $250,000.  Lo and behold, the full $1 million was 
available to the company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was common ownership among the four subsidiaries. 
Obviously, what was happening was that they met all of the 
technical requirements of the regulations and the provisions of 
the act; however, they definitely did not meet the spirit or the 
intent of the legislation.  I believe that is really what is 
behind this motion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the hon. parliamentary secretary who spoke a 
moment ago recognizes full well that that is precisely what is 
involved here and I hope this amendment makes that very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point we need to recognize, which I want to reinforce, 
is the point that was made earlier by my colleague for 
Calgary—Nose Hill, which had to do with payroll taxes and the 
impact those taxes have on the effectiveness and profitability of 
small businesses and their ability to hire people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She referred to the Canada pension plan.  The point that needs 
to be added is that over the next four years Canada pension plan 
premiums will increase by about 71%.  There will be no 
corresponding increase in the benefits received by the individual 
who subscribes to the pension plan.  The difficulty for the 
businessman who has an employee is that it will cost him an 
additional $700 a year to have that person on the payroll, and 
yet the individual does not receive additional benefits.  We need 
to recognize that this is what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point has to do with EI premiums and the hon. member 
covered that point very well.  But we need to recognize that when 
the two are added together it means that each new employee costs 
the small businessman roughly $1,200 a year.  That is a very 
significant amount of money.  That reduces the bottom line by 
that amount of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to draw the House's attention to something I find rather 
unique.  I discovered it in the November 14 weekend edition of 
the <I>Globe and Mail</I>.  What struck me was the logo.  The BDC 
has a new logo.  It says “We are a different kind of bank.  We 
are the small business bank”.  The ad reads: 
<UL>

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of observations.  First, in this ad the Business 
Development Bank of Canada is offering to sell or make available 
to investors and individuals notes that have guaranteed principal 
if held to maturity.  If we invested $1,000 and we left it until 
November 24, 2006, we would be guaranteed the full principal on 
the maturity date.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Preliminary investigations suggest that the notes themselves are 
backed by a basket of stocks on the Nikkei Stock Exchange, the 
Japanese stock market.  This suggests that the interest is based 
100% on any increase in the Nikkei 225.  So if there was no 
increase, then only the principal would come back.  If there was 
a substantial increase, then the value of those notes presumably 
would increase by the value of that basket of stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is interesting.  It looks to me that these are Japanese 
stocks that are being talked about, yet it says clearly that 
there is no direct foreign currency exposure nor is there foreign 
content.  It is RRSP eligible as Canadian content.  This is an 
interesting ad.  It requires a lot more study before we get into 
the detail of what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also refer to the CIBC Wood Gundy Securities Inc., which 
is a subsidiary of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.  We 
know that last week the CIBC advised the world and all of its 
shareholders that in the previous quarter its profit had dropped 
by 70%, largely as a result of its unsuccessful operation within 
the investment market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting that there will necessarily be bad 
performance.  However, the BDC is acting as an agent of the 
crown, an agent of the Government of Canada, which means that if 
the stock market goes down, as it did recently, in November 2006, 
the Canadian people will be responsible for the full principal 
that has been invested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is a different kind of bank, a bank for small business, 
I would like to know what in the world is going on.  It is 
incumbent upon the Minister of Industry and the Minister of 
Finance and even the Prime Minister to look at this and ask 
“What are we doing with this kind of a corporation in Canada?” 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, from the very 
start of the debate, I have been hearing our Reform colleagues 
say that if taxes and wages were lower, small businesses would 
be doing just fine, and that in any case government guaranteed 
loans were not needed when businesses were sound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect, unless the situation out west is very 
different from that in Quebec, what they are saying does not fit 
in with the needs of small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a number of sectors, start-up or expanding companies represent 
a risk. Members who were with me when bankers appeared before us 
know that, every time we asked them about start-up companies, 
they said that there was indeed a risk, that a new venture is 
always a risk. An expanding business needs room to grow and this 
also represents a risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the thrust of the bill is to ensure that, when a 
small business which is considered a risk but has a reasonable 
chance of being successful cannot get a loan, the government 
steps in to guarantee the loan. This is the intent of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might have been the first one to say that small businesses 
should pay lower EI premiums, but I will never say that lowering 
them means that start-up or expanding companies no longer need 
the Small Business Loans Act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing goes for lower wages. We are not looking to 
create an economy based on lower wages. What we want is an 
economy where small businesses about to start up choose to 
operate in sectors where work is highly paid and people can earn 
a decent living. You can be sure that developed countries and 
nations enjoying stronger growth have not relied on low wages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I feel I need to defend this bill against the attacks 
of my Reform colleague, I also want to tell my Liberal 
colleagues that they could have done a much better job of it. In 
fact, this bill is supposed to help small businesses, but what 
we have seen is some kind of negotiations with the banks and the 
big franchisors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to understand that we need the banks to lend the 
money and to compel them to meet a number of conditions, that 
the loan guarantee cannot be seen as their chance to get some 
bad loans paid back, which is why the spirit of the legislation 
has to be clearly stated. Unfortunately, nowhere can it be found 
in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowhere in the bill before us is the spirit of the legislation 
mentioned. The regulations previously included in the 
legislation have been withdrawn. The committee agreed to ensure 
that the regulations would not be changed without prior 
consultation of the parties and the committee. We hope things 
will stay that way. The regulations really reflect the spirit of 
the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some of the points we, in the Bloc Quebecois, want to 
make about these amendments. 
The first point that we will continue to make is that the 
purpose of the act must be stated in the act. We will also make 
the point that, in assessing the act, we must not only ask 
ourselves if the total cost of the loans will be paid by the 
borrowers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are fundamental questions that must be asked. What is the 
effect on the economy? What is the effect on employment as well 
as on the survival and the growth of small and medium size 
businesses? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a loan application is denied, when a prospective business 
is denied access to a loan and cannot start up as a result, how 
much does it cost to our economy? How much does it cost in terms 
of money that is not being injected into our economy? How much 
does it cost in terms of social spending for the person who is 
unemployed? We must take into account the costs of a business 
not being able to get off the ground as well as the risk of 
problems for small and medium size businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will make that point. We will also make the point that pilot 
projects must include working capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody knows that the financing of working capital is almost 
an essential requirement for a business that wants to start up 
or to grow. We agree that it is not appropriate to use this 
general program to finance working capital. However, we think 
there should be at least a pilot project where working capital 
would be guaranteed, but the business receiving the loan would 
also receive management counselling.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of my colleagues and I sent out simple questionnaires 
to our small and medium-sized businesses. One of the things we 
asked was: “In your opinion, if credit were easier to get, would 
the growth of your business be better, and would the risk of 
bankruptcy be lower?”  Many of the respondents said “Yes”.  The 
reason we asked this is that, in our experience, small and 
medium-sized businesses often do not manage to hang on for more 
than a year and a half, two years, two years and a half, because 
of administrative problems, yes, but also because they often 
have financing problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Federation of Independent Business had good reason 
to say that this is a very significant problem for more than 29% 
of businesses. 
This is why we are going to defend these points which will help 
advance the financing of small and medium-sized businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worthwhile pointing out at this time that loans for 
equipment account for 73.4% of the total, loans for land, 12.8%, 
and loans for commercial space, 12.8%.  It seems to me that this 
should help our colleagues beside us understand the importance 
of this bill, because equipment is what enables the company with 
some commercial space, whether or not it owns the land, to get 
started up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes the business also needs to finance its working 
capital. 
Businesses which have to purchase products for use in their 
production, to purchase raw materials to be manufactured, and 
then sell their products perhaps without any return for three 
months, may fail, despite all their spanking new equipment, 
their employees, because they lack the working capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ask that all this be looked at in order to improve the bill, 
and not to make it unworkable, as my colleagues next to us would 
like to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have a couple of points I would like to raise under 
Group No. 2.  One deals with some of the comments made by the 
hon. member from the Bloc who just spoke. The other deals with 
comments made by the government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Starting with the comments on the government side, members said 
they held their committee hearings, listened to people across the 
country and got a particular input from those people.  But then 
later they said there were supplemental letters to the committee. 
I am not aware of these.  I have seen what was presented at 
committee and I have not gone beyond that.  In that committee 
many groups, including the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business, specifically said they thought the ceiling on this was 
too high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back to a time when I was on the transport committee. There 
was one particular blatant piece of legislation that I recall, 
the Canadian Transportation Act.  On that we had a tremendous 
number of interveners from across this country, from one end to 
the other.  A huge majority of them, in the 90% range, were 
opposed to clause 27. They were clearly against it and they went 
on at great length to explain why they were opposed to it. I made 
an amendment at committee to delete that clause which was so 
objectionable to so many people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found it incredibly interesting that not one of the government 
members supported that amendment to delete that clause of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member from the government said that the Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business amended its position after 
consultation with its membership, I do not know if he misspoke 
but he gave a figure that less than a majority was in favour of a 
higher ceiling. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is most curious that he used a figure of less than 50% 
because it automatically implies that more than 50% still wanted 
that lower ceiling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from the Bloc made reference to how the Reform Party 
says the answer to this is lower taxes and lower salaries.  She 
is half right, which is probably not bad on an average day.  We 
certainly think there should be less tax. No one has suggested 
that people should get paid less as the answer to businesses 
making more profit.  We would like to see people making more 
profit and able to buy more things which means they should have 
more disposable income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have for a long time been very clear about disposable income 
and the ability of a Canadian business to compete and to sell its 
products cheaper by all means, but not by cutting profits.   Most 
cannot cut their profit as most of it has already been taken 
away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the speech I made earlier today.  I hope the hon. 
members listening were privy to that.  I used an example of my 
being in small business just prior to being elected.  I was in 
the construction business and the results of the increase of the 
CPP tax alone accounted for two of the eight houses I built each 
year; 25% of my gross profits, not for all payroll taxes, not 
even for all the cost of the CPP.  This was just for the amount 
that this government was increasing it by, 25% of my gross 
profit, $12,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I carry a dandy little device, a financial analyst calculator. 
While I was listening to the hon. member speak I pulled my 
calculator out of my briefcase and quickly calculated the $1,000 
a month, which is what the government would have taken out of my 
pocket were I still operating my small business just for the 
increase in the CPP alone.  I calculated the amount at 9% 
interest which is pretty nominal for a small business trying to 
get a loan these days.  I amortized it over a 10 year period, 
compounded semi-annually, which is the normal banking practice. 
It would have required a loan of $80,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying is that the problem with this whole bill with 
its $250,000 limits, government guarantees and high ratios which 
we will get into in part three of this debate, is that it 
suggests we have to give more money and back up more.  What we 
have to do is stop taking money away.  I do not care if we are 
talking in terms of intent, in terms of how high a ceiling we 
should put on this or what ratio we should guarantee. The best 
way to help businesses is to stop taking their money.  We should 
not be creating legislation that makes it easier for them to 
borrow money to give to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a small business operator, if I had to maintain my gross 
revenue income flow to pre-CPP tax increase levels I would have 
to go to the bank and borrow $12,000 a year.  Over the course of 
10 years I could take and amortize with interest a loan of 
$80,000.  That is $120,000 with interest payments added up that 
my business would have to put out in order to come up with the 
money the government would take out of my pocket for the CPP 
increase alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem in this bill is not whether the whole ceiling should 
be lowered.  It is the government's approach to the idea of what 
small business needs.  It somehow thinks that it is all right to 
fix the whole problem in our economy by making it easier for 
business to borrow money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will repeat in each section of this bill that the true way to 
solve the problem for small business is to leave the money in 
that business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember back in the late 1970s the banking industry decided 
this was a pretty vibrant economy and it could make tons of money 
by just getting businesses and individuals to borrow more. 
Contrary to what we have now where we have to go on bended knee 
and beg the banks to loan us money, in the late 1970s they were 
begging people to take it.  Because it was so easy and they made 
it sound so great, people borrowed more and more.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They wanted to borrow $50,000 to buy a used machine they saw. 
They felt they should be able to borrow $125,000 and buy a new 
one.  This was no problem.  They would write a cheque right then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what this government is leading people toward.  The 
government has increased the cost to operate business then makes 
it easier for these businesses to borrow money.  We get into a 
vicious cycle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government and Liberal governments in the past, all 
governments past, the old style politics of Canada operated by 
the two principal parties that have occupied this House, have 
often in many parts of Canada created a dependency on government. 
They have created that for businesses and individuals and they 
have created it for entire regions of this country.  They created 
dependency for a race of people, a culture of people, through the 
Indian and northern affairs legislation and acts of that branch 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now this government is trying to do it once again.  This 
government is trying to get businesses on hook to the generosity, 
in its view, of the Liberal government through a loans program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something wrong when the government thinks that the 
first thing it has to do is tax away everyone's money then turn 
around and loan some back.  It will arrange to have some of it 
loaned back.  The government will guarantee it. That is mighty 
generous of the government considering what it is really 
guaranteeing is individuals' own money.  The government took the 
money from them in the first place. The amount the government 
stands to lose can be paid out of the CPP increase alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we should be lowering those limits.  The majority of 
people who borrow money, the majority of businesses that borrow 
money, traditionally borrow on average far less than what we 
would like to see that ceiling reduced to, partly in response to 
many of the groups that spoke in committee. We think that is 
good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real way to solve the problem, which the government will 
hear a lot and I hope it sinks in, is that it will have to 
recognize that borrowing money to overcome oppressive taxes is 
not the answer to getting the economy going in this country 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should deal with all businesses by ensuring that 
they get to keep some of that money in their pocket.  Businesses 
earned it.  It belongs to them.  The government has not earned 
it.  Unlike the thinking of the finance minister the money does 
not belong to the government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, we 
are talking about Motion Nos. 2 and 3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who has ever applied for loans probably found it 
disappointing if they were turned down.  It would be unusual if 
at some time in our lives when we applied for a loan we were not 
been turned down.  It is not always because the idea was not good 
or the product we wanted to buy was not a decent product but it 
could just be because the proposal or our income was not 
sufficient to support the loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not remove the disappointment but one of the things 
this bill does is facilitate dependency by groups of businesses 
that cannot qualify through the normal lending channels.  That is 
one of the thrusts we have been talking about today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is going about financing small business the wrong 
way.  What the government is doing is building a dependency where 
people who cannot get money through a regular bank can go through 
the back door by having taxpayers guarantee the loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today when I was speaking on the first group of 
amendments, I was talking about the alternatives that can be used 
to get around that.  It is not a problem that these businesses 
cannot get money.  Businesses can always get money.  But it is 
the problem of there being a price to be paid for it.  Sometimes 
these people do not want to pay the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it is a new business, a risky venture, it may be a good 
idea but the banks have never seen it before.  Individuals 
approach various banks and the banks say they have never seen any 
history of this type of business and do not think they can make 
it and they do not qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those individuals are not satisfied that they cannot get the 
money from the banks.  But there are alternatives out there if 
they pay a bit more in interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had examples today from some of my colleagues of 
businesses that were started with borrowed money from friends or 
from a venture capitalist. I explained that my business, prior to 
being a member of parliament, was specializing in the financing 
of home based businesses. Certainly we lent the money out at an 
interest premium to the banks because we were filling that niche 
of handling that risky area of business.

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest problem we had as a small company involved in that 
financing sector was that when we used mortgages as a guarantee 
the government considered us to be in an investment business and 
it taxed us at a 50% rate on our profits.  That took away our 
ability to reinvest in these people.  Yet we were willing to make 
all sorts of creative financing options for people that made it 
possible for them to get into business.  In the five years we ran 
the leasing business prior to my becoming a member of parliament 
we never had a single loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet we always took on businesses that could not get financing at 
the regular places.  All it took was a little creativity. Instead 
of going through the normal procedure a bank might go through of 
making people fill out pages and pages of information about their 
personal financial history and being unable to prove they had a 
previous background, we would look instead for stability and 
trustworthiness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did that in a very simple way.  We had five telephone 
directories in our office that went back five years.  The first 
thing we did when a person called and asked for lease financing 
was look in those telephone directories to see if the person had 
lived in the same place for five years.  If they had, that gave 
us the first good clue that the person was stable, reliable and 
would be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we asked applicants for their job histories.  Had they 
worked at the same place for a good length of time, four or five 
years?  A second clue that they were trustworthy, reliable and 
would not run away would be if they had the same job for five 
years, had just been laid off and thought they would get into 
business for themselves.  If we leased them a fax machine or a 
photocopier they would not just run away and disappear out of 
sight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we asked if we could do a credit check on their credit 
cards to find out if they were up to their limit.  If the people 
going into business were not up to their credit card limits, that 
indicated they were not yet under financial stress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those were all good signs, being in the phone book for five 
years, having a good steady job prior to going into business for 
themselves and having credit cards that were not maxed.  If these 
criteria were met they got their loans.  That is all we did. 
There was no indepth financial investigation of their pasts.  We 
just looked for reliability, trustworthiness and a sense these 
people would not run away if something went wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course a portion of the loans we made started to go bad. 
People would miss payments.  Because these people were 
trustworthy and believed in their ideas we could approach them, 
talk with them and make arrangements for them to catch up.  They 
could find alternative positions, to sell the equipment or to 
make adjustments to their portfolios. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That sort of creativity is possible but because the government 
taxed away so much of what we made from this exercise we were 
robbed of capital to expand.  The demand for what we could do was 
much greater than what we could ever fill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government response is to build dependency by providing 
money at a bank market rate by making taxpayers carry the can on 
any defaults.  It was mentioned earlier that only a small 
percentage are in default.  It is about 5.6% to 6%.  The 
aggregate amount that can be paid out under this program is $1.5 
billion.  A default rate of 5.6% amounts to about $75 million 
under default at any particular time.  That is a significant 
chunk of money.  We should be pretty concerned about the 
liability faced by taxpayers when they are guaranteeing these 
sorts of loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the amendments proposed in Group No. 2 are being put 
forward.  Motion No. 2 makes sure no loans are made to relatives 
of the initial borrower to put more money into the same business. 
It is not right to use a loophole to get around the intent of 
the act.  If we have decided a business can borrow a certain 
amount it is not right to allow relatives working in the same 
business to borrow their share and to increase the total amount 
being risked on a particular business.  That was the reason we 
introduced this amendment stating the loan must not be in 
addition to other loans made under this act to persons related to 
the borrower for the operation of the same small business. More 
than two of my colleagues have given examples found by the 
auditor general of abuse in this area.

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other amendment we put forward is that the amount given to 
the borrower does not exceed $100,000.  Industry officials had to 
admit that the average loan size was $65,000, which is still a 
reasonable chunk of change for people starting a small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Borrowing $250,000 for the average person is a lot of money. 
That is more than starting a small business.  There really is no 
need to go to that level.  Restricting it to $100,000 is quite 
enough, especially if the minister will not agree to preventing 
this multiple borrowing we are trying to correct with Motion No. 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge members to support the Reform motions and if they do they 
will significantly improve the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on Bill C-53, Motions Nos. 2 
and 3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have gone through this before.  The government is nibbling 
around the edges.  The bill unfortunately will not address the 
problems affecting the private sector by any meaningful way.  I 
will continue with the speech I was making earlier on 
constructive solutions that can be applied to the bill if the 
government would listen.  It would find there would be widespread 
agreement among the electorate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are various things the government can do with respect to 
labour policy.  It can work with the provinces.  I challenge the 
ministers across the way to call their provincial counterparts 
together to deal with the issue of labour policies which are 
having a restricting effect on the ability of the private sector 
to function as well as it can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unionization techniques are being done to quite significantly 
restrict productivity.  Certain things can be implemented.  For 
example, there is the aspect of members taking a strike vote. The 
strike vote or a vote on whether to unionize should be a silent 
or anonymous vote rather than public.  Often strong arm tactics 
are used on members to vote for unionization or a strike.  That 
should be done by a secret ballot system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aspect of sexual bargaining should be banned, as this also 
restricts the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really horrible that we have not been able to address 
these significant problems that have been beleaguering the 
private sector for so long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has an enormous role to play regarding industrial 
policy in reduction of interprovincial trade barriers.  We had an 
opportunity to do that in this House and rather than taking 
meaningful measures to reduce interprovincial trade barriers the 
government once again nibbled around the edges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private sector says we have more boundaries east-west in 
Canada than we have north-south.  In part that can explain the 
reason why, although we have implemented free trade agreements, 
they have not been as good as they can become because the 
Government of Canada has actually impeded and impaired the 
ability of the Canadian private sector to be competitive with its 
counterpart south of the border because it has not done much with 
removing the interprovincial trade barriers that hamstring them 
so badly.  I would encourage it to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By eliminating direct subsidies to businesses we can save 
taxpayers a lot of money.  They really are not necessary because 
the private sector does not want the money.  It wants the 
environment that will enable it to be productive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a fetish for introducing regulations but have little 
desire to remove them.  British Columbia has enacted 3,000 new 
regulations since the government was elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I must interrupt the 
hon. member.  When the bill is brought back before the House for

<A NAME="LINK214">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC)</B> moved that Bill S-11, an act 
to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act in order to add social 
condition as a prohibited ground of discrimination, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Mr. Speaker, it is with emotion and hope that I 
initiate today the second reading debate on Bill S-11, an act to 
amend the Canadian Human Rights Act in order to add social 
condition as a prohibited ground of discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to be able to start my presentation by stating that 
we have every reason to be proud of living in this country 
because Canada is internationally recognized as one of the 
leading proponents of human justice, as a country whose society 
is said to acknowledge every human being's right to dignity, 
respect and equal opportunities. Unfortunately, I cannot make 
such a statement because nothing could be further from the 
truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As governments in this country concentrate their energies on 
reducing the budget deficit, the equality deficit caused by 
poverty in the form of discrimination is being overlooked. While 
being increasingly recognized on the international scene as a 
human rights issue, poverty remains one of the main barriers to 
equality in Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, Canadians who, because they are poor, are excluded from 
the social, economic and cultural life the rest of us enjoy are 
often treated like second class citizens. The everyday reality 
of many Canadians, living in poverty generally means lack of 
food, substandard housing, increased vulnerability to illness 
and systemic barriers to schooling and employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, to add insult to injury, there is more to this horrific 
state of affairs. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1820"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT94"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT94"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1820

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to having to endure the material hardships that 
accompany poverty, poor Canadians are always having to face 
ostracism and negative stereotyping in their dealings with 
financial institutions, owners, businesses and their staff, 
officials, the legal system, neighbours and strangers and in the 
media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian society is indeed intolerant of the poor.  This 
disparaging treatment is in part fed by the generalized 
obsession with the debt and the deficit, as I mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians who depend on social programs in order to live are 
disparaged and humiliated by taxpayers as a whole. 
The conclusion is self evident.  Disparagement of the poor 
promotes discrimination against them.  In other words, I would 
say they are faulted in a way for being poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite this general attitude, I am convinced that many 
Canadians would be upset to see how financial institutions treat 
the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I recognize the recent efforts by the banks to give 
disadvantaged clients greater access to basic services and to 
treat them fairly and courteously, I feel they have a long way 
to go when I hear that some people are still having trouble 
cashing their government cheque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As recently as last month, the media in Quebec were talking 
about how difficult it is for welfare recipients to obtain 
services in federally chartered banks as well as in the 
provincially regulated caisses populaires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A simple amendment to the Canadian Human Rights Act would 
prohibit discrimination against the poor and would give these 
people an effective recourse when they are discriminated 
against, for example, when they are denied housing or the 
possibility to open a bank account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not kid ourselves. There are still people in this country 
today who are victims of discrimination when they do such simple 
things as apply for a job, look for an apartment or open a bank 
account. 
Add to that the feeling of shame from having to stand in line at 
the soup kitchen and the feeling of anguish from not knowing if 
their children will have a roof over their heads and food on the 
table the next day. Members will certainly agree with me that 
these people unquestionably need to have their right to respect 
and to dignity protected under the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking about the protection of a right since Bill S-11, 
which supports both the intent and the purpose of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms, does not grant any special 
privilege to the poor in Canada. Its sole purpose is to ensure 
explicit recognition of poverty and its related attributes, such 
as being a welfare recipient, and to prohibit discrimination 
against the poor in areas under federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need I remind members that the Canadian Human Rights Act does 
recognize that some people in our society are considered 
vulnerable and must be protected against discrimination. The 
prohibited grounds of discrimination include race, national or 
ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, marital status, family 
status, disability and, since not too long ago, sexual 
orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-11 simply proposes to add the words “social condition” to 
the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination in section 2 
and subsection 3(1) of the act. And the reason for that is very 
simple: one-fifth of the Canadian population does not live the 
same way you and I do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this concept is hard to grasp for those of us who have 
never had to face the human misery associated with real poverty. 
Let me ask you to follow me for a few seconds on an imaginary 
trip that might help you measure the magnitude of the terrible 
social and human problem that poverty is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine yourself coming home to announce to your family that you 
just lost your job, a job in which you poured all your talent 
and energy, sometimes at the expense of your loved ones, because 
there was just not enough time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, you have all the time in the world, but what are you going 
to do with it? You just did not think this could ever happen to 
you. In the weeks that followed the initial shock you started 
looking for work, knocking on every door and meeting every 
employer who might need your services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the labour market is saturated. While being 
apologetic and polite, employers constantly explain to you that 
they have to face the new economic realities. They simply do not 
need you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Weeks have gone by. You have used up your savings and your 
retirement fund. You must now sell the car, and you will soon 
have to do the same with the house, because you can no longer 
pay the mortgage. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1825"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT95"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT95"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1825

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You managed to save face in front of your friends and your 
neighbours during the first few weeks of this nightmare. But now 
they are aware of the situation. There is no way you can hide 
the sad reality of your human and social decline. You are a poor 
and undesirable human being that one may nod to but would rather 
cross the street not to have to acknowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some time now, no one has come to shake hands with you and 
ask you how you have been. No one wants to hear bad news. It is 
too depressing. You may think you have reached bottom, but you 
are wrong. You have seen nothing yet, because now you have to 
find ways to survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So you go to your bank manager, with whom you have always 
enjoyed a friendly relationship, and now it is his turn to tell 
you, in a very official tone, that he cannot lend you money. “I 
am sorry, but I have to abide by the rules of the institution. 
My hands are tied, you have to believe me”, is what he tells 
you, secretly hoping this is the last time he has to deal with 
you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is next? To whom do you turn to? To a food bank? No. To the 
state, of course, to this welfare state that cares so much about 
the have-nots in our society. You will have to forget about your 
pride and your dignity, that is if you have any left. But you 
have no choice. You have to feed your hungry children, who are 
giving you a reproachful look, blaming you for the social stigma 
that will no doubt mark them for the rest of their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty is a debilitating scourge which strikes at random. Let 
us stop thinking we can be spared such a plague and let us work 
together towards its elimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“The day will come when nations will be judged not by their 
military or economic strength, nor by the splendour of their 
capital cities and public buildings, but by the well-being of 
their peoples: by their levels of health, nutrition and 
education; by their opportunities to earn a fair reward for 
their labours; by their ability to participate in the decisions 
that affect their lives; by the respect that is shown for their 
civil and political liberties; by the provision that is made for 
those who are vulnerable and disadvantaged; and by the 
protection that is afforded to the growing minds and bodies of 
their children.” 
This quote from the United Nations report entitled “The Progress 
of Nations” sums up perfectly the spirit in which I am 
undertaking this initiative in the House today in order to give 
some dignity back to the poorest citizens of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister himself said: “Canada may not be a 
super-power, but we are a nation who speaks on the international 
scene with great moral authority”. Are we really entitled to 
waiving our moral authority in the face of other economic world 
powers? I wonder. We are indeed perceived as such, but what are 
the facts? I willingly acknowledge that for the fifth year in a 
row, the United Nations world report on human development has 
rated Canada as having the best quality of life compared to 174 
other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in spite of this highly desirable ranking with regard 
to human development, according to the same report, out of 17 
industrialized countries, Canada has the 10th highest level of 
poverty. 
Indeed, according to the UN human poverty indicator, 11.7% of 
Canadians live under the poverty line, a most embarrassing 
situation for a country that is so proud of its moral values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that citizens of this country have a right to expect their 
government to take without delay the steps required to reinforce 
and clarify the current legislation on human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Human Rights Act, which is the keystone of our 
legislation in this regard, is essentially aimed at protecting 
citizens against discrimination and guarantees equal 
opportunities in federal jurisdictions such as 
telecommunications and banks. It also embodies the international 
human rights commitments Canada has made since the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights was signed in 1948. 
With the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and provincial 
legislation on human rights, this Canadian law promoted the 
fundamental values of equality and human dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, this act is not currently clear or consistent. 
Although it is aimed at promoting equity for all Canadians, it 
perpetuates the discrimination it seeks to eliminate by 
protecting only certain vulnerable groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the Canadian Human Rights Act does not include 
social condition among prohibited grounds of discrimination is 
an indication of the social and economic alienation of the poor 
and of their lack of influence in the Canadian political system.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until this oversight in the legislation is corrected, the poor 
will continue to be the victims of discrimination and prejudice. 
The specific purpose of Bill S-11 is to rectify the situation by 
building a society where everybody are equal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why this bill is so important to me. The almost ideal 
society where everyone is entitled to the same respect and the 
same human dignity is now within our grasp. The poor may be the 
only marginalized group that has not yet been included in the 
Canadian Human Rights Act. It is up to us, as members of this 
House, to correct this deplorable flaw in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a practical point of view, this will tell employers and 
service providers under federal jurisdiction that they cannot 
discriminate against a person because he or she is, for example, 
a welfare recipient. I want to emphasize that adding social 
condition as a prohibited ground of discrimination would not 
force businesses to provide services if they have good reason to 
believe that the client is unable to pay or that he or she 
clearly represents a financial risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, paragraph 15(g) of the act states clearly that there is 
no discrimination when an individual is denied services or is a 
victim of any adverse differentiation and there is bona fide 
justification for that denial of differentiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I want to mention that national antipoverty 
organizations that are unsatisfied with the lack of legislation 
on human rights have started to use the judiciary system to 
bring about some change. They essentially claim that 
marginalized groups that are not listed in the charter of 
rights, but who are the victims of such discrimination, must be 
considered on the same footing as the groups that are listed and 
be treated as such under the law. They only have to prove to the 
court that these groups are the victims of such discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, this was the direction taken by homosexuals rights' 
advocates when they got tired of waiting for politicians to act. 
Noting their success, other groups in search of equality are 
already starting to follow suit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By amending the Canadian Human Rights Act to include social 
condition among prohibited grounds of discrimination, parliament 
will then fulfil its responsibility to abide by the Canadian 
charter of rights, while saving taxpayers the costs associated 
with court challenges in order to bring the Canadian Human 
Rights Act in line with the Constitution of Canada and 
international commitments made by Canada on human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On both a symbolic and practical level, it would be important, 
on the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human 
rights, for Canada to reaffirm the commitments it made when 
ratifying international covenants, including the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that Canada ratified this international 
covenant in 1976. 
By signing this covenant, the federal government recognized the 
right of all Canadians and of their families to enjoy an 
adequate standard of living, including food on the table, good 
clothing, appropriate housing and living conditions that keep 
improving. The agreement also provides for periodical reviews of 
Canada's compliance with the covenant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This committee is currently carrying out its third periodical 
review. I am afraid that, once again, as a government, we will 
get bad reviews. Need I remind the House that, while the 
standard of living has improved for some Canadians in certain 
areas, Canada has yet to guarantee access to the bare 
necessities for its most vulnerable citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Food banks, which were nowhere to be found in the 1970s, now 
number in the thousands and can be found in 450 communities. 
The problem of affordable and adequate housing has now become a 
full-blown crisis: almost 400,000 Canadians live in substandard 
housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the issues that convinced the National 
Anti-Poverty Organization and the Charter Committee on Poverty 
Issues to travel to Geneva, in May of 1993, to appear during the 
examination of Canada's second report on the implementation of 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights. The brief submitted to the Committee on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, as well as the testimony of these two 
national anti-poverty organizations, emphasized the inequities in 
what they ironically call “the land of plenty”. Not 
surprisingly, committee members were quite stunned by the 
information they were provided with, since they thought all 
Canadians enjoyed an exemplary standard of living. 
They were also shocked to find out about the high levels of 
poverty among children and single mothers, the large number of 
food banks, and the state of disrepair of a large proportion of 
low-cost housing units.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 10, 1993, the Committee on Economic, Social and Economic 
Rights tabled its conclusions, in which it expressed a number of 
concerns about poverty in Canada. The committee was alarmed at 
the persistence of poverty in the country, and at the fact that 
no significant progress had apparently been made in the previous 
decade. It expressed its particular concern that more than half 
of all single mothers and a large number of children live in 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee recommended among other measures that the 
legislation on human rights include more explicit provisions on 
social, economic and cultural rights. By passing Bill S-11, we 
would confirm Canada's will to take these criticisms into 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also like to think that, by expanding the scope of the 
Canadian Human Rights Act, we are doing more than merely 
defending an ideal. The protection of these rights could well be 
one of our most powerful tools in the fight against poverty, 
since it promotes human dignity, justice and equal 
opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Canadian Human Rights Act is a powerful education 
tool, establishing standards would help create social 
behaviours. A dialogue would then follow, so that institutions 
and the public in general might better understand what it means 
to live in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another vein, I want to say that the fact that most 
circumstances leading to discrimination based on social 
condition come under provincial jurisdiction does not justify 
the absence of this prohibited ground from the federal act. 
People in this country have the right to seek remedy and redress 
when federally regulated institutions such as banks, airlines 
and telecommunications companies practice discrimination based 
on social condition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-11 does not infringe on the provinces' legislative powers 
since the Canadian Human Rights Act only applies to areas under 
federal jurisdiction. This being said, it should be noted that 
the provinces are ahead of us and have acted in their respective 
areas of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, in eight provinces, the human rights act 
prohibits discrimination based on social condition, social 
background, source of income or being on welfare. The steps they 
took are aimed at protecting the poor against discriminatory 
practices in areas under their jurisdiction such as housing and 
public services. The prohibited ground of discrimination applies 
to every activity legislated by the provinces except in Ontario 
where it only applies to housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to add that my home province is a leader in this 
area since for the past 13 years the Quebec Charter of Human 
Rights and Freedoms has prohibited discrimination based on 
social condition in every area covered by the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I conclude by repeating once more that poverty is a serious 
threat to the right to equality, and that it has no place in an 
affluent country like Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge you to consider poverty in the light of human rights. I 
suggest that the prejudice the poor have to face in Canada is 
similar to that of the marginalized groups listed in the 
Canadian Human Rights Act. Yet, poverty is still not recognized 
in the law as a direct and dominant cause of inequality and 
disadvantage in Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all my colleagues in the House to correct this 
regrettable legislative weakness. Let us stop saying it is time 
to act, and let us do something right now by passing Bill S-11.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise in the House today to debate this very 
important issue.  It is a matter of great importance not only to 
the residents of Waterloo-Wellington but to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the essence and spirit behind Bill S-11, an amendment 
to the Canadian Human Rights Act to add social condition as a 
protected ground under the act.  I believe the drafter of Bill 
S-11 intended it to provide protection to the poor and to 
prohibit discrimination based on economic discrimination.  This 
is laudable and should be supported by all members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is not with the object and aim of Bill S-11 but 
rather the overly broad and necessarily confusing nature of the 
exact wording.  Simply using an open ended term such as social 
condition will add confusion to the act and will result in an 
endless sea of litigation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are serious about assisting the poor and disadvantaged in 
society, we must create opportunities for jobs and provide 
education, training and the necessities of life so that they will 
be able to participate as full and equal members of society.  We 
must provide a remedy through our human rights legislation for 
prejudicial treatment of the poor in a manner that makes that 
protection meaningful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the UN 
declaration of human rights.  It is a fitting time to review our 
current human rights legislation to ensure that it protects the 
most vulnerable of society.  In Canada we have honoured our 
commitment to the declaration for 50 years.  I might remind all 
members of the House that article 25 of the declaration states: 
<UL>

health and well-being of himself or herself and his or her

of unemployment, sickness, disability, old age or other lack of 
livelihood and circumstances beyond his or her control.

world to live based on 1995 data.  The hon. member mentioned that 
in her opening speech.  I believe that Canada received the high 
rating because Canadians take our commitment to human rights very 
seriously.  That is why the government is committed to a broad 
review of the human rights act in this area.  We want to ensure 
that the act is an effective instrument that protects the human 
rights of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go a step further and note that although Canada received 
high marks the authors of the report cautioned Canadians to note 
that there was a growing wealth disparity among Canadians.  This 
is unacceptable.  Acknowledging this, the federal government is 
very committed to protecting all Canadians.  We are particularly 
concerned with designing programs that provide specific relief to 
the most needy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada and provincial and territorial 
governments have agreed that children are a top public priority 
and have jointly participated in the design of the national child 
benefit system.  This initiative is an important one which aims 
to prevent and reduce the depth of child poverty and to promote 
attachment to the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the 1997 federal budget announced a $850 million 
per year increase to the Canada child tax benefit for low income 
families.  The 1997 Speech from the Throne committed at least an 
additional $850 million within this mandate for the national 
child benefit, and this was confirmed by the recent 1998 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The addition of the ground of social condition as stated in Bill 
S-11 is to extend the protection currently provided by the act to 
include economic rights.  However we need to ask what we mean by 
economic rights.  We must be very clear on the meaning of this 
additional ground if we want the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission, the tribunal and the courts to understand the exact 
type of problems we hope to address by adding the words social 
condition to the Canadian Human Rights Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us sit back for a minute and examine the purpose of the 
Canadian Human Rights Act, what it can achieve and what impact 
adding this new ground will have on the act as a whole.  The 
Canadian Human Rights Act is an anti-discrimination statute.  It 
does not provide for rights directly but rather it provides for 
redress of an individual or a group of individuals who believe 
that they have been the victim of discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act covers discriminatory acts in the context of employment 
and the provision of services and facilities customarily 
available to the public.  Notably the act only applies to the 
federal sector. This includes the federal government and 
federally regulated employers and service providers such as 
banks, airlines, railways, telecommunication and interprovincial 
trucking companies.  The vast majority of small businesses, 
schools and religious institutions are governed by provincial 
human rights legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Groups that appeared before the senate committee on the bill 
such as the National Anti-Poverty Organization provided firsthand 
experience about the poor in Canada.  They spoke of the plight of 
the homeless, the problems of people below certain income levels 
finding housing, for example, and the difficulties they encounter 
in accessing services from banking to telephones.  These are some 
of the problems ostensibly that this amendment was designed to 
resolve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However this motivation may be somewhat misplaced.  First, 
housing is primarily a provincial matter.  Many provincial human 
rights codes currently provide as an enumerated ground of 
discrimination sources of income or receipt of social assistance.

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This ground provides a remedy for discrimination for individuals 
living on social assistance.  For example, when a landlord 
refuses to rent to a family because it is on social assistance, 
this type of discriminatory act is captured by the provincial 
human rights codes that contain the ground of social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the only province in Canada that 
has the ground of social condition in its human rights 
legislation is Quebec.  Quebec formally added this ground in 
1996.  There have not been a large number of tribunal decisions 
on this ground but we know at this point that this term includes 
both the objective element of being poor with the social aspects 
of prejudicial treatment against people who are poor. It is too 
early to determine the impact of adding this ground in Quebec and 
of course the impact on the federal jurisdiction as I stated 
earlier is not clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are problems in the federal jurisdiction that do not need 
to be talked about here but clearly need to be addressed.  The 
National Anti-Poverty Organization for example, citing Quebec 
statistics found that 80% to 90% of the poor were refused 
services from the banks, services such as cheque cashing or 
opening an account. I understand that the banks have taken some 
measures to correct these actions.  We must be sure that no one 
is denied a service because the source of their income is 
provided by the state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that the banks and telecommunications companies 
may not be doing enough to ensure that their policies do not 
discriminate against the poor.  It is this type of situation that 
needs to be looked at in the broad review of the Canadian Human 
Rights Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will look at determining the scope of the problem of the poor 
in this country in the context of what relief the Canadian Human 
Rights Act could possibly offer.  We will then work to find a 
solution that is tailor made to address the specific problems 
that we uncover. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Left as it is, Bill S-11 simply incorporates a term that might 
make us feel good but it does not effectively address the 
problems in the federal context nor provide a truly effective 
remedy for the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By comparison, look at the prohibited grounds currently listed 
in the act, for example, race, national or ethnic origin, colour, 
religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family 
status, disability, and conviction for which a pardon has been 
granted. For the most part these grounds are immutable 
characteristics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know what the ground marital status means for example.  It 
includes single, common law, same sex partners and married 
couples.  This ground has resulted in changes to federal programs 
to ensure that they do not discriminate on the basis of someone's 
marital status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am strongly in favour of addressing the real needs of the 
poor. No one can support discrimination against anyone simply 
because his or her income is below a certain level.  But I am 
concerned that we have not in any meaningful way fully canvassed 
the legal implications of the term social union in the federal 
context. There would be real concerns in terms of where we are 
heading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does it mean we must not discriminate because of someone's level 
of income?  We apply different income tax rates based on 
different income levels.  Does it mean then that the Income Tax 
Act could be suspect as potentially contrary to the human rights 
act if we adopt such a term?  We would have to be very careful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also have to note carefully the employment insurance 
program which requires specific criteria to be met before someone 
is eligible to obtain benefits.  Would this program also be 
suspect? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could RRSP provisions be subject to scrutiny under the Canadian 
Human Rights Act given that individuals of certain income types 
and levels, or very low levels of income cannot take advantage of 
this provision?  I certainly hope not.  That would be most 
unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to provide additional protection for the poor, 
and I believe we should and I think all members of this House 
believe we should, we want it to be meaningful.  Let us take the 
time then through the broad review of the Canadian Human Rights 
Act to research this problem and to find a solution that will 
provide meaningful protection for the poor.  I believe that is 
what all Canadians want.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I too am pleased to enter the debate on this private 
member's bill.  I sense the deep caring of members of this House 
for those who are less fortunate or disadvantaged particularly 
because of their social condition. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1850"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal is that the Canadian Human Rights Act would add 
social condition as a prohibited ground of discrimination. I 
think the concern for others that is behind this bill is 
something we all share and applaud.  The question is whether this 
proposed remedy is appropriate, whether it will do the job and 
whether it will have the consequences we hope it will have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question I have for the sponsor of this bill is what 
is the definition of social condition?  There was no definition 
offered by the member in her speech. It is very important that we 
define our terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw the problem the Liberals got themselves into by 
committing themselves to something called pay equity. It was 
undefined and it was left up to courts and tribunals to sort out 
what the legislators meant.  They came up with the result which 
the proposers of the measure did not like.  Now the Liberals are 
in the very embarrassing position of having to fight the 
interpretation of their own legislation.  That is not a good 
position to be in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to add something into such a critical and strong 
piece of legislation as the Canadian Human Rights Act, we had 
better know what we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The eight provinces that have similar provisions in their human 
rights legislation use somewhat different terms. Newfoundland 
uses the term social origin.  Nova Scotia, P.E.I., Manitoba and 
Alberta prohibit discrimination on the grounds of source of 
income.  Saskatchewan and Ontario prohibit discrimination on the 
basis of being in receipt of public assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member in her speech mentioned source of income or being in 
receipt of public assistance as a concern encompassed by the 
bill.  We need to be clear about what we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed that the senator who introduced this bill in the 
Senate said “poverty is a serious breach of equality rights, 
which I believe has no place in a country as prosperous as 
ours”.  It is suggested by the senator that social condition 
refers to poverty.  If it does, I think we should be clear about 
that so that we do not get unwarranted or unexpected 
interpretations in our desire to protect some Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The senator also referred to the absence of any direct 
recognition of poverty as a pervasive source of inequality and 
disadvantage in Canadian society.  If we are talking about 
poverty, perhaps that is what we should say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is the only jurisdiction in which the term social 
condition is used.  It is listed as a prohibited ground of 
discrimination and it is not defined in the Quebec statute.  How 
has it worked out in Quebec?  What has happened is that virtually 
all applications in which social condition is stated as a ground 
of discrimination were dismissed by the Quebec courts.  I would 
suggest it is not a very strong protection for people when the 
courts do not find the term to be sufficiently specific to 
actually use it to protect people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is only one case concerning the refusal to rent a housing 
unit that was found to be discriminatory on the basis of social 
condition.  That is not an experience the Parliament of Canada 
would find very helpful in protecting the people we want to 
protect under the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The human rights tribunal in Quebec has taken a broader 
interpretation of the term social condition, as human rights 
tribunals have done for example in the case of pay equity. 
Damages were awarded in seven of eight decisions that we have 
been able to identify.  In those seven judgments, the social 
condition was defined fairly narrowly as being a social 
assistance recipient.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that legislators legislate from their hearts. 
But they also must legislate in a way that is objectively and 
legally effective to protect people in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other question I have concerns the whole area of the law of 
unintended consequences. If we are going to protect people on the 
basis of social condition, nobody knows exactly what it is. 
Senator Cohen made a very revealing comment at the end of her 
intervention on this subject.  She said “In passing this bill, 
hon. senators, we provide protection for our most vulnerable 
citizens”.  We all want to do that.  “While you or I may not 
fully understand the significance of this law, it is clear to me 
that those who live in poverty consider this to be an extremely 
important statement about their worth and their value as citizens 
of this country”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There probably is not a member in this House who does not think 
it is extremely to important to affirm the significance and value 
of each human being, each citizen of this country.  We need to do 
this, but to put an undefined and possibly wrongfully interpreted 
term in our legislation in order to make this kind of affirmative 
statement is very dangerous.  At the very least, it is a very 
poor and illogical way of bringing forward a social consequence 
that we would all support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at how this term could possibly be 
misinterpreted.  For example, as the member who spoke before me 
pointed out, social condition could be used to bring a case that 
higher income people should not be given higher progressive taxes 
because it would be discriminatory.  By taxing the higher income 
people more because of their higher incomes, their social 
condition could be seen as being treated in a discriminatory way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to be careful that those kinds of interpretations cannot 
be made because our terms are carefully defined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the intent of the bill is something we all support, I 
would argue very strongly that this House carefully consider 
whether it is appropriate and whether we are going to get the 
results we want by passing the bill in its present form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Social condition is largely subjective whereas other prohibited 
grounds, such as race, ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age, 
all of those things are objective.  We have to be very careful 
when we put subjective criteria in place.  We may know what we 
want and we may think we know what we are getting but we can get 
something completely different.  It would be very irresponsible 
of us as legislators to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about this legislation, I would support having a 
very careful look at how we can remedy the wrongs and the ills 
that the member so eloquently points out.  In my view the bill 
would not do that.  It could very well have undesirable 
consequences because it has not been carefully drafted at this 
point and we could be quite aghast at the consequences in years 
to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason, although I fully support the intent behind this 
bill, the compassion and caring that motivates it, I think it 
would be a poor piece of legislation for the House to pass. I 
would ask members to go back to the drawing board and come 
forward with something more specific and effective to do the job 
than this bill would do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is with pleasure that I rise today to speak on private 
member's Bill S-11, an act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act 
in order to add social condition as a prohibited ground of 
discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a short bill. It contains only two clauses. But it 
nevertheless addressed a shortcoming in the existing Canadian 
human rights legislation, a major shortcoming, by prohibiting 
discrimination on the basis of social condition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first clause of the bill states that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>1. Section 2 of the Canadian Human rights Act is replaced by the 
following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>2. The purpose of this act is to extend the laws in Canada to 
give effect, within the purview of matters coming within the 
legislative authority of Parliament, to the principle that every 
individual should have an equal opportunity with other 
individuals to make for himself or herself the life that he or 
she is able and wishes to have, consistent with his or her 
duties and obligations as a member of society, without being 
hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory 
practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, 
religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family 
status, social condition, disability or conviction for an 
offence for which a pardon has been granted. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 2 reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>2. Subsection 3(1) of the act is replaced by the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>3.(1) For all purposes of this act, race, national or ethnic 
origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital 
status, family status, social condition, disability and 
conviction for which a pardon has been granted are prohibited 
grounds of discrimination. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might be interesting to take a brief look at the meaning of 
“social condition” and its importance in the various provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec for instance, this ground of discrimination is part 
and parcel of the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, whose 
section 10 reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(Discrimination forbidden) 
</I></B></P><P align=left>10. Every person has the right to full and equal recognition and 
exercise of his human rights and freedoms without distinction, 
exclusion or preference based on race, colour, sex, pregnancy, 
sexual orientation, civil status, age except as provided by law, 
religion, political convictions, language, ethnic or national 
origin, social condition, a handicap or the use of any means to 
palliate a handicap. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the Ontario Charter of Human Rights stipulates that 
receiving social assistance is a banned ground for 
discrimination only in connection with housing.  In Manitoba, in 
Alberta and in Nova Scotia, source of income is a forbidden 
ground for discrimination.  In Saskatchewan, it is receiving 
social assistance, while Newfoundland refers to social 
background. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, all of these provisions are aimed at banning 
discrimination based on poverty. 
In practice, however, this is unfortunately limited to being a 
welfare recipient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only the Quebec law includes a broader interpretation by having 
integrated the term “social condition” without restricting it to 
receiving social assistance.  Quebec jurisprudence has, in fact, 
defined social condition as encompassing income, occupation, 
level of education, and social background.  It is therefore a 
very broad interpretation, one aimed at clearly emphasizing that 
it is forbidden to discriminate against the poor, who are 
becoming more and more numerous as we know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One example of discrimination based on social condition is a 
landlord's refusal to rent to a person solely because that 
person is on welfare.  Here, the reason for refusal is not based 
on the ability or inability to pay the rent, but solely on the 
fact that the person is receiving social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example, under federal jurisdiction this time, would be 
a bank's refusal to open an account for a person on welfare.  It 
is a matter of public knowledge that certain banks do not 
hesitate to charge for opening an account, this being 
particularly aimed at social assistance recipients.

<A HREF="#LINKT102"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this bill sends the message that at the dawn of the 
third millennium discrimination against poor people is 
unacceptable.  Quebec long ago adopted this value.  It is high 
time the poor were protected against discrimination in areas of 
federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time of globalization and free trade, it is more important 
than ever that individuals' basic rights be respected, 
especially the right to equal opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, it is totally unacceptable for business people, 
such as the president of Bombardier International, to be anxious 
about the Prime Minister's discussion of human rights in 
Malaysia. 
It is true that it may be easier for the little guy from 
Saint-Maurice to talk about human rights in Malaysia than to 
respect them in Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, it is regrettable when fundamental human rights 
are sacrificed at the altar of international trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot fail but protest the fact that current Liberal 
government policies are broadening the rift between rich and 
poor.  More and more children are growing up in poverty in 
Canada, more and more families are poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Entrenching Bill S-11 in the charter should amount to more than 
wishful thinking.  The best way to fight discrimination against 
social condition is to improve the living conditions of our 
fellow citizens who find themselves in difficult economic 
straits incompatible with human dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government must take specific action to ensure justice for 
our society's most disadvantaged.  Changing the employment 
insurance plan, returning to the provinces the money savagely cut 
from transfers, reducing income tax for the middle class—these 
are all ways to show that the improvement of social conditions is 
a priority of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, I fear that such wishes, while easily realized, 
will not become a reality.  However, I would hope that Bill S-11 
will be passed unanimously by this House.  It at least will 
become a reality.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to rise in the House to support Bill S-11, an act to 
amend the Canadian Human Rights Act, in order to add social 
condition as a prohibitive ground of discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I express my thanks to Senator Cohen who worked very long and 
hard to raise this issue not only in the Senate but in Canadian 
society.  Senator Cohen has done a lot of very good work 
including producing an excellent report on poverty in Canada. I 
also thank the member for Shefford who has brought this bill from 
the Senate into the House for debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March the chief commissioner of the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission said: “Poverty is a serious breach of equality rights 
which I believe has no place in a country as prosperous as ours. 
Human rights are indivisible.  Economic and social rights cannot 
be separated from political, legal or equality rights.  It is now 
time to recognize poverty as a human rights issue here at home as 
well”.  She said this in her annual report to parliament in 
1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioner is saying what we know from our own experience 
and what I know from my own riding of Vancouver East, that 
poverty is one of the greatest barriers to equality in Canada. 
There is no question when we look at what is happening around us 
that poor people are losing their rights.  Discrimination is 
growing.  We are witnessing a growing homelessness that is now at 
crisis proportions in Canada.  There is an increasing environment 
of poor bashing.  We are seeing municipal bylaws that are 
discriminatory against poor people such as anti-pan handling 
bylaws.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a growing environment in this country where there is 
increasing discrimination against poor people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of that is contrary to the universal declaration of human 
rights. It has been very interesting to hear members from the 
Liberal Party and the Reform Party talk about how this bill and 
the idea of a prohibited ground based on social conditions is too 
difficult for us to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can always find reasons not to do something. But the fact is 
we all know in our hearts that poor people do face vicious 
discrimination.  We need the political will to say it should be a 
prohibited ground as we do in provincial legislation so it is not 
an issue that there will be too much litigation or it is too 
difficult, too complex. It already exists as a legal entity, as a 
legal ground.  We are now saying this should be included in 
Canadian human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to focus on is real point here, that the greatest 
source of discrimination against poor people in Canada comes from 
government policy.  Yes, there is discrimination by landlords, 
banks, businesses, services and even in our general attitudes and 
stereotypes about poor people.  But there is no question that the 
greatest discrimination is from public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday and today in Geneva representatives from NAPO and 
anti-poverty groups are briefing UN officials on Canada's 
hypocrisy when it comes to dealing with poverty.  This deals with 
the UN covenant on economic, social and cultural rights which 
Canada was a signatory to in 1976. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The anti-poverty groups are meeting with a UN committee to 
expose what has been Canada's blatant disregard for the covenant 
as we now are seeing in this growing environment of 
discrimination against poor people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is interesting to note that this is not the first 
time that anti-poverty groups have had to appear as witnesses to 
the UN committee to point out what is happening in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 NAPO and the charter committee on poverty issues went to 
the UN committee and exposed the extent of Canada's shocking 
non-compliance with the UN covenant. This is where we really get 
to the heart of discrimination and what is happening with growing 
poverty in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about some of the things that have taken 
place.  We could go back to 1989, to a good day in the House of 
Commons when the House unanimously passed a resolution to 
eliminate child poverty by the year 2000, something all members 
stood up and voted for and it was a very noble gesture. What 
happened? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the federal government abandoned social housing, one of 
the key issues that determined health and poverty in this 
country.  In 1995 we saw the loss of the Canada assistance plan 
that had laid out basic rights and conditions in terms of social 
entitlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 we saw the era of the Canada health and social transfer 
that abandoned and eliminated those universal rights in Canada 
and for the first time saw a massive downloading and slashing of 
social programs that were now up to $6 billion or $7 billion that 
has affected the most vulnerable people in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings us to 1998. This discrimination is still going on 
and I believe it is the worst form of discrimination, 
discrimination by government and public policy. The child tax 
benefit discriminates against the poorest families in Canada by 
denying people and families on welfare the right to the child tax 
benefit.  That is discrimination, something that should be 
outlawed if we had social conditions in the human rights act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only have to look at the EI cutbacks to see another form of 
discrimination.  I think it really begs the question why the 
government is reluctant to support this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went back into the records to see what kinds of positions have 
been taken by Liberal members in previous years and I came across 
a very interesting quote in <I>Hansard</I> of May 1993.  This is 
what a Liberal member had to say with regard to the UN covenant 
on social, economic and cultural rights: “The UN, hardly an 
enemy of Canada, says that the government record on child 
poverty, on homelessness and on food banks is deplorable. We live 
in one of the wealthiest countries in the world yet we are 
condemned internationally because the Conservative government has 
disregarded the reality of poverty”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a statement by the Liberal member for Hamilton East in 
May 1993.  The same members who are now part of the government 
have systematically created policies and programs that have 
discriminated against poor people and have increased poverty in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that our goal and why we should support the 
bill as a very important step is that we should be working 
together to end discrimination on the basis of social condition. 
It is very important to say that is not enough.  Our goal must 
also be to force the federal government to set concrete targets 
to eliminate poverty and homelessness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As pointed out by my colleague in the Bloc, if we eliminate the 
conditions of poverty, elevate people out of poverty, provide 
jobs, housing and social support, we are meeting the goals and 
targets we should have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest challenge for us is to get governments, not just 
the Liberal government but all governments, to examine their 
record and acknowledge their policies which have quite 
deliberately and consciously created increased poverty in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an issue of individual poor people who are to blame, 
although they often are.  We only have to look at workfare 
programs as yet another form of discrimination.  It is the years 
of slashing social programs and of scapegoating poor people that 
has brought us to where we are today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an opportunity in the House today to do the right thing 
and to say that social condition is something that can work.  We 
can join together like we did in 1989 with the resolution to 
eliminate child poverty.  We can say that social condition should 
be a prohibited ground of discrimination and should be in the 
Canadian Human Rights Act.  We can do the right thing.  I ask my 
colleagues to think seriously about the issue, join us and vote 
for the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, farm families in Canada are in crisis.  Since my 
question to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food last month 
on the farm crisis on the prairies net farm income has dropped 
not to 40% of last year's income but to 70% of last year's 
income.  This is a crisis by any description.  That is one 
particular description of a crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have the lowest net farm income in western Canada since 
the great depression of 1929 and the 1930s.  At $3,400 per farm 
this year that is the lowest per farm net income recorded since 
Statistics Canada began keeping records in 1926.  The agriculture 
and food industry in Saskatchewan is related to over 40% of all 
jobs in the province.  We have a very significant crisis as well 
as a social crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever farmers' incomes fell in the previous decade the media 
and the Liberals implied that farmers were to blame because they 
insisted on growing wheat for a world that already had enough. 
The implicit message was to diversify or perish.  What have the 
farmers done?  The irony is that today in Saskatchewan farmers 
are growing peas, lentils, sunflowers, spices and raising llamas, 
wild boars and even fainting goats.  We now face the lowest farm 
income levels in history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well agricultural exports from 1989 to 1997 doubled in 
Canada.  Yet net farm income declined over that period. Machinery 
operation costs increased 21% over the past five years. 
Fertilizer costs increased 57%. Farm chemical costs increased 
63%.  Liberal government user fees increased by $138 million as a 
result of the privatizations of the agricultural industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen U.S. subsidies for wheat at $2.68 U.S. per bushel 
when the price of wheat right now is $2.46 U.S. per bushel. 
In addition to that subsidy we have also seen an increase of $6 
billion by the U.S. treasury for its farmers, which now totals 
about $22 billion Canadian.  That is what U.S. farmers are 
getting from their government.  Canada is getting zippo as far as 
subsidies are concerned.  Europeans are providing $5.35 U.S. a 
bushel subsidy for their wheat producers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government betrayed and abandoned farmers by doing 
away with the Crow rate.  Other countries in Europe and the 
States backed their farmers with their treasuries.  I call on the 
government to commit to a national agricultural policy which will 
stand up and protect farmers in this very serious condition.  I 
call upon the Government of Canada to establish an emergency farm 
aid program around the national agricultural policy which I would 
like to see it announce in the House of Commons tonight. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I commend the 
hon. member for raising the question about the crisis in farm 
income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of agriculture is very concerned about the farm 
income situation.  When the official opposition requested a 
debate in the House of Commons on farm income, it was the 
minister who led the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further to the debate in the House of Commons the minister 
convened a meeting on November 4 with industry leaders, 
provincial ministers and farm leaders.  At that time officials 
were instructed to accelerate the process to consider both short 
term and long term solutions to the expected farm income declines 
in 1998 and 1999.  Federal and provincial deputy ministers of 
agriculture met on November 5 and 6 and are actively developing a 
full range of options that could be considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the industry advisory group on safety nets met on 
November 10 and will be sharing with the minister and officials 
its view on alternative actions that could be undertaken by 
governments including the possible approaches in designing a 
national disaster program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have worked co-operatively with our provincial colleagues and 
industry players on developing the current safety net system.  We 
will continue to work co-operatively on making the system even 
better.  This is a key priority for the minister of agriculture. 
He is diligent in his efforts to ensure that farmers across 
Canada have the necessary tools to manage price and income 
fluctuations that are beyond their control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is committed to acting as quickly as possible but 
not rashly, irresponsibly or prematurely.  The necessary tools 
are being developed to improve the effectiveness of the farm 
safety net system as quickly as possible, but I am sure the hon. 
member will agree that inequitable, ineffective and unaffordable 
ad hoc measures are not the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Action must be taken quickly, however.  It is important to take 
the time necessary to ensure the actions taken are the best ones 
for farmers and for all Canadians.

<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise to ask questions about the aircraft safety issue following 
the horrible crash of Swissair flight 111 off Peggy's Cove some 
time ago.  Coincidentally just last night another aircraft had a 
forced landing in Gander, Newfoundland.  The problem was similar 
to the one reported in the Swissair crash.  This one did not 
crash but it was a forced landing because of loss of cabin 
pressure and smoke in the cockpit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I asked this question before the minister responded that we 
have no evidence that there is a wiring deficiency or a wiring 
problem in aircraft in Canada.  I take exception to that and I 
will get into it in a second. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing he said was that there certainly was no hazard or 
no danger as long as planes are properly maintained.  I would 
like to address both those issues and ask the parliamentary 
secretary to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly on the question of wiring, it is very clear in the 
report called “FAA Aging Transport Non-Structural Systems 
Plans” that the organization or the task force identified to 
research the situation acknowledged that a more extensive 
examination of aging aircraft systems was needed. 
More aging airplane models need to be evaluated and the wire 
analysed in laboratories to fully characterize the condition of 
the wire on our aging transport airplane fleet.  Certainly wiring 
was the big issue in that report. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1925"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT106"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FAA went on to identify the top four aging concerns.  It is 
probably the most highly recognized aircraft safety organization 
in the world.  The top four aging concerns were wiring, 
connectors to wiring, grounds and ground straps, and circuit 
breakers.  These concerns are all related to wiring.  That is 
exactly what we have been saying all along.  Wiring is an issue 
that should be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue that I want to bring forward is maintenance. 
The minister said that even though these planes perhaps have 
problems as long as they are properly maintained everything is 
okay.  However the FAA went on to say that its studies also 
revealed that current maintenance practices for systems were too 
general and that standard repair practices were needed.  It said 
that there was definitely a need to improve inspections.  The 
review found that some wiring systems were difficult to inspect 
and that there were insufficient inspection criteria for 
corrosion on flight control and hydraulic systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I bring to the attention of the parliamentary secretary 
that wiring is an issue and inspections do not cover it.  That is 
very clear from the FAA report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the parliamentary secretary to address those 
remarks of the FAA.  I would like him to acknowledge the problem 
like the FAA has done.  There is a problem with wiring.  There is 
a problem with aging aircraft.  There is a problem with 
inspections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like the parliamentary secretary to comment on the 
specific wiring deficiencies and any efforts made or attempts 
right now to try to determine what the problems are.  I would 
like him to comment on the FAA remarks that improved inspections 
and maintenance procedures were definitely required right away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the parliamentary secretary could address those three issues 
by the FAA I would be very grateful. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the 
opportunity to respond to the matter raised by the hon. member 
for Cumberland—Colchester on October 20, 1998 as well as this 
evening regarding aircraft safety and kapton wiring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the certification of both foreign and domestic aircraft 
used in Canada, Transport Canada assesses aircraft wiring systems 
including the use of kapton wiring for appropriate installation. 
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration addresses the 
limitations associated with the use of kapton wiring.  It does 
not prohibit its use but it does caution on proper installation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When installed in accordance with FAA guidelines and subjected 
to the appropriate maintenance inspection procedures, there are 
no identified problems associated with the use of kapton wire. 
While Transport Canada is aware of Department of National Defence 
initiatives concerning this wire, there is no evidence of an 
identified safety problem with the use of kapton in the civil 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the position taken by the U.S. navy that kapton was 
totally unacceptable for its aircraft, there was no clear 
experience to indicate a widespread problem on civil aircraft. It 
is not Transport Canada's practice to require changes on in 
service aircraft unless experience has shown it to be necessary 
to take such action.  If it is shown through inspections, service 
difficulty reporting or occurrence investigation results that 
there is a problem with kapton, Transport Canada as regulator 
will take prompt and appropriate action to mitigate the safety 
risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, Transport Canada continues to monitor closely the 
overall transportation safety board investigation into the 
Swissair accident and to evaluate information as it becomes 
available.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since January 
1, 1997, the federal program implemented by the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency has resulted in the elimination of some 11,500 
lambs and sheep in 236 herds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This massive slaughter of nearly 10% of the animals has 
seriously affected the sheep industry in Quebec. Most animals 
have been slaughtered as a preventive measure, and some 
producers have lost their whole herd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last June, the Bloc Quebecois requested a moratorium on the 
slaughtering of sheep, and this moratorium has been respected, 
because it was imperative to take stock and put an end to the 
carnage.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we are asking the government and the minister of 
agriculture to act responsibly and fairly toward sheep producers 
and to prevent there being two categories of victims—those 
predating the October 27, 1998 order increasing maximum 
compensation and those of January 1, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fair treatment. Since the industry and the department have 
agreed on maximum compensation after October 27 of some $600 a 
head, it would be fair if all producers received the same 
settlement.  If the agency cannot legally act retroactively, the 
minister can set up ad hoc programs or income security measures 
similar to disaster relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec is doing its very large part to support 
sheep producers.  Today, in fact, it accorded a maximum loan of 
$100,000 per business interest free for three years to all 
Quebec producers whose animals were slaughtered between January 
1, 1997 and October 27, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So now what are those primarily responsible for the slaughter of 
these many sheep—the agency and the department of 
agriculture—waiting for to do likewise?  We simply want them to 
be fair and equitable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member's question on September 30 was: “Can the minister assure 
us that Quebec sheep farmers are receiving the same treatment 
from the agency in all aspects as their counterparts in other 
provinces, and is he prepared to produce agency documents to 
prove this?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to report that the information requested was provided 
to the hon. member for Louis-Hébert in writing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member has stated, we have ordered a number of sheep 
quarantined and slaughtered, primarily in Quebec.  These actions 
have been taken to control and prevent the spread of scrapie and 
to protect Canadian consumers and the sheep industry.  Our 
actions have been based on Health Canada's recommendation that 
animals that have been infected or exposed to scrapie must be 
kept out of the food chain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the difficult but necessary actions to date, 
there has been significant progress made in containing the 
further spread of scrapie in the sheep population in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We sympathize with the situation of these farmers who have 
worked hard to develop their industry.  We have taken a number of 
steps to assist them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the beginning of 1997 the Government of Canada has paid 
out more than $2 billion in compensation to sheep farmers in 
Quebec.  In February we amended our legislation to include 
compensation for disposal costs.  Recently we doubled the maximum 
level for compensation available for sheep destroyed to $600. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Farm Credit Corporation developed a deferred 
loan program to assist affected farmers in re-establishing their 
flocks.  We have also committed close to $400,000 to research 
into validating a test for scrapie in live animals.  In taking 
all these steps we have made every effort to consult with and to 
work with representatives of the sheep industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the House this government has treated Quebec sheep 
farmers fairly and equitably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The motion to 
adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., 
pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
