<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ORDER PAPER QUESTIONS—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am ready to make a ruling on the point 
of order raised on December 8, 1998 by the hon. member for 
Delta—South Richmond concerning Questions on the Order Paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all I want to thank the member for raising the matter. 
I also want to acknowledge the contributions made by the hon. 
House leader of the opposition, the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona, as well as the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Leader of the Government in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may, I wish to express my appreciation to the Deputy 
Chairman of Committees of the Whole who acted on my behalf to 
deal with the point of order raised at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his submission the hon. member for Delta—South Richmond 
presented arguments concerning three separate issues relating to 
Questions on the Order Paper.  These are:  first, the length of 
the questions; second, the number of questions allowed and the 
length of time taken by the government to answer the questions; 
and third, as the member stated, “failure to receive factual 
answers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member brought up this matter as a point of order.  For 
the benefit of all members and the listening public, a point of 
order is a question raised with respect to any departure from the 
standing orders or customary procedures either in debate or in 
the conduct of the House or committee business.  In this case the 
member alleges that Standing Order 39 has not been properly 
complied with. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing Order 39 has several components.  Members may place up 
to four questions on the <I>Order Paper</I> and may request that the 
government provide a response within 45 days.  In addition, this 
Standing Order gives the Clerk, acting for the Speaker, the 
authority to ensure that questions are concise and coherent and 
to order that certain questions be posed separately. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now address each of the three distinct issues submitted 
by the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the first point of his presentation, the hon. member alleged 
that his written question submitted on October 28 was refused 
because it was too lengthy.  He argued that the standing orders 
do not provide the Clerk with any guidance on the division of 
questions and therefore there was no authority to divide his 
question. 
The member also reflected on the manner in which the question was 
handled by those responsible for the order paper. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1105"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT2"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT2"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1105

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I give consideration to the procedural dimension of this 
particular aspect of the point of order, I must take issue with 
the way in which the member expressed his frustration with the 
handling of his question.  As so eloquently stated by my 
colleague the Deputy Chairman of the Committees of the Whole: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people working for parliament work for parliament.  They do 
not work for one party or another.  They have a specific job that 
is mandated to them to make sure that the questions are in a form 
which may be responded to. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure all members that the staff of the House of 
Commons aim for the highest level of competence and 
professionalism in the services they provide to members in 
support of their parliamentary activities.  Most importantly, I 
must attest to the impartiality of the Clerk's staff.  As I am 
sure all hon. members do, I have complete confidence in these 
employees and the way in which they discharge the important 
duties they have been assigned. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I will now turn to the procedural issue at 
hand, the dividing of a written question.  Standing Order 39(4) 
limits to four the number of questions a member may have on the 
order paper at any one time.  As pointed out by the hon. member 
for Winnipeg—Transcona, this rule has its origins in the 1985 
report of the Special Committee on Reform of the House of 
Commons, which is commonly known as the McGrath committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In return, there was a provision that the government would, upon 
request, reply within 45 days.  The committee expressed concern 
that members might try to circumvent the limit of four by 
submitting questions containing numerous subquestions.  The 
McGrath committee proposed that the Clerk should have the 
authority to reject outright or to split into separate and 
distinct questions those that contain unrelated subquestions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I concur with my predecessor, Speaker Fraser, when he ruled on 
June 14, 1989, that although not explicitly outlined in the 
standing orders the Clerk must apply more rigorously the 
provisions of Standing Order 39(2) and have the authority to 
order certain questions to be posed separately, as was 
recommended in the McGrath report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have reviewed the question as originally submitted on October 
28 by the hon. member for Delta—South Richmond and have found 
that proper procedures were followed and that the recommendations 
to divide his question were made according to Standing Order 
39(2) and based on the precedents of this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member contended that the length of his question prompted 
its suggested division.  In my opinion this recommendation to 
divide the question was not an arbitrary one.  The issue was not 
the length of the question but rather the fact that it contained 
unrelated subquestions.  The subquestions may be linked from the 
member's point of view but are in reality separate and distinct 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with any interpretation of rules there is unavoidably an 
element of judgment involved.  In this case judgment was properly 
exercised and, if anything, a certain latitude was given to the 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guided by the many years of practice in the application of this 
standing order dealing with the conciseness and coherence of 
order paper questions, House officials are always willing to 
assist members with the editing of their questions and to discuss 
with them or their staff any issue that may arise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now proceed to the second issue raised by the hon. 
member's point of order:  the number of questions allowed and the 
length of time taken by the government to answer the questions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member stated that, by not answering his questions within 
the 45 days allotted by the Standing Orders, the government 
prevented him from asking questions due to the limit of four, 
and that his ability to ask a further question was thereby 
undermined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member raises a valid concern, one that has been raised many 
times in the past.  However, the Standing Orders do not require 
the government to provide a response within 45 days.  While the 
Chair sympathizes with the member, previous Speakers have ruled 
that there is no particular sanction that the Chair can use to 
force the government to meet this deadline. 
I refer members to the <I>Debates</I> of May 18, 1989, at page 1891, 
where Speaker Fraser indicated that: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—I cannot order the government to produce those documents or 
answers within 45 days— 
</UL></UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, let me remind all members that there must be a 
balance between the requirements of the members asking the 
questions and the government which provides the answers.  As I 
had remarked in my ruling on February 9, 1995, found in the 
<I>Debates</I>d at page 9426: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incumbent upon all those involved on both sides of the 
process ... to ensure that every care is taken so that these 
exchanges remain as fruitful and as useful as possible. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would expect that the government would make every effort to 
respond within 45 days if so requested and that members would 
craft their questions in a manner to make this as likely as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This having been said, the onus rests with the House to examine 
this rule and to make changes if it so chooses. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving now to the third item raised by the hon. member for 
Delta—South Richmond: the “failure to receive factual answers”. 
In particular, the member expressed dissatisfaction with the 
response provided by the government to his Question No. 91. 
This matter is essentially identical to the substance of the 
question of privilege he raised on May 27, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, I had quoted from my previously mentioned ruling 
of February 9, 1995, in which I stated that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no provisions in the <I>Standing Orders</I> for the Speaker 
to review government responses to questions posed. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I then also quoted from my predecessor, Speaker Sauvé, who 
stated on February 28, 1983, at page 23278 of the <I>Debates</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the role of the Chair to determine whether or not the 
contents of documents tabled in the House are accurate. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To summarize the Chair's position on the three issues raised by 
the member, I find first that proper procedure was followed in 
the request made to the member to divide his question of October 
28. Second, I also find that while the 45 day limit causes 
problems for both sides of the House, the Chair has no authority 
to intervene in this area and, third, the Chair cannot comment on 
the quality or the factual content of the answers provided by the 
government to order paper questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to conclude by saying that this is not the first 
time the member for Delta—South Richmond has raised this issue, 
not only during this session but also in the last parliament.  It 
is obviously a matter he feels strongly about as evidenced by his 
well researched submission on December 8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall that he alluded to the parliamentary 
practices of the United Kingdom and Australia with respect to 
written questions.  Although I do not think it is relevant to the 
case he brought before the Chair, it would certainly be an area 
that may be of interest to the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs.  As I mentioned previously, the Chair can only 
enforce the standing orders as they have been adopted by the 
House.  However, pursuant to Standing Order 108 it is within the 
mandate of the procedure committee to review and report on the 
standing orders, procedure and practice in the House and its 
committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has the option of voicing his concern either through 
his party's leader in the House, who is a member of the procedure 
committee, or to write directly to the chair of the committee. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to remind the 
government that it is responsible for the quality and accuracy 
of the answers it provides to Order Paper questions.  I would 
also like to point out that the government is free to inform 
members if the 45-day deadline will not be complied with—and I am 
inclined to encourage this approach considering it may reduce 
interventions that sometimes take up valuable time away from the 
business of the House.  It would also give members the option to 
pursue other avenues to obtain the information they seek. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for bringing this matter to the 
attention of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate your ruling on this issue.  I have a comment and 
perhaps a question to put to the House.  The Standing Committee 
on Procedure and House Affairs has been advised that our party 
would like this issue raised and dealt with in a review of the 
standing orders.  That is as it should be.  We will deal with it 
there and hopefully we can come to you with some proposals to 
solve this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, with respect to the other issue, you have ruled 
that the government needs some leeway in the 45 day period that 
the government has to respond to written questions.  It has been 
a traditional ruling of the Chair that the government needs some 
leeway since 45 days sometimes is not long enough.  If that is 
the case, if there is some leeway on that side, what is the 
member who finds himself blocked from asking another question to 
do?  If the member is allowed four questions on the order paper 
and they stretch off into the distance at an unknown date, then 
he is blocked from asking future questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is leeway on the government side with the 45 days.  Mr. 
Speaker, as you have said and as other Speakers have ruled, there 
needs to be some leeway, but there is no leeway on the member's 
side.  The member has four questions and four it shall remain. 
His conundrum is that he needs answers to those questions in 
order to do his work as a parliamentarian.  He needs the fodder 
to answer questions, to critique the government and to put 
forward his own policy initiatives, but he is stopped at four 
questions because that is an absolute number. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would there be some consideration when the 45 days is extended 
for the government side that the member would be allowed to 
submit another question?  If it is good for the goose is it also 
good for the gander? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I appreciate the comment made by the hon. 
member.  From my perspective that is an avenue which should be 
pursued in this fashion.  He does not of course question my 
ruling, but he is asking for some guidance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to him, with all due respect, that the way he 
and the hon. member have chosen to rectify the matter, with 
respect to the first part of his comments, might be one that he 
would also consider using for the question he poses to the Chair. 
The Chair is not in a position to make rules standing on his 
feet, but the Chair would always take direction from the 
committee on procedure and House affairs.  I encourage the hon. 
whip of the Reform Party and the hon. member for Delta—South 
Richmond to pursue this as an avenue for this House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  As in the discussion I had 
with you this morning, my intention was not to question the 
impartiality of the staff of the House of Commons.  My intention 
was merely to point out the difficulty they face in dealing with 
a question such as the one I submitted when the rules are so 
vague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate your comments this morning, but I point out that 
the vagueness is still a problem.  However, you have suggested a 
big picture solution and we will certainly take that under 
advisement.  I thank you for your ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I thank the hon. member for his comments 
with regard to the quality and the impartiality of the work of 
our clerks, which is never in question and should never be in 
question in the House.  I thank him for that clarification.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House of Commons this 
morning to support Motion No. 360 which calls for employer 
provided transit passes to be an income tax exempt benefit. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1120"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate my colleague, the member of 
parliament for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, who has 
moved this motion and who has done an enormous amount of work, 
not only with members of parliament from other parties, but also 
with a number of municipalities, trade unions, environmentalists 
and businesses across this country to make sure that we have in 
the Income Tax Act a fair opportunity for working people to 
provide and receive an income tax benefit for using mass transit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before getting into who supports this idea and some of the real 
and significant benefits, I want to go over the reasons for which 
I support Motion No. 360. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it affects pollution in this country.  It affects the 
health of Canadians.  It deals with the congestion problem in the 
cities of Canada.  It is a social equity issue, an environmental 
issue and an economic issue.  I want to say a few words about 
each of those headings if I might. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all pay tax on our income.  Some of the benefits we receive 
from our employer must also be declared as income and are 
therefore taxable.  Employer provided parking and employer 
provided transit passes are both considered taxable under the 
current federal Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Revenue Canada's interpretation of this act provides 
tax preferences allowing most employees to receive their free 
parking income tax free.  This is an incentive for commuters to 
drive and represents a significant loss of income tax revenue, 
but this is a bias in my view for those who drive automobiles and 
against those who use mass transit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One way to address this unfair bias is to provide a tax 
exemption to public transit users.  This provides equity for 
non-drivers as well as motivation for drivers to switch to a mode 
of transportation with lower environmental costs and lower costs 
to the taxpayer in terms of the maintaining of roads, health care 
and so on.  I believe it is a rare opportunity for the federal 
government to effect public policy at the local level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States, the opportunity for employers to provide 
their employees with an income tax free transit subsidy became 
available under the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 and the Tax 
Reform Act of 1986. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On average, transit expenditures among recipients increased by 
23%.  With a 31% increase in transit use by participating San 
Francisco employees, an estimated 17 million vehicle miles were 
removed from their roads, 61 million tons of pollutants were 
avoided and $1.6 million of new transit revenue was generated. 
This is an example of the benefit of providing transit passes to 
employees as an income tax exempt benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Canada's commitment to greenhouse gas reductions 
under the Kyoto protocol, Canada has committed to reduce its 
greenhouse gas emissions to 6% below 1990 levels by 2012. 
Transportation is the largest single sector source of Canada's 
carbon emissions, at 32%, accounting for 30% of energy used and 
65% of petroleum consumed.  Half of these emissions are produced 
by cars and light trucks in cities where public transit is 
available.  Transportation emissions are expected to rise 52%, if 
this major issue is not addressed, between 1991 and the year 
2020. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have an interesting issue with respect to transportation 
and greenhouse gases.  One of the greatest economic and 
environmental challenges facing the world is the control of CO2 
and other greenhouse gases because they threaten to destabilize 
the climate and they lead to global warming.  We are seeing many 
examples of that around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada we have seen the rising sea level.  We have seen 
temperature change in certain regions of our country.  We have 
seen unprecedented drought cycles and extreme weather events, 
such as floods, fires, ice storms and so on which, cause human 
displacement.  They cause food shortages and losses exceeding the 
financial capabilities of the insurance industry.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This information was provided by the National Round Table on the 
Environment and the Economy in its strategy for sustainable 
transportation in Ontario, which it prepared in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to health, whenever we travel to cities like 
Vancouver, Toronto, Victoria, Halifax and Winnipeg we see more 
and more smog, which is ground level ozone.  It has increased by 
about 20% over the last decade.  Medical research shows that smog 
is contributing to increased incidents of respiratory illness, 
higher physician emergency room visits and increased mortality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very significant development in light of the fact that 
our health care has been cut back by the Liberal government by $6 
billion a year.  When people are being subjected to broader ill 
environments and broader risks to their health, they will be ill 
in greater numbers, requiring health care, and our health care 
has been taken away by the federal government to the tune of $6 
billion a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Support for this motion might encourage the Liberal government 
to provide some consideration which would be helpful to working 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk about traffic congestion and how it increases travel 
time, parking demand, vehicle costs and wear and tear on the 
roads.  Two forty-foot buses carrying 130 people occupy about 80 
feet of a single lane, but to carry the same number of people by 
car requires an extra 1,500 feet of lane. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have 130 people in cars, versus 130 people in two buses, 
we will see the wear and tear on our roads, an increase in smog 
and pollution and we will see all sorts of negative impacts upon 
Canadians in this country.  We believe this is another reason to 
support the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk about social inequity.  Generational poverty 
increases when people have limited access to education and work 
due to mobility barriers.  Adequate mobility is essential for 
people to participate in society as community members, producers 
and consumers.  Public transit provides safe, affordable, basic 
mobility for those persons without an alternative, including 
transit-dependent students, lower income workers, seniors and 
other persons who either cannot afford or choose not to own an 
automobile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Converting to public transit reduces the costs associated with 
the impacts of pollution, traffic congestion and the other things 
I have mentioned.  Public transit also provides substantial 
regional economic development benefits by channelling 
transportation dollars back into the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see many reasons to support such a motion.  There are also 
many individuals and organizations supporting this particular 
motion. The Federation of Urban Municipalities, which is our 
national organization representing municipal organizations across 
this country, supports the motion.  In my province of 
Saskatchewan, the city of Saskatoon, the town of Langdon, the 
town of Martensville and the city of Regina support this 
particular motion for all of the reasons I mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have quite a lengthy list of organizations from across 
the country which support such an initiative.  They include:  The 
Canadian Lung Association, the Climate Change Task Force group of 
the National Air Issues Co-ordination Committee, the David Suzuki 
Foundation, the Ontario Lung Association, Physicians for Global 
Survival, Pollution Probe, the Saskatchewan Lung Association, the 
Saskatoon Environmental Society, the Sierra Club of Canada and 
various trade unions and other governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask members to consider supporting this motion. 
It is votable.  It will mean better access to transit by working 
people.  Working people, as members know, who make $40,000 a year 
or less do not have a lot of options for tax deductions.  We do 
not have a lot of support in our tax system to help them get to 
their places of work.  I think in a country like Canada, which 
has such an expansive geography, mass transit is the only way to 
go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last example I give before I conclude my remarks is the 
example of grain movement in western Canada.  We have seen 
passenger trains being pulled off the rails.  Now they are 
thinking of closing a lot of the rail lines in western Canada 
that move grain.  They are using trucks instead of boxcars.  That 
is having an additional effect on our environment because more 
trucks on the road affect not just the environment but our roads.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask all members to support this motion which my colleague in 
the NDP has so thoroughly researched and presented to the House 
of Commons. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too wish to 
speak to Motion M-360, introduced by our colleague from Kamloops, 
Thompson and Highland Valleys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
consider making employer-provided transit passes an income 
tax-exempt benefit. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will be supporting this motion.  I believe it 
is our duty as legislators to adopt policies which make it 
possible to attain objectives of public interest which are of 
vital importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government accepted tax exemption for employer-provided 
transit passes, it would be exhibiting fairness, encouraging 
public transit, and effectively combatting pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment, we have a situation of flagrant inequity: 
employees who take public transit and receive bus passes from 
their employers are deemed to have received a taxable benefit. 
To put it clearly, this benefit is considered to be income, and 
therefore taxable.  On the other hand, according to a Revenue 
Canada interpretation, those whose employer provides parking can 
benefit from a tax exemption.  There seems to me, therefore, to 
be a problem of equity here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Responsible public policy dictates that we must stop encouraging 
automobile use over public transit. 
Public transit is safer, more economical, less polluting and, 
most importantly, accessible to more people.  They are thus 
perhaps more humane, certainly more cost-effective, healthier and 
more democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he introduced the motion, the hon. member for Kamloops. 
Thompson and Highland Valleys gave a detailed explanation of how 
the Americans implemented this system.  There is no lack of 
precedent, therefore, on which we can build.  The benefits to 
public transit in the U.S.A. are undeniable.  Everywhere that 
employees were able to take advantage of this measure there was 
an increase in the use of public transit, and major improvements 
to infrastructures and services to the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has become obvious in the greater Montreal area and other 
areas in Quebec and Canada that, when services are cut, there 
are fewer users. And when the demand drops, bus routes are 
removed. This creates a vicious circle of the worst kind. On the 
other hand, whenever the demand for public transit is 
encouraged, a virtuous circle is created, which promotes the 
expansion of public services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was no accident that the three major urban transit companies 
in Quebec, namely the Société de transport de la Communauté 
urbaine de Montréal, Société de transport de Laval and Société 
de transport de la rive sud de Montréal, as well as most if not 
all their unions and employees are asking that we support a 
progressive and innovative policy. In addition, it seems obvious 
that promoting public transit is also a matter of social 
fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As our colleagues so aptly pointed out, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfair that low-income families have been left with less 
access to educational and job opportunities simply because they 
do not own a vehicle. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is to say nothing of the environmental aspect. According to 
a Transport Canada 3000 report, it is estimated that transit 
passes could help reduce automobile travel by as much as 300 
million kilometres over 10 years.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would result in lower noise levels, fewer traffic jams and 
accidents, less congestion in parking areas as well as 
tremendous savings in terms of fuel and other non-renewable 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, if approved, this proposal would assist in fulfilling 
Canada's Kyoto commitments. For the record, I will go over them 
briefly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Kyoto protocol calls for an average 5.2% reduction of 
greenhouse emissions in all industrialized countries between 
2008 and 2012. 
This means that Canada will have to reduce its 1990 levels of 
emissions by 6 per cent. However, the federal government has 
been dragging its feet regarding this issue. It has long put off 
any concrete measure to help fight climate change, which is a 
result of the greenhouse effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the signing of the Kyoto protocol, the federal 
government proposed the setting up of task forces, where some 
450 experts would try to devise a strategy. While the 1998 
budget provided for $150 million over a three-year period, it was 
only on October 19 that the first initiatives were announced, 
and that a Canadian strategy finally seemed to be taking shape, 
following the Kyoto protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will spend millions to correct this environmental 
mess. 
Therefore, some may think it will surely refuse to make transit 
passes an income tax-exempt benefit, since this measure would 
deprive the government of valuable tax revenues. This is not the 
case. Indeed, how do these revenues compare with the savings in 
the health sector and in the budgets for the construction and 
renovation of our infrastructures, not to mention the incentives 
related to employment and distributive justice? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government not cut the billions of dollars that it 
has been giving for years to the oil and nuclear industries? Oil 
consumption is the primary cause of greenhouse gases, that 
scourge that those in Kyoto said they wanted to fight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for nuclear technology, it creates more problems than it 
solves. For example, CANDU reactors are neither efficient nor 
profitable and they pose a major threat to human safety and 
international security, since it is possible to divert that 
technology and use it for military purposes. 
Just remember, barely a few months ago, when the Indo-Pakistani 
crisis brought the threat of a nuclear conflict to the whole 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some might accuse me of exaggerating in establishing a link 
between bus passes and nuclear threat. Not so, considering that 
cumulative short sighted policies have often led our world on 
the brink of disaster during the 20th century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are moving step by step on the road to a better world. With 
the 21st century just months away, let us take a measure that 
will promote fairness, a healthier environment, sustainable 
development and a more just society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion of the member for Kamloops—Thompson and Highland 
Valleys seeks to do that, and we support it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member for 
Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys for putting forward this 
motion.  The motion certainly gives us an opportunity to put on 
the table various views concerning the subject.  It allows us to 
talk in general terms about the commitment we all have to the 
environment to ensure that it continues to be one which we 
cherish and one which we will continually take steps to improve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government recognizes that encouraging the use of public 
transportation is important. 
Other members have raised some concerns with respect to the 
measure, the fairness and the efficiency. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT9"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT9"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1140

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ensure before we commit the government's scarce 
resources that any measures taken represent an efficient use of 
public funds. When we look at this particular motion, the bulk of 
tax assistance would accrue to individuals already using mass 
transportation.  Although we have heard various numbers quoted 
today in the debate, the incremental increase in the number of 
transit users is expected to be small compared to the existing 
users. One could argue that the proposed measure would not be the 
most cost effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also note that the tax system is not always the most 
efficient and effective mechanism for accomplishing various 
policy objectives. We all know that all levels of government have 
a variety of policy tools at their disposal and they must be 
careful to use each one properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be clear that the government recognizes the importance 
of sustainable development in all its aspects including its 
impact on climate change.  The government is committed to 
pursuing the principle of long term sustainability across a wide 
spectrum of government activities.  To provide leadership in this 
important area the federal government has required all of its 
departments to prepare sustainable development strategies for 
tabling in parliament.  Federal departments are expected to 
update these strategies every three years and to provide annual 
progress reports on implementing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Finance which is responsible for tax policy 
had its sustainable development strategy tabled in parliament on 
December 10, 1997.  The department recognizes that closer 
integration of economic and environmental goals is an important 
objective and has taken concrete steps toward furthering this 
objective in every budget since 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year's budget provided an additional $50 million annually 
for three years.  The funds will help lay a strong foundation 
including developing a national implementation strategy, carrying 
out public education, encouraging early action by Canadians, 
identifying best practices and mechanisms such as emissions 
trading, all with the objective of reducing the impact of climate 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To co-ordinate efforts in this regard the Government of Canada 
announced the establishment of a climate change secretariat that 
will support the efforts of the ministers and will work with the 
provinces and stakeholders to develop the national implementation 
strategy to honour our Kyoto commitments to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions.  As part of this process a transportation issue table 
has been created to determine the most appropriate measures to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector. The 
table will examine the merit of the proposed tax treatment of 
transit passes along with other available options and will make 
recommendations to governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the hon. member for bringing this important 
issue to our attention.  I believe that the measure will be 
reviewed as part of the national process.  It would therefore be 
premature to take any action in this regard immediately.  I am 
sure I am like all members of the House who would like to make 
gains against greenhouse gas emissions, but I would also like to 
take a comprehensive approach, an approach that is all inclusive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments in the past have sometimes taken a piecemeal 
approach to challenges that we face.  We know the results.  We 
have made progress in a number of areas.  But we know that when 
we approach an issue from a comprehensive and all inclusive 
perspective, the results and the outcomes are ones that we are 
proud of and that we can live with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of greenhouse gas emissions is global. We have a 
global commitment to deal with it.  We will deal with this issue 
in a collective fashion.  It has been stated by other speakers 
that this initiative alone may not provide the results we are 
looking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is questionable whether we will see an increase in ridership. 
This particular motion solely addresses the aspect of making the 
employer provided transit passes an income tax exempt benefit.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre made 
reference to making this tax deductible.  There is a difference. 
In this motion we are only focusing on those individuals who are 
employed.  There are individuals who are most in need like 
seniors who have benefits that local municipalities provide by 
offering them reduced rates for public transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue should be approached from a much wider spectrum.  Also 
it is being suggested at a time when there is a more 
comprehensive approach being taken by the government, by the 
stakeholders and by all the partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know members who have engaged in this debate have talked about 
the support that is out there among the municipalities and 
environmental groups.  The government is supportive of 
initiatives that will deal with greenhouse gas emissions. 
However, we must be cautious in ensuring that whatever we do we 
do it in a manner that will be efficient and will make best use 
of taxpayers dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By moving on the motion as it is presently worded we would not 
be achieving our objectives in Kyoto and our objectives with 
respect to the tax assistance that we may be able to provide. 
With that being said, I would urge hon. members not to support 
the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too 
commend the hon. member from Kamloops for bringing the issue 
forward in this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that we have made commitments in Kyoto.  Global 
warming is real.  It is a very important issue, one that all 
Canadians and certainly members of the House from all parties 
should be extremely concerned about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary spoke about the need for a plan and 
that the federal government would work toward developing a plan. 
He was also very clear in terms of his opposition to the motion. 
Where he was not so clear was what in fact was the government's 
plan to deal with this extraordinarily important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is very good at pinpointing a particular 
initiative such as the one suggested by the member from Kamloops 
as being inappropriate or wrong headed, but the government has 
not been as good in actually providing some level of leadership 
or strong consultation with the provinces and the municipalities 
to develop a strategy that addresses this very real issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initially when I saw the motion I had some concerns.  I 
typically have concerns about a Pavlovian type tax policy that 
encourages some types of behaviours and discourages others.  We 
already have a tax code in Canada that is far too complicated. 
The logical corollary of the motion, for instance, is if people 
were walking to work we might remove taxes on shoes.  I am not 
being facetious, but we get into a very murky area when we talk 
about complicating a tax code that is already far too complex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being the case, while I should have perhaps been happy to 
hear the parliamentary secretary speak about simplifying the tax 
code—and again his government has done nothing but complicate 
the tax code—our party continues to stand for and believe in 
broadly based tax relief, increasing the basic personal 
exemption, reindexing the tax brackets, and eliminating and 
phasing out the surtaxes that are currently driving some of our 
best and brightest elsewhere, the types of tax policies that will 
benefit all Canadians not just now but as we enter the 21st 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party is supporting the motion.  One of the reasons we will 
be supporting it, despite our concerns about an increasingly 
complicated tax code, is that the environment is a very unique 
issue.  The environment and economics are inextricably linked. 
For far too long we have in a lot of jurisdictions in the country 
dealt with the environment separately from economics.  In fact 
those people typically interested in economics discount 
environmental arguments and vice versa. 
In fact we cannot do that.  It is not appropriate to do that and 
it is not logical.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important at the time of the production of an 
environmental externality, that is emissions, that the cost of 
that externality be internalized into the cost of the consumer 
who is utilizing the service or the product which is causing that 
environmental externality.  It is very important that there be a 
direct cost for environmentally unsound behaviour and a benefit 
for environmentally positive behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very difficult for us in our day to day lives to see the 
benefit of sound environmental actions on a micro level because 
we cannot tie it directly to our quality of life in the short 
term.  Global warming for many of us is something that still 
seems fairly esoteric and arcane.  It is important that somehow 
we can link in a very direct way people's behaviours:  negative 
behaviours to a negative policy in this case or positive 
behaviours, that is taking public transit, to a positive 
treatment under the tax code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I lived in New York for several years.  During that period the 
degree to which New Yorkers relied on public transit was amazing 
to me.  In north New Jersey and New York City there are about 10 
million people living in a very small land mass.  When we 
consider how efficiently that city operates in terms of its 
public transit system, probably from an environmental perspective 
the low impact the citizenry of New York has in terms of global 
warming compared to other centres that are more spread out, it is 
almost a miracle.  We could look at cities like Los Angeles, 
Atlanta, Toronto and such cities that were built around the 
suburbs and urban sprawl.  Cities like New York rely on public 
transit and were designed very well from the beginning to 
accommodate public transit and ultimately have become in my 
opinion examples of environmentally sound urban planning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps that is one area in which the federal government should 
be working more closely and playing a leadership role.  Part of 
our Kyoto commitment could be working with provinces and 
municipalities in terms of urban planning and the types of 
initiatives that have been successful globally.  Linking 
environmental policy to day to day action is very important.  We 
need to explore this issue further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the Reform Party has spoken against the motion but we are 
supporting it.  We also recognize that there are other examples 
where tax policies have been suggested by Reform members.  For 
instance, the mortgage interest deductibility was supported by 
and large by the Reform caucus.  There are examples where the 
Reform Party will recognize the importance of some types of 
behaviours but not necessarily other types of policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that certainly home ownership is as 
extraordinarily important as a clean environment, an environment 
that is sustainable and is there for future generations of 
Canadians.  One thing Canada has that we must covet and protect 
is our relatively clean environment.  We are recognized around 
the world for our relatively pristine surroundings and 
environment.  It is something we cannot take for granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the demographics and the fact that people are 
moving into the cities, that urban centres are growing, this is 
the type of policy we have to explore very carefully.  It should 
not be summarily discounted by the government as a bad idea until 
it has a set of policies to address these very important issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to recognize and commend the New Democrats 
for doing something that I had not expected them to do and that 
is to suggest a tax cut. 
Perhaps we should recognize that important evolution.  If we 
support this private member's motion on providing a tax benefit 
for taking public transit, in the future perhaps we could engage 
the New Democrats in a discussion about their supporting our 
belief of tax cuts for everybody in Canada.  Clearly that is 
something we all need.  It would be sound not just for the 
environment but for all aspects of our quality of life.

for Davenport.  Is that correct? 
<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds—Grenville, Lib.):</B>  Yes, Mr. 
Speaker.  I appreciate the chance to discuss the motion before us 
concerning the tax status of employer provided transit passes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the surface this initiative would seem destined to digress 
into what is an all too familiar confrontation, to which the 
previous speaker alluded, between the environment and the 
economy.  Framed in those narrow terms I know how that story will 
end, but I honestly feel that this issue has the potential to 
encourage needed debate on a number of important issues.  We have 
heard that already this morning in previous speeches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first issue debate around this point raises is the notion of 
costs.  I have seen a number of reports both in Canada and the 
United States that outline the financial impacts of a whole 
variety of transit benefit programs.  I was struck by what was 
not included in the cost benefit analysis.  Things such as the 
health costs associated with increasingly poor air quality are 
not included in the calculation of whether this is a good or bad 
idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are remedial costs associated with cleaning up the air. We 
will have to do it sooner or later and somebody will have to pay 
for it.  There is lost productivity associated with traffic 
gridlock.  One of the previous speakers used a calculation that 
100 cars equal two buses.  If we can put more people on buses 
then people will spend less time in traffic jams and more time 
engaged in the productive activities they are hired and paid to 
do.  There are the costs associated with the construction and 
maintenance of the infrastructure needed to support the number of 
cars on the highways and bridges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying for a minute that including these costs would 
cause the equation to lean in one direction or another, but I am 
saying they are rather conspicuous by their absence.  The fact 
that some of these costs are difficult to quantify should not be 
rationale for ignoring them completely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These types of costs transcend not only ministries in the 
federal government.  They also transcend levels of government. It 
is important to remember there is only one taxpayer in the 
country.  We are fooling ourselves if we think that over time the 
costs we are not calculating will simply go away.  The Sydney Tar 
Ponds are a $2 billion shrine to that kind of nonsensical 
thinking.  Sooner or later these costs have to be captured and 
have to be paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make matters worse, we are not only passing these costs on to 
taxpayers that had no share in any benefits these initiatives 
might have realized, but we are in some cases passing these costs 
on to our children, our grandchildren and our 
great-grandchildren.  Those kinds of debts and leaving that kind 
of legacy of debt are extremely hard to justify on any level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge we face is to meet our own needs without 
compromising the capacity of future generations to meet their 
needs.  To that end I think government has a definite role in the 
identification, the calculation and the verification of the full 
costs and benefits of activities and in the development of 
policies that allocate these costs appropriately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact on the natural and human resources of the nation need 
to be taken into account for any decisions we make.  This motion 
also brings into question the fundamental concept of what is the 
role of the tax system.  To put it bluntly this initiative goes 
against the grain.  Not only would a tax exemption reduce tax 
revenues to the government, but increased mass transit ridership 
would also reduce gasoline sales, a commodity that is also a 
source of tax revenue.  It does illustrate the role the tax 
system can play in encouraging certain behaviours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments seem to spend a great deal of time and effort 
developing regulatory regimes and trying to reinforce corporate 
behaviours that run directly counter to what the tax system 
encourages them to do.  Not only are command and control 
approaches expensive.  They are all too often totally 
ineffective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look at fiscal policies that encourage sustainable 
behaviours.  Spending in environmental areas should look and act 
like investments, not costs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Ideally we need a tax system that places taxes on the things we 
want less of and exemptions for activities that result in the 
things we want more of.  This motion is certainly attempting to 
do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the hon. member for bringing this motion to the 
House.  I draw the attention of all members to the wording of the 
motion; that we consider this action is hardly radical.  I would 
be the first to admit that this action is not without 
repercussions.  The discussion which would result in a detailed 
examination of those factors would not only be a valuable 
exercise in and of itself, but it would also serve to send a very 
clear and positive message to Canadians that we not only 
understand but are prepared to address the challenges we face as 
we shift to support the core and non-partisan value of 
sustainability.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
recommendation of the member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland 
Valleys is praiseworthy.  It has been proposed by the Federation 
of Canadian Municipalities each year since 1990, imagine.  It has 
also been made in two reports of the Standing Committee on the 
Environment and Sustainable Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was first proposed in the 1995 report “Keeping a Promise: 
Towards a Sustainable Budget”.  We heard a number of witnesses 
on the question of transit passes which was one topic of 
discussion before the committee. Witnesses noted that levelling 
the playing field in the transportation sector by making transit 
passes a tax free benefit would encourage employees to use public 
transit.  The result would be reduced energy consumption, 
decreased atmospheric pollution and reduced traffic congestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the same committee produced the report “Kyoto and 
Beyond:  Meeting the Climate Change Challenge”.  One 
recommendation of the committee was to let Finance Canada conduct 
a comprehensive study of the fiscal and regulatory tools 
available to the federal government to encourage a shift to 
public transit, including the provision that employer provided 
transit passes be considered a tax free benefit. So far this 
recommendation seems to have been ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 a request to the finance department to provide an 
accounting of the total value of benefits currently provided 
through employer provided parking was referred to the Department 
of National Revenue.  However, Revenue Canada was unable to 
provide the data.  In other words we are in the unfortunate 
position of not knowing how many people take advantage of tax 
free parking benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless both the Department of Finance and Revenue Canada 
argue that by offering the benefit to other commuters there is a 
negative impact on the tax base, as we heard earlier from the 
distinguished parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do know that social, environmental and equity benefits would 
arise from implementing the transit pass tax exemption.  We also 
know there is widespread support for the measure, as indicated 
already by other members.  The Amalgamated Transit Union has 
organized a campaign.  Support comes from sources so diverse as 
the city of Saskatoon, the Ontario Coalition of Senior Citizens, 
Pollution Probe, the Lung Association of Canada, the Canadian 
Labour Congress, the National Round Table on the Environment and 
the Economy, the city of Toronto, and the Regional Municipality 
of Ottawa-Carleton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is well timed and deserves the support of this House 
and the Government of Canada, considering the commitment made in 
Kyoto by the Government of Canada.  The parliamentary secretary's 
arguments are worth examining but the basic thrust of this motion 
reflects widespread support across the country.  Therefore we 
must conclude it is time for Ottawa to act.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the motion before us calling on the House to consider 
making employer provided transit passes an income tax exempt 
benefit was recently brought to my attention by one of my 
constituents. 
While I was aware that this issue was being debated in the House, 
I will admit that before the meeting with my constituent, I had 
not invested much time in understanding the issue completely.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mary Jane Dawson came into my office with her children over the 
Christmas break to talk to me about why she felt this was an 
important initiative and one which deserved my support and the 
support of the Reform caucus.  Her young children, Riley and 
Kelsy, also had very strong views about this motion. They were 
concerned about the state of the environment and about the impact 
of emissions on global warming, air quality and health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the Reform caucus, I believe strongly that I 
should work to best represent my constituents within the 
framework of Reform Party principles that were established in a 
democratic grassroots process. However, as any member of my 
caucus can attest to, it is not always possible to determine the 
views of our constituents on each and every issue.  At best we 
attempt to gauge public opinion by the number of letters that 
cross our desks or the number of people who phone or visit our 
offices.  It is not very scientific, but I believe this is a 
useful guide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The visit I had with Ms. Dawson and her children forced me to 
examine the issue more closely and determine whether I could 
support the motion and still stay committed to the policies that 
have been painstakingly developed by thousands of average 
Canadians across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that this motion would add to the 
complexity of the tax code. What this country needs is tax cuts 
and not more tax exemptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party would work to create a flatter, simpler and 
fairer tax system. We would also remove 1.2 million Canadians 
earning less than $30,000 a year from the tax rolls completely. 
This means that seniors, students and other low income Canadians 
will have more money in their pockets.  This would enable them to 
purchase transit passes or pay for other transportation needs 
with their own money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we do not live in a perfect world and we do not have a 
Reform government in power until the next election.  What we have 
is a Liberal government that is taxing hard working Canadians 
into poverty. Let us look at the Liberal record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Income taxes under the Liberal government are 56% higher than 
the average of our G-7 partners. The average Canadian family paid 
about $21,000 in total taxes in 1996.  For 1998 the government 
will collect $19 billion more in income taxes alone than it 
collected in 1993, a 37% increase. Bracket creep, the deindexing 
of the personal income tax system, has sucked an extra $13.4 
billion from taxpayers.  In 1997 alone, Canadian taxpayers paid 
$4.3 billion more than they would have had the system been 
indexed in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Statistics Canada, between 1989 and 1995 real after 
tax family incomes fell by $3,461 from $41,000 to approximately 
$37,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first two quarters of 1997, governments took two of every 
three dollars of additional personal income earned by Canadians 
in direct taxes alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Low income Canadians who earn more than $6,456 are taxed at 17% 
of their income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Canadians pay indirectly for the cost of Canada's 
burdensome regulatory environment, which cost Canadians the 
equivalent to 12% of GDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a shameful Liberal record.  This is why the advocates 
for the working poor are looking for ways to give low income 
working Canadians a break with tax exempt transit passes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we let the poor keep what little they earn, we give them the 
means and motive by which to improve their lot in life.  If we 
tax them into poverty to feed an insatiable bureaucracy, we breed 
dependency and destroy hope. How can the poor be expected to pick 
themselves up by the bootstraps when this Liberal government has 
stolen their boots? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the dilemma I face.  I can work hard to push for tax 
cuts and to ensure that a Reform government with its sound 
economic plan forms the next government.  But what do I tell the 
overtaxed working Canadians in my riding who find it difficult to 
meet their transportation needs today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To work out this problem, I thought about the infamous Peter and 
Paul. When the government spends money, it takes that money from 
Peter and gives it to Paul.  Since Peter has worked hard to earn 
his money, it can be argued that taking the money from him is not 
a very nice thing to do. Furthermore, Peter might not even like 
Paul or the things that Paul does with the money he is given. 
This compounds the offensiveness of the original taking.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this very simple reason, the members of the Reform caucus 
look at government spending with a healthy dose of suspicion. 
Unless tax dollars are being spent on programs with very broad 
base support, such as health care, it becomes very difficult to 
justify the expenditure.  However, since Peter has the right to 
keep the rewards of his labour, allowing him a tax exempt benefit 
does not place an unfair burden on Paul.  It does however place a 
burden on the government which is forced to either look for 
revenue elsewhere or reduce expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that Canadians endure the highest tax rates in the G-7, 
finding additional revenue in the form of increased tax levels 
would probably not find much support with the general public. 
This leaves us only with one other option:  decreasing 
expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a letter to the Canadian Urban Transit Association the 
finance minister estimated that the cost of implementing the tax 
exempt transit passes would be $140 million for the federal and 
provincial governments.  I want to make it clear that this is 
$140 million of forsaken revenue, not $140 million of spending. 
The difference here is very important. When the government spends 
$140 million it takes the money from Peter and gives it to Paul. 
When it forsakes $140 million, it simply leaves that money in 
Peter's pocket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of course is how does the government compensate for 
the $140 million shortfall?  It should do this by cutting the 
fat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that any member of the House can claim there 
does not exist at least $140 million in waste in the federal 
government. Our party has identified $15 billion in federal 
government waste that we would like to eliminate when we form 
government.  If we can find $15 billion in waste, surely the 
Liberals across the way can find a measly $140 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague from Calgary Southeast, our chief critic for 
revenue, has made it clear that he will not be supporting this 
motion.  I respect his position.  He believes, as I do, that the 
tax system should be transparent, fair and simple.  However, I 
believe we must make a clear distinction between those looking 
for relief from taxes and those looking for government grants and 
subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians should be allowed to enjoy the benefits of their 
labour without undue tax penalties.  If employers wish to provide 
transit passes as part of their remuneration packages, why should 
low income Canadians be taxed on this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am proposing is that in this environment of tax 
oppression we should look at an interim policy option that gives 
working Canadians a break until Reform can form the government 
and give Canadians serious tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a different matter, Canadians who choose to use public 
transportation because they wish to make as benign an impact on 
the environment as they can should have the freedom to make that 
choice.  Canadians must be allowed to make choices. Tax relief 
will help them make choices and act on values they hold, whether 
those values involve environmental preservation or the 
independence that comes from owning a car.  It is that choice 
that I will defend.  It is that choice that is in peril if the 
Liberal government continues to tax Canadians to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the advice of my constituents and based on the belief that 
low income Canadians need tax relief, I will be supporting this 
motion.  I would ask the members of my caucus to review the 
arguments presented by myself and the chief critic for revenue to 
determine for themselves how they will vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party does not believe in making Private Members' 
Business partisan politics.  We believe in free votes. Especially 
when it comes to Private Members' Business we do not believe in 
making it partisan business.  I note the member from the 
Conservative Party spoke earlier on behalf of his whole party.  I 
encourage all members in the House to give this motion 
consideration as I have, speaking against one of my own 
colleagues.  I think the motion has merit and deserves support.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, what 
I am going to mention will reinforce much of what we have heard 
this morning.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been a pleasure to hear those comments.  I do not think 
there is any doubt in anyone's mind that by encouraging people to 
use the public transit system we are going to benefit the 
environment and the health of many Canadians.  There is no 
question that that feeling is out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bit disconcerting that the only real argument against 
this is that we are not going to bring in enough revenue dollars. 
I find it hard to comprehend one against the other.  Those are 
the types of issues that should not be an if/or.  We know what 
the effects will be and we should respond to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be nice to see government departments working together 
for the overall benefit of Canadians.  There is no question that 
there would be health savings.  If anybody could come up with an 
argument that there would not be savings I would like to hear it. 
We have information to indicate that there could be savings of 
between $320 million and $427 million in health care costs in 
Ontario alone.  If that is not reason enough to encourage people 
to stay on the public transit system, or to get on to it, I do 
not know what is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environmental benefits, especially in the area of greenhouse gas 
emissions, are further reason to give full support to this 
motion.  It is an opportunity once and for all for this 
government to take a holistic approach to improving the 
environment, society and health.  It is an opportunity for a 
government that has shown no vision of looking beyond and seeing 
all the benefits of a motion such as this.  I thank my hon. 
colleague for presenting the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a moment to comment on the impression that was given 
by my hon. colleague from the Progressive Conservative Party.  He 
said that he was surprised to see New Democrats suggesting a tax 
break and he thinks it would be great if we did this.  I want to 
emphasize that New Democrats have always believed in investing in 
Canada and in Canadians.  That has been the way since the 
beginning of the party.  That is what we will continue to do. 
That is what we are doing with this motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to open debate at 
second reading of Bill C-65, which proposes to amend the 
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation involves the renewal of two federal 
programs—the provincial personal income tax revenue guarantee 
program and the equalization program—each for an additional five 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the revenue guarantee program the federal government 
protects those provinces participating in tax collection 
agreements from large revenue reductions resulting from changes 
in federal tax policy.  The major portion of this bill, however, 
deals with equalization, a program that in many ways defines the 
generous spirit of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will be aware that the commitment to equalization 
payments is enshrined in section 36(2) of the Constitution. 
These payments exist so as to enable provincial governments of 
varying levels of affluence to provide reasonably comparable 
levels of public services at reasonably comparable levels of 
taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization has a long tradition.  It was established as a 
program in 1957 and has been continuously renewed and improved 
ever since.  This government's commitment to equalization was 
clearly evident from the fact that this program was exempt from 
the restraint measures of the past five years when Canadians were 
facing a $42 billion deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most recent official estimates made last October indicated 
that receiving provinces would get almost $9 billion in 1998-99 
from the federal government under equalization.  These estimates 
will be updated later this month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we use the existing October estimates, it is clear that these 
transfers are very significant indeed.  They can make up between 
15% and 40% of total provincial revenues and the payments are 
unconditional.  It means that receiving provinces can use them as 
they wish and experience has shown that they play a significant 
role in improving the quality of a wide array of public services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently seven provinces benefit directly from equalization 
payments:  Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick, Quebec, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also indirect benefits for all Canadians.  We all 
benefit from knowing that we live in a country where the 
objective is to provide health care, education and basic public 
services at essentially the same level in all provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In renewing the equalization program this bill proposes a 
package of improvements, improvements that aim to ensure that the 
program continues to accurately measure the revenue raising 
ability of each province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed modifications will be gradually phased in over the 
next five years so that the impacts on the provinces will be 
smoothed.  In addition, this will give federal and provincial 
governments time to plan for changes in the amounts of the 
transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed modifications are expected, according to current 
estimates, to result in transfer increases of almost $50 million 
in 1999-2000, rising to about $200 million by the year 2003-04. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What makes this happen?  There are three components to the 
equalization renewal package proposed in this bill.  First, the 
equalization legislation will be renewed for five years.  That 
provides a secure planning framework for the receiving provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the equalization ceiling and floor provisions will be 
improved.  The ceiling provision provides protection to the 
federal government against unexpected increases in equalization 
payments.  In other words, this prevents changing economic 
circumstances from unaffordably driving equalization payments 
through the roof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new ceiling will be set at $10 billion in 1999-2000 and will 
grow by the percentage change in gross domestic product.  This 
change will ensure that the program remains affordable and 
sustainable over the five year renewal period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The floor provision is the other side of the coin.  It provides 
protection to the provincial governments against unexpected large 
and sudden decreases in equalization payments.  The new floor 
will be applied equally across all receiving provinces.  It will 
reduce the fluctuations in floor protection that can result from 
application of the equalization formula during a period of 
economic change. 
This will mean more predictable protection for provincial 
governments.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third change is that improvements will be made in the 
measurement of the provinces' ability to raise revenues on their 
own.  The equalization formula measures provincial revenue 
raising capacity by looking at over 30 different provincial taxes 
and comparing the results to a standard.  It is on the basis of 
this exercise that the size of equalization transfers is 
calculated for each province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the taxation environment is not static.  It changes. 
The changes proposed in this bill are needed to ensure that the 
equalization program reflects existing provincial tax 
opportunities and practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes in measurement, which will be implemented through 
regulation, relate to five tax bases that require significant 
improvements and other tax bases that require technical changes 
because of revised or new data. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, changes are proposed for the measurement of the 
provinces' ability to raise sales taxes.  The new base will now 
reflect the taxing practices of those provinces that have moved 
to the value added tax as well as those that have maintained the 
existing retail sales tax systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, because of increased activity related to games of 
chance, the treatment of revenues that flow from them needs to be 
updated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed changes will take into consideration the ability of 
provinces to raise revenues from casinos and video lottery 
terminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, let us get the facts straight.  We have not changed the 
revenues which equalization takes into account at all.  Before 
the proposed changes we looked at all the revenues from all types 
of gambling and after the changes we continue to do so.  What we 
have changed is our measure of which provinces have a high 
ability to raise these types of revenues and which provinces have 
a low capacity.  Our measure of disparities has changed, not our 
measure of revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For disparities, we used to look just at lottery ticket sales 
per capita.  Now we look at lottery ticket sales per capita and 
the capacity that different provinces have to raise revenues from 
casinos and VLTs as measured by differences in their incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new way of measuring disparities is fairer to all provinces, 
but, let me emphasize once again, in no way encourages gambling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to this, a number of resources, such as forest 
products and natural gas, will be measured according to value 
rather than by volume as is currently the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point I would like to repeat what I said earlier about 
these modifications happening gradually.  The proposed tax base 
changes will come into effect in stages over a five year period. 
This renewal follows more than two years of consultation with the 
provinces.  Considerable tactical work was undertaken by both 
federal and provincial officials and was then reviewed by 
ministers of finance at both the federal and provincial levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that hon. members will recognize that it has been 
important to fully analyse the equalization program in order to 
assess accurately what change is needed.  I submit to this House 
that this has been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to build on this groundwork and finish the 
renewal.  Our deadline is March 31, 1999, when the current five 
year equalization legislation expires.  It is important to have 
new legislation in place before that happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear that the passage of this bill will 
provide important continuing benefits to Canadians by assisting 
provincial governments in providing services on which Canadians 
can rely.  It will provide for the next five years a stable 
funding horizon for equalization.  It will provide substantial 
support for the less affluent provinces, underscoring the 
priority the government has placed on equalization, and ensuring 
that equalization receiving provinces have resources to provide 
the services their people need and want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation intends to maintain the fairness with which the 
equalization program is delivered.  It is important legislation 
and I believe hon. members will support the speedy passage of it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise to speak to Bill C-65, an act to amend the 
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act.  As the parliamentary 
secretary said, the primary object of the legislation is to renew 
the federal equalization program for another five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by simply stressing the importance that 
the Official Opposition, and I am sure all members of the House, 
attach to equalization.  Under our Constitution, as the 
parliamentary secretary said, parliament and the Government of 
Canada are committed to the principle of making equalization 
payments to ensure that provincial governments have sufficient 
revenue to provide reasonably comparable public services at 
reasonably comparable levels of taxation.  I do not think it can 
be stressed enough that equalization is an important principle 
which makes our federation work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Official Opposition, the Reform Party, is committed to 
equalization and has been from the outset.  Also I believe that 
the rank and file people in provinces like British Columbia, 
Alberta and Ontario who receive no equalization payments and in 
fact are net contributors to federal-provincial transfers also 
support the principle of equalization.  They have objections as 
to how the federal government administers it, how the federal 
government handles transfers, but do not object to the principle 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization is linked to taxation.  It is linked to the 
finances of the provinces.  It is linked to the financing of 
social programs.  It is linked to the social union.   It is 
literally linked to the financing of federalism itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides commenting on the particular bill, I also want to take 
the opportunity to comment on the broader subject of 
federal-provincial financing arrangements of which equalization 
is only one part.  In particular I want to make the case that the 
reform of federalism which the government consistently avoids 
requires the reform of the financing of federalism that should 
include the reform of equalization and not merely the tinkering 
reflected in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average person reading the bill and the act it amends—and I 
venture to say most of us as MPs—would find it utterly 
incomprehensible because equalization payments are now supposedly 
based on a complicated formula that has over 30 elements to it as 
well as ceiling and floor provisions which complicate it even 
further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finance ministers and officials of the Department of Finance 
often imply that every element of this program is based on 
principles and rationality beyond the ken of ordinary mortals. In 
other words there is a mystique associated with equalization and 
federal-provincial fiscal arrangements which often tends to 
discourage members of parliament and ordinary citizens from 
investigating the subject or questioning the status quo. I 
encourage all members to disregard that mystique in considering 
the bill and to penetrate it with some common sense, analysis and 
suggestions for improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My own first encounter with the mystique connected to 
federal-provincial financial relationships occurred at the 
University of Alberta when I was a student there in the early 
sixties.  I sat through a lecture by a learned economist in which 
he carefully and cautiously explained the principles and the 
rationale that lay behind the old tax rental agreements which 
were the predecessor to the current equalization formula.  It was 
a beautiful theory.  It was beautifully laid out.  Everything was 
connected to principle and analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I then went across the river from the University of Alberta and 
had lunch with my father, who was Premier of Alberta at the time, 
and attended the dominion-provincial reconstruction conferences 
initiated by Mackenzie King after the war from which came the tax 
rental agreements that then later gave birth to equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rehearsed for him this grand rationale and theory that lay 
behind the tax rental agreements which I had just learned at the 
University of Alberta.  I got halfway through and he started to 
laugh. 
The reason was that when he attended those conferences Mr. Ilsley 
was the finance minister at that time.  Mr. Ilsley presented the 
tax rental agreements and of course, as usually happens at these 
conferences, they could not agree.  The premiers could not agree. 
The federal government could not agree.  No one could agree on 
anything.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As also usually happens, they went to the prime minister's house 
for dinner that night and they did arrive at an agreement.  They 
then hauled in the officials and told them they had an 
arrangement where Boss Johnson of B.C. was supposed to get so 
many million, Manning in Alberta was supposed to get so many 
million, Garson in Manitoba was supposed to get so many million 
and Douglas was supposed to get so many.  They wanted to come up 
with a formula that delivered those dollars to those provinces, 
and so on it went right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying there is no rationale or there are no principles 
behind both equalization and federal-provincial fiscal relations, 
but a lot of it has been added after the fact.  Beneath and 
behind a lot of this complicated formula lay some very basic 
financial needs and, I would also add, some very basic political 
considerations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members want to be reminded of the political factors that go 
into equalization, we need look no further than at the events 
that just preceded the calling of the Newfoundland election which 
is to be held tomorrow.  Just days before the Newfoundland 
provincial election was called the government of Premier Turbot, 
as he is affectionately referred to on this side of the House, 
was projecting a $30 million deficit.  Lo and behold on January 
15, just two days before the election was called, the federal 
finance officials recalculated the equalization formula and the 
payment even though the figures were not supposed to be released 
until February 15.  It was a miracle.  Lo and behold, coincidence 
of coincidences, the projected increase in Newfoundland's 
equalization entitlement was just enough to cover the deficit and 
to enable Premier Tobin to announce that the budget would be 
balanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be rationality and principles behind equalization but 
there are also some very tangible political considerations and 
MPs should not allow the mystique of equalization to deter us 
from discussing those here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read into the record a brief description of the federal 
equalization program.  It is only 10 paragraphs.  As members will 
know, because of the Official Opposition's interest in 
federal-provincial relations and reform of federalism, we read a 
lot of what the provincial governments produce on this subject 
and we read what the federal government produces and often we 
compare the two.  Sometimes it cannot be recognized that these 
descriptions are describing the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the federal description of the Calgary declaration 
and the descriptions produced by the provincial governments are 
so different that it is hardly recognizable they are talking 
about the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On equalization I am happy to report that the information sheets 
in most of the provincial information packages and the federal 
package are almost identical.  This is a miracle in itself.  It 
deserves a little recognition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, therefore, is the official description of equalization: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization is an unconditional transfer.  Provinces receiving 
equalization may spend it in accordance with their own 
priorities.  Equalization is funded by the federal government and 
is authorized by federal legislation covering five-year periods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current equalization legislation expires on March 31, 1999. 
Seven provinces currently qualify for equalization—Newfoundland, 
Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Quebec, 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba.  Three provinces do not receive 
equalization program payments—British Columbia, Alberta and 
Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization transfers are determined on the basis of legislated 
formulae.  First, the amount of revenue which each province could 
raise if it applied national average tax rates is calculated for 
each kind of revenue that provinces and their local governments 
typically levy.  Second, each province's overall ability to raise 
revenue from these sources is compared to that of the five 
provinces making up a representative standard—Quebec, Ontario, 
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This incidentally is one national standard to which Quebec does 
not object.  If a provincial government's total revenue raising 
ability falls short of this standard its per capita revenues are 
raised to the standard level through federal equalization 
payments.  If a provincial government's total revenue raising 
ability exceeds the standard, as in the case of B.C., Alberta and 
Ontario, it does not receive equalization. 
As a result of this formula, when the fiscal capacity of a 
receiving province decreases in relation to the standard its 
equalization increases.  When the fiscal capacity of the 
receiving province increases relative to the standard its 
equalization falls.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization is subject to ceiling and floor provisions.  The 
purpose of the ceiling based on the growth of the national 
economy is to protect the federal government from open ended 
growth in payments while the floor provisions protect the 
individual provinces against any large annual declines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ceiling and floor provisions are referred by economist Tom 
Courchesne as part of the bells and whistles connection to 
equalization which often ensured that the actual payments are not 
exactly what the formula itself delivers.  It is just part of the 
mystique. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization is the most important federal program for reducing 
disparities among provincial governments and their relative 
abilities to raise revenues and based—and this is the bottom 
line—on current estimates equalizations for 1998-99 will ensure 
that all provinces with average tax rates have revenues of $5,431 
per resident to fund public services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that is the program as it is described.  The bill in front 
of us essentially renews that program with a bit of tinkering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The broader financial and political considerations affecting 
equalization are as follows.  I was disappointed that the 
parliamentary secretary did not connect equalization to the other 
things it is connected to, namely the whole approach to tax 
policy, to social policy and to the operation of federalism 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, health, education and other social services have now 
become the largest component by far of the budgets of the 
provincial governments.  Whether or not the federal government 
recognizes it, Canadians now rely more and more on private 
resources and the provincial governments for health, education 
and social assistance expenditures than they do on the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in the all important area of health care, out of a 
total of $82 billion in health care expenditures, 30% now 
represents private spending, 61% represents provincial 
expenditures and only 9% represents federal expenditures.  This 
incidentally is in a field where a previous Liberal 
administration once promised, once swore up and down on a stack 
of Bibles it would never change.  The federal government would 
always assume 50% of the approved cost of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder that more and more Canadians' summary impression of 
the government is boiling down to two phrases:  they raised our 
taxes and they cut our health care; they make us pay more and 
they give us less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it is increasingly clear that all the provinces, 
including British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario which receive no 
equalization, are experiencing increasing difficulty in financing 
health, education and social services.  These difficulties are 
compounded by the insatiable appetite of the federal government 
for tax revenues, federal tax revenues having increased 38% since 
this group got into office, and the reduction of federal 
transfers to the provinces by over $6 billion per year which adds 
up to a cumulative decrease, if we add up the annual decreases 
over the period since they have been implemented, of about $16 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of these circumstances, what is required?  What is 
required with respect to equalization?  I would say something 
more than tinkering, something more than what is contained in the 
bill for which the government has had five years to prepare.  It 
is dealing with one of the pillars of social financing and we 
always hear how passionately committed the government is to 
social programs.  It brings a bill to the House that is mere 
tinkering with one of the pillars of social service financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are concerned about hospital closures and the shortage of 
doctors and health care personnel; if we are concerned about the 
200,000 people on the waiting lines; if we are concerned about 
spiralling tuition fees and Canadian students rapidly increasing 
their debt load; if we are concerned about the ever increasing 
number of Canadians, particularly children, living in poverty; if 
we are truly concerned about all these things, what is needed is 
a substantive reform of federal-provincial financial relations. 
That includes a substantive reform of the three pillars that 
undergird the financing of social services, namely tax policies, 
federal-provincial transfers such as the CHST, and equalization, 
the subject of the bill before us.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also suggest that any significant improvement in 
federal-provincial financing of social programs requires a 
substantive rethinking of tax policy, CHST and equalization. 
These have to be considered together because they are all tangled 
up together.  They are all interrelated.  We cannot change one 
without affecting the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the record of the Liberal administration with respect to 
implementing the real reforms needed to revitalize the financing 
of social programs?  There is no record other than defending the 
status quo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is mere tinkering with regard to tax policy. Prebudget 
discussions have disclosed that the budget will only include 
token tax relief in comparison to the over $30 billion of 
increased revenue which the government has collected per year 
since it took office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to transfers for social purposes, it is mere 
tinkering. The recent social union and health agreement proposals 
disclose that the federal government appears prepared to put only 
$2 billion to $3 billion back compared to the $16 billion it 
took.  It plans no real reform in the relations between the 
federal and provincial governments that would allow the provinces 
to do more with less.  What reforms Ottawa has agreed to have 
been initiated by the provinces and not by Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to equalization, as I said it is mere tinkering 
again.  Despite having five years to plan for this bill, it 
contains no rationale connecting it to the other aspects of 
federal-provincial program financing.  It contains no substantive 
reform of equalization at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In these three things, the federal budget, the social union 
proposals and the equalization bill, we have only the latest 
example of fossilized federalism.  The status quo is maintained 
with just a little tinkering to try to create the impression that 
substantive improvements are being achieved.  Meanwhile, 
Canadians continue to pay more for less in terms of social 
services. Canadians must look elsewhere for substantive reform of 
the financial underpinnings of federalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to be entirely negative.  In contrast to the 
fossilized federalism of the federal government, we have the 
flexible federalism recommended by the official opposition in its 
new Canada act.  I also have to say it is advocated by an 
increasing number of the premiers.  In contrast to the frozen 
federalism of the federal government, we have the springtime 
federalism recommended by the official opposition and also 
advocated by a number of premiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does flexible federalism advocate to reform 
federal-provincial finances for the 21st century and to rebuild 
the financial foundations of our social programs, including 
equalization?  Does the federal government not collect any of the 
thinking that is being done by the provinces on how to reform 
federal-provincial finances?  Does it pay no attention to the 
work that has been done by the think tanks?  Why is it that the 
federal government shows no leadership in these areas at all?  It 
just clings to the status quo and adds a little tinkering.  That 
is its only contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proposing three things that substantive reform of 
federal-provincial financing would entail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, simplify and rationalize federal transfers for social 
purposes by providing simple equal per capita grants to all 
provinces for social purposes.  Stop trying to equalize through 
every social program envelope, from health to social assistance 
to unemployment insurance.  This position has been well 
articulated by both the Alberta and Ontario governments.  I 
anticipate objections to this from some of the lower income 
provinces but I ask them to wait until I am finished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, reform if necessary and refocus the equalization program 
we are discussing today even more heavily on the low income 
provinces.  Listen to what I am saying.  Equal per capita grants 
for social program funding across the country, then reform 
equalization and tip it even more steeply toward the lower income 
provinces to bring their capacity to finance social programs up 
to a national standard established by interprovincial agreements.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, complement these preceding measures with broad based 
substantive tax relief to increase the disposable incomes of 
individuals and families in every province so that private 
resources are also available for social spending and are 
enhanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a $15 billion broad based tax relief program such 
as was in the Reform Party platform during the last election 
delivers financial transfers to the people of each province of 
the following orders of magnitude. Listen to the orders of 
magnitude.  People do not seem to understand how much broad based 
tax relief could deliver into the pockets of people, particularly 
lower income people and businesses in the various provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundland, $216 million. Nova Scotia, $396 million.  New 
Brunswick, $329 million.  P.E.I., $56 million.  In Atlantic 
Canada $998 million in total can be delivered into the pockets of 
individuals and businesses through tax relief, more than what the 
federal government currently pumps in through regional 
development grants. For Quebec, $3.256 billion.  For Ontario, 
$5.45 billion more. Manitoba, $498 million more.  Saskatchewan, 
$438 million.  Alberta, $1.4 billion.  British Columbia, $1.8 
billion. This is the order of magnitude of what can be pumped 
into provincial economies through broad based tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this country had federal leadership committed to reformed 
federalism rather than fossilized federalism, if this country had 
a finance minister committed to the positive reform of 
federal-provincial financial relations instead of mere tinkering, 
what should have happened over the last year in discussions 
between Ottawa and the finance ministers of the provinces should 
have been this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister should be meeting with every provincial 
finance minister to discuss and agree on substantive measures to 
stabilize and improve the financing of social services in this 
country. When the finance minister meets with his provincial 
counterparts, their discussion should occur with a simple table 
that has four columns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Column one would show what the province would receive through 
simple, equal, per capita grants in support of social programs. 
Column two would show what the province would receive in terms of 
enhanced and better focused equalization. Column three would show 
what the people and employers of the province would receive 
through broad based tax relief which the province is free to 
either let it do its stimulative work or to tax back in part if 
it so desires.  Column four would give the total and would show 
that each province would be better off financially, better 
equipped to finance health, education and social assistance than 
it would be under the status quo and Liberal tinkering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the official opposition urges parliament to 
reject this equalization amendment bill as mere tinkering.  The 
government ought to be embarrassed to bring something like this 
before the House. It is inadequate just as we consider the 
financial components of the social union agreement juvenile and 
inadequate and the tinkering tax changes in the next budget as 
inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As more and more Canadians and more and more of the provinces 
begin to see the inadequacies of this Liberal government's 
fossilized federalism, I express the hope that at some premiers 
conference in the not too distant future, instead of meekly 
accepting these tinkering proposals of the fossilized 
federalists, the premiers will take off their premiers' hats for 
just a day and put on their political leaders' hats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their capacity as political leaders, I would like to see some 
of those provincial political leaders, whose views on flexible 
federalism are more advanced than that of the federal government 
and more in tune with the need of the 21st century, discuss just 
for once their vision of flexible federalism and the political 
alliances and initiatives required to get a new government in 
Ottawa which is prepared to make the substantive reforms of 
federalism and federal-provincial financing required for the 21st 
century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to an important bill concerning equalization 
payments in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First off, I wish to comment on what the Leader of the Reform 
Party said earlier about the equalization program.  The Leader 
of the Opposion said that it was complex, incomprehensible and 
riddled with political interventions.  With all due respect, I 
would differ. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one program right now that is clear, technical and 
technically comprehensible when one takes the trouble to look 
more closely, that is fair to all Canadian provinces, that is 
based on verifiable, scientific facts and not on political 
decisions, that is the very foundation of what has been 
described as the compassion of this regime from its very 
inception, it is the equalization payment program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of all those listening, I would like to give a 
brief explanation of the origins of equalization payments, what 
they are, how they are calculated, and how they benefit the 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization payments are not a recent phenomenon.  They first 
began in 1957.  Why do we have them? 
They are the result of the post-World War II Rowell-Sirois report, 
a huge royal commission of inquiry into the workings of the 
Canadian federation which, after months of discussions, briefs 
and analyses, recommended certain directions that the federation 
should take to ensure a fairer future for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the recommendations was equalization payments, a program 
to ensure that provinces across the country, even those with 
differing tax capacities, could all provide reasonably 
comparable levels of public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a self-respecting federalist, and even for a sovereignist 
looking at the system from the outside, equalization payments 
are the foundation of fiscal federalism. 
They make it possible to reduce—but not eliminate—the disparities 
from coast to coast, as the members opposite would say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How are payments arrived at?  Using a very specific formula, an 
analysis is made of the tax revenues that each province and each 
local government is capable of raising from their populations in 
order to provide public services that are comparable from one 
province to another without levying additional taxes that would 
bleed taxpayers dry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the sources of revenue for each of the provinces and 
local governments are identified.  When the program was first 
introduced in 1957, three sources of revenue were identified for 
each province.  Now there are 30. 
These include property taxes, income taxes, sales taxes, and so 
forth, for a total of 30 categories.  There is nothing political 
about it.  It is simply a list of 30 ways in which each of the 
provinces generates provincial and local fiscal revenue.  A list 
is compiled for each province. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT25"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT25"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1300

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, one takes five provinces considered representative and 
puts them through the same process. For each of the five 
representative provinces, such as Ontario and Quebec in 
particular, a standard is developed against which every other 
province will be assessed in terms of its capacity to levy taxes 
on its territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These 30 fiscal parameters for each province, the standard 
developed for the five representative provinces, will serve as 
the basis for calculating the equalization payments each one is 
entitled to, unless they are not eligible because they exceed 
the standard set for the five Canadian provinces regarding the 
capacity to levy taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all this has been done, the federal government agrees with 
the provinces that, for the next five years, equalization 
payments will be calculated per capita—and this is a very 
important detail—so that each province can provide public 
services in a fair manner, at approximately the same level, 
taking into account its particular fiscal capacity and economic 
strength. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing political about this, nothing off the wall, as 
the Leader of the Opposition suggested. If there is a program 
that is still appreciated, regardless of how much is paid to 
each province, it is this one. We may come back to this later. 
There are individuals who are getting a lot of political mileage 
out of this. But regardless of the amounts paid, equalization 
per se is a very good principle. 
It is also a principle that would deserve further and more 
serious consideration, and more social understanding as well, 
especially on the part of a staunch federalist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing complicated in equalization. Finance Canada has 
put out a booklet, about 30 pages long, that outlines the 
situation very well. For those with more inquisitive minds, who 
put more energy into understanding what is going on in this 
country, there is, of course, 450 pages of annexes. Hard work 
can be done on every aspect of the fiscal parameters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, this is a matter of personal taste and preference. My 
preference would be the fiscal system. It is a system that has 
captivated me for many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though we have concerns about the estimates done for 
certain of the parameters used to calculate equalization 
payments per province, we will wait until the bill goes to 
committee to ask more precise questions, in order to have an 
even better idea of the results of the last negotiation and of 
the new equalization system that will apply as of April 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, allow me to set the record straight and to 
denounce certain members across the way who are trying to score 
political points in talking about equalization and Quebec— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> If I were the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, instead of staying here, I would go back to the 
drawing board and overhaul the employment insurance system, 
which presently covers less than 40 per cent of the population. 
It would be better for everybody if the minister did that 
instead of commenting on what I have to say about equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning equalization in Quebec, there is a myth that has been 
circulating for many years, ever since equalization payments 
started, to the effect that Quebec is the great beneficiary of 
equalization. I pointed out earlier that when we take into 
account the 30 fiscal parameters of equalization— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B> Four billion dollars a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, would you be so kind as to tell 
my colleagues across the way that they should listen carefully 
in order to avoid perpetuating a myth that is complete nonsense? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Thibeault):</B> I would ask the hon. members 
to listen with me to what the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot has to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Do you know why they are talking and laughing 
across the way? Because they do not want us to dispel a myth 
arising from remarks that are sometimes so tendentious as to be 
deceitful. That is why they are raising their voices. They do 
not wish to hear the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, equalization payments are established per 
capita for each of the provinces, which is understandable. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initially, in 1957, they said that each Canadian, from coast to 
coast, should enjoy consistent public services without crippling 
cost to the provincial governments.  So equalization payments 
were used for this purpose and calculated on a per capita basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seven provinces currently receive equalization payments, and 
Quebec is not the one receiving the most.  Payment on a per 
capita basis is the basis of the program.  This year, Quebec 
received $536 per capita. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundland received $1,743 per capita, or three times what 
Quebec received. 
Let us also look at New Brunswick. And in terms of figures, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development is not so qualified, 
because he cannot differentiate between 38% coverage and 62% 
coverage.  He mixes up the figures.  His figures are also a 
little tendentious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, New Brunswick received $1,322 per capita, again nearly three 
times what Quebec receives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> And Ontario? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Ontario does not get any. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development is doing the right 
thing by leaving to go to work. I would advise him not to write 
a book, but rather to work for the unemployed he has left on 
their own for the past two years.  It will be more advantageous 
for everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that, taking a province such as Quebec with the second 
largest population in Canada and multiplying the number of 
people by $536 gives an impressive total.  The principle of 
equalization payments, however, is to calculate per person.  I 
have done a few quick calculations, and if Newfoundland had 
Quebec's population, with its level of equalization payment per 
capita, it would not get the $3.9 billion Quebec does, but 
rather $12.736 billion.  In other words, a total of four times 
as much in equalization payments as Quebec, if Newfoundland had 
the same population as Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can be seen that it makes no sense to say that Quebec gets 
$3.9 billion, or 47% of the equalization payments.  No, no. 
Equalization is calculated on a per capita basis, not a lump 
sum.  If Newfoundland had as large a population as Quebec, it 
would get three times as much in total equalization payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now a little trip to the west, the land of Reform.  Let us look 
at Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Two out of four. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> And what about British Columbia? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> British Columbia does not get any. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> And what about Alberta? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, it is none too bright of those 
on the other side to start making such remarks when a very 
serious matter is being discussed.  They are being totally 
demolished by the Reform and do not want to hear any arguments 
in favour of the equalization payment system.  This seems 
illogical.  Sometimes the Liberals exhibit no logic whatsoever, 
particularly the Liberals from Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying about Manitoba, if Manitoba had a population of 
7.3 million instead of the 1,141,000 it does have, it would get 
seven times as much in total equalization payments as Quebec. 
One can fiddle about with figures like that, but the main point 
is that there must be a fundamental respect of an act or of a 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This equalization program has been established on a per capita 
basis, for the people the members across the way are supposed to 
be serving. But instead of serving them, they are laughing and 
saying any old thing. I would be ashamed if I were in their 
shoes. It would not be a pretty picture if residents from the 
riding of Beauce saw their member of Parliament act like a clown 
in this House. They would go back to their riding and condemn 
such behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the reputation of members of the political 
profession, when we look at polls and see politicians ranking 
dead last in terms of credibility, it is because of attitudes 
like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The member for Saint-Hyacinthe calls me a clown while he stands 
there and quotes wrong figures. I would like to know which of us 
is the real clown, and I wish remarks like these were not 
allowed to be made in this House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I would ask the member for 
Beauce to choose his words carefully in referring to fellow 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, through you, I ask the member 
for Beauce not to call me a liar, as he did in stating that the 
figures I gave were not the right ones. Let him check, let him 
do his job. The Liberals from Quebec should do their job and 
take it a little more seriously. They will see that the figures 
I gave were the real ones, the right ones. These figures came 
from their own colleague, the Minister of Finance and member for 
LaSalle—Émard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, we must be very careful with figures. We must 
review the principles behind equalization. Since equalization 
payments are calculated on a per capita basis, any comparison 
should also be made on a per capita basis. On that basis, Quebec 
does not benefit from equalization payments any more than the 
other provinces do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one insists on making statements such as the ones we heard 
from the other side, to the effect that Quebec is spoiled when 
it comes to federal transfers, then one should provide the whole 
picture. If one claims that Quebec receives more in equalization 
and social transfers payments than the other provinces, one 
should also say something about federal investments in Quebec 
over the past 30 years and about the procurement of goods and 
services in Quebec. If those Liberal members did their homework, 
they would defend Quebec rather than begin by saying we are 
whiners. 
One has only to look at the data—and the data come from 
Statistics Canada, the Department of Finance, and the Department 
of Public Works and Government Services—to see that, since 
1961, Quebec has never had its fair share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in terms of federal fixed capital investments, in 
the past 30 years, only 18% of total federal investments were 
made in Quebec. Yet, Quebeckers still account for one quarter of 
the Canadian population. Given our demographic weight and our 
contribution to the federal government's revenues, we should be 
entitled to at least 25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The figures on the procurement of goods and services are not 
jokes of false data. They can be checked. In fact, all the 
figures that I am presenting can be checked. It is simply a 
matter of not being so lazy and really going to check them. 
In terms of the procurement of goods and services, we have had 
only 18% since 1961, more than 35 years ago, while Quebec 
accounted for more than one quarter of the population then and 
accounts for one quarter of it now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the whole investment picture and procurement of 
goods and services, Quebec has a shortfall of $2.4 billion a 
year.  This is productive and job creating spending.  This $2.4 
billion in spending on goods and services from businesses could 
help create 45,000 jobs in Quebec if it were properly and fairly 
distributed to Quebec.  If the federal government had acted 
fairly, an extra 45,000 jobs could have been created in Quebec. 
That is a lot. 
The unemployment rate in Quebec with these 45,000 jobs would be 
1.1% lower.  That is significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These figures can and should be verified.  It is true that, if 
we look at only part of the problem, we could indeed say that 
Quebec receives $1 billion more a year in equalization payments 
and employment insurance than its demographic weight would 
justify.  We are not ashamed of that, especially since if the 
federal government had made these fixed capital investments, and 
if we had had our share of federal government procurement of 
goods and services in Quebec, we would have made up this billion 
dollars.  We would not need the extra equalization payment, 
employment insurance benefits or social assistance.  We would 
even have had an extra $1.4 billion to play with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government could keep the additional billion dollars 
it pays us over and above our demographic weight, if it returned 
to us the $2.4 billion it owes in job creation investments and 
in procurement of goods and services from Quebec businesses. 
In politics, two things in particular are important.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number, in fact, but there are two in particular: 
honesty and moral integrity. Moral integrity, as in providing 
accurate figures, and intellectual honesty demand that you look 
at the picture as a whole, and not just say that Quebec receives 
equalization payments.  Yes, Quebec receives equalization 
payments, as do Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Manitoba, 
Saskatchewan— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin:</B> Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> The members opposite are laughable.  But I am 
not going to take the bait because it is not worth it on these 
small points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overall picture has to be presented.  Yes, it is true that 
Quebec receives more social band-aids, because its levels of 
poverty and unemployment are perhaps worse than they would have 
been if the federal government had treated Quebec fairly for the 
last 105 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, we are mentioning this not to complain but to 
set the record straight and to put the debate in proper 
perspective.  Furthermore, the Leader of the Official Opposition 
just made a thinly veiled suggestion that this is one national 
standard Quebec finds to its liking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not want to get into the federalist argument that, as the 
spoiled child of the Canadian federation, Quebec receives more 
than its share of equalization payments. 
Given what we have been hearing for weeks from the other side, 
and what I heard just minutes ago from the leader of the 
opposition, I have no choice but to direct my presentation on 
Bill C-65 to that aspect of the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the bill, in the days to come we intend to go 
into further detail on certain aspects of the review of the 
equalization payment system, on certain parameters such as the 
demands brought to the table over the past 10 years, not just by 
Quebec but by a number of provinces, particularly those relating 
to the way property tax is handled.  We are going to address 
these further in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already have a meeting scheduled this week with people from 
Finance, in order to go still further into the technical aspects 
that are different. 
There are, for instance, differences from the formula used in 
the past five years.  We are going to continue our efforts and 
will be making recommendations to our party based on the final 
outcome of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, I would ask my Liberal and Reform colleagues to 
take a look at equalization payments.  It is not all that 
complicated, a matter of taking an hour or two to read some very 
well prepared documents.  Some are summaries, while others are a 
bit more complex.  One can have a good grasp of the principles 
of equalization payments even without the latter, however. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing magical about equalization payments, nothing 
arbitrarily determined.  The process is one of negotiation, 
based on parameters that are highly technical but can be 
verified in all the provinces of Canada. 
It is being rather lazy intellectually to say “The system must 
be torn up, got rid of, dumped.  We must start all over again, 
reform the whole business”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, the federal taxation system is not all bad.  It 
contains some things that are understandable, and the 
equalization payment system may be one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my hon. colleagues for their attention.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with interest to the previous speakers and, on 
principle, we in the New Democratic Party support the principle 
of Bill C-65 on equalization.  It is the ultimate form of an 
attempt by governments to level the playing field on crucial 
issues of social spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all like the idea of level playing fields.  We do not like 
different playing fields or uneven playing fields.  We now have a 
level playing field for social programs, and equalization is a 
step in that direction, where the three have provinces, British 
Columbia, Alberta and Ontario, are not included but everybody 
else is.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundland will receive $1,648 per capita; P.E.I., $1,340; New 
Brunswick, $1,154; Manitoba, $898; Quebec, $521; and 
Saskatchewan, $232. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the history of this issue and the long lists of the 
per capita entitlement of provinces over time since equalization 
was first brought in, we notice something about the province of 
Saskatchewan.  This province moves in and out from being a have 
province some years to being a have-not province in other years. 
Every other province is consistent.  British Columbia is a have 
province, Ontario is a have province and Alberta is a have 
province.  All of the other provinces are have-not provinces, but 
Saskatchewan is different.  It comes and it goes.  We wonder what 
is behind these statistics until we factor in which party forms 
the provincial government.  By and large, it works like this. 
The people of Saskatchewan elect a Conservative or a Liberal 
government.  It gets into financial and economic crises and then 
the province of Saskatchewan needs equalization payments.  It 
qualifies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the people elect a CCF-NDP government and everything is 
back in order again and Saskatchewan loses its status.  Then the 
people elect a Conservative or a Liberal government which screws 
up the economy again.  Basically it is a history lesson. 
Liberals and Conservatives screw up the economy and the CCF-NDP 
governments get it all back in order again.  It is a reflection 
of the province qualifying or not qualifying for equalization 
payments.  There is an interesting history lesson in these 
statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to reflect on a view that was previously stated.  We are 
talking about one sector of this whole issue of equalization, 
which is an umbrella for attempting to be fair.  Yet sometimes 
when it comes to health care the government has been very unfair 
by unilaterally slashing beyond anything reasonable the health 
care system to cause irreparable damage to that sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would be hard-pressed to find a single Canadian who does not 
say that our health care system is in disastrous shape because of 
the Liberal government.  There are some people who will 
distinctly say that some provincial governments are involved, 
which is true.  Ontario is involved.  But by and large the 
slashing and hacking and the damaging records have been caused by 
the Liberal government in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was shocked when we added up all of the costs of health care 
to find how much the federal government actually pays.  I 
remember the old days when it was 50:50.  We all remember the 
good old days when the federal government said it was an equal 
partner in this marriage.  It said that it was an equal player 
and for every dollar spent it would pay 50 cents, that it would 
pony up, and it did.  That was the way it was supposed to work. 
It was a family of the federal and provincial governments and the 
federal government paid 50%.  It was a nice balance.  That was 
the way it was supposed to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, over the years that old playing field just about tipped 
upside down.  When we add up all of the costs of health care, 30% 
is paid privately.  There is nothing about dental work, eye 
glasses and so on, which is all part of health care. Sixty-one 
per cent is picked up by the provincial governments and the 
federal government picks up 9%.  That is a real embarrassment. 
The Liberals should be hanging their heads in shame.  They should 
be apologizing.  They should feel sorry for what they have done 
and they should rectify it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us understand that when we talk about equalization, which my 
party has supported from day one, we cannot look at it in 
isolation.  It is important that we acknowledge that while the 
government has devastated health care, it has now come forward 
with a revised Bill C-65 which, on principle, my party supports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Casino revenues are now taken into account with respect to the 
provinces' abilities to raise revenues, which makes sense because 
of the way the country is going.  I do not want to comment on 
casino taxes or anything of that nature because I got into 
trouble doing that the other day.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also reflects the value of harvested timber as opposed 
to the volume of harvested timber.  It is fair to say that the 
province of British Columbia has some of the highest quality wood 
in the world.  I do not know if it is the highest quality wood in 
the world, but possibly it is.  This measure is fair.  Some of 
the other provinces harvest a lot of timber as well, but it is of 
a slightly different quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also we acknowledge that the cost of obtaining new oil is much 
more expensive than old oil.  I know that old oil and new oil is 
a favourite topic of yours, Madam Speaker, but it is something we 
have to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point we, as well as some of our friends to the right, 
consider this as being a bit of serious tinkering.  We have to 
take this more seriously.  We have to see it in terms of the 
context in which we consider all of the fairness of this.  My 
friends in the Reform Party reminded us about that little 
adjustment just before the Newfoundland election, which we all 
noticed and thought was interesting.  Our friend Brian, from a 
previous life here, will have a chance to balance his books. 
Nevertheless, we have to get much more serious about how we 
develop this kind of policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider how the social union was struck.  There were 
11 middle aged, white men stuck away in the Prime Minister's 
residence playing poker with social policy:  “I get this.  You 
get this.  I get a bigger share than you.  No, your share is 
bigger than mine” and so on and so forth.  They cut a deal. 
Mark my words, what we do not know is what part of that deal was 
left unstated.  The Prime Minister said to premier <I>X</I> that 
if he bought into the deal they could make arrangements about 
<I>X</I>, <I>Y</I> and <I>Z</I> a little later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all agree that policy making in a crucial area such as health 
care or social policy ought not to be done by a few guys sitting 
in a secret meeting, cutting a deal over dinner.  That is not the 
way we should develop public policy.  Unfortunately that is the 
way it is done.  That is the way the state of affairs has 
progressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend from Regina is going to be making a number of comments 
more specifically regarding his province.  At this stage we in 
the New Democratic Party support in principle the issue of 
equalization.  We have some obvious concerns which will come up 
during the committee's work on this legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to share my colleague's time speaking 
to Bill C-65, an act to amend the Federal-Provincial Fiscal 
Arrangements Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization is a principle which provides certain revenues to 
provinces that are deemed to be at a disadvantage from provinces 
that are in an advantageous situation economically and 
financially.  This is a concept that I heard the Liberals, the 
Tories and the Reformers talk about with respect to different 
issues.  For example, when it is the large international oil 
companies that want tax breaks, the Reformers and the Liberals 
talk about a level playing field for the international oil 
companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An equalization bill is a good example of a level playing field. 
It provides revenues to those provinces that are unable to 
provide basic government services to their people because of 
various economic disparities.  The concept of equalization to 
ensure that consistent benefits are paid to various provinces 
that require them was enshrined in the Constitution when it was 
patriated in 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some interesting issues in this bill which I want to 
address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one that comes to mind is that each province which is 
a have-not province, seven out of ten, have a different per 
capita formula.  For example, Quebec receives $521 per capita in 
equalization payments from the have provinces and from the 
national treasury. 
Nova Scotia gets $1,209.  For Manitoba it is $898.  New Brunswick 
gets $1,154. Newfoundland gets $1,648.  P.E.I. gets $1,340. But 
Saskatchewan, which has more miles of roads than any other 
province in Canada even though we only have one million people, 
only gets a per capita grant of $232.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite interesting that Quebec has 7,100,000 people and 
gets $521 per person.  Saskatchewan has just over one million 
people and gets $232 per person.  We in Saskatchewan have 
national transportation commitments that Quebec does not have 
even though we have less than one-seventh its population.  Of 
course we get only one-third of its grants per capita. I raise 
this in the House and with the government opposite as to why that 
inequity would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see that perhaps with P.E.I. and some of the smaller 
Atlantic provinces that have had a long tradition of being 
reliant on federal government revenues.  It was appropriate for 
the Liberal government in Ottawa and sometimes from time to time 
a Tory government to provide those moneys to elect provincial 
governments in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to monitor that and see what happens down the road, 
in spite of this particular initiative, when an NDP government 
gets elected.  That may happen very soon in Nova Scotia. I want 
to make sure that the money the government is giving to Nova 
Scotia now is similar to what it will get when it becomes an NDP 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, we have heard my colleague from Kamloops, 
Thompson and Highland Valleys make reference to the fact that 
when there is an NDP provincial government, as in Saskatchewan 
for example, we are there to clean up the mess of the former 
Liberal-Tory-Reform coalitions which have made every effort 
possible to bankrupt our province.  The people tossed them out 
and elected an NDP government and we end up cleaning up their 
mess.  Not only are we a very modest recipient of fiscal 
arrangements but on occasion we have been a have province and we 
have shared revenues that have been derived from good management 
with other provinces that require that assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see some key changes in this equalization agreement.  My 
colleague made reference to casino revenues.  I will make 
reference for example to the resource revenues which will reflect 
the value rather than the volume of harvested timber. This again 
benefits Quebec.  British Columbia, with a very high quality 
timber, is not affected at all because it is a have province. But 
it provides a little extra money for Quebec and perhaps it needs 
it.  Perhaps the provincial government would be better suited to 
manage the economy and balance its budget rather than continue to 
have huge deficits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an issue which is very important to Saskatchewan right 
now.   My province of Saskatchewan is experiencing an 
agricultural crisis.  Farmers are desperate to get their crops in 
this spring.  They have no revenues to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some very significant problems in agriculture, not 
because of a local management problem, but because of an 
international situation which has arisen.  European and American 
governments nationally have funded and subsidized agriculture in 
their countries to a very large extent while Canadian governments 
are eliminating subsidies for agriculture altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying subsidies are the answer, but when a federal 
government abandons its farmers, farmers in Canada end up 
suffering even though we are providing most of our products for 
export while the European farmers and American farmers are the 
recipients of huge subsidies from their governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has cut the Crow benefit which was a 
transportation subsidy.  It has taken $340 million a year outside 
of our agricultural economy.  Now the government is saying it 
wants the Saskatchewan government to chip in 40% for an 
agricultural program to help those farmers who are in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agriculture is not something we benefit from locally in Canada. 
We export a vast majority of Saskatchewan's production to other 
parts of the world that require food.  This is a national 
agricultural situation.  Actually it is international in nature 
when it comes to subsidies, yet the Liberal government says it is 
not going to provide any assistance to these farmers unless the 
province comes up with 40% of the funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is offering only $450 million for all of Canada. 
Saskatchewan might get 40% of that in a particular year.  That 
may amount to $5,000 or $6,000 per farmer which will not make any 
difference in terms of substantially improving their position to 
put a crop in this spring. The government has to consider that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over and above equalization, or maybe including the 
equalization, there should be some consideration that foreign 
governments are subsidizing their agricultural base.  We should 
provide some reciprocity for Canadian farmers to make sure they 
are not put out of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Minister of Natural Resources, the member for 
Wascana, is from Saskatchewan.  He has said that Saskatchewan's 
equalization benefits are being increased because of the problems 
of lower income in agriculture and a substantial decline in 
resource prices and that the Liberal government is going to give 
us $3 million this year as an increase in equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has said that Saskatchewan should be able to put 
that into its agricultural program.  Yet he does not understand 
that we are not being asked to put in three million bucks.  We 
are being asked to put in $45 million to $60 million this year 
alone.  But he is going to help out by taking $340 million out of 
our economy from the elimination of the Crow benefit, giving us 
$3 million back and saying “good luck, this is a real good 
economic program for farmers and for western Canada”. The 
farmers in western Canada have seen enough of this shell game 
being undertaken by the Liberals to trick farmers into believing 
the Liberals are actually doing something for the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Manitoba is in an even more desperate situation with this 
equalization bill.  Manitoba is slated to lose $37 million over 
five years.  This accounts for 18.5% of Manitoba's overall 
revenues, not the $37 million, but the total equalization 
payment.  I believe provincial officials are very upset about 
this.  They are opposed and are asking for amendments in the next 
go around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more disturbing than all the issues I have raised is 
that the Reform Party goes on record as saying that it does not 
support equalization.  It does not support a level playing field 
for the provinces and regionally based economies.  Reformers do 
support a level playing field for Conrad Black.  They do support 
a level playing field for the oil companies that are 
international in nature.  They do support a level playing field 
for their large corporate friends, but they do not support 
equalization for provinces and regions that require equalization 
assistance from our national treasury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon the Saskatchewan and Manitoba members of parliament 
from the Reform Party to stand in this House and say they oppose 
the Reform Party's view that equalization is bad and it will not 
support equalization payments to provinces that require them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have a couple of comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member made reference to the situation in Saskatchewan. 
I reiterate that I do not want the hon. member to give the 
illusion to those individuals watching this program that there is 
a different formula for Saskatchewan.  The equalization formula 
is calculated one and the same.  We end up with different results 
because of the varying capacities and abilities of provincial 
governments to raise taxes.  There is no inequity there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member made reference to the fact that Quebec has a 
higher per capita rate than does Saskatchewan and that somehow 
that is unfair.  If we go down that road and if I follow the 
logic of the hon. member, the have provinces that do not get any 
equalization are being treated unfairly.  He said that 
Saskatchewan has a lot of roads so it should get more. Quebec 
does not have as many roads but it has a lot of ports. 
Saskatchewan does not have ports.  Should we follow that line of 
thinking? Then we get on to the whole subsidization issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member made reference to the amount of the increase in 
equalization.  He did not think it was very much.  Will the hon. 
member go back to Saskatchewan and tell the people that he does 
not support an increase in equalization payments for the province 
of Saskatchewan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is good that the hon. 
Liberal member has raised the issue of ports.  This is another 
sore point for farmers in Saskatchewan. 
Farmers, through their revenues and income, have supported the 
ports of Canada.  If we did not have ports, we would not be able 
to ship our grain outside the country.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are sick and tired of the Liberals continuing to 
download to them all of the costs that are on the shoulders of 
the Liberal government.  For example, when there is a strike at 
the port in Prince Rupert, on the coast, or up in Churchill, who 
pays for the costs of demurrage or for the delay in getting the 
grain to market?  It is not the Liberal government or Quebec.  It 
is the farmers in Saskatchewan, the farmers in western Canada who 
pay for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite appalled that the Liberal parliamentary secretary 
would say that farmers have nothing to do with the ports of this 
country.  I ask the hon. member to go to Saskatchewan, Manitoba 
or Alberta and talk to the farmers.  Ask them about the federal 
government which is responsible for the ports, which cannot 
deliver our grain to market because the workers are not paid 
adequately and have to use job action to get a fair rate of pay, 
ask the farmers who pays for all that.  It is not the Liberal 
member of parliament from Ontario.  It is the farmers from 
Manitoba, Alberta and Saskatchewan who pay for those ports.  I am 
glad the member raised this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My sense is that Saskatchewan, because of its involvement with 
the equalization formula and which supports the concept of 
equalizing payments, would be remiss if it did not take advantage 
of an equalization formula which includes resource revenues, 
which are now down in price and therefore the revenues are down 
and equalization kicks in.  This is something which is fairly 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the reason that our farmers have record low net incomes 
this year is not because we have equalization payments.  Incomes 
are low because they are spending a lot of money in ports and 
other parts of the country to get their grain to market and the 
Liberals are downloading the costs to the farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member opposite to go to his Minister of Finance 
before the budget and have the Liberal government change its 
policy as it applies to farmers.  Rather than have farmers pay 
for all of the transportation costs, all the labour costs and all 
the port costs, perhaps the federal government should undertake 
responsibility in a financial way to help them out in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for raising that issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise today to speak on the equalization 
renewal package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The equalization renewal package on the surface is positive for 
most of the beneficiary provinces receiving equalization 
payments, with the exception of Manitoba which will receive less 
money as a result of these changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general, the suggested changes include changes in the 
treatment of general and miscellaneous sales tax, lottery and 
gaming revenues, forestry revenues, mineral resources, 
miscellaneous provincial and local tax revenues and also gasoline 
and fuel tax, hospital and medical insurance premiums, oil 
revenues, natural gas revenues, payroll taxes, property taxes and 
sale of crown leases.  These are some of the changes that are in 
the calculation of equalization which are taken into account in 
this new package. I am going to focus on a couple which I do have 
some concerns with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is on the lottery and gaming revenues.    The government is 
moving to treat casino revenues similarly to lottery ticket 
revenues. Previously only the lottery revenues were considered. I 
have concerns with this for a couple of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is that casino revenues often bear significant social costs 
to the provinces, with respect to the costs to health and social 
programs. In Nova Scotia I have seen the impact of the casinos in 
Halifax and Sydney. Frankly it is my own personal belief that 
unless casinos are successful in attracting people from outside a 
particular area, there is extremely high social costs in terms of 
gambling addiction.  In some cases there has been loss of 
people's entire monthly incomes.  There are costs to families in 
the increases in things like spousal abuse and marriage break-up.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health costs are provincially borne costs.  These changes would 
effectively mean that the federal government would be considering 
more casino revenue than it had previously.  Thus provinces would 
be penalized for their casino revenue.  I would argue that in the 
future casino revenues, when considered and balanced against the 
negatives, the social costs and the health costs, are dubious at 
best in terms of their benefit and their sustainability in the 
long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some concerns about that particularly in light of the 
government's irresponsibly slashing health care and the CHST 
since 1993 to the tune of over $6 billion.  I would argue that it 
is short-sighted to consider these casino revenues.  From a long 
term perspective the sustainability of that revenue stream is 
questionable and the benefits are at best dubious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some concerns from our provincial counterparts 
relative to natural gas revenues, for instance offshore natural 
gas revenues and offshore oil revenues for some of the provinces 
affected.  Be it Nova Scotia or Newfoundland, the opportunities 
for Nova Scotians, Newfoundlanders or Atlantic Canadians to 
bootstrap themselves into some level of prosperity in the 21st 
century is largely contingent on these revenues.  We should be 
very careful not to create through changes in equalization a 
clawback that effectively eliminates and reduces significantly 
the benefits from the steps forward being made by these 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be very careful that in our haste to respond to the 
critics of equalization we do not eliminate the basic goals of 
equalization, that is to enable provinces and citizens in have 
not provinces not just to compete but to succeed in a global 
environment.  I would argue that those natural resource revenues 
are pivotal and very important to those provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to recognize the importance of equalization within 
Canada.  It is a cornerstone of Canada's social policy.  It is 
something we should be proud of as a country.  It is difficult to 
take a country of some 30 million people spread out over a 
massive geographic land mass and try to create some semblance of 
equality of opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there are people who will be critical of everything that 
has been done by previous governments, I would argue that one 
thing we have done in Canada that is quite unique and quite 
extraordinary is to create at least some semblance of equality of 
opportunity in almost every corner of the country.  That is 
something we should be proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I grew up in a rural part of Nova Scotia, in an area where there 
was not a significant level of opportunity but where there was a 
sound education system and a health care system that worked, 
albeit the health care system has been gutted in recent years due 
to draconian cuts from our federal counterparts.  The quality of 
the education and health care system helped to equalize the 
opportunity for me and for other Nova Scotians.  We are not 
looking for and no Canadian should believe in some type of policy 
that promises equality of outcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past governments have made the mistake of trying to 
protect regions of the country from the risks of the future. In 
doing so with successive social program spending and reinvestment 
there have been times when governments, in trying to protect for 
instance Atlantic Canadians from the risks of the future, have 
unwittingly prevented Atlantic Canadians from participating fully 
in the opportunities of the future.  That is something we have to 
be very careful of.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be equally careful that we do not capitulate to the 
critics of equalization who claim somehow this is a handout that 
is unjustified and unfair to any Canadian.  Equality of 
opportunity is something that makes Canada unique.  We should 
treasure it as Canadians and be prepared to defend it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to recognize as well that the federal government 
has a leadership role to play in creating equality of opportunity 
across the country, but equalization does not go far enough.  I 
am talking about the federal government taking a leadership role 
in some of the issues that are within provincial jurisdiction but 
where the federal government could play a role in working with 
the provinces to ensure better quality services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last federal election our party had as part of its 
platform a call for national testing in education.  Recognizing 
that is in the provincial jurisdiction, the plan we called for 
was actually an optional plan that provinces could opt in or out 
of.  It would at least raise the bar across the country where 
parents in any region of the country could demand and ask to know 
why their student or child did not test well relative to a 
student in another area, or why the education system was failing 
one area of the country and succeeding in another area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents, students and everyone in Canada want to know where 
their education system stands up.  It is not equalization or 
strictly a financial area but it is a leadership area that the 
federal government could play by implementing and working with 
the provinces to develop a system of national testing such that 
we could see an increase in the quality and excellence which 
could be provided by primary and secondary education systems 
across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to take a serious look at federal programs, for instance 
the millennium scholarship fund.  Before the government even had 
a surplus, when there was just a vague whiff of a surplus, it 
chose to invest $2.5 billion in the millennium scholarship fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These types of programs are in some ways difficult to argue with 
because it is money for higher education, but we should be 
looking very carefully at the design of these programs.  First, 
we should not increase tensions on a federal-provincial relations 
perspective.  Second, these programs should be designed in such a 
way as to reflect not just where Canada is now and where 
Canadians are now but where Canada is going and where we want 
Canadians to go in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example of the wrong-headedness of some of these 
policies.  The millennium scholarship fund is not available for 
students going to private career colleges.  I participated 
recently in a conference on education.  One of the things I 
learned at the conference was that the wave of the future in 
post-secondary education, and quite possibly in secondary and 
primary education, would be in implementing more private 
programming and more private delivery of what was previously a 
totally public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private post-secondary education is outgrowing and outpacing 
public post-secondary education around the world.  This is a 
global phenomenon.  Yet in Canada a scholarship program that was 
recently developed does not reflect the realities of where we are 
now and where we are going in the future in a global context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be very careful to recognize that federal policies and 
more money are not always the answer.  We have to be rigorous in 
providing the types of programs and investments that Canadians 
want and need.  That takes a little more vision than we are 
seeing from the government on a number of these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also like to see a more concerted effort on the part of 
the federal government to work with the provinces in bringing 
down interprovincial trade barriers, one of the structural 
impediments to our global competitiveness and our productivity as 
a country.  Interprovincial trade barriers are an area that can 
actually inhibit and prevent the growth and success of our 
provinces and Canadians in various regions.  These trade barriers 
need to come down.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking about equalization of opportunity, not strictly 
equalization payments.  This is very important because we cannot 
simply depend on money to solve the problems.  We must recognize 
that equalization payments are a way in the short term and in the 
mid-term to equalize opportunity, but we have to work nationally 
and provincially with our provincial counterparts to create 
policies, economic development strategies that are rooted in the 
free market.  We have to recognize that the free market is only 
sustainable if all citizens have access to the levers of the free 
market.  This means a sound education system, a sound health care 
system, and the ability for people to bootstrap themselves and 
become successful.  This will take more than simply equalization 
payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party is having a conference on February 23 in Halifax 
called “The New East”.  The name came from the phrase the new 
west.  I found when travelling in Alberta a sense of buoyancy and 
optimism that is very encouraging.  There is a sense of 
self-reliance and opportunity that is leading the way.  We want 
to see equality of opportunity, that level of opportunity and 
access to economic growth available to all Canadians.  “The New 
East” conference will provide us with ideas for sustainable 
strategies that will provide in the future the types of free 
market based policies which will give opportunities for Atlantic 
Canadians to participate in the same level of economic growth 
that other regions have had in the past and will have for the 
foreseeable future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not simply a matter of Atlantic Canada moving forward 
because of increased revenues in offshore oil or gas.  We now 
need to move forward and take those opportunities we have had in 
offshore petroleum or other resources and invest significantly in 
the type of knowledge based infrastructure we need in these 
regions to enable us to succeed in a global knowledge based 
society.  That again is a strong education system.  It is also 
recognizing some of the global trends in information technology, 
for instance, the death of distance as a determinant in the cost 
of telecommunications—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
last summer the leader of the Reform Party decided to use the 
unprecedented tactic of going overseas to deride the Canadian 
economy during a speech in Hong Kong to investors and business 
professionals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He claimed that the Canadian dollar and the Canadian economy was 
facing a major economic crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately the Reform leader's doomsday predictions have not 
come anywhere near to being realized.  In fact our government's 
prudent approach in managing the economy has proven to be the 
right one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider the evidence.  The Canadian dollar has now regained its 
strength and unemployment is down to its lowest level in nearly 
nine years.  Youth unemployment in 1998 saw a net increase of 
143,000 jobs, the best result in 20 years.  This is just a small 
part of the overall total of 1.5 million jobs created since our 
government took office in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I for one am glad the government did not listen to Reform's 
demands last summer to scrap the budget plan.  I look forward to 
even more of the responsible fiscal management we have come to 
expect from our government in the upcoming budget.

Jordan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The King, ruler of his country for 46 years, was a beacon of 
hope in a land entrenched in conflict.  The shifting sands of 
Middle East politics have claimed many leaders and it is a true 
measure of the man that he was able to lead his people for so 
long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the privilege of meeting the King a few years ago.  What 
was most striking about him was his humility, grace and kindness. 
Known to dress as one of his subjects, to take the pulse of his 
citizenry, he was a true people's king.  However, it is in his 
last act that the King demonstrated his true colours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is said that the ultimate measure of a man is not where he 
stands in moments of comfort, but where he stands in times of 
challenge.  So it is in his last gesture of flying while 
critically ill to ensure that the Wye Peace Accord was signed 
that the King may be judged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Reform Party wish to extend our deepest

many people rightly feel that the social union agreement

</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, in the new agreement, the federal government takes 
a large step in agreeing to no longer introduce new initiatives

and will have to obtain the agreement of a majority of 
provinces, which will then be allowed to tailor programs to 
their own requirements.

to modernizing Canadian federalism.  This is the kind of 
overture our government feels would strengthen the provinces'

as vital as social services and health.

leaders of all G-8 countries, except Canada, are in Jordan.  Even 
the Russian Prime Minister with his failing health, Boris 
Yeltsin, is defying his doctors and has left the hospital to 
attend the funeral of King Hussein.  But our Prime Minister is

the world has known that King Hussein was going to die as early

This is about showing solidarity with King Abdullah, the new 
Jordanian leader.  It is about sending a message that Jordan is a 
valued friend.  It is about demonstrating that Canada wants to be 
involved in achieving peace in the Middle East.  It is about 
proving that Canada cares enough to send its highest dignitary,

Canadians that the legislative branch will be bound by this 
resolution, as will the executive branch”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

Fraud accounts for one third, but there are also overpayments, 
there are sometimes errors on the part of the department or the 
taxpayer, and when there are errors, we put them right.  That is 
good management, designed to treat all workers fairly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

the subject of manpower for a very long time and, contrary to 
what the members of the Bloc Quebecois were saying earlier—that 
the Prime Minister had made promises and we had done nothing—the

establish a manpower agreement with the Government of Quebec, an 
agreement that should help Quebeckers in time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned about modernizing Canadian federalism, and we

own money and does not come from the agreement we negotiated on 
manpower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell him that we also had the future of the regions in 
mind and that I regularly hear that people find their relations 
with the Government of Quebec too centralized, whereas they

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>THE LATE KING HUSSEIN 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK171"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, and fellow members, Canadians, the entire 
international community and the people of Jordan are grieving 
over the loss of His Majesty King Hussein. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seldom in the years since the second world war have we seen in 
one person, one statesman, the qualities of true greatness 
possessed by Jordan's long serving leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Jordan whatever their background owed much to King 
Hussein.  He brought his country into the modern world.  He 
encouraged the emergence of democratic institutions and made 
human rights a priority.  He ruled with a gentle hand, granting 
successive waves of Palestinian refugees a home in Jordan where 
they built new lives and were extended the privileges of 
Jordanian nationality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of all, King Hussein will be mourned and his memory 
honoured for the steps that he personally took over many years to 
find a just and equitable peace in the Middle East.  He believed 
and understood that Israel and its Arab neighbours needed to find 
a way to live side by side in peace.  This was never an easy task 
when distrust and suspicions were everywhere, wounds were deeply 
felt and old hatreds difficult to overcome.  But King Hussein 
persisted despite opposition from many of his neighbours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At each crucial stage in the peace process of recent years he 
played a key role.  He was on the White House lawn beside Yitzhak 
Rabin in July 1994.  Three months later he formally brought 
hostilities between Jordan and Israel to an end. Most recently, 
although gravely ill, he left his hospital bed to help forge the 
Wye accord between Israel and the PLO. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His compassion for the suffering and misfortunes of others was 
legendary.  Who can forget his moving tribute at the funeral of 
Prime Minister Rabin, or the day he knelt to beg forgiveness of 
the Israeli mothers whose children had been killed by a 
Jordanian soldier in a fit of madness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will recall King Hussein's various visits to Canada, 
the last of these in March 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a firm ally of his country, Canada was always prepared to 
provide moral and material support to his peace efforts. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jordan's king will be sadly missed and not soon forgotten by his 
country, in the Middle East, in Canada and indeed throughout the 
international community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Government of Canada, I wish to express our 
deepest sympathies to his wife, Queen Noor, his family and the 
Jordanian people as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To his successor, King Abdullah, I wish to pledge Canada's 
support as he takes up the difficult task of continuing to foster 
peace in this troubled region. 
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I also rise today to join with other hon. members in 
paying tribute to Jordan's King Hussein, a remarkable man who led 
a remarkable country for 47 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we also pay our respects and send our condolences to Queen 
Noor, and to King Abdullah, King Hussein's son who now takes up 
the heavy mantle of leadership, and to all the people of Jordan 
who today mourn the loss of a friend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the difference between a politician and a statesman?  I 
think King Hussein helps define that answer, for during his long 
tenure he demonstrated time and time again the courage and the 
wisdom that made him a legend in his own time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the funeral proceeded this morning, it was evident that the 
King's greatest skill, that of bringing together people who 
differ and differ profoundly, will be his greatest legacy, that 
even in death King Hussein was able to make the lion lie down 
with the lamb.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu paid his respects 
along with two former Israeli prime ministers and the widow of 
Yitzhak Rabin.  They attended, just as did Yasser Arafat and 
Syria's President Assad.  Four U.S. presidents were there, as 
were the president and prime minister of Russia.  That was the 
kind of man King Hussein was, a man who believed in peace and 
brought together others who saw the possibility of peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to be a modern, moderate, peace loving man in 
the Middle East but King Hussein excelled at that difficult task. 
He was a bridge between the Arab world and Israel.  He was a 
bridge between the west and the east.  He was among the first to 
invest in peace in the region, to take his place among the 
peacemakers, not the war makers.  He did so at great personal risk 
but that risk paid off.  It is not an exaggeration to say that 
much of the progress, what progress has been made with respect to 
Middle East peace, would not have been possible without his moral 
leadership and example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the official opposition and all Canadians, I pay 
tribute to a great king.  May God sustain and guide his successor 
along the same path. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK173"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
death of King Hussein of Jordan was a great and unexpected 
sorrow to the world, and a crushing blow to his people.  An 
unexpected sorrow to the world because, although he was known to 
be ill, this pilot-king had been at the controls of the plane 
when he recently returned to Jordan, so there was no indication 
that his death would come so soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During his reign, the friendly relationship between Canada and 
Jordan grew stronger and stronger.  A number of Quebec 
businesses contributed to the development of trade links with 
Jordan. 
Many Quebeckers have been involved, in a spirit of generosity 
and openness, in international development projects funded by 
Canada.  We can only hope that these ties will be continued 
under his successor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take advantage of this opportunity to express my best 
wishes, and those of my party, to his son, the new King 
Abdullah.  May his reign allow Jordan to continue to progress 
along the road to modernization and peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The death of King Hussein was also a crushing blow to his 
people.  One need only watch the scenes on television to realize 
that the relationship between the king and his people was more 
than one of ruler and ruled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>King Hussein was obviously a great monarch, with the affection 
and trust of his people.  In every way, his long reign was a 
totally remarkable one. 
With leadership skills that were the envy of many, he guided his 
people for nearly half a century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This king, a member of his country's Hashemite minority, did not 
have the benefit of the oil wealth of most Arab countries in 
advancing his country economically and socially.  He was able to 
strike a wise balance between the internal demands of his 
country, which was not exempt from the tensions relating to the 
Arab-Israeli conflict, and the regional realities which dictated, 
after a number of conflicts, the normalization of relations with 
his neighbours, Israel in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the vicissitudes of international politics and of 
regional conflicts, King Hussein will be remembered as a 
peacemaker for his moderation in word and deed. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK174"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today we 
pay tribute to one of the most compelling figures to govern a 
middle eastern nation in this century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>King Hussein ruled Jordan for 47 years.  Throughout this period 
he was at the very centre of Middle East politics carefully 
advancing the interests of his own people while mobilizing around 
the cause of peace in the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His achievements are all the more impressive when one considers 
the pressures and forces levelled against him.  He governed with 
a mixture of vision, gritty determination and solid political 
judgment.  He demonstrated that the hand of friendship is a more 
effective route to peace than the clenched fist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His reign was characterized at times by turbulence and great 
upheaval.  By virtue of his single minded determination to improve 
the welfare of his people and to modernize his country, he earned 
the enduring affection of his own people and the admiration of 
people around the world. 
This was evident a few short weeks ago when thousands of people 
lined the streets of Amman to welcome their beloved king home 
from his most recent medical treatment abroad.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>King Hussein worked tirelessly for peace in the region. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His goal was to ensure that Jordan could peacefully exist in a 
new regional relationship with Israel and the newly constructed 
Palestinian territories.  King Hussein's passing marks the loss 
of one of the most formidable campaigners for peace in our 
lifetime but his legacy will endure. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His contribution to the peace process in the Middle East will 
live on. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to convey on behalf of my colleagues and my party 
heartfelt condolences to the family of King Hussein, to the 
people of Jordan and to Jordanian Canadians.  May his successors 
draw strength from King Hussein's inspiration and achievements 
and may we Canadians rededicate ourselves to the cause of peace. 
<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party, I 
would like to express our sympathy at the death of Jordan's King 
Hussein. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People the world over are mourning the loss of this great man. 
Not only was he recognized as one of the world's most respected 
leaders both in the Middle East and around the world, but it was 
just a few short months ago despite his illness that the king was 
called upon to help forge the Wye peace accord between Israel and 
the PLO. His reputation and stature throughout the world is 
obvious given the fact that all of the world's important leaders 
travelled to Amman today to pay their respects at the state 
funeral. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During his tenure as foreign affairs minister, our leader the 
Right Hon. Joe Clark had many occasions to meet the late King 
Hussein in Canada and in Jordan.  He noted that he had always 
admired King Hussein's wisdom, foresight and calm strength during 
very tumultuous times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>King Hussein ruled Jordan through some very turbulent years but 
no matter what the obstacle, he always demonstrated a sense of 
fairness and compassion.  His years of leadership guided his 
country toward democracy with human rights always at the 
forefront. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To his son and successor, King Abdullah, we wish him well as he 
works to continue the estimable legacy of his father.  A king of 
peace seeking reconciliation will be that legacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the flag over our Peace Tower flying appropriately at 
half-staff, the world has lost a great man.  On behalf of our 
leader the Right Hon. Joe Clark and the Progressive Conservative 
Party of Canada, we would like to extend to Her Majesty Queen 
Noor and the entire family and the people of Jordan our deepest 
sympathies. 
<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  It is only in exceptional 
circumstances that we lower our flag on the Peace Tower to 
half-mast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>King Hussein was an exceptional world leader. Will you please 
stand and join me in one minute of silence on the death of King 
Hussein of Jordan.

have asked for in these questions.  I asked previously when I 
might expect an answer and I was only told that the government 
House leader would look into it.  I wonder if I could get a 
specific timeframe on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, seeing as the government has had this question for 
six months, would it be prepared at least to table part of the 
question it has answered and give us an undertaking as to why it 
has taken so long to answer this question?

concern.  I heard his remarks this morning on a point of order on 
this very question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will look into in great detail the whereabouts of Questions 
Nos. 132 and 138.  I will also look into his suggestion as to a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys,

to ask a question of my friend, the parliamentary secretary.  The 
government had promised to introduce legislation this year to 
protect Canada's water.  That was actually last year and it is a 
new year now.  Could he bring us any kind of update? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am reluctant to allow question 
period to continue.  The hon. member rose on a point of order. If 
he is referring to a question on the order paper I would perhaps 
allow his question.  It does not appear that he is. This is 
another, if I may call it so, bit of a fishing expedition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the proper time for this is during business of the House 
on Thursdays when the government House leader is here to deal 
with it.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL FISCAL ARRANGEMENTS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-65, an 
act to amend the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  When the House broke for question 
period the hon. member for Kings—Hants had the floor and he had 
five minutes remaining for his remarks. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
issue of equalization is fundamental to Canada.  Equalization has 
represented a cornerstone of the social and economic policies in 
Canada.  The equality of opportunity that has been provided by 
equalization is pivotal and important if we are to ensure that 
throughout Canada people have access to the levers of the free 
market and a global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that we recognize the differences of the 
country and encourage people to succeed in their provinces and to 
access opportunity.  Without equalization, without this 
commitment to what is essentially Canadian, we would be 
imperilling that opportunity and that tenet of Canadian policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier that in Manitoba there is some significant 
concern over the reduction in equalization payments that this 
adjustment process would result in.  It reminded me of an article 
I read last spring in the <I>Winnipeg Free Press</I> of Saturday, 
May 17, 1997.  It followed the Reform Party's announcement on 
equalization and was called “Securing Your Future”.  They were 
calling for a cut in equalization payments by 12% or $1 billion. 
They were looking at readjusting equalization so as not to 
include some of the provinces that are currently receiving it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Manitoba would be one of the provinces that would be cut out of 
equalization.  I will give an idea of the impact on Manitoba. 
Manitoba's deputy premier Jim Downey at that time called the 
Reform plan to cut equalization payments to only three payments 
frightening.  He said that at first blush it would cause a 
remarkably severe impact on Manitoba and a loss of $1 billion or 
about one-sixth of the province's gross revenues.  He said it 
would essentially wipe out 25 provincial departments or the 
entire education budget.  He was explaining what the impact in 
the short term would be of this type of draconian policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all believe in the free market.  We must all understand that 
the free market is only successful if all Canadians have access 
to the levers of it.  In a knowledge based society equality of 
opportunity means equality of educational opportunities and 
health care.  All these policies tie together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not stand by and see a ghettoization of Canada.  It is a 
remarkable achievement in our country that we have been able to 
provide some semblance of equality across the country in terms of 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to see the government move forward not just with 
an equalization policy to equalize opportunities but with 
something more fundamental than that, an industrial strategy for 
our country, which is clearly lacking; a commitment to reducing 
interprovincial trade barriers; a commitment to reducing taxes; a 
commitment to reducing the regulatory burden on individuals and 
on small businesses; and a commitment to ensuring that Canadians 
can not only compete in a global environment as we enter the 21st 
century but can succeed in that environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party has always been committed to these goals.  We would 
like to see the government commit in the upcoming budget to the 
type of fiscal policy and type of economic policy that would lead 
Canadians proudly into the 21st century.  Maybe some day 
equalization will not be necessary because all regions of the 
country will succeed and all Canadians will have an opportunity 
to participate in the type of economic growth that everyone 
deserves.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
one of the member's final comments was with regard to the 
ghettoization of Canada and I think that is an unfortunate 
description of what might be in fact the effect of the 
equalization program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will know that equalization puts about $8.5 billion 
into the hands of the provinces so their taxation levels do not 
have to rise for them to be able to provide the same kind of 
services across the country.  It is basically a mobility issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should be careful in his choice of language.  It 
would be wonderful to think that over the long term all provinces 
would be able to sustain their economies without equalization, 
but the bill before us will renew the equalization program for 
the benefit of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope the member would want to clarify his views on 
equalization in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member may not have heard the first part of my speech 
which was prior to question period.  At no time did I say that we 
did not support equalization.  In fact I defended the tenets of 
equalization vociferously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the hon. member that it is absolutely essential to 
the equality of opportunity across the country that we maintain 
and strengthen equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the hon. member's intervention because I would not 
in any way want my words to be interpreted as not supporting 
equalization.  It is quite the contrary.  We recognize it as a 
cornerstone of Canadian social policy.  Our party defends it and 
we recognize its importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I was suggesting, relative to ghettoization, is that 
without equalization there would be a ghettoization of Canadians 
because there would be some groups in some regions of the country 
who would simply not have the same access to opportunity as 
others.  Without equalization we would have a ghettoization.  I 
hope that clarification is to the member's satisfaction. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to what the member had to say 
and I agree with him that Canadians are fair and generous people 
who really do not mind helping out their neighbour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there is a feeling among many that Ontario, Alberta and 
British Columbia seem to be left holding the bag with this 
equalization business.  That perception is very real.  Part of 
the problem is that the whole process of the equalization formula 
is complex, convoluted and confusing.  Nobody really understands 
why one province will be the beneficiary of funding while another 
will not.  Without getting into detail, we have to look at some 
of the provinces and how wealthy they are in resources and ask 
why that province is getting funding when another is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all seriousness, how would the member give this whole notion 
a better public relations face? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  He raises a very good point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that if the member wanted to see British 
Columbia become a beneficiary province the best way to ensure 
that would be to maintain a New Democrat government there for a 
long time.  In fact at some point in the future that may occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But seriously, it is an extraordinarily complex formula.  We 
were briefed several times on the formula and it is very 
complicated, quite frankly, for a student of these affairs to 
understand.  From a public relations perspective I do not know 
how to get the point across.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important for Canadians living in the contributing 
provinces to realize is that the people who are on the receiving 
end do not use the funds in a wasteful manner.  They are being 
used for the basic social fabric, education, health care and 
those fundamental areas that everyone in Canada values.  What 
makes Canada unique is our ability to provide the funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who simplistically say that we should cut off 
equalization have to realize that those people would go somewhere 
to find opportunities.  Ultimately the social problems that would 
exist in a particular region, such as Atlantic Canada, would 
exist in another region if we were not able to provide some basic 
level of service in the areas of social spending, education and 
health care.  Those problems would not disappear simply because 
of the lack of equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through an industrial strategy we could ensure that in 10 or 15 
years equalization would be less necessary.  We have to move on 
that type of policy.  However in the short term it is a 
fundamental tenet of Canadian social and economic policy that 
simply needs to be maintained at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins:</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate what the member had to say.  However the 
underlying question is:  Are provinces, in a way, not like 
people? Are we not creating, to a certain extent, some kind of 
dependency on equalization, given that it is not clear to most 
people just why the money is being given? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are transferring huge gobs of money from one place to 
another, from one pocket to another.  Under what circumstances? 
I do not know.  To a certain extent we are creating a dependency 
when the lines are not very clearly defined for these transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member comment on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, one of the areas that is 
changing dramatically in Atlantic Canada is natural resource 
development.  There is natural gas development in Nova Scotia and 
the Hibernia project in Newfoundland.  We would hope that in the 
not too distant future these provinces would actually be have 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not honestly believe that equalization payments contribute 
to dependency.  When I speak of social spending policies I am not 
talking about income support, I am talking about education, 
health care and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those areas do not represent a dependency.  They represent a 
basic quality of life that is required for anyone to succeed.  If 
we want Nova Scotians to succeed we need to provide enough 
funding for a strong education system and for a good health care 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member raises the very important issue of dependency. 
We must consider whether the government has over the past 30 
years, in trying to protect Atlantic Canadians from the risks of 
the future, actually prevented some Atlantic Canadians from 
participating fully in the opportunities of the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He does have a point.  I would suspect that some of the policies 
which have been implemented have not been successful. 
Equalization in itself, as a policy, has actually had some level 
of success in at least providing a level of opportunity for those 
people to succeed either in those provinces or to go elsewhere. 
In particular, young people need to be provided with a sound 
footing to get them through the first years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the hon. member that we need an industrial 
strategy.  We need something that can actually harness the powers 
of the free market in a global environment so that all Canadians 
can succeed.  However, that cannot be done simply through 
equalization.  It cannot exist in isolation from other government 
policies and leadership in other areas.  Frankly, that is what is 
really lacking at this point.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat 
Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have this 
opportunity to discuss amendments to the Federal-Provincial 
Fiscal Arrangements Act.  This act provides the legislative 
authority for parliament and this government to provide 
equalization payments to the provinces by virtue of the fact that 
all Canadians are equal and deserve equal access to equal 
services.  Fundamentally, that speaks to what this legislation is 
all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard in this House what the opposition parties feel 
this bill should not be about.  They feel this bill should not be 
about equity, that it should not be about building Canada from 
coast to coast to coast, that it should not be about providing 
services to all Canadians, no matter the level of income or the 
location of residence, on the basis of equity.  We have heard 
from the opposition that it should be about the principle of 
every person for themselves; that every person, man or woman, 
should fend for themselves, based on their ability to compete and 
survive in a very turbid world of market forces, and that is the 
way it should be.  That would be a great speech in Washington, 
D.C., but this is Canada.  Canada was built on a principled set 
of tenets.  Canadians deserve equity in social programs from 
coast to coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I re-emphasize that this debate has been about what the program 
should not be.  This debate so far for the opposition has been 
about what it should not be for Canadians.  The opposition has 
said that we should not have equity, that we should not have 
regional distribution of wealth, that we should not build Canada 
as a mosaic of regions where each region builds upon the 
strengths of others and provides support where support is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition fails to remember that it was some of the eastern 
provinces which first began the process of transfer payments.  It 
was the eastern part of this country that actually provided 
transfer payments for the building of the west.  That did not 
happen last year, nor did it happen 10 years ago.  It happened 
literally hundreds of years ago, but it happened.  That is an 
example of how this country was built. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do members of the House see me trying to profess that that was a 
wrong move, that it was un-Canadian, that now my region or 
province has been hard done by?  No.  That is what built this 
country.  A major principle that built this country is that all 
Canadians should be provided equal access to government programs 
and services, in particular social programs such as health and 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is terrible that hon. members opposite are still heckling 
that point of view.  We are debating the fact that in this 
country social programs will be provided to the citizens of St. 
John's, Newfoundland on the same basis as they are to citizens of 
Victoria, B.C.  Hon. members opposite have some explaining to do, 
not just to their own constituents but to their own consciences. 
It is not a Canadian principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Constitution has entrenched the principle of equity for 
Canadians.  It has done so through the principle of providing 
services to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud to be a Canadian.  I am also proud that 
opposition members still defend the principle of equity. 
Unfortunately they do not come from the Reform Party, but I think 
there are a few members across the way who still quietly, while 
not disturbing their caucus ranks, realize and understand the 
value that Canada is not a dog eat dog society, that there are 
still some principles of building a country and that those 
principles are based on the fact that Canadians in need will be 
assisted by Canadians who, at that point in time, have a little 
more to offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could simply take a snapshot in time of what Canada is today, 
but we must remember that Canada changes over time.  The east 
coast was the economic engine of Canada not too long ago.  We 
were the economic engine that provided resources to help build 
other parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not heard any new ideas from the opposition about 
rebuilding the federation and building on the social programs and 
services which Canadians enjoy.  What we have heard is how to 
take them down.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the Reform Party has based its entire debate on. 
That is what the Reform Party and other members of the opposition 
have based their entire discussions on.  Their question is how do 
they take down the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we take it down?  By simply providing tax relief to 
Canadians.  What will this tax relief do?  It will provide the 
provinces with the opportunity to be able to tax their citizens. 
It is more appropriate for the provinces to tax their citizens 
based on the individual capability to provide the services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does it really boil down to?  It is so that the people in 
Newfoundland and Labrador will be able to use their own money to 
provide all the programs and services they would need in order 
for them to be equal Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that really say about the Reform Party's position? 
This means every man, woman and child must stand solely for 
themselves.  No matter what the financial circumstances of the 
provinces, no matter what the circumstances of the region, 
everybody should be on it for their own.  Is it a great country 
building principle?  Quite frankly it is one that I reject out of 
hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers are really saying that they want all persons to fend 
only for themselves.  I do not accept that notion. I do not agree 
with it whatsoever.  It is a very short term view of what Canada 
is all about and what Canada has been in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are already seeing in the House indications that when it is 
appropriate for members opposite to rise and demand additional 
services and programs for their own constituencies they have no 
problem doing it, but do not ever institutionalize a program in 
the Constitution or in legislation which actually provides for 
the basic principle that Canadians help Canadians.  Do not ever 
do it unless it affects Reform Party constituents.  Then it can 
be done because it is completely appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The country was built on a more solid foundation than that. They 
country was built on the foundation that through time, through 
place and through any sort of political arrangement Canadians 
help Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very delighted that I am allowed the opportunity to speak 
on equalization.  It has been very helpful to my province in a 
period of economic need.  Over 25% of the budget of Government of 
Newfoundland and Labrador literally is achieved through the 
equalization program.  If we were to suddenly eliminate that, 
what kind of health care would Newfoundlanders and Labradorians 
receive?  What kind of education would they receive?  How could 
they participate as full Canadians in a system which means that 
they will not receive the same levels of service as any other 
Canadian? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How productive or meaningful would our country be if we actually 
allowed that to occur?  By providing government programs and 
services based on a province's individual capability of taxing 
its own citizens as opposed to drawing upon the collective 
strength of all Canadians is a very un-Canadian principle.  Quite 
frankly, why have Canada?  Why be a collective?  Why be a nation 
based on principles of equity?  Why do it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members opposite have no response for me because they 
realize that just as in any organization, just as in any family, 
just as in any circumstance, sometimes men and women are called 
upon in time of need, time of crisis, out of friendship and 
compassion to help out where they can.  That is the principle 
that built the country and it is not being reflected in the House 
or during the course of this debate.  That is why I am quite 
honoured to be able to have that entered into the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The equalization program provides a significant amount of 
revenue which my province of Newfoundland and Labrador and indeed 
the other provinces of Atlantic Canada require.  If it were not 
there the people of Atlantic Canada would not be as well served 
as they are today.  They would not be provided with government 
programs and services.  They would not feel like full Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that it does exist despite the fact that it does have 
some shortcomings speaks well of Canada. 
It exists in a form that allows for equal participation not just 
of the provincial governments but of their citizens.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization, according to this act as we have changed it, 
allows for a significant additional increase in incremental funds 
to the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador.  Why?  Because we 
are in need right now and it is judged by our ability to tax our 
own citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the formula based approach to the equalization 
formula, which is transparent, up front and very accountable to 
all citizens of Canada, we provide a basis to transfer moneys to 
provinces in particular need of those services so that they can 
provide equally to their constituents.  That is a principle which 
is being aggressively attacked by the platform and statements of 
the opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that they feel this is such irresponsible behaviour on 
the part of the government?  They define it as irresponsible in 
that the net effect of it is to reduce personal incentive.  Why 
would they say that to a region such as Atlantic Canada or to 
certain regions in the west which also receive equalization and 
still profess to be a party that wants to build the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly this is not the way that Canada was built.  Nor 
should it be.  It is not the position of our government.  Nor 
will it ever be.  It is now enshrined in the Constitution that 
equalization is part of the basic fabric of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to announce in the House this afternoon that 
Newfoundland and Labrador will be receiving additional 
incremental payments under the equalization formula as amended in 
this act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the reaction from the members opposite speaks to the 
fact that it is a good deal for Newfoundland and Labrador. I 
always want to make additional improvements to the bill, but I am 
very satisfied to stand in the House right now to defend an 
amendment to an act which allows my province the ability to 
provide government programs and services such as health and 
education at a higher level than it would if members of the 
opposition were in power.  That speaks to itself.  It speaks to 
what Canada is all about.  It speaks to my role as member of 
parliament in addressing the particular issues.  It speaks to 
what we do in the House, which is debate ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear that the idea of Canada as expressed by members 
of the Reform Party and other members of the opposition is not 
the idea that I share.   We are a caring, sharing country where 
not every man, woman and child will have to fend for themselves 
according to their own means of the day.  It is where we share 
resources, wealth, ideas and where we share the common greatness 
of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That may be odious and terrible for the opposition.  I hope the 
microphones are picking up the catcalls that are being put 
forward in the House.  Equalization is a very important element 
of what we are doing in terms of providing equity and wealth 
distribution for all citizens throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say very clearly that the increased economic 
performance of Newfoundland and Labrador will mean in due time 
that we will not require the assistance of equalization payments. 
We will not require the assistance of any other transfers because 
that is our objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just 10 short years ago Newfoundland and Labrador trailed the 
nation in terms of gross domestic product.  We not only trailed. 
We were in negative growth.  Today, Newfoundland and Labrador 
leads the country in economic growth.  Our gross domestic product 
as predicted by some leading financial institutions is predicted 
to continue to grow into the 21st century.  I am very proud of 
that.  That growth will define the fact that we will no longer 
require equalization payments.

Government of Canada to provide for some of our needs.  Why that 
is even being debated on the other side speaks again to their

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for his “Canada is a social program” 
speech. It was very heart rending.  I am thrilled to hear that he 
has embraced collectivism and has spoken warmly in favour of it, 
but I want to point out a few things to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about how much his government cares about social 
programs, but he forgot somehow to mention that his government 
has cut $20 billion out of health care in the last few years. 
There was not a word about that.  Somehow that slipped his mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member across the way tell us, if his government 
cares so much about social programs, why it cut $20 billion out 
of health care over the last few years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what is painfully left out 
of the hon. member's question is the fact that if the Reform 
Party had its way, if Canadians actually let it in through the 
democratic process, it would not be a question of cutting 
billions of dollars out of health care.  It would be a question 
of when and how fast would it eliminate health care and have it 
just completely a user pay based system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be very clear about a couple of points.  This is the 
party whose leader stood in Atlantic Canada some two or three 
years ago and said that when it comes to the fishery it has been 
such a boondoggle and expense on taxpayers “let's take 10 
seconds and tell Atlantic Canadians that it is over”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the Atlantic fisheries are producing more in terms of 
gross domestic product than they were 10 years ago.  The value of 
exports are double.  Our economy is growing.  This is a party 
that continually would abandon Atlantic Canada given the 
opportunity, but we will not let them have the opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care is a prime concern of Canadians.  Everybody in the 
House knows that unless we did something about our fiscal house 
in Canada there would not be any question of how much would we 
have to cut from health care or education, or any other program 
today.  It would be how we would deal with the destruction of all 
social programs in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gives me no joy to admit there were cuts to social programs. 
When a $42 billion deficit is eliminated it is not possible to 
turn to a neighbour and say it is okay because it is very 
important to eliminate a $42 billion deficit.  It is important 
that the Government of Canada not spend $42 billion a year more 
than it takes in.  When the question is asked whether that means 
we should cut $42 billion in government programs and services, 
they do not have an answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We rebuilt the economy and our ability to fund health care and 
education programs while at the same time trimmed our deficit to 
a responsible level.  Now we are seeing a dividend from that.  We 
are seeing a reinvestment into health care and education.  We are 
seeing it on a very stable platform: one where there will be no 
further cuts in the future, one that will see Canadians have 
stable fiscal arrangements in the future, and one that builds 
upon a very much stronger Canada.  That is a Canada that the 
Reform Party does not understand. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have risen from my laryngitis simply because I feel compelled 
to remark that of the many atrocious speeches I have heard in 
this place the member's ranks toward the very top of the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fascinating to have learned from the hon. demagogue 
opposite that he and his colleagues are in favour of equity, 
civility, collectivity, sweetness and niceness and little furry 
kittens, and the opposition is in favour eviscerating all that is 
good and civil about our society.  I am delighted to see that the 
hon. member has a very mature Manichaean view of the political 
pluralism in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will bring the hon. member's attention to a speech delivered 
by the hon. leader of the opposition this morning.  The hon. 
member opposite suggested that the Reform Party opposes all 
manner of equalization carte blanche and would eliminate such 
programs. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is simply, completely, totally inaccurate, false, wrong and 
misleading.  The hon. member would know that, had he been here 
this morning to hear the hon. Leader of the Opposition say that 
the Reform Party “supports equalization”.  We support the 
principle of equalization.  The people of Alberta, B.C. and 
Ontario generally support equalization as well.  He went on to 
say that this is an important principle in our federation. What 
the hon. Leader of the Opposition did say, and I would second his 
comments, is that we have concerns about the way the formula is 
calculated and the way the program is applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member suggested that Newfoundland this year has the 
highest rate of GDP growth in the country.  Marvellous.  Kudos to 
Newfoundland and Labrador.  We can all join in commending the 
people of that province for moving ahead economically. However, I 
would point out that that region is receiving hundreds of 
millions of equalization dollars from the taxpayers of British 
Columbia who are right now in a recession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the hon. member's kind-hearted generosity, compassion and 
care for all, would he be prepared to adjust the equalization 
formula so that the fastest growing province in the country could 
help the only province that today is in recession? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is always interesting 
and amusing to see the policy gymnastics of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the hon. member has referred to is the fact that there is 
substantial economic growth occurring in Newfoundland and 
Labrador.  As a country we are going to see the shared dividends 
from that economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the hon. member fails to point out is that there is still 
some significant catching up to do.  Newfoundland and Labrador 
will become a have province, a sharing province which is indeed 
our objective, but we still have some ground to make up.  That is 
why the equalization program is stepping in right now.  It is to 
be able to provide that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not our objective over the long term to be a recipient of 
equalization.  It is the objective however of the Reform Party to 
keep us in that position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party's position has always been that tax cuts are 
the answer.  Can the revenue of a family be cut from $30,000 a 
year down to $25,000 and still provide the same level of 
purchasing power as there was at $30,000?  The obvious answer is 
no.  Yet the hon. member and the Reform Party continue to raise 
the idea that we can cut the revenues of the Government of Canada 
very substantially, very quickly and very heavily and still be 
able to provide the same levels of support, programs and services 
such as health care and education for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank God the people of Canada are much, much smarter than the 
Reform Party members will ever give them credit for being.  They 
just do not understand this fact.  Reform members change their 
policies time and time again whenever it suits their needs.  They 
never actually address the real issues.  They continually read 
the polls, find out what the polls may say in their 
constituencies and actually design polls so they say what they 
want them to say and then they create ideas or policy documents 
based on those polls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Polls do not say much when it comes to building Canada.  What 
hon. members do not understand is that Canadians throughout the 
country share a very sound value which says let us build the 
economy, let us build jobs, let us have growth but at the same 
time, let us try to be fair to all the regions of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party members do not understand that and it is about 
time they did. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member obviously does not know what he is talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform government will put $2.5 billion back into health 
care.  Furthermore we will reduce the tax burden on a family of 
four earning $30,000 by $4,000 a year.  That will put almost $1 
billion more into Atlantic Canada than is presently being 
distributed in Atlantic Canada through all of those pork jobs the 
Liberals love to keep the strings on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position is that we believe a dollar in the hand of the 
consumer beats the heck out of a dollar in the hands of the 
member. What is wrong with putting money into the hands of the 
people in Atlantic Canada who can be responsible and use that 
money in a far more responsible way than ACOA or any other 
program could think of?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne:</B>  Now we are getting to the heart of it, 
Mr. Speaker.  What the hon. member is suggesting is that a dollar 
taken away from the hands of a public health care institution is 
far better served put in the hands of someone who is of a higher 
income bracket.  Any tax cuts that occur take away funds from 
public institutions and put them in the hands of probably those 
who need them the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax cuts are important but they have to be focused.  They have 
to be directed at the people who need them the most.  Low income 
and middle income Canadian families are the people who deserve 
the tax breaks the most.  Let us put it in perspective.  What the 
hon. member is suggesting is that if we take that tax dollar, we 
reduce the ability of the Government of Canada and the individual 
provincial governments to provide those services and we put it in 
the hands of the rich.  The rich quite frankly will be able to 
afford those health care services when they go on the free market 
to buy them.  That is not universal health care. It is not 
universal health care and it is not a Canadian health care 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have one tier medicine where everybody, regardless of income 
level, regardless of their location of residence have equal 
access to the same medical services.  That is something the 
Reform Party does not agree with. They cannot stand it— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I regret to interrupt the 
parliamentary secretary when he is in full flight, but the time 
for questions and comments has expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to address Bill C-65. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the Reform Party cannot support this bill.  As my 
colleague from Calgary Southeast said and earlier my leader from 
Calgary Southwest said today, Reform Party does support the 
concept of equalization but we do think that the program as it is 
structured now not only is wasteful, vague and ill-defined but 
actually does some damage. We would like to see a different 
approach taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into that I simply must respond to something my 
colleague across the way said.  He said that we have one tier 
health care in Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me inform my friend across the way that about 30% of health 
care in Canada today is funded by private individuals.  Maybe he 
did not know that.  Maybe he did not know that only 9% is funded 
by the federal government now.  It used to be 50%, but the 
federal government did its disappearing act which it chronically 
does when the going gets tough, and now the provinces have been 
left holding the bag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the member and his government provided the latest 
example of that when they dumped about $20 billion in spending 
cuts on the provinces, including his own native Newfoundland 
which really could hardly afford to bear that kind of loss. My 
friend across the way should explain to his constituents if he 
cares so deeply for social programs, how it is that he let his 
own government eviscerate health care in Newfoundland like he 
did.  I think he has a lot of explaining to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get into some of the specifics of this bill.  The Reform 
Party has problems with Bill C-65 for a number of reasons.  I 
should explain first of all what this is. This is an equalization 
bill that seeks to extend the current equalization agreement with 
some tinkering for another five years.  It means about $8.5 
billion in expenditures or somewhere in that range per year, in 
other words about $42 billion over the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a tremendous amount of money.  It amounts to about 8% of 
the federal government's budget every single year.  Yet are we 
having a major task force look into this?  Are we having a big 
discussion about this?  No. We had three days notice that we were 
going to debate it today.  Probably not too many days beyond 
today it will be pushed through by this government because that 
is the way it does business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that this is one of the most important pieces of 
legislation that can be brought before this House.  There is 
almost universal agreement that the legislation, and I guess it 
is in the Constitution now, the whole formula and idea of 
equalization needs radical reform.  There is hardly an economist 
in the country who would argue that the current design is good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to start by pointing out that it is fraught with 
opportunity for political manipulation.  I will mention this to 
my friend who just spoke, because he comes from a riding that was 
formerly held by the current premier of Newfoundland. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT63"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT63"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1610

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not very long ago in January the premier of Newfoundland 
announced to everybody that there was was going to be a $30 
million deficit.  This was a great disaster.  Lo and behold two 
days later we found out that the federal government did some 
tinkering with the equalization payments.  All of a sudden he has 
$30 million in excess of his budget.  He will have a balanced 
budget.  It shows us how open to political manipulation the 
current system is.  He went ahead and called an election on the 
basis of his balanced budget.  That is ridiculous.  It is an 
insult to Canadians.  We need to have a system that is a lot more 
transparent than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that we have a Constitution that says that 
equalization should provide reasonably comparable levels of 
public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation. That 
is about as clear as it is.  In other words it is wide open to 
interpretation.  However the current government in power wants to 
structure it, it will structure it.  It does not need all the 
provinces to agree because the federal government, if it so 
deems, will go ahead and structure a side deal with one of the 
provinces.  We have side deals now with Newfoundland and Nova 
Scotia that provide different set-ups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems with the formula, which is the most 
confusing convoluted thing I have ever laid my eyes on, is when 
it talks about calculating revenues.  For instance for forestry, 
it does not take into account the cost of production.  When we go 
to the people's republic of British Columbia where it costs a 
fortune to cut a tree and compare it to what it costs to cut a 
tree in Alberta, there is a huge difference.  That is not 
reflected in the formula.  Some provinces are discriminated 
against because of the huge discrepancies in the cost of 
production.  In my judgment we have another disaster there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have problems with this piece of legislation because it 
does not take into account the other types of social spending 
that come from the federal government.  I want to give some 
examples of that.  In my judgment and in the judgment of people 
who have followed this for a lot longer than I have, we 
constantly see in Canada various programs that seem to be 
equalization programs of some sort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at employment insurance which is structured on levels of 
unemployment in particular areas.  People in Alberta have to wait 
half a year to get unemployment insurance benefits. People in 
Atlantic Canada where there are high levels of unemployment may 
have to wait 10 or 12 weeks.  It is now on an hourly basis but it 
boils down to somewhere in that range. That becomes a big 
transfer, a big equalization program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at something like the infrastructure program.  A lot of 
people did not realize that in itself was also an equalization 
program.  It was based on levels of unemployment. Again we see a 
whole bunch of money going from some provinces into other 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at regional development which is heavily skewed toward 
certain provinces.  Look at defence spending.  There is a good 
example.  All these military bases are being put in particular 
ridings not because it makes military sense, not for the nation's 
defence, but because the government wants to plough some money 
into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that we need transparency.  I would argue that we 
need a system today where we take into account all of this 
spending.  Then we ask whether or not it is an appropriate 
amount.  Maybe there needs to be a more straightforward formula. 
My leader spoke of that earlier today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to make that the central part of my speech today. 
I want to talk about how we create have provinces.  My friend 
across the way talked about the need to have ways to bring 
provinces that are currently receiving equalization into the 
mainstream so that they do become have provinces.  I agree with 
that.  We all agree with that.  We believe there should be ways 
to do that.  But I can guarantee that having income tax top 
marginal rates of 69% like they have in Newfoundland is not the 
way to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend across the way who embraces collectivism or spoke of 
collectivism in some warm way, and gave a speech about how Canada 
is one big social program, would be shocked to find out that many 
businesses do not want to set up shop in a province with marginal 
rates of 69%. 
They are scared away by high marginal tax rates.  They find it 
passing strange that an equalization program that actually 
provides incentives to provinces to have high income tax rates, 
because that is how they receive equalization payments, actually 
exists.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think he would be shocked to find that out.  But I encourage 
my friend to consider that perhaps there is a better way to make 
Atlantic Canada work better.  Maybe there is a way through 
lowering taxes to attract investment to Atlantic Canada.  That is 
why last week the Reform Party spoke of a plan to give Canadians 
$26 billion in tax relief.  My friend across the way will say 
“Oh, but you are going to cut social programs”.  Not at all. In 
fact we would increase spending on social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would cut spending for some things that Canadians do not 
consider to be very important.  We would cut spending for the 
CBC.  We think that $800 million a year spent on CBC television 
is a horrible waste.  We think that the money that currently goes 
into regional development has become a huge pork barrel industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends across the way will know that even in Atlantic Canada 
many people are extraordinarily cynical of ACOA.  They see all 
the manipulation that goes on whereby government ministers reward 
their friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out the situation in the Prime Minister's riding where 
all kinds of chicanery is taking place.  Somebody who bought a 
hotel from the Prime Minister has received a bunch of federal 
grants.  That is a little bit ridiculous.  I see my friend 
getting hot under collar, but sometimes the truth stinks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We argue that those things need to be cut.  We would like to see 
the CRTC cut.  It is a terrible waste of money.  We would like to 
see all kinds of money eliminated from the bureaucracy of 
different programs like Indian affairs.  Every year the auditor 
general pillories the department of Indian affairs for its 
wasteful expenditure of Canadians' money.  In his last report the 
auditor general chastised the department for spending $91 million 
to negotiate treaties, yet not a single treaty had been 
negotiated.  That is what goes on in the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We argue that we need to cut spending, absolutely; not in the 
high priority areas, but in those wasteful areas to which I just 
referred.  We are going to continue to push for that to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak a bit about the best way to help people across the 
country.  It is not by giving them a program.  It is not by 
becoming a huge welfare state.  It is not by embracing big 
government welfare programs like my friend across the way would 
have us do.  We think that is the wrong approach.  In fact I 
would argue that has failed in every country where it has been 
attempted.  Instead it is time to see reality and to understand 
that it is the private sector which will create the jobs.  It is 
the private sector that will create prosperity for people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The political allocation of scarce economic resources simply 
does not work.  The definition of insanity is to keep doing the 
same thing over and over again and expect to get different 
results, yet that is exactly what this government does.  Every 
year it thinks that if it just throws a little more money at the 
problem it will get better.  So it throws more money at the 
problem, but it never gets fixed.  It just keeps getting worse 
and the government cannot figure it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time that my friends across the way embraced a new 
approach.  We offer them an idea whereby we take the money that 
they currently dole out to their friends and instead leave it in 
the hands of taxpayers, entrepreneurs, investors and homemakers, 
the people who know far better than the government how to use 
that money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that Canadians after a generation of seeing taxes 
go ever upward really do deserve a tax break.  It is time for tax 
relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. finance minister spoke in the House today about how he 
wanted to give Canadians tax relief.  His department has been 
floating for weeks the idea that it wants to give Canadians a $2 
billion tax cut in the next budget.  What a joke.  What the 
minister does not mention is that this year the government is 
going to increase taxes by $2.4 billion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>CPP premiums are rising by about $1.4 billion.  Bracket creep 
takes about a billion dollars out of people's pockets every year. 
What the government trumpets as a wonderful tax cut is actually 
a tax hike in disguise, and so it has been with this government 
for five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year the government says “We are going to provide 
targeted tax relief because we are Liberals and we care”.  It is 
simply not so.  In fact since this government came to power we 
have seen taxes go ever upward.  We have seen disposable income 
fall like a stone.  Canadians have to pay $38 billion in taxes 
this year that they did not have to pay in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that Canadians can ill afford that.  It is 
interesting that as revenues for the government went up $38 
billion we saw the savings rate drop $31 billion.  Who really 
balanced the budget?  Was it the finance minister? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  My friend opposite, the junior finance 
minister, says it was.  I disagree.  I think that Canadians 
balanced it.  The finance minister balanced the budget on the 
backs of taxpayers.  He balanced it on the backs of people who 
are sitting in hallways in hospitals waiting for beds because he 
took about $20 billion out of spending for health care.  He took 
billions out of essential programs but left lots of money for his 
slush fund.  He left lots of money for ACOA.  He left lots of 
money for the departments that funded the Prime Minister's hotel 
deal.  We need to put an end to all that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about some specific ways in which we can benefit not 
only the people in Atlantic Canada and Quebec, but the people in 
provinces across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers believe that we could deliver about $26 billion in tax 
relief over the next three years if we hold the line on spending 
at $104.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Already the government is headed for a budget this year of 
around $109 billion.  It will probably be $4 or $4.5 billion over 
budget.  It was $3 billion over budget last year.  People 
probably have cause to be pretty concerned about the government 
falling into its old habits of spending like crazy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government holds the line on spending at $104.5 billion, 
that frees up a lot of money.  It frees up about $17 billion 
which could be used for debt reduction and about $26 billion 
which could be used for tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When that is broken down, it means about $342 million a year, or 
somewhere in that range, in tax relief for Newfoundland every 
year.  As competent as my friend opposite thinks he is, I can 
guarantee that the people of Newfoundland would much rather have 
that money in their own pockets than give it to him to spend for 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that the people of Atlantic Canada who would get a 
total of $1.5 billion would much rather have that money in their 
pockets than allow hon. members opposite to spend it for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the people of Ontario, who would get $10 billion 
in tax relief, would much rather have that money in their pockets 
than allow bureaucrats and politicians to spend it for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We argue that people in British Columbia, who could sorely use a 
tax break right now, would love to have billions in tax relief. 
It would mean a lot to them, especially as they toil under the 
socialist government which has done so much damage to that 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our argument is very simple.  We think that the money would be 
better used in the hands of individual taxpayers, investors and 
homemakers, rather than leaving it in the hands of bureaucrats 
and politicians who so often misuse it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me touch on some of the things that we would do to help 
Canadians.  We would eliminate the 3% and 5% surtaxes.  We would 
fully index the tax system again so that we would stop this 
automatic tax increase of a billion dollars a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would cut capital gains inclusion rates in half so that when 
people make an investment and help the economy they are not 
penalized heavily just because their investment may happen to 
keep up with inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have situations now where people invest in the economy. Their 
investment keeps up with inflation.  All of a sudden they want to 
sell it, only to find that they have not made a cent in real 
terms but that they have to pay all kinds of tax.  That is 
absolutely ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to raise personal and spousal allowances to $7,900.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We want the child care exemption to be given to all families, no 
matter how they look after their children.  We want to have a 
refundable child care credit so that people on low incomes would 
actually get a cheque in the mail if they were not paying any tax 
at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want the rate on the employment insurance fund to come to an 
end.  Instead of giving back a paltry 15% of the money that has 
been taken, money that was overpaid to the EI fund, we want to 
give it all back.  We want to give back to Canadians the entire 
overpayment because we believe it is their money in the first 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of the things we want to do.  We want to drop the 
three rates down to two rates.  If we add up all of those things 
it comes to $26 billion in tax relief.  It would mean that a lot 
of money would go into people's pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give one example as I close.  For the average family of 
four making $30,000, it would mean $4,660 in their pocket every 
year.  That is what tax relief would do for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend from Newfoundland would argue that his government 
could spend it better.  I think that family would argue with 
that.  It is time to embrace a new approach instead of continuing

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat 
Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there have been some comments made 
by members across the way that I think need to be corrected. 
There was an assertion that there was political interference in 
the budgetary deficit of the province of Newfoundland and 
Labrador that could be mysteriously re-corrected by some 
political interventions by the federal government in order to 
solve a political problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has demonstrated that he clearly does not 
understand equalization.  Therefore, when he makes these 
assertions about the effects of tax cuts and other measures, he 
is obviously talking from a very ill informed point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization works on the basis of a formula.  It is a very 
transparent, very accountable process that is defined and 
entrenched in legislation.  The payments that are given to the 
provinces over the course of time are based on the formula. 
There are adjustments to the variables which are input into the 
formula based on facts:  population statistics, growth in the 
economy, growth in the ability of the province to tax.  Those are 
the basic variables that are put into the formula, which is very 
accountable, very transparent and very upfront.  It is not 
subject to political manipulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this entire conversation hon. members opposite have been 
speaking about the positive influences and effects of a $384 
million tax cut for Newfoundland.  I would like the hon. member 
to go to Newfoundland and ask this simple question of 
Newfoundlanders and Labradorians: “Do you think that it would be 
acceptable to cut $384 million in public programs for health, 
education and social services?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to ask that question.  That 
question was asked in the provincial campaign.  The answer that 
Newfoundlanders and Labradorians gave was emphatically and 
categorically “No.  We want strong public institutions and the 
ability for people to provide for each other”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what did Labradorians and 
Newfoundlanders say to him when he cut $20 billion out of health 
care?  I would like to know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party of course would not cut spending for health 
care and social programs.  We would increase it.  We have made 
that pretty clear.  We would increase it by $2.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend across the way has asked a question and I think he 
deserves a serious answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last election campaign we laid out exactly where we would 
cut about $9 billion in government spending.  We sent it out to 
about 15 million households across Canada.  I invite my friend to 
revisit that, but I will touch on some of the highlights again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we said then, we would make cuts to the CBC.  We think that 
CBC television should be a private broadcaster.  We think it is 
time, in a day and age when there are all kinds of private 
broadcasters providing services across the country, to privatize 
the CBC.  We made that very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would make cuts to the Department of Canadian Heritage.  We 
think that all of these grants for special interest groups are 
ridiculous.  We think it is ridiculous to spend $100,000 on a 
dumb blonde joke book.  I am sure even my friends across the way 
would question whether that was a wise expenditure.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would cut all the pork barrel spending that goes on in 
regional development.  It is a very unfortunate joke on Canadian 
taxpayers when they are paying for all kinds of patronage deals 
that benefit friends of the Liberal Party.  We think that is 
wrong.  We would cut the bureaucracy of Indian affairs.  We have 
made that very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of the areas where we would cut.  If my friend 
would simply go back and review Fresh Start, he would see that we 
lay out the entire menu for him.  He could go through it and he 
could use it to guide him when he wonders again where these cuts 
would come from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final point I would make is that it is interesting to me at 
a time when the government has cut so drastically in health care, 
and even with the increases it will still be about $4 billion shy 
of where it was, that it has still managed to ratchet up overall 
spending pretty significantly, by about $4.5 billion this year 
alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member across the way.  Why is the 
government spending so much more on frivolous programs like 
millennium grants and things like that?  If the hon. member cares 
so much about health care, why is it increasing in areas like 
that when it is cutting the heart out of Canadian health care? 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the CBC is 
essential for the north because there are a lot of places private 
broadcasters will not serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My other concern is around land claims negotiations and the 
price we pay for them.  Our other alternative is to go to court. 
When we go to court that means we have no control as politicians 
or as people.  We cannot be a part of a legal process.  Therefore 
we would have absolutely no say in or any control over what we 
would pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member rather we take all our treaties to court to 
have them negotiated rather than have a process that we can 
actually be involved in? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
her good question.  We have made it very clear we would not cut 
CBC radio.  We understand that there are remote communities which 
do not have access to private broadcasters.  We have specifically 
said CBC television. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the land claims issue, we do not argue 
necessarily with the idea of having the government engage in 
treaty negotiations.  It would be nice if it could actually come 
to some kind of agreement.  After spending $91 million and not 
reaching any agreements I would come to question whether or not 
that is a very good use of taxpayers money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final point I would make on treaty negotiations is what is 
really important is that there be finality.  When a deal is 
reached we do not want to see it reopened again which is what we 
are seeing now with Treaty 8 in northern Alberta.  We think that 
is a huge mistake.  We would like to see these things settled and 
settled once and for all.  We think we owe that not only to 
natives but to Canadian taxpayers in general. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
during the member's speech when he was talking to the bill on 
equalization he referred to the employment insurance system as 
being an example of other ways in which equalization can take 
place.  He specifically said that in Alberta people had to wait a 
half year before they got employment insurance benefits whereas 
in the maritimes it was obviously much less and therefore that 
equalization was giving more to the maritime provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member like to reconsider his statement? It is 
important for Canadians to understand we have an EI system that 
is the same for all Canadians.  There are some exceptions which 
reduce benefits and reduce claim periods, but in terms of 
eligibility for benefits it is the same for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise this matter because if the member is incorrect on this 
item, how many other items in his statements can we believe? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we can make the same 
argument about equalization itself.  We could say that there are 
pockets of Alberta where the economy is not perking along like in 
Calgary and therefore they should have equalization.  I do not 
buy the member's argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Previous to 1971 when the reforms were made to employment 
insurance on the basis of regionally extended benefits previous 
we had a purer type of insurance program, a program that looked 
at individual needs and not so much at the needs of regions. 
Insurance should be something that is based on individual needs, 
not on regional needs.  When we have that we see political 
manipulation of scarce economic resources. 
We see politicians using the EI fund just like we saw in the 
recent raid on the EI fund.  We see politicians using huge piles 
of money for their own political ends.

happens when governments are given control over huge piles of 
money like has happened through employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reject the member's arguments.  I think they are false.  I 
would encourage him to consider that basing employment insurance 
on a personal insurance basis probably makes a lot more sense for 
everybody involved.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak to Bill C-65 
which renews the equalization agreement.  Like my colleague from 
Medicine Hat I am a little disappointed that the government has 
seen fit to have such a short debate and to rush something 
through the House when it knew it was coming.  It has made no 
effort to really look at what equalization payments are or at the 
need for restructuring and some massive reorganization.  It seems 
to think it can add a few band aids and every thing will be okay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-65 makes technical amendments to the formula that 
determines equalization payments.  I want to review the three 
sections.  It provides for the phasing-in of tax base changes 
over the period from April 1999 to March 31, 2004.  It adjusts 
the definitions of resource revenue and revenue to be equalized. 
It changes the minimum and maximum payment provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question that some Canadians will be asking is what exactly 
is equalization and what is it for.  I would like to review some 
of its history for Canadians who may be watching the debate this 
afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was introduced in 1957 and it was an effort to balance the 
vast disparity in potential tax bases among the provinces to 
ensure that every Canadian citizen had access to similar levels 
of social programs.  Equalization is included in the Canadian 
Constitution.  It is found in section 36 of the 1982 act.  It 
reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament and the legislatures, together with the government of 
Canada and the provincial governments, are committed to: (a) 
promoting equal opportunities for the well-being of Canadians; 
(b) furthering economic development to reduce the disparity in 
opportunities; and (c) providing essential public services of 
reasonable quality to Canadians. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 36(2) goes on to read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament and the government of Canada are committed to the 
principle of making equalization payments to ensure that 
provincial governments have sufficient revenues to provide 
reasonably comparable levels of public service at reasonably 
comparable levels of taxation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians support this concept.  Very few Canadians have 
difficulty in supporting the concept of equalization, but when 
Canadians get into the details they start to have some problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to share with them an experience I had with the unity 
panel in B.C.  In the fall of 1997 I was asked by Premier Glen 
Clark to sit on the B.C. unity panel.  It toured the province of 
British Columbia with regard to the Calgary declaration.  Its 
purpose was to gauge public support for the declaration.  The 
unity panel used various means to measure the support of British 
Columbia.  It included a mail-in questionnaire, public meetings, 
focus groups and a province-wide telephone survey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the telephone survey the unity panel asked questions about 
equalization.  I want to share some of the results.  One question 
that was asked was: Should the provinces and Canada work together 
in setting up national standards.  They felt they wanted a shared 
partnership between Canada and the provinces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question on equalization was: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has an equalization program whereby the 
four provinces receive tax dollars to allow them to provide a 
similar level of public services to those available in richer 
provinces like British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario.  Generally 
speaking, do you strongly support, somewhat approve, somewhat 
disapprove or strongly disapprove of federal equalization 
programs? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to share with the House that 37% strongly approved and 
44% somewhat approved of equalization programs.  The vast 
majority of participants supported the principle of equalization. 
To quote from the B.C. unity report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there was a great deal of reluctance to accept the 
possibility that British Columbia should, therefore, receive less 
than other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many participants commented that British Columbia's population 
has special needs itself such as its specific demographic 
characteristics, seniors and immigration, that needed more 
funding and that there should be some recognition of this 
situation in federal transfers and there should be flexibility in 
arrangements to respond to this. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was because of the results of the efforts of this B.C. unity 
panel that travelled the province that the B.C. government added 
three additional principles to the Calgary declaration: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(1)  That British Columbia supports national standards for health 
and believes that these standards are best set co-operatively by 
the federal government with the provinces; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2)  That British Columbia supports the federal government's 
equalization program and believes that for other federal 
transfers for health, education, and social programs, provinces 
should receive the same level of federal funding per person; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3)  That British Columbia believes that provinces should be 
able to assume greater responsibility in areas that are important 
to them, such as fisheries in the case of British Columbia. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This resolution passed unanimously in the B.C. legislature.  It 
is the second additional principle that is relevant today. 
British Columbians widely support the concept of equalization, 
but we have to remember that it goes far beyond this equalization 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government unfortunately has built in equalization 
bias in all of its transfer to provinces.  When it comes to the 
three so-called have provinces, B.C., Alberta and Ontario, they 
get a reduced level of transfers from the federal government. 
There is not only the formal equalization program but the 
transfers to the provinces that show discrepancies.  When we 
combine the formal equalization program with these other biases 
we get a different picture.  I want to share some of the issues 
that are evident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the province of Newfoundland 43.7% of the provincial budget 
is from transfers from the federal government.  In Nova Scotia it 
is 40.3%.  In New Brunswick it is 38.2%.  In Quebec it is 15.3%. 
In Prince Edward Island it is 36.8%.  In Manitoba it is 29.3%. 
There is heavy reliance on federal government transfers.  On the 
other hand we have Alberta with 9%, British Columbia with 8.8% 
and Ontario with 10.9% of their provincial budgets coming from 
federal transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This system of bias permeates through all the programs the 
federal government has with the provinces.  It is very evident 
with the federal spending on immigration settlement in the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me provide the House with some numbers from 1997 when I was 
the Reform Party critic of immigration.  This is the money that 
is sent to provinces to help new immigrants settle in their 
chosen home.  Quebec, which is a have not province, receives 
$90,000,000 a year.  B.C. receives $23,373,000.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Quebec which takes considerably less immigrants 
than the province of British Columbia gets three times as much 
money per capita per immigrant.  The province of Quebec gets 
$3,067 per immigrant.  The province of B.C. gets $1,000 per 
immigrant to help them settle in their chosen home. It is not 
only in the transfer payments, it is in all these other payments 
that we see the bias. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have sat in the House for five years listening to members of 
the Bloc Quebecois tell Canadians how Quebec is not getting its 
fair share out of the Canadian federation.  Yet when I look at 
the figures in the equalization program, that is not what I see. 
In the last complete fiscal year, from April 1, 1997 to March 31, 
1998, the federal government spent $8.987 billion on 
equalization, almost $9 billion, of which $4.177 billion or 46.5% 
of the equalization program went to Quebec. It would appear to 
me, although we hear many complaints from the Bloc, that Quebec 
has done quite well in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk in billions and millions of dollars, it is quite 
easy for the eyes of the viewers back home watching this debate 
to glaze over. It is incomprehensible to them. I would like to 
relate what we are talking about on a more individual basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When going through the website looking at the various programs 
that are provided to various provinces, I was struck by some 
differences.  In viewing the Quebec government's website, I came 
across a wonderful program that is available to all Quebec 
children under the age of 10. Every child under the age of 10 in 
Quebec has access to free dental coverage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the province of British Columbia that is not the case.  In 
British Columbia the parents are responsible for the dental care 
of their children.  In effect the have province of British 
Columbia is helping the have-not province of Quebec to provide a 
health program to its children that is not available to the 
children in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia sees it as somewhat unfair that it is expected 
to have less and not to have the same advantages and the same 
level of care as a have-not province.  It sees its money going to 
allow a have-not province to have better services and better care 
for its children.  Is this equal and fair? I think many British 
Columbians would say no, it is not. This is only one example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go to the example of the cost of universities.  This 
country has three so-called have provinces.  In 1998 
<I>Maclean's</I> reviewed the universities in a special issue.  It 
indicated that there were 24 universities in Canada's three have 
provinces.  The average tuition fee in those have provinces was 
$3,581.  By comparison in Quebec where there are seven 
universities, the average tuition fee was $2,109 for Quebec 
residents.  It amounts to 60% less in cost for a student from 
Quebec to go to university than a student in the three have 
provinces.  Even when it charges more for out of province 
students, it comes to $56 less than the average of the three have 
provinces.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again we have a situation where the three have provinces, 
the provinces that contribute to the equalization program, are 
not getting the same benefits out of Confederation that the 
have-not provinces receive.  It is a question of a level playing 
field and a lack of understanding why the provinces that are 
always putting in get fewer services from the government and why 
we are always being asked to pay more for those services than the 
have-not provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbians ask if this is fair.  Is this equal?  Does 
the equalization program mean that the have provinces will give 
money to the have-not provinces to provide services that they do 
not have themselves? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the province of New Brunswick which uses the 
largesse, the money it gets from the have provinces, to subsidize 
businesses to move to New Brunswick.  British Columbia lost some 
of its UPS people and offices because the money it sent to New 
Brunswick was used to subsidize the businesses to move out of 
British Columbia to New Brunswick.  For some reason British 
Columbians do not think it is fair that their money should be 
used to take jobs away from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The largest flaw in the equalization program is that it has lost 
sight of what it was supposed to be about.  It is about providing 
reasonably comparable levels of public service at reasonably 
comparable levels of taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The complexities and intricacies of equalization are an 
accountant's dream.  They probably cannot believe this 
equalization formula, how it is derived and how it is used. The 
basis of the formula looks at 33 tax elements of the economies of 
five provinces:  Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and 
British Columbia.  It tries to estimate how much revenue the 
province can raise in each category.  This may work if every 
province had the same kind of tax system but they do not. They 
are all different.  It also does not take into account some of 
the geographic differences in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this bill the formula has been amended so that forestry 
revenues will no longer be based on the volume of wood harvested 
but changed to the value of production.  Like my hon. colleague 
from Medicine Hat mentioned, this formula does not take into 
account the cost of production to obtain the forestry revenues. 
It costs significantly more to harvest trees in the rugged 
mountainous terrain of British Columbia than it does to cut the 
same value of trees anywhere else in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly the equalization formula does not take into account 
the costs of providing services in each province.  Once again let 
us compare the cost of building 100 kilometres of highway in 
British Columbia to the cost of building 100 kilometres of 
highway in Saskatchewan.  The disparity in costs seems to be 
irrelevant to the formula.  The government seems to think the 
cost of delivering services to Canadians is the same everywhere 
and that is just not so. Because B.C. has the potential to raise 
more money, it not only has to fund its own highways by itself 
but it also has to contribute to the building of the highway in 
Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that there is a grave need for change in the 
equalization program and Bill C-65 just provides more tinkering. 
It does not address the real problem.  I would suggest that the 
real problem is why does a country like Canada have seven 
have-not provinces and only three have provinces?  This is what 
this issue is all about and what needs to be dealt with in the 
discussion of equalization programs.

Canadians must have access to the same level of health care, 
education and social services regardless of the province that 
they live in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we should also be honest about the program.  In the new 
Canada act we recommended changes to the federal-provincial 
fiscal relations and I want to quickly go through those.  One is 
to make all payments to the provinces under jointly funded 
programs in the form of equal per capita grants.  Another is to 
address disparities and regional opportunities through a single 
equalization cash transfer based on the relation of the per 
capita gross domestic product of a recipient province to the per 
capita gross domestic product of Canada. I would like to remind 
the House of the third element that the Leader of the Opposition 
brought up earlier, by recommending broad based tax reductions to 
give the citizens of all provinces additional money to spend, and 
aid in improving all provincial economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the biggest flaw in Canada's equalization 
payments is that it is only looking at the symptoms and not the 
ailment itself.

Order 38 to inform the House that the questions to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, APEC Inquiry; the hon. 
member for Churchill, Aboriginal Affairs; and the hon. member for 
Winnipeg Centre, Employment Insurance. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the member's comments with interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised that someone did not jump up to make note that 
the pants of the member for Medicine Hat were in flames as a 
result of some of the whoppers he delivered to the House. 
Interestingly enough I found the same kind of attitude coming 
from the Reform Party again in the comments of the member who 
just spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about immigration.  She talked about numbers, 
here is how much per capita in Quebec, here is how much per 
capita in another province and then just asked the rhetorical 
question is that fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The duty of members of parliament is not simply to raise 
spectres but to convince the House and others that they have done 
their homework and that they have made sufficient inquiry so that 
any obvious reasons for differentials would be taken into 
account.  They are not to raise those spectres and somehow leave 
everyone hanging as to why, what reasonable explanation could 
there be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member knows that the legislation before the House is 
renewing the equalization program for another five years and that 
the basic elements of the program have been reaffirmed by two 
years of consultations with all of the provinces and the federal 
government. Does the member know better than each and every one 
of the provincial representatives at the table discussing the 
elements of our equalization program?  The important element here 
is that this member has only raised to the House questions which 
she has not attempted to answer herself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member would look, for instance, at the whole area where 
she was Quebec bashing and was against the whole issue of 
bilingualism and the importance of our official languages in 
Canada.  She did not even inquire whether or not the cost of 
providing services ostensibly in both official languages in that 
province had a significant amount to do with that and 
furthermore, that providing those support services with regard to 
immigration was also to provide support to the rest of the 
provinces which also have an obligation to provide those services 
in one of the two official languages on the basis of need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something going on here which the member did not give 
credit for.  The member did not explain it and did not attempt to 
explain it. Not only that, the member did not attempt to inquire. 
All she wanted to do was to raise spectres about inadequacies 
which she believes are there.  Each and every premier and the 
federal government do not agree.  The member should explain 
herself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will certainly explain 
myself.  I am sorry the member did not listen to my speech.  He 
only picked out points that he wanted to challenge me on, but let 
me explain.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The point at hand is that the equalization program is supported 
by Canadians.  It is a fair program and the understanding of it 
is supported by the Reform Party.  We believe in equalization, 
the purpose of which is to bring the provinces to the same level 
of being able to provide social services and health care.  We and 
Canadians have a problem when the federal government brings that 
equalization bias into every program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By no means was I using Quebec as an example other than as a 
demonstration of how Quebec, which has fewer immigrants needing 
resettlement than British Columbia, gets three times as much 
money.  Quebec gets the benefit of the investment dollars from 
the immigrants but the investors move to British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although Quebec gets the benefit of the investment dollars and 
the $90 million a year even though it does not have the 
immigrants to support, British Columbia receives one-third of 
what Quebec receives although the majority of immigrants move to 
British Columbia.  British Columbia does not have the benefit of 
the investment dollars to create economic growth which could be 
used to create the money to support them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was using that as an example of the equalization bias that is 
carried over in every transfer program the government has for the 
provinces.  I do not apologize for that.  I would like them to 
explain to Albertans, British Columbians and Ontarians, people 
from their own province, how they can justify always making those 
provinces pay more to get less. That is not equalization.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am always 
very interested in what my Reform Party colleague has to say. 
She does her research well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I would like to draw to her attention a few of the concerns 
that sprang to mind as I was listening to her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that Quebec's share of equalization payments, aimed 
at evening out the ability of the various provinces to provide 
services for their people, has unfortunately dipped dramatically 
in recent years. But that is only one facet of the movement of 
money between Quebec and the other provinces and the central 
government here in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other is the taxes paid to the central government and then 
used by it to purchase goods and services or to fund research 
and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fact, and there are figures to prove it, that the 
government spends the lion's share of its dollars in Ontario, 
not in Quebec or in the prairies. 
It does not spend the lion's share of its dollars in the 
Atlantic provinces, but here in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That leaves us with the paradoxical situation of Quebec sending 
approximately $30 billion every year to Ottawa and receiving $30 
billion back.  Unfortunately, while Quebec is forking over 
taxpayers' hard-earned dollars, its share of goods and services 
falls well short of its share of taxes, while Ontario's exceeds 
it by about 15%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the transfer payments kick in to even things up.  But now, 
and this is the question I put to my colleague, we have the sad 
situation where Quebec is not receiving job creation money, but 
transfer payments instead.  The same is happening in the 
Atlantic provinces, and that is what is unfair.  The only 
solution, obviously, is for Quebec to become a sovereign nation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if my colleague from 
Quebec is concerned about not getting any contracts or 
procurement from the federal government, he should try living in 
British Columbia where we get a very small amount in return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Ontario gets it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  There is no question that Ontario gets 
the largesse of government.  It is no wonder with 99 members 
sitting opposite representing Ontario.  The government is Ontario 
and that is part of our problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share with the member from the province of Quebec that some of 
our concern is that although Quebec gets 46.5% of equalization 
transfer payments to level the playing field, that kind of bias 
is in other programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the immigration program.  The province of Quebec 
gets a very large share of the settlement dollars which other 
provinces do not get. Quebec may feel it is hard done by and I do 
not argue that Ontario gets the largesse of government, but B.C. 
is certainly far worse off than the province of Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I apologize in advance that my voice is not as robust as usual; I 
am suffering from laryngitis.  There is simply too much to shout 
at the government about.  It is difficult to maintain one's 
voice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise today to address the bill dealing with 
equalization.  At the outset and contrary to some of the comments 
by members opposite, the Reform Party supports the principle.  We 
object to the equalization which is entrenched in the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what some members opposite might have us believe, I 
and others in my party share the belief that Canadians from coast 
to coast should have access to generally comparable standards of 
public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation.  We 
have some significant differences with the current structure of 
equalization which is perpetuated in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some very serious objections to the process by which 
Bill C-65 came before us.  Equalization is an automatic 
entitlement program, a statutory program, which causes us to 
spend $8 billion a year annually out of the public treasury with 
no specific annual grant by parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather, it is an amount that is automatically included in each 
year's federal budget and automatically spent out of the federal 
treasury under the authority of the statute we are discussing and 
amending today.  It is an automatic statutory entitlement 
program.  I have a very large problem in principle with programs 
of this nature because they do an end run around normal 
safeguards, checks and balances of accountability in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important we not create programs of this nature that 
simply proceed on auto pilot year after year spending literally 
billions and billions of tax dollars without a close methodical 
serious review of their cost, their design and their 
implications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have such a methodical review in the debate on Bill 
C-65 before us today.  Quite to the contrary, the government gave 
the House only three days sitting notice that the bill would be 
debated today, a bill which will essentially authorize roughly 
$35 billion in expenditures over the next five years.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the largest expenditures of the federal 
government which parliament authorizes.  Yet we have quite a 
remarkable circumstance of being given three days to prepare for 
debate on an extremely complex and complicated bill that deals 
with a formula which, as colleagues have said, nobody really 
understands expect for a handful of specialist accountants in the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is attempting to collapse debate by not putting 
up any other speakers.  It is so serious about this $8.5 billion 
public expenditure that I think it has had one prepared speaker 
on the bill and another who just stood and gave us 20 minutes of 
hot air.  That is how serious it is about a parliamentary review 
of an $8.5 billion expenditure.  It is shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we ought not to rush through the automatic rubber 
stamping of this huge public expenditure every five years as we 
are today.  Rather we ought to calm down and make a serious, 
slow, parliamentary public review of the design of the entire 
equalization system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ought to be allowed to have the bill go before a 
parliamentary committee for extensive hearings, to bring forward 
academic experts, to speak to the entire concept and design of 
equalization, and to hear from Canadians on how they feel this 
matches with their ideas of social and fiscal equity.  We will 
not do that.  We will just ram it through yet once more, treating 
parliament and the people who represent Canadians as a kind of 
rubber stamp in the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of experts would have a lot to add to the debate. In 
October the C. D. Howe Institute produced an excellent, 
thoughtful study on the entire balance of fiscal federalism with 
emphasis on equalization.  It was authored by an esteemed 
professor from the University of Alberta, Dr. Paul Boothe and 
sponsored by Koch Oil.  Other studies have been done by people 
like eminent fiscal expert Professor Thomas Courchesne at Queen's 
University.  We ought to be receiving the benefit of the 
expertise of these people and not just rushing through it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the many problems with this formula is that it is 
extraordinarily complex.  A very simple principle involved in 
responsible government is that spending and taxing decisions 
should be transparent.  They should be easy to see and understand 
at least by a reasonably well informed layman.  I do not think 
there is a reasonably well informed layman in the country who is 
not an expert in the Byzantine rules surrounding equalization 
that really understands the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the auditor general pointed out that among the many 
problems with the equalization formula is the inclusion of 
property taxes in the assessment of the average tax rate in 
various provinces.  It is incredibly difficult to get to the 
bottom of that.  The auditor general in his 1997 report flagged 
as a very serious problem the inclusion of property tax in the 
formula for 33 tax sources.  The finance department responded by 
saying that it would address the issue of property taxes in the 
renewal process, that is in this bill.  There is nothing in Bill 
C-65 dealing with this one very complicated element of 
equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem is that the government tells us that this is all 
governed by a clean, clear mathematical formula but that is not 
the case.  For political reasons we have ended up establishing a 
roof and a floor of equalization transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at Newfoundland which is going through a period of 
considerable growth and suppose that it continued or in fact 
doubled or tripled over the next couple of years.  Newfoundland 
would find its unemployment rate tumbling down.  Let us hope that 
happens.  Revenues would be flush in the provincial treasury but 
Newfoundland would still receive substantial transfer payments 
under equalization based on the notion that from a given year to 
a given year the reduction in equalization can only be <I>x</I> 
amount.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the formula states that one province should no longer be 
considered a have not province and should be regarded as a have 
province, that province would continue to receive the benefit of 
a transfer from hardworking taxpayers in other parts of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, if my province of Alberta, which seems to be a 
perpetual have province, were to suddenly suffer the fate of an 
enormous reduction in commodity prices, energy prices and 
agricultural commodity prices and suddenly were to fall into a 
regional recession, we would not suddenly receive a large 
equalization transfer payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at British Columbia. Today it finds itself in the 
worst recession ever since 1981, a very serious and deep 
recession.  B.C. taxpayers are having to work harder and longer 
than they otherwise would in order to send extra revenues into 
the federal treasury.  Those revenues are then spun around in 
this enormous costly machine we call Ottawa and sent out to parts 
of the country which are actually growing and which have 
considerable growth rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Family incomes are on the rise in some parts of the country. 
They are on the decline in British Columbia yet those hardworking 
families, because of the bizarre mess of the equalization 
formula, end up having to pay net into the system so that others 
can receive the benefit.  I think that is just plain wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need is a system that is transparent and accountable and 
one that ordinary people can understand.  We also need a system 
that is fair.  I have talked about the unfairness inherent in the 
system today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the points that Dr. Paul Boothe has raised in his many 
studies on this issue is that if the objective in equalization is 
equity, if it is to establish a modicum of social equity through 
fiscal transfers, then the equalization plan as currently 
designed is surely not the way to do it.  It takes money from 
every taxpayer in British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario, every 
single person who pays GST, federal income tax or pays in any way 
into the federal treasury.  Even if they are below the poverty 
line, as hundreds of thousands of them are, they all end up 
making a net contribution to the fiscal transfer through 
equalization to even the highest income taxpayers in the 
so-called seven have not provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, I have a hard time believing in one of the 
wealthiest countries in the world, in a country that enjoys a 
level of prosperity and a standard of living almost unparalleled 
to any other country at any other time in human history, that 
seven of our ten provinces are purportedly have not provinces.  I 
think that is part of the problem with the formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, a single mom in my riding who has a minimum 
wage job and is earning $14,000 a year and is trying to raise a 
couple of children on that meagre, paltry sum is still paying 
federal income tax because of the enormous equity in our tax 
system.  She is paying federal income tax, the goods and services 
tax and other taxes which come to us in this parliament. What we 
are going to do under Bill C-65 is take some of the money from 
that single mother in Calgary Southeast, spin it around in this 
bureaucracy in Ottawa and then send it out to subsidize the 
delivery of social programs, including health care, which accrues 
in part to the benefit of billionaires who might live in another 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One could say that my low income constituents, because they 
happen by accident of geography to live in what is deemed by this 
formula to be a have province are forced to pay, according to Dr. 
Boothe, 9% more in taxes than they otherwise would in order to 
benefit the Desmarais family, the Bronfmans of Montreal or the 
Irvings in New Brunswick, or the Purdues, or the Crosbies in St. 
John's, Newfoundland. 
That is not equity; that is inequity. This is not how to design a 
system of social equity.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to help people who really need help, if we really 
want to equalize opportunity and living standards across the 
country, we need to come up with a system of equalization that is 
sensitive to income, not to the arbitrariness of region or 
geography or the accident of where people happen to live, but 
with respect to the very real circumstances of their standard of 
living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we propose that there should be a much clearer per 
capita transfer from the federal government to the provinces for 
the various social programs and, I believe, an equalization 
system on top of that which should be designed on the basis of 
individual transfers.  What does that mean?  That means we should 
look to the tax system which can respond to the different levels 
of income that people have as the way to transfer wealth in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Really that is what this is all about.  If we get all the 
bureaucratic gobbledegook, legalese and accounting gimmicks out 
of the way and what we are talking about in this bill is how we 
transfer wealth from those who have a lot of it to those who have 
not much of it. I submit we do not do that by penalizing the 
lower income taxpayers in Alberta, B.C. and Ontario to the 
financial and fiscal advantage of higher income taxpayers in the 
rest of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Medicine Hat mentioned that an Alberta family 
that earns $30,000 to $40,000 pays 9% more in taxes to the 
federal government than it otherwise would, whereas its 
counterpart family in P.E.I. generates 20% more income.  These 
are families with the same standard of living.  They have the 
same jobs. They are working just as hard.  The family in P.E.I. 
is not living in poverty and is no less able to provide the 
necessities of life than that family in Calgary, Medicine Hat, 
Toronto or Scarborough, but it gets the 20% advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reminds me of a study that was conducted some years ago by 
the Canada West Foundation under the auspices of Professor Robert 
Mansell, an economist at the University of Calgary.  It was the 
first real effort to quantify the net impact of what we call 
fiscal federalism, all of these transfers back and forth between 
Ottawa and the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was in about 1992, several years ago.  Professor Mancel 
found in 1992 that the total cumulative cost of fiscal federalism 
to the province of Alberta, my province, was nearly $150 billion 
since 1960.  That is to say that because of equalization, because 
of other transfers and things like the national energy program, 
the federal government had managed to extract $150 billion more 
out of Alberta than Albertans received in benefits or transfers 
from the federal government. There was a huge net transfer out of 
British Columbia and Ontario, not nearly as large.  I think it 
was in the neighbourhood of $20 billion for British Columbia and 
$30 billion to $40 billion for Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about massive transfers of wealth largely based 
on geography.  I just do not think that is equitable or fair in a 
society which is trying to assist those who need the help the 
most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem with the current equalization system is the 
classic welfare trap, as it has become known by sociologists. As 
a way of explaining it, the welfare trap is if we subsidize 
something we are likely to get more of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current equalization plan essentially subsidizes provinces 
which do not have high rates of economic growth.  It subsidizes 
provinces which keep their tax rates low.  Provinces such as New 
Brunswick give special tax deals to corporations to locate there, 
as my colleague from South Surrey—White Rock—Langley pointed 
out, yet they still receive the benefit of equalization.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It creates this perverse situation where if a province raises 
its taxes or generates more economic growth, it will be deemed to 
be a have province.  Based on the Byzantine equalization formula 
its transfer from the federal government under equalization will 
decrease.  We are penalizing success.  We are in a sense creating 
a perverse incentive for regional economies not to succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting that any premier or his cabinet would set 
out to generate low rates of economic growth in order to avoid a 
cut in its equalization payments.  I am not suggesting that for a 
moment.  Surely the provincial finance minister realizes in the 
back of his mind when he is planning his annual budget that if he 
raises certain tax rates and if on the other hand they generate 
significant growth, that the province's equalization payment from 
the federal government is going to be cut.  That is inevitably 
going to be a factor.  We have entrenched this kind of welfare 
trap into federal-provincial fiscal arrangements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all of those and many other reasons, I am vigorously opposed 
to this bill.  I do not think it is in the best interests of 
social equity in Canada nor is it equalizing opportunity or 
creating greater harmony between the provinces and individuals 
within this wealthy and diverse country.  I hope my colleagues 
will look more closely at this issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have a couple of comments on 
what the hon. member said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One comment concerns the property tax issue.  He is correct that 
the auditor general has flagged it as an issue of concern.  The 
federal government has indicated that the property tax issue is 
one that the provinces and the federal government are continuing 
to discuss. It is a bit of a difficult situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some provinces were recommending that we go to market value 
assessment although it does not necessarily allow a province to 
generate the same type of revenue when we compare the market 
value assessment of a home in British Columbia equivalent to a 
home in Quebec for instance.  That has some flaws in it as well. 
For the information of the hon. member, the property tax issue 
would remain on the agenda until there was a solution that is 
acceptable to the provinces and to the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also went on to talk about the impact on British 
Columbia that commodity prices are having and why British 
Columbia is not receiving any sort of equalization given the 
economic turmoil it is going through.  I advise the hon. member 
that there is a fiscal stabilization program. The federal 
government compensates even the have provinces if their revenues 
decline more than 5% due to economic circumstances. Even for the 
have provinces there is a safety net with respect to drops in 
revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said that equalization provides a disincentive 
for provinces to raise revenues.  It is hard to believe that a 
have-not province would take into consideration the fact that it 
is receiving equalization and based on that receipt of 
equalization that it would not engage in any type of economic 
activity, that it would not want to create employment for its 
people. I dispute the argument that equalization is a 
disincentive to provincial economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I offer the opportunity to the hon. member to speak to that, to 
put himself in the shoes of a provincial finance minister or 
premier who would say “I am not going to work in partnership 
with businesses in my community because we are receiving 
equalization. We do not want any sort of economic development in 
this province until we have no more equalization and then we will 
engage in economic development”.  I just do not follow that 
argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Madam Speaker, my colleague from Stoney 
Creek does not follow the argument because he did not listen to 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect, I said explicitly that I did not believe for a 
moment that any provincial finance minister sat down and 
contrived ways not to generate economic or revenue growth in 
order to avoid the reduction in federal equalization payments 
that might result.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I said that it does put them in a difficult position. 
Let us take one concrete example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Quebec maintains substantially lower corporate 
tax rates than the province of Alberta.  I am all in favour of 
tax competition in the federation.  I think it is great.  The 
problem is that if the Quebec finance minister raises that tax 
rate he will likely lose a corresponding amount of revenue or 
even more revenue out of the federal equalization transfer.  So 
he is much less likely to make that policy change, which means 
that essentially Alberta, Ontario and B.C. businesses are 
subsidizing artificially low corporate tax rates in the province 
of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting that the provinces should end up 
constructing their entire fiscal and economic policy to avoid a 
reduction in federal transfers.  I am saying that we are creating 
a perverse incentive and it is not a good thing.  If we move in 
the direction that I am advocating, which is to create a system 
of transfers that are sensitive to individuals and their income 
regardless of the accidents of geography, that would avoid the 
kind of disincentives which exist in the current system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the member is debating Bill C-65, which has to do with 
equalization payments.  I know that he is the finance spokesman 
for his party and is well aware of the fundamental principles, 
one of which is that on a province by province basis we do not 
take individual provincial tax rates into account but rather the 
average of five provinces.  It would be very difficult for any 
province to structure tax rates which would allow it to maintain 
equalization payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, I was astounded by the answer that was given to the 
question posed by the parliamentary secretary.  The insinuation 
by the member was that equalization is a disincentive.  He denied 
it and then he went on to explain how it is a disincentive.  It 
is sucking and blowing at the same time.  He cannot have it both 
ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question to the member is simple.  Does he believe that the 
equalization program, agreed upon by all of the provinces and the 
federal government following two years of consultation, is a 
disincentive for growth in a province which would otherwise have 
opportunities for jobs?  Does the member believe a province would 
turn down opportunities for economic growth simply to maintain 
equalization payments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Madam Speaker, to be clear, I believe 
that it can act as a disincentive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, I do not believe that provincial governments 
necessarily respond by electing policies which slow growth or 
revenue.  However, it is unfortunate that it can have the 
unintended consequence of penalizing provinces that see 
significant growth.  It is an unfortunate outcome of this kind of 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the member's point on an individual tax in an 
individual province, yes, the five province average which takes 
into account 33 different criteria is the average against which 
each individual province's fiscal load is measured in the 
determination of whether it qualifies for equalization transfers. 
In the instance I raised, the level of revenues that the province 
of Quebec generates from corporate taxes is a factor in its 
overall fiscal load as compared to the five province average. 
This system does create a situation where provinces can maintain 
artificially low levels of taxation, levels of taxation which 
would definitely be higher if there were no equalization 
payments.  That is the whole point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some cases the provinces are able to maintain much lower 
levels of taxation in order to create de facto subsidies.  I 
raised the case of New Brunswick which provides all sorts of 
corporate tax holidays for people who locate their businesses 
there.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I am in favour of tax competition, but I am not in favour 
of a system where the federal government gives a financial 
advantage to those provinces which use those kinds of tax levers 
in their competition to attract business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Madam Speaker, 
following on the whole issue of the tax question, has the member 
given consideration to the benefits received by a province that 
engages in economic growth and job creation?  Does he believe 
they are simply dollar for dollar with the equalization payments 
or does he believe that the benefits to a province would greatly 
exceed the value which it would otherwise receive under the 
equalization program? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would admit that it is 
possible, but I would also admit that it is possible that 
provinces take into account the loss of equalization revenues 
that they would receive if they reduced taxes or increased 
growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a problem and that is why I recommend my idea of 
transferring to individuals on the basis of income and need and 
not to the provinces on the basis of geography. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
this is my first speech of 1999.  I will begin by wishing my 
colleagues and all of the constituents of Calgary East a happy 
new year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we approach the new millennium Canadians are looking to their 
elected representatives, and especially the government, for 
visionary and bold leadership.  The role of the official 
opposition is to point out to Canadians when their government 
does not meet these expectations.  With this in mind, I rise 
today to voice my concern over Bill C-65.  I do so because I am 
convinced that this piece of legislation does not address the 
economic inequalities which exist among the provinces in our 
federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept and the intent of provincial equalization payments 
in order to guarantee all Canadians comparable services and 
standards of living is indeed a noble goal.  My party supports 
this concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform members who have spoken today have made the point very 
clear that we support the concept of equalization and of 
Canadians having a guarantee of comparable services and 
standards across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of every government, including the federal government, 
is to ensure that the equality of all Canadians is guaranteed. 
That is the cornerstone of my party's policy.  Therefore, why are 
we opposed to this legislation?  This legislation falls short of 
achieving this goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What amazes me is that after so many years of experience—and we 
have had this program for close to 40 years—one would think that 
this government would have learned to use our financial resources 
more effectively.  However, what we have before us today is a 
status quo piece of legislation which is flawed and does nothing 
but pour more money into this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do that?  Every program this government introduces costs 
more and more, while Canadians are burdened with oppressive tax 
rates and coping with the crisis in our health care system.  Can 
the government not use taxpayers' money more prudently? 
Apparently not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also amazed to learn that in a country rated as one of the 
best and richest in the world we have seven have not provinces 
and three have provinces.  Why is 70% of the country made up of 
have not provinces?  It is difficult to understand. 
One can readily understand a province needing assistance when an 
important sector of an economic activity collapses.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The current fisheries crises on the east and west coasts require 
attention and the injection of resources.  The federal government 
should intervene to ensure that Canadians living in these regions 
do not suffer undue hardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that being said, the systemic equalization program that 
we are discussing today is inefficient, a waste of resources and 
fails to address the underlying problem of regional economic 
disparities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning the Leader of the Official Opposition and my 
colleagues outlined some of the major problems and flaws in this 
program.  Let me highlight some of them again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The formula for determining the distribution of funds is overly 
complex and convoluted.  It is based almost entirely on 
assumptions and not on hard facts or statistics.  The current 
program ends up pitting province against province and results in 
resentment and conflict, the haves versus the have nots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no accountability, leaving the entire process open to 
political manipulation and bureaucratic interference.  It 
penalizes provinces which display industriousness and innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to elaborate on my last point.  In my home province 
of Alberta the cornerstone of our prosperity has been the oil and 
natural gas sectors.  We are and always have been proud to share 
these resources with our fellow Canadians despite the 
introduction of the unfair and discriminatory national energy 
program during the early 1980s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today oil prices are quite low.  This has led to hard times and 
layoffs in the oil patch.  However, due to the resilience of 
Albertans and their government, Alberta is not facing an economic 
crisis.  This is because Alberta has diversified its economy to 
avoid such situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government could learn much from the Government of 
Alberta.  It could also take some pointers from the Government of 
Ontario.  The Ontario economy is booming through low levels of 
taxation and job growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question still remains:  What are we to do with this 
inherently flawed equalization program?  The official opposition 
suggests a new approach.  For starters, let us discuss a new 
approach to equalization through open and honest debate in 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are supposed to be the custodians of the public purse.  It is 
up to us to find cost effective ways to ensure that all Canadians 
have comparable services.  We must also eliminate the 
arbitrariness of the current program and eliminate bureaucratic 
interference.  We must create a transparent and accountable 
manner of addressing regional inequalities.  This could be 
achieved through a simpler formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition's new Canada act proposes two basic 
reforms which have been outlined by speakers from the official 
opposition.  I am going to repeat them so that members opposite 
will understand what we are trying to say.  They are: the equal 
treatment of all Canadian citizens with per capita grants to 
provinces for shared cost programs, and a single equalization 
grant based on a macro indicator of per capita provincial GDP 
compared to per capita national GDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are respected around the world for their generosity 
and desire to help others.  The citizens of our country are 
compassionate people who will go to great lengths and sacrifices 
to ensure that their neighbours are well taken care of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this government should not take this goodwill and 
generosity for granted.  I am sorry to report that our current 
method of equalization takes advantage of the compassion inherent 
in Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by stating that what is needed is a frank and 
open discussion in parliament over the nature of equalization 
payments in our confederation.  I humbly submit that the Reform 
Party's new Canada act proposals merit serious consideration in 
the debate over the equalization program in our country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, first and foremost the Canada act to which the member 
refers is a misnomer.  This is not legislation.  This is merely a 
proposal on the part of the Reform Party.  If that party were 
very serious about it, it would introduce it as legislation, 
possibly as a private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take the member to task slightly in his 
suggestion that the way to correct or to reform the equalization 
process is to treat all Canadians equally.  The problem with that 
concept is that there is great disparity across the country.  In 
fact Canadians do not have equality of opportunity either in 
terms of their resources or their industrial base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member suggested that 70% of Canada is have not because 
seven provinces are recipients of equalization payments and three 
are the actual ones that give out the equalization payments. This 
illustrates the weakness in the submission in the Canada act that 
the key is to treat everyone equally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, 70% of Canada does not quite describe the situation 
when the member was talking merely about provinces.  The three 
have provinces probably account for 80% or 90% of the actual 
industrial and resource base of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member perhaps reconsider his approach to treating 
everyone equally and consider the disparity of opportunity that 
exists among Canadians rather than ignoring the inequalities 
among us all? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am extremely happy that 
my colleague asked a couple of questions and made some comments. 
We will introduce the new Canada act when we are over there and 
they are over here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second factor is that under no circumstances will we give up 
the cornerstone of the policy that all Canadians and all 
provinces are equal.  How did we suddenly come to recognize the 
factor that 70% of the provinces are have nots?  It was from the 
formula those members came up with that is so complex nobody can 
understand it.  People in my province cannot understand this 
formula.  It is they who have created have not provinces versus 
have provinces.  The Reform Party has stated that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with equalization.  We agree with the policy that all 
Canadians are equal, but we are asking for a better allocation of 
resources like we have proposed.  Those members must have been 
listening to what we have said about how the equalization program 
should work. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened intently to my colleague's speech.  One thing 
he did not talk about was a provision in the new act to tax 
casino profits.  The federal government has realized that some 
tax dollars are being generated in gaming whether we talk about 
casinos or VLTs or whatever.  I know VLTs have become quite a 
contentious issue in Alberta, the member's home province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member share with us whether he thinks there is a 
taxable net benefit to society?  We have Gamblers Anonymous and 
the social ramifications of family break-ups and so on that are 
being caused.  Does the member really consider that the federal 
government will see a net taxable benefit in that regard?  I know 
Saskatchewan is struggling with the concept of whether there is 
anything there that is taxable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a very good 
point.  I am sorry to see that it was introduced.  The member is 
right that my province is struggling with it.  I personally 
believe that VLTs, as has been done in my province, should only 
be in casinos where those who want to go there can go.  They 
should not be accessible to the general public.  The member is 
right.  I do not agree.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was intrigued by the 
member's suggestion that the new Canada act will not be 
introduced until the Reform Party forms the government.  I would 
suggest that the new Canada act may never be introduced at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also suggest that he kindly consider calling it 
something other than an act which suggests that it is already 
legislation that has passed.  He could call it a bill but it has 
not actually been submitted before parliament.  Would the Reform 
Party be up front and call it what it is, which is simply a 
proposal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Canadians who will decide 
who will be sitting on that side.  I rest assured that Canadians 
will ensure that if the Liberals carry on with heavy taxation and 
continue the health care crisis they will on this side pretty 
soon.  Let us not worry about that.  We will leave it to the 
decision of Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to express 
opposition to Bill C-65, an act to amend the Federal-Provincial 
Fiscal Arrangements Act.  Many of my colleagues have spoken very 
well from different angles and I shall be looking at some of the 
technicalities in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subject matter of the bill is commonly referred to as the 
federal-provincial equalization payment arrangement.  Every five 
years since 1957 the federal government through the finance 
department reviews the equalization program.  Bill C-65 deals 
with the period from 1999 to the year 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the equalization program is to equalize the 
provincial revenue raising capacity which enables provinces to 
provide reasonably comparable levels of the public services at 
reasonably comparable levels of taxation.  In the absence of 
equalization payments wealthier provinces would be able to 
provide more services to their residents than poorer provinces 
with the same level of taxation.  The equalization program is 
important to the Canadian Confederation.  This program is only as 
good as the process that allows it to keep pace with the 
provincial tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the process.  The key element in the equalization 
formula is the representative tax system commonly called RTS. The 
RTS is a hypothetical tax system which is representative of the 
actual systems of the separate provinces.  The key to success 
rests on how well the RTS reflects provincial tax systems.  The 
RTS ought to be comprehensive, representative, accurate and 
appropriately categorized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RTS should include all revenue sources used to support 
public services comprehensively.  Also a partial coverage of the 
revenue sources yields a biased picture of relative fiscal 
capacities of the provinces.  The RTS should use definitions of 
tax bases that reflect the tax structure actually used by the 
provinces to reflect what governments actually do.  It should not 
represent imaginary, unfair or unrealistic measures.  It should 
be representative of the actual tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The data used to measure the various tax bases must be as 
accurate as possible for it to be a reliable measure.  The items 
in the RTS that make up a category or revenue source should have 
common characteristics, the ability to be taxed at a similar rate 
and should be appropriately categorized. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1755"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance department currently uses such criteria for its 
assessment of the RTS but nowhere is it explicitly set out.  The 
finance department has not formalized the set of principles to 
guide its review of the RTS. It is necessary to arrive at a 
common way of estimating the tax base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many of the 33 revenue sources used by the department the 
bases are not straightforward and no consensus exists.  I will 
give six examples to prove what I am saying.  For example, some 
provinces calculate their payroll taxes on the total payroll of a 
business while others tax only a portion above a certain 
threshold.  Still other provinces charge no tax at all. For the 
purpose of RTS the base chosen across all provinces must be 
common. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For sales taxes the base used in the RTS is no longer 
representative of the tax structure used by all provinces. The 
four provinces that account for a third of Canada's population 
use a common sales tax base, the GST, which is different from the 
one used in the RTS.  We are comparing apples to oranges.  They 
are not equivalent.  There is a need to review the way the sales 
tax base is currently measured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is user fees.  User fees are not part of the 
current federal-provincial discussions for the 1999 renewal.  It 
is very important to mention here that governments at every level 
are resorting to alternative revenue sources such as user fees. 
It is a tax with only a semantic distinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial and local governments receipts from user fees doubled 
from $6 billion in 1984 to $12 billion in 1994.  In just 10 years 
it doubled.  How these revenues are treated in the equalization 
formula can have a significant effect on overall equalization 
payments.  User fees imposed by the provinces have been part of 
the equalization of the RTS since 1967. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similar fees imposed by the municipalities were brought in with 
the 1982 renewal.  Currently they are included under the 
miscellaneous revenue category of the RTS.  This is a category 
that is altogether different and impacts on the calculations of 
the complicated equalization formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth example is that since 1977 lottery revenues have been 
treated as a separate revenue source in the RTS, with gross 
revenues from the sale of lottery tickets constituting the 
lottery base.  It worked well until the provincial gaming sector 
became significantly transformed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today provinces are operating video games, casinos, bingos, 
VLTs, break-open tickets and other games of chance.  The RTS base 
does not cover these newer gaming activities.  The revenues are 
treated differently for equalization purposes.  Where a casino is 
operated by a provincial lottery corporation profits are 
equalized under the lottery revenue source.  If the casino is 
operated by a government department the gross revenues of the 
casino are equalized under the miscellaneous revenue source in 
the RTS.  Again we are mixing apples with oranges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similar inequities arise in the treatment of revenues from other 
games.  The RTS has become less representative of the provincial 
taxing policy.  We will see if the government is addressing these 
gaming inequities in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth example is resource taxation.  Resource taxation is an 
area where the ground is always shifting.  The resource revenue 
bases in the RTS are measured on the basis of the value or volume 
of production.  Ideally they would be measured on the basis of 
economic rent or the value of the resource over its cost of 
production.  Rent is a measure of taxable potential, not actual 
but potential. 
It consists of a value that can be taxed without affecting 
production because natural resources in different locations can 
differ in quality and production costs.  Rent associated with 
them can also differ significantly.  These differences are not 
captured by the value or volume of production.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, there are separate sources, for example, new oil, old oil, 
heavy oil or mined oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saskatchewan argues that the current equalization formula lumps 
together oil sources that have much different profit potential. 
The resulting national average tax rate overstates the extent to 
which the low profit oil can be taxed.  Royalties generated from 
low profit oil may not be sufficient to compensate for the loss 
in equalization payments associated with the production of that 
oil. Production of such oil may cause a province to lose more in 
equalization transfers than it gains in oil revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, forestry revenues include income from logging plus 
royalties, licences, rentals or fees.  The tax base used in the 
RTS for forestry revenues is cubic metres of wood cut on crown 
land.  The province of Quebec argues that trees are not a 
homogeneous product and I agree.  Spruce grown in Quebec is not 
equivalent in value to the cedar grown in B.C.  The revenue used 
for forestry products is related more to the value of the product 
than the volume of production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get technical, the revenue yield of forestry products is 
related more to the value of the product than the volume of 
production.  The current RTS base for forestry revenues may 
exaggerate the fiscal capacity of Quebec and other provinces with 
large volumes of relatively low value wood products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Finance has failed to find a way to 
accommodate provincial concerns in the area of resources taxes 
and appropriately categorize them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sixth example is property taxes.  It produces $2 billion in 
this category, the second largest amount of entitlements in the 
equalization program, almost 22% of the total.  When the RTS was 
first adopted, municipal property taxes had been left out of 
equalization because there was no suitable measure available to 
determine the base for the real property tax.  Still the 
government has not developed a suitable measure. The government 
is using the wrong yardstick instead of the 36-inch one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Comparable data on real property values across provinces has 
always been difficult to obtain.  The base needs to be assessed 
rather than observed.  The tax base is the income earned by the 
taxpayer, not the potential.  The base is a stock of 
heterogeneous items, only a small portion of which changes hands 
each year.  The value of the stock must be estimated or assessed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Assessments inevitably involve judgment and judgments can 
differ.  They can differ from item to item.  The problem is 
compounded by the fact that the assessment practices differ from 
one class of property to another, from one province to another 
and from one municipality to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the assessments are infrequent and use different 
base years.  Thus the assessments are not comparable within the 
same municipality either.  The government therefore lacks a 
common measure of property values.  There is no agreement on the 
appropriate base for taxing property.  Market values are volatile 
and changes in the market value do not necessarily reflect 
changes in fiscal capacity. The current property tax base 
measures relative fiscal capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The weights used in the formula to distribute property values 
across provinces are arbitrary and the formula is not 
sufficiently sensitive to changes in property values.  The 
formula is not consistent with the basic RTS principle that the 
tax source used should closely represent what provinces actually 
tax. 
Not even one province levies property taxes on the basis used in 
the equalization program. Despite the red flag by the auditor 
general, the Liberal government has done nothing to rectify this 
problem.  It continues to measure a yard with a 26-inch 
yardstick.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many flaws in the present equalization program. It 
should be completely reformed.  We know the equalization's 
provision has limited the cumulative growth of total equalization 
payments to the cumulative growth of GNP from the base.  Ceiling 
and floor levels were also introduced.  I will not elaborate on 
that but it does not work favourably.  Rather it would make it 
difficult for the provinces, particularly those close to the 
floor level, to plan their budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is asymmetrical treatment of underpayments and 
overpayments.  The overpayments are treated as non-interest 
bearing loans to the provinces.  Last year it cost the federal 
government $38 million.  Free use of federal funds is not 
necessarily shared equally by all receiving provinces.  The 
federal government does not charge interest on the underpayments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has manipulated the program for political 
favours.  Our leader reminded us that the premier of 
Newfoundland, Brian Tobin, was given a gift before the election. 
The program could be more effective if the federal-provincial 
committee on equalization began its review of outstanding issues 
earlier in each new equalization period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final decision about this program rests with parliament. The 
Department of Finance should have made a greater effort to 
educate parliament and the Canadian public in general.  It could 
use parliament more effectively by soliciting advice from a wider 
circle of interested parties rather than just relying on the 
advice of a federal-provincial committee working behind closed 
doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has had five years.  Just three days ago we 
received notice of this bill without draft legislation.  I wonder 
what the government has been doing for five years.  The Liberals 
have denied the opportunity for public consultation or academic 
input into this case.  This process is characteristic of this 
government.  We all know the Liberals are masters of the top 
down, arrogant, manipulative process. The least the government 
could do would be to establish a committee of parliamentarians to 
study this issue in detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constituents of Surrey Central and I have some serious 
problems with the unnecessary and traditional way the political 
leadership of our country has handled the equalization program. 
Evolving over many decades, every five years the traditional 
political parties have given us an extremely convoluted and 
complex process.  Its design is so archaic and cryptic that it 
defies logic and reason.  It is not fair that our system is such 
a conundrum.  There is no reason for that to be the case. This 
could be a simple series of calculations.  That is where the 
problem begins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals are failing Canadians by not providing a system that is 
capable of providing measurements of provincial revenue raising 
capacities that are comparable from province to province.  What 
is worse is that the Liberals are satisfied that the best 
measurements possible are being used. This is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measurements should be accurate, reliable and sound. In this 
case they are not. Why would the Liberals allow such measurements 
to be used?  In the five years the Liberals have had to prepare 
for the new equalization program they have done nothing but 
tinker with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has advanced the new Canada act which seeks to 
improve the Canadian political and economic system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need for a single social union agreement on transfers 
from the federal government to the provinces.  The program 
presently costs $48 million.  Eventually it will cost $242 
million.

earlier in the case of Premier Brian Tobin of Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, on behalf of the people of Surrey Central I am

Speaker, the member's remarks give me an opportunity to express 
feelings that I have with respect to gaming.  Mr. Speaker, if you 
will forgive me I will go slightly off the topic but I hope that 
the member will react to my comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been increasingly uneasy with the way provinces have more 
and more been exploiting casinos, gambling and lotteries in 
general.  I fear that this is creating as many if not more 
problems than is worth the money that is being collected. In 
other words the provinces are causing addiction, breaking up 
families, contributing to all kinds of problems that in the end 
the federal government will have to address by increases in 
transfer payments for social and health spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gaming is becoming a serious addiction, on the same order as 
alcoholism and drug abuse.  We, as legislators, be we at the 
federal level or the provincial level are forgetting our duty to 
the citizens by allowing the spread of this terrible problem 
simply because provincial governments want to make money easily 
without having to raise taxes.  They want to make money by 
exploiting the weakness of people.  This is a serious problem 
that the governments are going to have to address eventually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member whether he agrees that gaming has become a 
serious sickness in society, that it is aided and abetted by the 
provincial governments and that sometime the federal government 
should intervene in order to protect the interests of Canadians 
who obviously cannot protect their own interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I sincerely thank the 
hon. member for bringing forward this issue.  I know he is 
sincere in coming forward with his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last weekend I was in Windsor, Ontario, a city with casinos.  I 
noticed that the small businesses, particularly the restaurants, 
were closing in that area.  The reason is that the casinos were 
subsidizing the food and the smaller businesses were suffering. 
The revenue from the casinos was not going to the community where 
it was doing the damage to the community. The smaller businesses 
were suffering and complaining.  At least seven businesses 
complained to me.  Three of them were restaurants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Particularly in the gambling industry it is is recreation on the 
one hand but on the other hand it is a serious disease.  It is 
mostly seniors who are affected by the disease. It is a 
provincial jurisdiction and I cannot comment on what it should do 
or what it should not do.  Definitely this is a point that all 
politicians at whatever level should look at seriously so that we 
can preserve the social values in our society and protect those 
who are addicted to gambling.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to Bill C-65, an act to amend the 
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act, at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spent some time listening to the debate of hon. members 
and thought it would be appropriate to get back to the bill and 
to put on the record some of the principles with regard to 
equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The equalization program is one of the cornerstones of the 
country.  It has played a major role in defining the Canadian 
federation.  Equalization ensures that all provinces have the 
resources they need to provide reasonably comparable services to 
Canadians, no matter where they live, without having to resort to 
higher levels of taxation than other provinces.  That is a very 
important principle within equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization is also an unconditional federal payment and the 
provinces can use it as they wish.  Seven provinces currently 
receive equalization payments: Newfoundland, Prince Edward 
Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Manitoba and 
Saskatchewan.  They all currently qualify for payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed Bill C-65 would renew the equalization program for 
a five year period from April 1, 1999 to March 31, 2004.  The 
basic structure of the equalization program would remain the same 
as proposed under Bill C-65.  There is no change to the basic 
structure of the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill includes changes to the program to ensure that it 
continues to measure the ability of provinces to raise revenues 
as accurately as possible.  These improvements will increase the 
costs of the equalization program by an estimated $242 million 
and the changes will be phased in over the course of a five year 
renewal period.  The bill also includes changes to the ceiling 
and floor provisions of the equalization program which protect 
against unusually large fluctuation in equalization transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments are the result of over two years of 
extensive consultations and review of the equalization program by 
the federal and provincial governments.  It is important for 
members to know that the review of this process that has been 
with us for some time took two years to look at the rationale of 
the program, its benefits, its fairness and its equity.  The 
premiers and provincial representatives along with the federal 
government concurred with the principles of our equalization 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time of the 1998 budget it was projected that 
equalization in 1998-99 would amount to $8.5 billion.  The last 
official estimates released in October show an increase to $8.8 
billion.  New estimates of equalization will be provided when the 
1999 budget is tabled in the House on February 16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also includes changes to the ceiling and floor 
provisions of the equalization program which protect against 
unusually large fluctuations in equalization transfers.  The bill 
would also renew the provincial personal income tax revenue 
guarantee program for the same five year period.  This program 
protects those provinces participating in tax collection 
agreements from many major revenue reductions that may be caused 
during the course of the year by changes in federal tax policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the principal elements of the bill before the House. 
This is second reading.  The speaker who just addressed the House 
raised some concern that he did not want to rubber stamp approval 
of the bill and that he was opposed to it.  This is not the time 
to deal with approval of the bill.  This is the time to look at 
some of its elements.  The bill will go to the finance committee 
which has representatives of all parties. 
Members of parliament do a lot of their work in committee where 
officials appear before the committee—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  If you believe it, pal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Reform members want to deny the fact that 
at committee important work is done.  I know that, having been a 
member of both the health committee and the finance committee. We 
have had the opportunity to deal with officials, to deal with the 
minister responsible and to hear witnesses on a whole host of 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the Reform Party has made some suggestions. It is useful 
to have suggestions on how the equalization program may be 
modified or may possibly be improved.  The time to get these 
points before the House is through its committee system.  That is 
why it is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent the afternoon listening patiently to the speeches.  I 
intervened on a couple of points which I thought were concerning 
because they may have given Canadians the wrong impression about 
what the situation was with regard to the equalization program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the examples given by the member for Medicine Hat dealt 
with the employment insurance system.  The member suggested that 
the EI program was biased and a form of equalization in itself. 
The member also went on to present the House with a fact, at 
least in his own mind, that somehow people in Alberta have to 
wait longer to get EI benefits than somebody in the maritimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry but that is just not correct.  It is absolutely wrong 
and the member should correct the record for what he said.  They 
do not have to wait a half a year.  The member said the people of 
Alberta had to wait a half a year and that is just not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance system is very specific.  It is 
prescribed benefits for all Canadians.  It has a clawback 
mechanism as well as intensity rules for frequent users which 
actually would reduce benefits, but in terms of eligibility for 
benefits what the member said to the House was absolutely wrong. 
The member should clarify the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from South Surrey presented the House with a very 
creative argument about immigration and how it was awful that 
Quebec was getting so much money per capita more than anybody 
else.  She tabled the numbers and said that was $3,000 per capita 
here and $1,000 for somebody else.  It begged a question.  If the 
numbers were in fact that different, if the numbers were as they 
suggest unfair, why did the member not present to the House what 
the reasons were from the officials, from the department, from 
the minister, from any colleagues in this place?  If only she 
asked the question, she would have had the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather the whole strategy of this debate on behalf of the Reform 
Party was not to give answers but rather to raise spectres, to 
raise simple allegations and not to answer them, to leave 
Canadians hanging, saying that they said so, so it must be wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was not the case at all.  The member for Calgary Southeast 
decided that he would try to slip one through on taxation by 
saying that all a province had to do was keep the tax rate low to 
continue to collect equalization payments.  If they raised their 
taxes then they would lose some equalization dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not as simple as one province increasing its tax rates and 
somehow losing some equalization payments.  The system is much 
more complex than that and takes things into account.  It 
provides for five-province averages of tax rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The allegations or insinuations in the House in many of the 
speeches given by Reform members have been to suggest that there 
is an inequity, to suggest that there is a wrong, to somehow 
suggest there is something going on that should not be going on. 
They have used time and time again a rhetorical question:  “Is 
this fair?  Look at these numbers.  This could not be fair”. 
Not one member rose in his place and actually said “I made the 
inquiries and I now understand why the numbers are different”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every member of parliament has heard these questions before on 
things like Canadian film production subsidies where Quebec gets 
a disproportionate amount of subsidies for French film production 
on a per capita basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a reason for that and I will offer it to the House. The 
reason is that production for French language film is centred in 
Quebec and provides that film for French speaking Canadians 
across the country.  It is not just for Quebeckers.  It is for 
francophones in Canada who want to enjoy French language film. 
That is the explanation.  If we take that into account we will 
see that the numbers are fair and equitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will see with regard to immigration, with regard to property 
taxes and with regard to many of the examples the Reform Party 
raised as spectres of inequity that they are explainable.  The 
question then becomes why did these members not do the right 
thing and explain the variances that they found in some of these 
issues.  Why did they not try to answer the question?  The reason 
is that it is politically opportunistic to raise the rhetorical 
question, suggest it is wrong and leave it there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have a right to know all the facts.  With due respect, 
I think what we have seen today is an example where members have 
not given all the facts.  I do not think they have done Canadians 
a service by presenting facts without proper investigation, 
without proper inquiry to ensure that the allegations or the 
insinuations they are making were correct.  These are important 
points for Canadians to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most repeated allegations by the Reform Party today 
was that this system provides disincentives for the seven 
provinces that presently receive equalization to pursue economic 
growth, to create jobs and to improve their lot.  This is 
basically saying that all premiers who receive equalization feel 
that they will get a better benefit by keeping equalization than 
there would get by having more growth and more jobs in their 
province.  That is just not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economic spinoff and the ripple effect of economic growth 
and job creation in provinces create value added benefit for the 
provinces that is worth far more than simply the loss in 
equalization payments that they would otherwise receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely absurd to suggest that a province would value 
equalization payments more than it would value jobs for its 
citizens.  Yet throughout the entire debate the Reform Party has 
suggested that somehow the provinces, the treasury officials, the 
premiers and so on all get together and connive to see how they 
can screw the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the provinces get together and they present their cases 
they know exactly who gets what.  They know what the rules are. 
It is a transparent process.  They know what the calculations 
are.  There are adjustment features as the other member from B.C. 
mentioned.  Those things are taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a system that is already in place.  We have come forward 
to renew it for another five years.  Effectively it has the same 
fundamental principles of equalization for the benefit of all 
Canadians which basically promote equity among Canadians 
regardless of where they live and regardless of where they choose 
to live because we are a mobile society.  I think that is a very 
important aspect.  The equalization program continues to support 
Canadians as a mobile society no matter where we choose to live, 
to work or to play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those things are there so that we have the services that we can 
get, no matter whether we are in the east or in the west.  From 
coast to coast to coast the equalization program is there and 
working to ensure that all Canadians have those services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciated the opportunity to put some of these points on the 
record.  It is important to understand that we are here at second 
reading.

Mr. Speaker, tonight we will talk about APEC for four minutes.  I 
want to start off by reading into the record exactly what 
commissioner Ted Hughes received in a letter addressed to him on 
February 3 regarding his role in the hearing. In the public 
interest, he is to inquire into all matters touching upon these 
complaints, to hear all evidence relevant thereto and to ensure a 
full and fair hearing with respect to these complaints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his letter to the new solicitor general, Ted Hughes points 
out very clearly “I have concluded for the purpose of the 
present inquiry, a full and ample opportunity to present evidence 
to cross-examine witnesses and to make representations can be 
best achieved by the complainants having counsel. Accordingly I 
write to recommend in the words of Madam Justice Reed that the 
state fund counsel.  That is the purpose of this letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“The question I have under study is not whether state funded 
counsel should be provided but rather whether I have as a matter 
of law the authority to order that it be provided.  You will 
appreciate from what I have said that my answer to the former 
question would very definitely be in the affirmative. While it is 
going to take time for me to study and research the legal 
question before me, I believe that, as a courtesy to you while 
that process is occurring, I ought to make my view of the funding 
issue known to you and communicate it to you in the form of a 
recommendation pursuant to the protocol sanctioned by Madam 
Justice Reed. If such a recommendation has not been previously 
been placed before you, I believe this is a fair and reasonable 
course for me to follow”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Justice Hughes is a well respected person in British 
Columbia.  He has been on the bench.  He has worked for 
governments in British Columbia. The Reform Party is very happy 
that he is now heading up this inquiry. We know from his past 
record he will not be pushed around.  He will do what has to be 
done to make sure that justice is served in this purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it very strange that today in the House the minister was 
asked again by our critic for the solicitor general whether he 
will agree to these recommendations by Justice Hughes and yet we 
are still looking at it. This is not something that just happened 
yesterday.  The letter has been there for close to a week, but 
the government has known for a long time.  The previous 
commissioners requested funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There cannot be a fair hearing unless everybody is well 
represented.  I hope Justice Hughes in his own research will find 
that under the act he has the power to do this funding on his own 
in case the government refuses once again to go by what he is 
asking it for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole APEC situation has been a black eye on Canada.  A 
number of things have happened in this inquiry.  A minister has 
had to resign over this issue.  The former chairman of the 
commission has resigned over this issue.  The two other 
commissioners have resigned over this issue. Here we are back now 
with Justice Hughes starting into this hearing and looking at 
getting some more support from this government to get ahead and 
do what needs to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government in hundreds of questions in this House on this 
issue has always said “Let us let the inquiry get going.  Let us 
let it happen”.  Now the new commissioner is saying to fund the 
other parties so that we can get this under way in a fair and 
prudent manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would implore this government to do that.  Make sure it is 
funded.  Make sure it moves forward.  We are all looking forward 
to the results that Mr. Hughes will come out with.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, they are calling for a public inquiry while, on

The opposition's position is completely illogical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Hughes, who is now chairing the commission, has said 
himself, and I am quoting very freely here, that he will do 
“whatever it takes to uncover the truth of what went on in 
Vancouver”.  He himself, therefore, is saying that the 
commission is able to get to the bottom of things, to 
effectively determine what happened and to submit a report, 
which, I would remind members, will be made public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We received a letter from him, and this letter was released 
Friday at noon. 
What could be more natural than for elected officials to take 
the time to read this letter, to examine it and reflect on it, 
and to respond in a balanced manner that takes into account the 
full proposal, the present context in its entirety, and the 
mandate of the commission.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
neglect of first nations is an ongoing black mark against the 
Liberal government.  It should be ashamed of the way it ignores 
the huge problems facing these people.  The government claims to 
be concerned about the problems but it does little about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First nations in my riding live in third world poverty. 
Unemployment is over 70% and over 90% in some areas.  There is 
homelessness and a lack of clean drinking water.  Preventable 
diseases like TB are prevalent.  When I go to these communities I 
can hardly believe what I am seeing.  The human tragedy of these 
conditions is heart breaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last November I questioned the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development about conditions at the Shamattawa first 
nation.  Shamattawa is a sad example of all of these problems. 
Four out of five children in this community have been or are 
addicted to solvents.  Since 1992 there have been over 100 
suicide attempts in this community of under 900 people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week I got a letter from the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development saying that Shamattawa is a high priority 
community.  If it is such a high priority, why has the government 
ignored its appeals for a healing centre to treat addicts within 
the community?  Why did the government promise to pay for a 
recreation centre and only commit 16% of the needed funding?  If 
this is what the Liberal government calls a high priority 
community, I would hate to see the low priority community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shamattawa is not the only community that this Liberal 
government has abandoned.  In my short time today I cannot 
possibly list them all but I will mention a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One that I definitely want to mention is Garden Hill.  This 
community of about 2,700 people was shaken by a terrible tragedy 
last month. An infant choke to death because no nurse at the 
local nursing station was able to respond to the call in enough 
time.  The station is supposed to have eight nurses but only had 
three at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of health care professionals does not only affect first 
nations.  Thompson has a severe shortage of doctors.  These days 
someone who wants a simple physical has to book months in 
advance.  Doctors are leaving and nurses are being laid off 
because of government cuts.  These cuts are affecting all 
northern communities, first nations and non first nations alike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the New Democratic Party is calling on this 
government to reinvest at least $2.5 billion into health this 
year.  Anything less will not be enough to patch up the holes we 
are seeing in our health services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I mentioned the poverty and poor housing on first 
nations.  I want to point out the link between this and the 
health problems we are seeing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take the God's Lake first nation. This small community of 1,200 
accounts for 10% of all the cases of TB in Manitoba.  That is a 
shocking number but not surprising when only about 10% of the 
homes on the reserve have basic sewer services.  If the 
government would do something about these kinds of problems, it 
would save millions in health care costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government must do more to address the conditions on 
first nations.  These conditions would not be tolerated in 
Toronto or Shawinigan.  It is a double standard to ignore the 
first nations. The Liberal government always points to the 
“Gathering Strength” initiative and the aboriginal healing fund 
as if they are going to solve everything.  They do not even come 
close to what is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a real investment in first nations housing, health care 
and economic development. 
Token gestures and empty words are not enough.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased today to respond to the hon. member for Churchill on 
behalf of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
concerning the social problem at the Shamattawa First Nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is concerned about the living 
conditions facing the residents of Shamattawa.  We are working in 
partnership with the first nation to take action in addressing 
the social conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Numerous meetings have occurred among regional officials and 
the chief and council over the past few months.  On November 20 
officials from Health Canada and the Department of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development met with Chief Massan of the Shamattawa 
First Nation and Chief Francis Flett of the Manitoba Keewatinowi 
Okimakanak.  They discussed the first nation's desire to build a 
multipurpose complex which would contain an arena.  On December 
24, 1998 a letter committing $400,000 toward the cost of this 
multipurpose complex was provided to the first nation.  These 
funds include $200,000 in advance to the first nation's base 
capital allocation and another $200,000 provided through social 
and educational reform components of the gathering strength 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, $150,000 was made available to enhance education 
facilities.  The first nation anticipates the construction of two 
portable classrooms to begin in the spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Construction of a water treatment plant is also under way at a 
cost of $4,736,000.  A further $33,000 has been identified to 
assist the first nation in the development of a human resource 
strategy that will target education and employment opportunities 
for youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I understand that the community is working on a 
proposal to access dollars from the Aboriginal Healing 
Foundation, to which the member referred, to address its needs 
for a healing centre on the reserve.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
asked a question recently of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development regarding EI and the changes to EI that have had such 
an impact on the riding I represent.  I was not at all satisfied 
with the answer.  In fact I do not really know where the comments 
of the minister came from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister maintained that it was our party which has been 
calling for a reduction in premiums.  Clearly our party has been 
fairly constant in our position that we want the eligibility to 
be increased and the levels of benefits to be increased, but we 
certainly do not want the premiums to be lowered.  That certainly 
was not our prime motivation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party has been looking at the impact of the 
cuts to EI for quite some time.  In fact our EI critic, the 
member for Acadie—Bathurst, has toured the country recently, 
going to virtually every community, getting input from working 
people and asking them about the impact the cuts have had on 
their working lives.  Certainly the feeling has been that the 
current system has had an impact greater than I think the 
government even realized when it introduced the recent changes to 
EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding of Winnipeg Centre has seen a cutback or a withdrawal 
of funding of $20.8 million.  One can imagine the impact it would 
have on any community to pull out that kind of capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the inverse, if a business were to come to Winnipeg 
with an annual payroll of $20.8 million, one could imagine that 
any level of government would pave the streets with gold to try 
to attract that type of business to the riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly this has had a devastating effect.  The riding I 
represent has two of the poorest postal code zones in the 
country.  Already an awful lot of people are living very close to 
the poverty line.  It is a very marginal area.  To pull $20.8 
million out of that community meant that many more people were 
pushed over the fine line from living marginally close to the 
poverty line to living in abject poverty.  It has had a huge 
impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe the changes necessary go far beyond what is being 
hinted at or alluded to.

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe there have to be dramatic changes in the eligibility. 
We want at least 70% of all unemployed people to be eligible for 
benefits.  They should be getting benefits in the neighbourhood 
of 60% of their working earnings.  They certainly should not be 
penalized the way they are now in terms of clawbacks, where if 
their income is over a certain level they have their benefits 
clawed back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the harshest rules that has come into effect recently 
which has caused the biggest inconvenience is the divisor rule, 
where the benefit is calculated using all of the 26 weeks 
preceding the date on which one files, including the dead weeks 
that one may not have worked.  Obviously rolling those weeks 
where one has no income into the average will bring down one's 
monthly benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I do not believe the government realized how sweeping 
this would be.  Cases came before the public hearings held by our 
critic.  People came forward who had previously received in the 
neighbourhood of $350 per week.  Their weekly cheques are now $38 
per week.  Surely this was not the intention of the government. 
We are hoping that substantial changes will be put into effect in 
the next budget. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member has criticized our reduction of the EI premium rate from 
$2.70 to $2.55, but we feel the new rate provides a moderate 
reduction for both employers and employees and still provides 
money to help Canadians find jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premium rate reduction does not jeopardize benefits to the 
unemployed.  We will spend an additional $800 million per year on 
active employment measures under EI, bringing federal funding to 
more than $2.7 billion annually by 2000-2001.  We will create 
even more jobs by using the $3 million transitional jobs fund now 
in place and by using general revenues to serve high unemployment 
regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 14 the minister announced the Canada jobs fund, a 
permanent program which will build on the highly successful 
transitional jobs fund initiative.  This annual commitment of 
$110 million will help a greater number of regions across Canada 
and will help create approximately 10,000 new jobs each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also recently announced that we will be injecting another 
$465 million over three years into the youth employment strategy 
to help young Canadians enter the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance system is about making sure people who 
are laid off or quit with just cause get help in between jobs.  A 
recent study of the system determined that 78% of such people 
were eligible for benefits.  We believe our approach is working 
and Friday's employment figures bear this out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remember that the unemployment rate dropped to 7.8% 
in January, the lowest level in nine years.  Last year 143,000 
jobs were created for youth, the best performance in 20 years. 
Last month alone 87,000 jobs were created and 44,000 of these 
were for youth.  Since October 1993, when we came to office, 1.6 
million more Canadians are working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The motion to adjourn the House is
