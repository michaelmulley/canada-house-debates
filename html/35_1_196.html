	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for over a 
year now, Canadians have been planning to celebrate the 50th 
anniversary of the events that led to the end of the second world 
war. Hundreds of commemorative activities have already been 
held in various communities across Canada. Through 
ceremonies, concerts, exhibitions and storytelling, Canadians 
are paying tribute to those who gave their lives to overcome 
tyranny.
<P>
	There are no words to express the pride I feel toward my 
country, a country that was effectively created by the men and 
women who fought for our freedom. It is because of both those 
who did not come back and those who are still among us, along 
with the thousands of Canadians who supported their efforts, 
that we now enjoy a quality of life and freedoms without 
parallel. Today I want to thank and honour them.

	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Bloc Quebecois wishes to salute the election of the Mayor of 
Paris, Jacques Chirac, as President of the French Republic. 
During his seven-year mandate, Mr. Chirac, a man of vast 
experience, will probably have to face the major challenges that 
await France as the next millennium approaches. When Quebec 
Premier Jacques Parizeau visited France in January, the new 
French president said that if Quebecers decided in favour of 
sovereignty, France would no doubt be among the first to say 
that it would accompany them along that road.
<P>
	For his part, the Prime Minister of Canada implied a few 
months ago that Jacques Chirac had as little chance of winning 
the presidential election as the sovereignists had of winning 
their referendum. Again, history is waiting for our Prime 
Minister just around the corner.

	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this week is National Nursing Week. As a nurse, I 
realize the important role nurses fulfil in our health care system 
and the many challenges they face daily.
<P>
	Nurses face the seemingly never ending challenge of 
providing more services at higher standards with less funding. 
This is the result of a combination of today's fiscal constraints, 
rising health costs, public expectation, and the expanding role of 
health services.
<P>
	Changes in the role nurses play have great potential to 
improve cost effectiveness in our health care system. For 
instance, in many cases nurses can provide the necessary 
education, guidance, and care without the patient having to visit 
or revisit a physician.
<P>
	Our health care is too important an issue to be left only to 
politicians. Health care debates and decisions must involve all 
major players, and nurses are ideally positioned. I ask all 
members in the House to join me in saluting all of Canada's 
nurses today.

Speaker, I am pleased to announce that May 8 is World Red 
Cross and Red Crescent Day. This day is meant to celebrate 
international understanding and promote the humanitarian 
cause of the Red Cross Society of Canada.
<P>
	This year's theme is dignity for all and respect for women. 
World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day acknowledges the 
millions of people suffering from the consequences of war due 
to ethnic and other violence, natural disasters, and malnutrition. 
It appeals to people all over the world to respect the dignity of 
those most in need. For nearly 100 years, the Canadian Red 
Cross Society has maintained a Canadian tradition of providing 
humanitarian assistance whenever and wherever it is needed. 
Often the Red Cross is the only organization allowed to bring 
assistance to war zones.

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on this 
50th anniversary of V-E Day in Europe, we will recall that 
although far from the battle, all of America was deeply 
concerned about the events taking place in Europe. While 
thousands of Quebecers and Canadians were fighting abroad, 
thousands of others contributed to the war effort on the home 
front.
<P>
	I am referring in particular to all those women who provided 
support to the combatants. I am thinking about the nurses, the 
women who worked on farms and in factories and those who 
produced war materials. To all those women who, through their 
courage and hard work, contributed to the war effort, we are 
expressing today our most sincere admiration and deepest 
gratitude.

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Reform Party MPs have given thumbs up to the first piece of 
legislation in Canadian history to actively keep government 
honest and accountable to Canadians.
<P>
	The taxpayer protection act is a chance for governments to 
show Canadians that government can be responsible with tax 
dollars while giving Canadians an opportunity to have a direct 
say on how much money they can afford to pay.
<P>
	The taxpayer protection act would require deficit control and 
reduction. It would limit expenditure increases to the rate of 
growth in the economy or population growth. It would also keep 
tax increases in check in the same way. The taxpayer protection 
act would not say how the money is to be spent but how much 
money is to be spent.
<P>
	The Liberals are famous for stealing good political ideas 
before, during and even between elections. I therefore challenge 
the Liberals to embrace this Reform idea, a federal taxpayer 
protection act, and show Canadians that even they can be truly 
responsible and accountable.
<P>

	<B>Mrs. Bonnie Hickey (St. John's East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today on this 50th anniversary of V-E Day to pay tribute to 
the Canadians who helped bring about the end of the second 
world war.
<P>
<B>(1405 ) </B>
<P>
	During the war thousands of men and women from the 
Dominion of Newfoundland proudly served with the allied 
armies, navies, and air forces. Thousands of others served with 
the merchant navy, risking their lives to keep the vital shipping 
lines across the Atlantic open.
<P>
	Members of the Newfoundland Overseas Forestry Unit 
worked in Britain to ensure the continuing supply of lumber, 
while many others joined the British Home Guard.
<P>
	At home, people felt the reality of this war as well. In the fall 
of 1942 four allied ships were sunk by U-boats off Bell Island of 
Newfoundland, the only community in North America to come 
under direct enemy fire. Sixty-nine men were killed and a 
memorial now stands in Lance Cove in their honour.
<P>
	As Mr. Churchill said 50 years ago, ``Today is V-E Day; long 
live the cause of peace''.

	<B>Mr. John English (Kitchener, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
1940s young men and women left Canada's farms and factories, 
villages and cities to fight a war that had to be fought. They were 
young men and women like Earl Grummett, who fought from 
D-Day's beaches to Holland along the Maple Leaf route; like 
Stanley Kudoba, who spent the war's last hours fighting the 
enemy in a small Dutch village; or like Lottie Kosiorek, who 
was freed from a forced labour camp.
<P>
	Today we celebrate those who triumphed over Nazism and 
fascism 50 years ago. How thrilling it was for us to hear the 
Dutch Prime Minister say on Saturday, ``Thank you, Canadians, 
from the bottoms of our hearts''.
<P>
	These men and women were the glory of their times. Let us 
honour them today in our times for the great deeds they did for 
all of us.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The model forest program has in just three years firmly 
established a nationwide network of ten large-scale model 
forest partnerships. The worldwide notoriety of this project has 
helped to place Canada in a leadership role in forest 
management.
<P>
	These partnerships are comprised of willing and committed 
individuals, encompassing a broad spectrum of our society, 
including academics, students, traditional and non-traditional 
forest-based industries, foresters, and First Nations groups.

	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Cochrane-Superior, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate the government and the 
hon. Minister of Natural Resources in particular for establishing 
National Mining Week.
<P>
	This is a timely recognition of mining's importance to Canada 
and to regions of the country such as northern Ontario.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In Ontario, with 56 mines and 103 quarries, the mining sector 
contributed $4.9 billion to the economy last year. There are 300 
companies providing mines with services and equipment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The mining industry is a high-tech industry, very much part 
of our new economy. It is developing technologies for robotics 
and process control and anti-pollution systems. In addition, the 
mining industry has invested heavily in training and boasts a 
highly skilled workforce.
<P>
	Ontario's mines have played and continue to play a leading 
role in developing these technologies. In areas like northern 
Ontario, mining is an integral part of our heritage. Mining is 
also an essential part of our present and our future.
<P>
	I look forward to National Mining Week as an annual 
celebration to raise the profile of mining among all Canadians.

anniversary of the Allied victory in Europe.
<P>
	On this occasion, let us remember that more than one million 
Quebecers and Canadians joined the armed forces during the 
second world war and made a major contribution to the 
liberation of Europe, notably Belgium, where I was born, from 
its oppressor. And more than 42,000 of them lost their lives in 
the process.
<P>
	I want to draw attention to the courage of the Quebec service 
members who fought in the Netherlands, among other places, 
where many distinguished themselves. We thank all those 
Quebecers and Canadians who served at the front, were killed at 
sea, on land and in the air or risked their lives to overcome 
tyranny.

<P>
	Forestry was a major force involved in the founding of many 
of the communities within my riding of Nanaimo-Cowichan 
and continues to be a vital economic activity throughout the 
riding today. At the same time, the people of 
Nanaimo-Cowichan have a great respect and appreciation for 
not only the revenue but also the beauty provided by the forests. 
We realize the importance of striking a balance between the 
environment and the economy.
<P>
	To help celebrate National Forestry Week, a constituent of 
mine, Mr. Ed McDonald, a forestry technician with 40 years 
experience, has graciously donated western cedar seedlings to 
each member of the House of Commons. On behalf of Mr. 
McDonald, I invite all MPs to pick up a beautiful B.C. seedling

<P>
buffeted by the currency traders, is offering its national railway 
to outside investors. Canada is doing the same.
<P>
	Yet the American government continues to pour money into 
its rail and port system. One recent example is $1.6 billion to 
improve rail and terminal facilities in Long Beach, California, 
to ``enhance export capabilities''.
<P>
	The Netherlands Parliament has just approved an expenditure 
of almost $6 billion for a 75-mile link to connect Germany's 
Ruhr industrial belt to Rotterdam.
<P>
	If the Liberals could see what the Dutch and the Americans

according to the 1993 violence against women survey by 
Statistics Canada, 29 per cent of women, or 2.7 million women, 
who have ever been married or lived in a common law 
relationship have been physically or sexually assaulted by their 
partners. Forty-four per cent of the cases involved a weapon and 
45 per cent resulted in physical injury.
<P>
	We are all painfully aware of the seriousness of the problem 
and the negative consequences not only to those involved but to 
society as a whole. In fact we may have been so overwhelmed by 
the tragic statistics and pleas for help over so many years that I 
fear we may have become desensitized to the severity of the 
problem.
<P>
	I call to the attention of the House Motion No. 15 to Bill C-41,

<P>
	Every year tens of thousands of Canadians are shocked into

enough money to pay for the demands on our health care system.
<P>
	The time for solutions is now, otherwise we will see the 
demise of publicly funded health care in Canada. Therefore we 
must define essential health care services and ensure that all 
Canadians are covered regardless of their financial status. We 
must amend the Canada Health Act to allow the provinces to 
work with different funding models. We must also ensure 
federal funds given to the provinces go to health care and are not

<P>
	On May 8, 1945, before some of us were born, Canadians old 
and young paraded in the streets, gathered on Parliament Hill, lit 
victory bonfires; church bells rang and children shouted in joy. 
The second world war was over in Europe and loved ones would 
soon be coming home.
<P>
	With the news that the great war was over so too was the worry 
that a father or a son, a sister or a friend would not live to see and 
feel the peace for which they had fought and for which so many 
had died.
<P>
	In the homes of Canada the sounds of victory that bellowed 
from Europe echoed like a profound sigh of relief.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And for those who had lost a loved one in the war, there was at 
least the consolation that others would not have to suffer from 
the same pain that gripped them, and that the war would no 
longer make young widows out of young brides.
<P>

this anniversary in a very special way: They returned to 
Europe's battlefields of 50 years past. They returned to say their 
goodbyes to friends who are dead but not forgotten. Several of 
them returned to Holland, a grateful country which warmly 
welcomed them. They were greeted as liberators. They were 
showered with the same love and exuberance that they received 
in the spring of 1945.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Today, as they did 50 years ago, the Dutch people are 
welcoming Canadians into their homes and hearts. They are 
showing the gratitude that a people have for their liberators; the 
gratitude of a people who know what freedom is because they 
had it taken away. It is the gratitude that a people have for the 
soldiers, some of whom are in the gallery today, who ended their 
starvation and who fought a desperate battle against a vicious 
enemy. It is the gratitude for the young Canadian soldier far 
away from home who fought beside a brother at one moment and 
then in a burst of fire became a memory the next. It is the 
gratitude for those young Canadians who fought through the 
cold and the mud, through the rain and the blood, through the 
pain, until the people of Holland found their liberation and 
Europe found its victory.
<P>
	Ik bedaank het nederlandse volk for de gast vrijheid.
<P>
	The battle in Holland was not a battle for conquest; it was a 
battle for freedom. It was battle that cost the lives of 7,000 
young Canadians who lie buried in the peace they won.
<P>
	Canada paid a great price for that peace. It is a price we 
measure each time a veteran sees a small Dutch child, as we saw 
today near Parliament Hill. It is the price of making the world 
safe and decent for all our children. It is the price our country 
was willing to pay.

<P>
	This morning, the MPs of this House attended ceremonies to 
honour the sacrifice of those who served Canada in those six 
years of conflict. We gathered at the War Memorial to pay 
tribute to those who gave their lives for freedom and to honour 
the peace we inherited from them.
<P>
	In his eloquent speech at the Groesbeek cemetery in Holland 
on Saturday, the Prime Minister said: ``You made it possible for 
us to live, grow and prosper in peace. Your legacy is a proud and 
independent country which grew from infancy to adulthood 
during the war''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On this day, the 50th anniversary of V-E Day, we oblige 
ourselves to preserve this legacy for all the days to come. We 
oblige ourselves to keep this vigil of peace constant from parent 
to child, from teacher to student, from generation to generation.
<P>
	We pay tribute to their great sacrifices and to the ideals that 
inspired those sacrifices. Canadians fought and died on the 
fields of Europe to preserve the democratic ideals that make 
Canada the envy of the world.
<P>
	Today we stand proud on the world stage because 50 years ago 
our veterans dug in and told the enemy: ``We are the Canadians. 
We are the bitter enemy of your oppression. We will not rest 
until your tyranny has ended. We will not rest until we share our 
freedom with the world''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, exactly 50 years ago the war ended in Europe and 
the end of the world conflict, which came on August 15, 1945 
with the surrender of Japan, seemed imminent.
<P>
	Today we celebrate the triumph of freedom and democracy. 
But we also commemorate the sacrifices made by those to whom 
we owe this victory and this legacy of freedom and democracy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12284"> 12284 </A></B>
<P>
	The road to victory was a long and arduous one. From Italy to 
France, from Belgium to the Netherlands, tens of thousands of 
our soldiers gave their lives to liberate Europe from its 
oppressors.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Today we want to thank them, all those who served on the 
front, the sailors and airmen from every part of Canada, the 
merchant seamen, the nurses, all the men and women who risked 
or lost their lives in order to defeat tyranny.
<P>
	We must never forget that more than a million of our fellow 
citizens enlisted in the Canadian forces during the second world 
war; 100,000 were wounded and more than 45,000 made the 
ultimate sacrifice.
<P>
	Although far from the conflict, the whole of the American 
continent was profoundly touched by the war that had inflamed 
Europe. As thousands of young people left for the front, 
thousands of other citizens contributed to the war effort on the 
home front in the factories, on the farms and in the militia.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to recall the particularly heroic role played by 
thousands of soldiers from Quebec who fought in the 
Netherlands, side by side with their fellow citizens from other 
Canadian provinces. There was the Régiment de Maisonneuve, 
the Fusiliers Mont-Royal, the Royal 22e Régiment and the 
Régiment de la Chaudière.
<P>
	The extent of human loss and the horror of the suffering 
inflicted on nations during this endless war are beyond belief. 
The figures themselves which refer to thousands of dead are 
shocking but fall far short of expressing the grim facts. For 
instance, they do not reflect the horror of the concentration 
camps and the genocide of the Jews.
<P>
	And at home, who can adequately describe the sorrow of 
mothers and fathers who lost a son in the flower of his youth? 
What can we say to widows and orphans, brothers and sisters, 
bereft of a loved one who went overseas and met a hero's fate on 
the battlefield? The most eloquent and authentic memorial to 
those who died is the silence that prevails among the little 
crosses that mark the grassy graves, row on row, in cemeteries 
spread over Northern France, Belgium and the Netherlands.
<P>
	These people went into battle and these lives were sacrificed 
so there would be no more wars and so future generations would 
be spared this horror and suffering. Unfortunately, many bloody 
conflicts are raging throughout the world.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	And now, consider those who have accepted the responsibility 
for maintaining peace in the world. I am thinking of the UN 
peacekeeping force and especially our Canadian soldiers now on 
peacekeeping missions. Every day they witness acts of atrocity 
against civilian populations.
<P>
	The ceremonies being held today hold out some hope that the 
world will remember the horrors of the second world war and 
learn the lessons it teaches us.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, we must continue to thank those who died and 
those who survived this monstrous tragedy. Let us honour their 
memory.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the victory in 
Europe, V-E Day, let us give meaning and commitment to our 
promise to remember.
<P>
	Let us truly remember the people involved, in particular our 
service people, our merchant seamen, the men and women of 
ferry command and civilians overseas. Let us truly remember 
also those who served in Canada, including the families of those 
overseas.
<P>
	Let us truly remember those who were killed or wounded in 
action. Let us remember what Stan Waters, a former commander 
of the Canadian Armed Forces, once told us, that there are no 
hyphenated Canadians in the graveyards of Europe; just 
Canadians period.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Let us remember those who were wounded and those who lost 
their life. We must not forget Stan Waters, a former commander 
in the Canadian Armed Forces, who once told us: ``There are no 
hyphenated Canadians in the graveyards of Europe, just 
Canadians period''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let us truly remember the millions who died in the Holocaust 
and the millions of civilians who were killed during the war 
around the world and let us truly remember and honour those 
who made it safely through to V-E Day, many of whom are still 
with us.
<P>
	Let us truly remember that the struggle for freedom, liberty 
and democracy is never over. It goes on all over the world, 
including here in Canada. It is not a struggle to be taken for 
granted.
<P>
	This principle is captured in the motto of the supreme 
headquarters of the allied powers in Europe: ``Vigilance is the 
price of liberty''. This principle can be captured here in Canada 
without a motto by declaring that if we value freedom and 
democracy we must work at retaining or improving it every day 
of our lives.
<P>
	Let us celebrate the anniversary of V-E Day by truly 
remembering the price of freedom was not just paid in the past. 
Let us honour the sacrifices of the past by discharging with 
meaning and commitment our ongoing obligations to the 
preservation and improvement of democracy today.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, today 
marks the 50th anniversary of the end of the war in Europe. 
Some 500,000 Canadian veterans of World War II are still with 
us today to rejoice in the V-E Day celebrations. They, along 
with their families, friends and all who supported them, are very 
special people, for they serve to demonstrate that good can 
triumph over evil. They left home and country and travelled to 
foreign lands and seas to combat tyranny and oppression.
<P>
	Today we pay tribute to their great sacrifices and to those 
ideals of peace, freedom and democracy that inspired those 
sacrifices.
<P>
	While tens of thousands commemorate the anniversary 
throughout Canada via a number of venues, many vets have 
returned to Europe to revisit old battle sites, to tell a new 
generation about the horrors of war, to reacquaint themselves 
with old friends and make new friends; especially to remember 
their fallen but not forgotten comrades, the 45,000 who paid the 
ultimate price so that we may know a legacy of peace and 
freedom today.
<P>
	In the <I>Glen</I>, the regimental newspaper of the Calgary 
Highlanders, is published a short poem with the heading ``The 
War in Europe is Over!'' It reads:
<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="JOBCREATION">JOB CREATION</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on Friday, Statistics Canada reported a decline in 
the unemployment rates for Canada and Quebec. There is, 
however, a sad truth behind its report, since the decline can be 
explained, not by an increase in the number of jobs, but by the 
departure of 38,000 people from the labour market. If the level 
of unemployment is dropping, it is because the unemployed are 
giving up trying to break into the job market and are abandoning 
all new efforts.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. With the lack of job creation measures and with 
cuts of more than $6 billion to unemployment insurance, does 
the minister realize that the sole effect of his government's 
action in the past 18 months is to hide the actual number of 
unemployed, rather than reduce unemployment?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I point out to the Leader of 
the Opposition that over the past year Canada has seen the 
highest level of job growth of any of the 22 countries of the 
OECD. There have been 461,000 jobs created in this country. It 
is the best job growth number.
<P>
	That is not enough and we want to continue. Much of that has 
been as a result of the government providing the major stimulus. 
We can see over 100,000 of those jobs attributed directly to the 
infrastructure program, which was a major election 
commitment we made. We have provided stimulus right across 
Canada. Thirty thousand Canadians alone have been affected by 
new employment and new opportunities through our strategic 
initiatives and a number of other areas.
<P>
	We certainly are not saying it is sufficient, but it is on the right 
track. All that is lacking is the full dedication of all members of 
this House to the crucial issue of job creation rather than 
spending their time on other issues which are not as relevant to 
the people of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the minister talks enthusiastically of job creation, 
but he is forgetting to mention that no jobs have been created in 
Canada in the past five months.
<P>
	Instead of focussing on creative measures, talking about 
regional development and committing to defence industry 
conversion, will the minister acknowledge that all he is doing at 
the moment is considering a project that would reduce the 
number of Canada employment centres from 100 to 30, as 
proposed in a document produced recently by his department?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure the hon. 
gentleman would want to apologize for the absurd statement he 
just made that not one job has been created in the past five 
months. Several thousand jobs have been created in the hon. 
gentleman's own riding.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12286"> 12286 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the government always quotes statistics for a full 
year. I would ask him to check his figures for the past five 
months.
<P>
	Since the federal government has shown it is incapable of 
fighting unemployment creatively, and since the problem has 
taken on such proportions, particularly in Quebec, where we 
have over 800,000 people on welfare now, how does the 
Minister of Human Resources Development explain the federal 
government's stubborn refusal to give the Government of 
Quebec jurisdiction in matters of manpower training, when it 
alone can establish the appropriate and integrated measures that 
will really create jobs?
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the claim made by the hon. 
Leader of the Opposition is interesting. Only a few weeks ago 
the minister for manpower in the province of Quebec admitted 
that the SQDM itself was not up to doing the job and is now 
subject to a major review.
<P>
	The hon. member is suggesting that we transfer the large 
network of investments we have provided in this country over 
the past 50 years to help Canadians get back to work to an 
organization which itself is subject to review by its own 
provincial government. I do not think that is a good investment. 
I do not think the people of Quebec would like to see us provide 
that major rupture in the opportunity to provide for the chance of 
Quebecers and Canadians to get jobs.
<P>
	What would be far more appropriate is if the hon. Leader of 
the Opposition and his counterparts made a real dedication 
today to start working with us in a co-operative partnership. We 
could combine all our efforts and all our resources for all 
Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. Last Friday, 
the governor of the Bank of Canada, Mr. Gordon Thiessen, 
confirmed to the finance committee that the bank's current 
monetary policy is similar in every respect to the one pursued by 
his predecessor. In fact, the governor referred to the continuity 
of the bank's policy.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance confirm the governor's 
comments that the Bank of Canada's current monetary policy is 
similar to the one which was in effect under the previous 
government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I already said a 
number of times in this House that we disagreed with the Bank 
of Canada's policy during the last recession, when interest rates 
were going up. But, we certainly agree  today with the bank's 
policy, given the current objective of having and maintaining a 
low inflation level, and given the high price paid to achieve that 
goal.
<P>
	It is in the interest of the Bloc Quebecois and everyone else to 
keep inflation low, because this is a major asset for job creation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, does the minister realize that, if we are not careful, we 
could, as mentioned in the most recent report of the Bank of 
Canada's governor, recreate the situation which prevailed in 
1990, when Canada was the first country to go into a recession, 
before the United States, before Europe, before the rest of the 
world, because of a policy of excessively high interest rates? 
The governor of the Bank of Canada confirmed that last week. 
We are doing exactly the same thing again.
<P>
	How does the Minister of Finance explain that the Bank of 
Canada's policy remained the same under his government, 
particularly in light of the fact that there are 800,000 fewer jobs 
than in 1990, and also considering that, before he took over the 
finance portfolio, he felt that this policy had a devastating effect 
on economic growth and job creation? There are 800,000 jobs 
gone.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
must first tell us if he wants to keep inflation down, if he accepts 
the one to three per cent bracket. If he does not accept it, then let 
us have a debate on the issue. If he does accept it, I am sure he 
will agree that we must anticipate inflation.
<P>
	In any case, I find the hon. member's question somewhat 
puzzling, given that, in the last month, interest rates have gone 
down at least four times. There is a very distinct downward 
trend. I do not understand the timing of the hon. member's 
question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The member, following on the Leader of the Opposition, talks 
about job creation. The Minister of Human Resources 
Development pointed out very clearly that the numbers upon 
which the Bloc Quebecois is relying are simply not correct and 
that in fact there is job creation. Simply to fill in the answer 
given by my colleague, in the last quarter alone there have been 
100,000 new jobs created in the private sector. The other side 
ought to know that.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at one point in time the policy of the government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12287"> 12287 </A></B>
<P>
respecting direct to home satellite communications was to 
restrict access to a Canadian owned and operated company. Two 
weeks ago the federal cabinet overturned that CRTC decision.
<P>
<B>(1440 ) </B>
<P>
	The Minister of Industry said the cabinet did so because it 
favoured more competition and that any links to Power Corp., a 
direct beneficiary of the decision, were merely coincidental. 
However, the government also abandoned its own time line for 
implementing that decision and adopted Power Corp.'s 
recommendations in that regard as outlined in a memo to the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	How does the Deputy Prime Minister explain the fact that 
Power Corp., a Liberal connected firm, so completely 
influenced the content and the timing of a cabinet decision in 
which it had a direct interest?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as has been previously 
debated very fully in the House, a cabinet decision was made by 
the Government of Canada to protect competition and to protect 
Canadian consumers. I am sorry the leader of the third party is 
not interested in the view of the Canadian consumers who have 
overwhelmingly supported the decision that we have taken to 
review the licensing procedures which were set out rather 
discriminatorily by the CRTC.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the issue is not competition. The issue is insider 
influence and potential conflict of interest.
<P>
	Power Corp. told the government to abandon its original time 
line and cabinet threw out the original time line. Power Corp. 
told the government not to alter the DTH policy panel's report 
and the government did not change the panel report. Power 
Corp. instructed the government to seek CRTC support for the 
changes and the government dutifully trotted off to see if it 
could get CRTC's support. It looks like cabinet did everything 
Power Corp. asked for and then some.
<P>
	Why was Power Corp., a major player in the direct to home 
satellite business, allowed to set government time lines and 
policy in these matters?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the leader of the third 
party says that this issue is not about competition or consumer 
choice. It is exactly about consumer choice and competition.
<P>
	That is why the Consumers' Association of Canada in a letter 
to the government on April 19 pointed out very specifically it 
was very concerned that preference may be given to one 
Canadian direct to home company over another. It said that what 
was even more disconcerting was that there may be an attempt to 
mothball this technology until a time when cable companies and 
telephone codes have overcome any technological edge. CAC 
believes the recommendations of the policy review panel 
argument address the issue of cultural protection in a fair and 
practical manner. The letter states: ``I realize my language is 
strong, however it reflects the general frustration felt by many 
consumers''.
<P>
	This government decision was about protecting Canadian 
consumers and offering choice in television viewing, something 
the hon. member should understand is an important part of 
Canadian cultural policy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister reads briefing notes to 
answer a question I did not ask.
<P>
	What we object to is not competition in the industry. What we 
object to is the process of policy making and its susceptibility to 
influence by the Liberal family compact. The Canadian owned 
Expressvu has well established ties with the CRTC. Power 
DirecTv is part of the Liberal family compact as well. It is time 
to clear the air.
<P>
	What changes is the government proposing to the broadcast 
licensing process to ensure that policy making is open, 
transparent and free from undue insider influence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, unlike the leader of 
the third party who seems more interested in protecting a 
particular interest, we have an interest in ensuring full 
competition, transparency and protecting the Canadian 
consumers. That is why we have brought the issue to the most 
open and democratic forum in the country, the Parliament of 
Canada. That is where the issue will be decided.
<P>
	If the member has a charge to make, he should make the 
charge. If the member believes in fair and open competition and 
consumer choice in the emerging satellite television industry, 
then why does he not join us in debating, discussing and 
reforming these issues on the floor of the House, which is 
exactly what we have proposed?

question is for the Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	Last Monday, the Minister of National Defence announced 
that the government had approved the Canadian Forces plan to 
almost triple the number of low level flights over Labrador and 
northern Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12288"> 12288 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	Yet, the environmental assessment panel reviewing the issue 
had recognized the obvious need for monitoring studies and 
other efforts to identify any negative effect to the extent 
possible.
<P>
	Will the Minister of the Environment admit that the decision 
made by her colleague, the Minister of National Defence, is 
environmentally risky and flies in the face of prevention and 
sustainable development?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I think that the federal 
government's decision to increase the number of low level 
flights follows a recommendation by the Quebec Premier's 
spokesman on native issues, Mr. Cliche, who said in the April 6, 
1995 edition of <I>Le </I><I>Devoir</I>, and I quote: ``It remains to be 
demonstrated whether or not the impact is acceptable to the 
population. That is why a research institute must be created''. 
That was the recommendation of the Quebec Premier's 
spokesman, and we followed it.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think that the minister did not follow this matter very closely. In 
fact, many representations were made by aboriginal people 
complaining about the effect of low level flights on the 
environment and their quality of life.
<P>
	Does the Minister of the Environment undertake to include in 
future agreements with Canada's allies a clause providing for 
the cancellation of contracts as soon as the environment and the 
local populations start feeling the negative impact of these 
flights?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, in response to the first 
question, I tried to emphasize that representations for the 
creation of a research institute were made by the Quebec 
Premier's spokesman, among others. We therefore decided to 
establish the institute in question.
<P>
	As far as I know, Mr. Cliche is the Quebec Premier's 
spokesman on native issues. We are now working with the 
Minister of National Defence and the Minister of Indian Affairs 
to ensure that the institute to be put in place by September will 
be responsible for reviewing other issues besides the 
environment.
<P>
	We know that the studies conducted over eight years did not 
show an environmental impact. Obviously, the decision on 
where the flights will take place will be made by this new 
institute we are creating in collaboration with the Minister of 
National Defence and the Minister of Indian Affairs.

	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
to become a recipient under the Atlantic groundfish strategy 
program one must prove ``an historical attachment to the 
groundfishery'' but not need.
<P>
	It was reported this flaw allowed Prince Edward Island's snow 
crab fishermen to make $200,000 last summer, then only five 
weeks later collect $340 per week under the TAGS program. 
Why? Because they once had an historical attachment to the 
groundfish industry.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Human Resources Development amend 
his disastrous social program experiment so that need is the 
primary eligibility criteria?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a real disservice to 
criticize a program which is providing important benefits for 
close to 30,000 Canadians as a disastrous experiment.
<P>
	We are giving an opportunity to people whose industry has 
collapsed to find not only a way of maintaining income benefits 
for their families, but also to begin to find some way to make 
adjustments to new jobs and new employment opportunities, a 
program that has been in effect for nine months.
<P>
	It constantly amazes me that the Reform Party is so anxious to 
overturn and discredit initiatives designed to help Canadians 
deal with their immediate problems. It shows that whatever 
notion there is about Reform, it has nothing to do with investing 
in people.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like the minister to stand up before Canadian taxpayers 
and say that giving people who make $200,000 a year more 
money is an important benefit to the country.
<P>
<B>(1450 ) </B>
<P>
	TAGS is now at least $385 million in the hole. Funds are being 
diverted from training, the most promising component of the 
program, to cover the shortfall. As illogical as it seems, the 
minister continues to defend giving those who make over 
$200,000 per year financial support.
<P>
	Given the serious financial constraints of TAGS, will the 
minister now focus the few dollars we have left on those people 
who really need the money and not on those making over 
$200,000 a year?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons there are 
cost 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12289"> 12289 </A></B>
<P>
overruns in the program is that since the program was 
announced over nine months ago, my colleague, the minister of 
fisheries, for reasons that are totally beyond the control of 
anyone certainly in this  Chamber, has had to close down 14 
additional sectors of the fishing industry.
<P>
	That kind of calamity, which is the result of a ecological 
disaster being visited on us, is the reason why the program is 
facing the kind of pressures it is.
<P>
	As I said in the House last week, we have established an 
independent evaluation through Price Waterhouse which has 
given us a series of clear recommendations on how to correct 
those programs. The recommendations are now being 
implemented, including those which apply to income testing.
<P>
	At the same time we have to continue to apply the test of 
fairness to those who have had attachment to the fishery so we 
can begin to provide an alternative for them to be removed from 
the fishery.
<P>
	Clearly fairness is not a word in the Reform Party's 
vocabulary.

	Last Friday, in response to a question we had put to him, the 
Secretary of State for Parliamentary Affairs said that, upon 
returning to the House, the President of the Treasury Board 
would be able to provide us with an answer regarding the 
damning statistics on the working language of public service 
employees in the national capital region. Indeed, the latest 
report released by the Commissioner of Official Languages 
shows that only 44 per cent of francophone federal employees in 
the Ottawa-Hull area are able to work in French when not 
dealing with public inquiries.
<P>
	How can the President of the Treasury Board not see in the 
fact that only 44 per cent of francophone federal employees in

failure of institutional bilingualism?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board

out, there has been improvement and yes, more improvement is 
needed.
<P>
	The official languages commissioner and Treasury Board 
have co-authored a brochure that deals with the question of 
language of work and the rights and responsibilities of public 
service employees. That is being distributed now.

We agree with all of those recommendations and will implement

able to use it in correspondence.

	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of the 
Environment.
<P>
	The latest federal budget marked the end of the Green Plan 
introduced in 1990 by the previous government. The Minister of 
the Environment has, to all intents and purposes, confirmed that 
this program, which before its funding was gradually cut back 
represented a unique environmental initiative, has been phased 
out for good.
<P>
	In November 1993 the Minister of the Environment said that 
many positive things had come out of the Green Plan and she did 
not want to make sweeping changes just to be able to say she was 
the new minister.
<P>
	That being said, why did the minister drop the Green Plan?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we did not drop the 
Green Plan. In fact, we built on what the previous government 
left behind. Unfortunately, under the previous government, 60 
per cent of the environment budget was sunsetting funding, to 
expire after five years in the case of the Green Plan and the St. 
Lawrence action plan.
<P>
	Thanks to the Minister of Finance, instead of having 60 per 
cent of its project funding at risk, Environment Canada's budget 
consists totally of long term and secured projects.
<P>
	In the case of the St. Lawrence action plan, for instance, we no 
longer have to go back to cabinet for additional funding, since 
the project is 100 per cent funded through the annual budget. 
And the Green Plan, which was about to expire and was cut three 
or four times by the previous government, will no longer be 
subject to the political whims of the day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my supplementary is also directed to the Minister of 
the Environment.
<P>
	We on this side of the House understood, despite what the 
minister just said, that the Green Plan had been cut by the 
government opposite.
<P>
	That being said, does the Minister of the Environment realize 
that without the Green Plan, her environment commissioner will 
be similar, in a way, to the commissioner of official languages, 
and will observe and criticize, year in year out, and will not have 
the tools to take any kind of action?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to repeat the 
answer to the hon. member so there is no misunderstanding.
<P>
	Until the last budget, 60 per cent of the funding of 
Environment Canada was sunset funding. It meant that at any 
time, if one wanted to pursue the Great Lakes action plan, if one 
wanted to pursue the St. Lawrence action plan, if one wanted to 
pursue the North American waterfowl management plan, one 
had to continually go back to cabinet. Only 40 per cent of 
funding was long term and secured.
<P>
	As a result of the work of the Minister of Finance, we now 
have 100 per cent long term funding. The green plan money that 
was scheduled by the previous government to run out after the 
election will be rolled into the permanent budget of the 
Department of the Environment so that we may have long term, 
100 per cent funding which is not be subject to cuts by individual 
ministers for photo ops.

export products through its economy and to its benefit?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I fail to follow the reasoning of the hon. member 
because, as he would know, Canadian Pacific has no restrictions 
on its share ownership. I have not seen and I am pretty sure the 
hon. member has not seen any major change in the way Canadian 
Pacific handles its shipments as opposed to CN.
<P>
	The main reason for the decision taken on Friday is western 
farmers and people from coast to coast want to maintain 
competitive rail systems in Canada. We believe CN on a level 
playing field with Canadian Pacific is the best way to achieve 
that.

	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have an 
important question for the Minister of Natural Resources.
<P>
	In view of the strong provincial role in managing Canada's 
natural resources and the particular importance of mining to 
many areas of the country, especially northern Ontario, could 
the minister explain why it is appropriate that the federal 
government declare the second week of May national mining 
week?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government is very pleased to declare 
the second week of May national mining week.
<P>
	We are all aware that a prosperous minerals and metals 
industry is very important to all of Canada and benefits the 
economy of all Canadians. We attach great importance to those 
areas of federal jurisdiction that relate to mining such as 
international trade, international environment and the science 
and technology necessary to understand and develop policies in 
relation to those areas.
<P>
	We work in partnership with the provinces and industry in 
these key areas. All provincial ministers of mines, all provincial 
mining associations and the Standing Committee on Natural 
Resources of the House recommended the proclamation of such 
a week.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> This would bring to a conclusion the question

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my point of order relates to remarks made by the 
Minister of Transport about a question I asked in this House on 
Friday, May 5, 1995.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport said I had betrayed a confidence of 
this House and questioned my integrity because I was quizzing 
him about a current issue. I did not rise on a point of order on the 
spot because I could not believe what I had just heard, given the 
seriousness of the accusations.
<P>
	Unfortunately, on checking <I>Hansard</I>, I found that what I had 
heard was indeed what the Minister of Transport had said.
<P>
	My question is this: How can I have betrayed the confidence 
of the House by asking the Minister of Transport a legitimate 
question on an issue featured on the front page of such leading 
newspapers as <I>La Presse</I> and <I>The Globe and Mail</I> with regard to 
the government's decision to privatize CN?
<P>
	The figures quoted in my questions did not come any lock-up 
but were taken from the comments-
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleague, I reviewed last Friday's 
<I>Hansard</I> and read what was said. I also requested the videotape 
in order to see exactly what had gone on.
<P>
	As far as the hon. member's question is concerned, it is not up 
to the Chair to answer and apologize, but I think that, at this 
stage, what the minister meant and what the hon. member 
understood is a matter of debate.
<P>
	I will take this incident under advisement if you want me to, 
but at this point, I do not consider this to be a point of order. If 
there is more to it, I am listening.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> For clarification, Mr. 
Speaker, when remarks are made which are ruled 
unparliamentary, can we request that they be withdrawn? I think 
that is what my colleague wants to know.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Absolutely. When unparliamentary terms are 
used, members may ask that they be withdrawn. It is up to the 
Chair to decide, however. According to what I read in Friday's 
<I>Hansard</I>-and if you wish I will reread and review what was 
said-at this point, I must say that I have not found that the 
language used at the time was unparliamentary. However, I will 
review the matter and report to you as appropriate.

	The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that 
managing the family home and caring for preschool children is

of a privately controlled RRSP style fund with no contributions 
from the taxpayer. My bill would allow MPs to plan ahead for 
the future or provide them with funds for transition back into

<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, the current situation with respect to 
veterans and their families is nothing short of appalling. Tens of 
thousands of men and women have risked their lives for this 
nation yet in their latter years, when they turn to the Department 
of Veterans Affairs for disability pensions, they run up against a 
bureaucratic nightmare. Before many make it through this 
quagmire they have passed on without being fairly 
compensated.
<P>
	Veterans must wonder why the country they served so 
valiantly serves them now with such contempt. I find it passing 
strange that on a day when we are acknowledging the 
contribution of our veterans to this country, we are having to be 
critical about Bill C-67.
<P>
	I want all my colleagues in the House to consider the 
following figures. The average turnaround time for veterans 
who apply for benefits is 18 to 20 months at first level. Due to 
the fact that the benefit of doubt clause has not been 
appropriately applied, only 30 per cent of cases are accepted. 
That is almost two years for veterans who currently average 73 
years of age to find out their expected disability pension has 
been turned down. On the advice of their independent advocate, 
many appeal their cases, but this can take up to three years. Of 
those that appeal, 70 per cent end up receiving benefits; many 
may only receive a portion of the expected entitlement.
<P>
	The situation is unacceptable. We are making thousands of 
veterans in their advanced years wait almost five years to 
receive a disability pension. Currently there is a backlog of 
12,500 cases and 10,000 more veterans are expected to apply for 
benefits this year.
<P>
	After being chastised by the subcommittee on veterans 
affairs, the government promised to act on behalf of veterans to 
correct this shameful situation. Bill C-67 is the government's 
answer.
<P>
	One of my prime concerns with Bill C-67, and the thrust of 
Motions Nos. 1, 8, 9 and 12, is that it removes the right of 
veterans to have their first level application prepared by the 
Bureau of Pensions Advocates, which has been a very important 
body to veterans as some of our members across the way may 
well know.
<P>
	Under the current system, each veteran's application is 
prepared by a trained independent lawyer. In addition, each 
veteran enjoys solicitor-client privilege. The government 
claims the use of the Bureau of Pensions Advocates by veterans 
at first level is too time consuming and is largely responsible for 
the current 18 to 20 month  turnaround. However, page 50 of the 
report by the subcommittee on veterans affairs entitled 
``Keeping Faith: Into the Future'' clearly states that application 
preparation by the Bureau of Pensions Advocates consumes at 
maximum five months of the 18 to 20 month waiting period and 
in most cases consumes only two months.
<P>
	If the Bureau of Pensions Advocates overprepares its cases, 
why are 70 per cent turned down at first level? There is no logic 
in that. The removal of the Bureau of Pensions Advocates from 
the first level process is ominous for a number of reasons.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	The veteran now relies on the department to prepare and 
adjudicate his or her first level decision. This is not only a 
conflict of interest but it also removes from the veteran the right 
of solicitor-client privilege. The importance of solicitor-client 
privilege cannot be understated.
<P>
	In the subcommittee on veterans affairs report, ``Keeping 
Faith: Into the future'', Mrs. Frances L. Crummer, a witness who 
had been battling with the department for six years most 
eloquently states the need for solicitor-client privilege.
<P>
	She states: ``An important consideration which must not be 
forgotten is the average age and education level of the clients 
serviced by the bureau and the fact that most of them know little 
or nothing about how the system operates. Their link with the 
system is their advocate, the person in whom they place their 
trust''. I can endorse this lady's reasoning from firsthand 
experience.
<P>
	She goes on to say: ``The solicitor-client privilege enshrined 
in the statute is one of the inherent strengths of the bureau and 
the Pension Act. It forms the basis for trust that the clients place 
in their advocate''.
<P>
	She goes on to say: ``Changes could place clients in jeopardy 
and destroy their trust, not only in their advocate but ultimately 
in the system itself. No changes should even be contemplated to 
section 19 of the act which establishes the independence of the 
Bureau of Pensions Advocates. I feel it must remain 
independent of the department in order to properly service 
veterans and dependants''.
<P>
	What veterans face at first level could be an indifferent or 
incompetent pension officer who lacks the will or knowledge to 
inform veterans to pursue benefits to which they are entitled. I 
am also concerned that veterans may not be informed if they are 
able to apply for an appeal of the department's decision.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12298"> 12298 </A></B>
<P>
	Even if the pension officers have the best intentions, I am not 
confident that the applications they fill out will be as good as 
that of the Bureau of Pensions Advocates. The end result could 
be a fast rate of first level rejections.
<P>
	I foresee another difficulty with the Bureau of Pensions 
Advocates' being removed from the first level. Under Bill C-67 
the size of the bureaucracy will be increased. The minister will 
be getting more power to influence the department's internal 
affairs. Under these proposals, the minister may have undue 
influence over the whole decision making process and the 
quality of service or rate of acceptance.
<P>
	Departmental employees will be vulnerable to receiving 
direction which could deter them from encouraging veterans to 
pursue benefits and services to which they are entitled. They 
will also be under pressure to take part in fiscal restraint. Even 
an offhand remark by the minister could affect the way his staff 
deals with veterans.
<P>
	With the current rejection rate of 70 per cent and an 18 to 20 
month waiting period, I have no confidence that the removal of 
Bureau of Pensions Advocates from the first level will speed up 
the process and improve the acceptance ratio. Advocacy will 
suffer from a lack of continuity.
<P>
	Currently an advocate from the bureau will deal with a 
veteran from first level to review and appeal stages ensuring that 
the advocate is familiar with the merits of their client's case 
throughout. Under the proposed system, the pension officer 
after first level will have no mandate to be involved in the case. 
Yet the Bureau of Pensions Advocates' lawyer would be 
unfamiliar with the case that has been passed on to him and 
would be unable to properly advise the veteran on the merits of 
his appeal.
<P>
	A second aspect of this piece of legislation which concerns 
me is the proposal to join the Bureau of Pensions Advocates to 
the department. Again I am concerned about the chances of 
conflicts of interest arising and the lack of solicitor-client 
privilege. With the BPA restricted to hearing appeals and as part 
of the department, I fear that the Bureau of Pension Advocates 
may no longer provide the objective, expert, independent advice 
it currently offers, and it is good at it.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	As departmental employees, they may become party to any 
cost cutting or ratios alluded to by the minister because they will 
now be answerable to superiors within the department. I fail to 
see how this will serve the best interests of the veteran.
<P>
	I encourage all members of the House to support these 
important amendments on behalf of all veterans.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased today to be involved in the report 
stage reading of Bill C-67, a bill that promises to bring many 
benefits to Canada's veterans.
<P>
	It is appropriate that we are discussing Bill C-67 today 
because of V-E Day and the tributes that have been paid by all 
members of the House to our proud veterans who are heroes to us 
all.
<P>
	A year ago a commitment was made to veterans that we would 
cut in half the turnaround time it takes to receive a disability 
pension. I was at that committee meeting and we ensured that it 
was followed up in a relatively short time by standards in the 
House.
<P>
	We have been moving step by step toward that objective. 
Veterans Affairs Canada has already introduced numerous 
measures to improve the administration of the pension system.
<P>
	With the legislation we have before us for discussion today, 
we will now take one giant step toward our objective. Bill C-67 
puts in place the legislative measures needed to make the 
pension system more efficient.
<P>
	The legislation gives Veterans Affairs Canada the authority to 
make first level decisions. It focuses the efforts of the lawyers 
and the Bureau of Pensions Advocates on preparing appeals for 
veterans. It merges the Canadian Pension Commission and the 
Veterans Appeal Board into one appeal body with two levels of 
appeal.
<P>
	We have worked to keep all veterans' benefits intact. This bill 
will not take away any of the benefits. I want to stress that. 
Veterans still have the right to a two-step appeal process. They 
can still count on the help and expertise of trained lawyers if 
their application goes to appeal. By making the appeal system 
more efficient, we will cut down on the time that it takes for 
veterans to get their pensions. That is what it is all about.
<P>
	I thank the Standing Committee of National Defence and 
Veterans Affairs for its excellent work on the bill. As 
parliamentary secretary I sat in on all the briefings from all 
witnesses and all the discussions both in the steering and in the 
main committee.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for Labrador who chaired the 
committee and other colleagues who from time to time acted as 
chairman. The committee heard from many veterans, their 
spouses, former commissioners of the Canadian Pension 
Commission, former members of the veterans appeals 
organizations. We heard all their testimony.
<P>
	Many points of view were brought to the committee table. 
Members of the committee discussed a wide range of issues that 
arise from the legislation. Like my hon. colleague across the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12299"> 12299 </A></B>
<P>
floor, I want to reiterate the respect that our committee has for 
Canadian veterans. I thank the witnesses and committee 
colleagues for their hard work.
<P>
	We are very much aware of the debt of gratitude that Canada 
owes its veterans. Particularly over the last year, indeed, the last 
two years it has become very obvious that Canadians from all 
walks of life and from all across the country are taking time to 
reflect on just what our veterans have done to provide the 
freedom that we sometimes take for granted.
<P>
	I will speak more generally to the motions and to the bill 
itself. I would like to stress something I said earlier. The whole 
purpose of Bill C-67 is really not to touch benefits. The 
principle of benefits is not involved. The principle of Bill C-67 
is to reduce the time it takes for veterans to go through the 
process of application and the two levels of appeal. Indeed that 
is necessary.
<P>
	I am disappointed that this was not done before. It is 
happening today. With the average age of veterans at 75 and 
particularly as some veterans are just now experiencing the 
effects of certain illnesses and discrepancies that may have 
occurred as long as 50 years ago, it is very difficult and time 
consuming to track down and document the information. It is 
even more important because of the average age and the 
difficulty as time goes on in going back through records to hone 
and to refine the process so that it reduces the time.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	A matter of principle underlies all my specific comments on 
the motions as we go forward today. I will not be in favour of any 
amendment that increases the time it takes to provide veterans 
with the pensions that they rightfully deserve.
<P>
	It is not a question of partisan politics. It is a question of the 
logic behind the motion. Does it increase the time? If it 
decreases the time I would be fully in favour of it. If the end 
result of the motion is to increase the time, then it is counter to 
the bill and I will not be able to support it.
<P>
	I note also that all the motions put forward today are by 
members or stand-in members of the standing committee who 
had ample opportunity to raise these issues in the months that we 
had the bill under consideration. In may cases they come out of 
the blue and do not do anything for veterans. They certainly do 
not relate to any discussions we ever had in committee. I am not 
really sure of the impetus behind the motions. I cannot hold 
myself responsible for knowing what motivates the other side of 
the House.
<P>
	In group one we are looking at Motions Nos. 1, 8, 9 and 12. 
Their intent, if I understood my hon. colleague from 
Nanaimo-Cowichan properly, is to keep the Bureau of Pension 
Advocates separate so that it will be available at the first level of 
application.
<P>
	That runs counter to the central principle of the bill, a 
principle agreed to at second reading and accepted by the 
standing committee. The refocusing of the mandate of the 
Bureau of Pension Advocates away from dealing with the first 
level of pension claims to allow it to be active in the conduct of 
appeals was never once discussed in any detail in committee.
<P>
	It was discussed in committee in a general sense. I do not 
remember any strong proposals being made by members of the 
committee following the various witnesses who appeared before 
us. We reached the consensus that was reported in the bill. I do 
not see any reason for changes. Quite the contrary, I believe the 
motion proposed would further impede the progress and would 
cause more time for the first application to be considered.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
consideration of Bill C-67, an Act to establish the Veterans 
Review and Appeal Board, to amend the Pension Act, to make 
consequential amendments to other Acts and to repeal the 
Veterans Appeal Board Act, is now at report stage before the 
House.
<P>
	As you know, this bill seeks to restructure the process for the 
allocation of disability pensions to veterans. The bill also 
repeals the Canadian Pension Commission and transfers the 
responsibility of all initial decisions to the Minister of Veterans 
Affairs. It also establishes a board to review decisions and to 
hear appeals. Finally, the Bureau of Pensions Advocates, which 
was formerly an independent body, will now be integrated into 
the Department of Veterans Affairs. The bureau will deal with 
applications made to the new board.
<P>
	This bill proposes many changes. The evaluation process 
regarding veterans' pensions has been the subject of numerous 
debates over the years, ever since the issue of providing a 
pension for any type of disability suffered by a member of the 
armed forces in the line of duty was first considered.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Issues such as compensation, eligibility to a pension, 
assessment of that pension, as well as the review and appeal 
process and the support offered to veterans were all discussed, 
not to mention time frames, arrears and certain discretionary 
actions taken by the department.
<P>
	The pension system currently in effect is the result of all these 
debates and of all the legislative measures which followed. For 
example, we can think of the Woods committee, in the sixties, 
which led to the 1971 reform of the Pension Act. History tells us 
that laws follow changes: they do not trigger them.
<P>
	It is precisely because of change that we are trying to make the 
processing of applications more flexible. Our top priority is to 
speed up the process so that veterans who are getting older 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12300"> 12300 </A></B>
<P>
collect more quickly the pension to  which they are entitled. We 
should remove any barrier that stands in the way.
<P>
	This stage begins with the examination of four amendments 
moved by Reform members. If I am not mistaken, those four 
motions in the first group deal with two main points. The first is 
that the Bureau of Pensions Advocates should remain 
independent from the department. The second one is that the 
services of that Bureau should be available for first time 
applications.
<P>
	Reform amendments would keep the Bureau of Pensions 
Advocates under the Pension Act. They want to maintain the 
independence of the Bureau and full access for applicants. 
However, it has not been demonstrated in committee that this 
would bring substantial benefits. In many cases, it would be a 
waste of time.
<P>
	With the witnesses who appeared in committee, we discussed 
access to and independence of the Bureau. As a matter of fact, no 
study made in the last few years questioned the existence of the 
Bureau of Pensions Advocates. Neither the assessment of 
pensions in 1992 nor the Marshall report tabled last Fall 
questioned that. The consensus was that the Bureau should 
remain at arm's-length with the minister.
<P>
	We should not forget the main thrust of this bill, which is to 
speed up the processing of applications. We know full well that, 
even when the services of the Bureau of Pensions Advocates 
were used at the very beginning, only 30 per cent of the claims 
made to the Canadian Pension Commission were approved. 
When the rejected claims were sent to the next levels of 
decision, the approval rate jumped to 70 per cent. Only 30 per 
cent of the Commission's decisions were maintained, despite 
the legal services provided by the Bureau.
<P>
	But what is even more surprising is that Mr. Chartier, the 
chairman of the Canadian Pension Commission, was unable to 
answer our questions about the 30 per cent success rate of his 
organization compared to the 70 per cent success rate of the 
Board, which overrode 70 per cent of the first decisions made by 
his Commission. Mr. Chartier stated that he could not explain 
this difference and that he never thought about examining the 
issue. He told us he was very concerned about hanging on to 
work through careful scheduling of the files review.
<P>
	I must say that what I found the most convincing during the 
chairman's testimony was his nonchalance in terms of the delays 
our veterans must face. We just have to support the department's 
bill even though an arbitrary decision can be made at the first 
level. The proposed merger is not such a bad idea after all.
<P>
	The bill provides for the pensions advocates to deal with all 
the claims made to the new board which will be responsible for 
the reviews and the appeals. Hence, the free legal aid service 
will be maintained where needed. We hope that an increasing 
number of claims will be approved at the first level. This is the 
main object of this bill, to open up the pension allocation system 
and to make it a lot more flexible.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	We think that a forms clerk or expert would be much more 
useful to help a claimant to complete the forms and make their 
way through the system. The goal here is to speed up the process 
while providing assistance at the review and appeal level to 
those who need legal advice or help in their approach. This is 
why we will oppose the amendments put forward by the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	We will reject the Reform's motions to ``judicialize'' even 
more the process at the first decision level. We must trust the 
proposed change given the performance of the Canadian 
Pension Commission so far.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
once again, I would like to stress that we are at the report stage 
of Bill C-67, an act to establish the Veterans Review and Appeal 
Board, to amend the Pension Act, to make consequential 
amendments to other Acts and to repeal the Veterans Appeal 
Board Act.
<P>
	Need I remind you that this bill's goal is to restructure the 
entire allowance system for veterans' disability pensions? It 
abolishes the Canadian Pension Commission. It transfers 
responsibility for first decisions to the  Minister of Veterans 
Affairs. It sets up a board which will be responsible for hearing 
review requests and appeals at every stage of the process. Lastly, 
it integrates the Bureau of Pensions Advocates, formerly an 
independent organization, into the department.
<P>
	During the debate at second reading, we told the government 
that we agree with the basic principle of reducing processing 
time, but that we question the methods proposed in this bill to 
reach that goal. After consideration in committee, we concluded 
that, excepting senior officials and the government, most 
veterans' associations and individuals seriously doubt that this 
restructuration will reach the desired ends.
<P>
	In addition, veterans are really worried about two issues: the 
increased powers of the department and their vested rights. That 
is why we seized the clause by clause review and now seize the 
report stage in the House as opportunities to propose 
improvements to the bill. We have attempted to meet the goal of 
reducing processing time while addressing their concerns.
<P>
	One of the fears that keeps on resurfacing concerns the 
increased power of the minister.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	We see the federal government concentrating more and more 
powers in the hands of fewer and fewer people. This tendency is 
a threat to equity in the case of our veterans. For the sake of 
efficiency it may be necessary to concentrate certain powers, but 
the only way to prevent abuse or monumental errors under such 
conditions is to provide for broader consultation mechanisms.
<P>
	That is what the Bloc Quebecois had in mind when it proposed 
its amendments. I believe it is necessary for the government to 
proceed with transparency. It must consult with the provinces. It 
must control its centralist tendencies and its inclination to make 
decisions alone, as the lord and master, with respect to 
everything that concerns the public interest.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12302"> 12302 </A></B>
<P>
	Partisan appointments are a real threat. Too often, political 
considerations tend to outweigh qualifications when appointing 
people to what are often positions of consequence. Lack of 
efficiency or bias in some public services can often be traced 
to such considerations.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois hopes to counter this tendency to 
concentrate power, and that is the purpose of our contributions 
to the debate on bills like Bill C-43 on lobbyists, Bill C-65 and 
this particular bill. The purpose of all four amendments is to 
ensure that appointments to the new board are conditional on 
consultation with the government of each province and with the 
designated committee of the House of Commons.
<P>
	Our amendments concern three clauses: clause 4, 
appointment of board members; clause 6, appointment of 
temporary members; and clause 8, designation of the 
chairperson and deputy chairperson and acting designations.
<P>
	Clause 4 provides for establishing the new veterans review 
and appeal board, consisting of not more than 29 permanent 
members. As it stands now, the clause provides that these 
permanent members are to be appointed by the governor in 
council-in other words, the Prime Minister-without further 
ado. Our amendment proposes that permanent members be 
appointed after consultation with the government of each 
province and after consultation with the committee of the 
House. We felt that two consultations prior to any appointment 
provided sufficient guarantees that the appointment process 
would be valid. The process also gives appointees greater 
legitimacy.
<P>
	We must not forget that the board's permanent members 
together form the staff of a quasi legal organization and must 
therefore be beyond reproach.
<P>
	The same applies to the temporary members provided for 
under clause 6 of the bill. These temporary members will be 
employed for a particular term and for a specific duty in order to 
meet certain one time needs. In the case of this board, any 
number of persons may be appointed for a term not exceeding 
two years, but may be reappointed for one additional term. 
These temporary board members may be appointed to help 
alleviate the board's workload, which may have become too 
great through too great a backlog, too many cases or too many 
contested decisions. The appointment of the temporary 
members, like that of the permanent members, must, in our 
opinion, be reviewed by each province and the standing 
committee before taking effect. Otherwise, excesses could 
occur if this appointment system is not properly supervised, and 
nothing in this government's actions would rule out such a 
possibility.
<P>
	Our third and fourth amendments concern clause 8, which 
pertains to the extremely important positions of chairperson and 
deputy chairperson of the board. Clauses 8(2) and 8(3) of the bill 
clearly define the role of the tribunal chairperson and, 
accordingly, all that the position involves. I would draw them to 
your attention,  and I quote: ``The Chairperson is the chief 
executive officer of the Board and has supervision over and 
direction of the work of the Board including the allocation of 
work among its members, the conduct of its work, the 
management of its internal affairs and the duties of its staff. The 
Chairperson shall make such reports to the Minister as the 
Minister may require respecting the use of the resources 
allocated to the Board''. It is, therefore a very important role.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	Consequently, we would like both the chairperson and deputy 
chairperson, who is to occupy the chair if the chairperson is 
absent, to be appointed in consultation with the provinces and 
the House standing committee. Should both positions become 
vacant, we ask that there be a two cycle mechanism. First, the 
minister would immediately choose replacements among the 
board members. Then, the vacancies would be filled the same 
way as initially, namely in consultation with the provinces and 
the House standing committee. With these interim appointments 
made by the minister, the board would not be left rudderless 
during the consultation process.
<P>
	This, in short, is what the Bloc Quebecois is asking for, to 
make the appointment process more transparent. The federal 
government must learn to consult the provinces more often. 
Furthermore, appointments must no longer be made behind the 
scene, in the back rooms of power where the government admits 
only its friends, powerful lobbyists and the rich. Otherwise, 
even the best public administration system might fall prey to 
incompetence and arbitrary decisions.
<P>
	We do not want this to happen to the veterans' pension 
assessment system. Twenty four years ago, the Minister of 
Veteran Affairs, the hon. Jean-Eudes Dubé, agreed in this House 
that it was essential that decisions concerning veterans be 
arrived at in the spirit of fairness and impartiality. I trust that the 
present government finds this equally important.
<P>
	This is why I expect our colleagues opposite to support our 
amendments in favour of more transparent mechanisms.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to address a few words under group two to 
Motion No. 3. I hope that is appropriate at this time.
<P>
	A number of witnesses presenting their reports on Bill C-67 
to the Standing Committee on Defence and Veterans Affairs 
complained about the length of time members could be 
appointed to the veterans review and appeal board. They felt that 
ten-year terms with eligibility for an additional ten years is 
excessive, and I agree.
<P>
	Appointments with terms like this allow little opportunity for 
new blood to come into the system. They also allow the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12303"> 12303 </A></B>
<P>
government to stuff the board full of  political appointees who 
will remain long after the government has gone.
<P>
	Motion No. 3, which is our amendment to clause 5 of Bill 
C-67, will ensure that there is plenty of turnover, allowing a 
frequent infusion of new blood to the board. In addition, no 
government will be allowed to dominate the board long after it 
has been voted out of power. It calls for ten permanent members 
to be appointed for three years, ten more for six years, and the 
remaining nine for nine years. Permanent members will be 
eligible for reappointment, but no member will be able to sit on 
the board for more than twelve years. Provision exists for a 
permanent member to trade their term with another permanent 
member. Length of term is decided by lot.
<P>
	I encourage all members to consider seriously this 
amendment. It would do much to defuse public criticism of 
political appointees.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the comments made by both my 
colleagues on Motions 2, 4, 5, and 6 and on Motion No. 3.
<P>
	I understand Motions 2 and 4 will be voted on as a group and 
then Motions 3, 5, and 6 will be voted on separately.
<P>
	Let me speak about Motions 2, 4, 5, and 6 submitted by the 
Bloc. As I understand it, the thrust of these amendments would 
add delays to the process of appointing members to the veterans 
review and appeal board. This is surely counter to the thrust of 
the bill. The proposal as it is made will take time and it will slow 
the process down.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	I believe it runs counter to the attitude expressed by the Bloc 
in committee where it seemed committed to helping veterans. In 
short, these amendments do absolutely nothing for veterans.
<P>
	Further, the motions call for reasonable representation and 
appointments to be made after consultation with provincial 
governments and approval of appointments by the standing 
committee of the House. On the federal side the government is a 
national government which represents the interests of all 
Canadians. That is why we have 295 members from all regions 
of Canada. It has ensured and will continue to ensure 
appointments to federal boards and agencies are qualified and 
are representative of Canada as a whole, taking into account 
such factors as region, gender and ethnicity and that appropriate 
and necessary consultations occur before such appointments are 
made.
<P>
	To put the regional factor into legislation would restrict the 
government's flexibility in achieving a balance of all of these 
factors and in appointing the most qualified candidates. The 
federal government is the only body which can sit all of these 
matrixes and compare one region with another.
<P>
	With respect to provincial consultation, to mandate by statute 
that the provinces must be consulted prior to appointments 
being made in virtually every federal body, as the Bloc 
Quebecois appears to propose, would be needlessly 
cumbersome, time consuming and costly. In addition, provincial 
statutes do not include a requirement to consult the federal 
government on all appointments made by the lieutenant 
governor in council. It would be as inappropriate to require the 
federal government to consult provincial governments on 
appointments to agencies created by federal legislation as it 
would be to require provincial governments to consult the 
federal government on appointments to agencies created by 
provincial legislation.
<P>
	With respect to approval by the standing committee, to grant 
the standing committee the right to approve appointments would 
be to usurp the prerogative of the governor in council. It would 
represent a fundamental change in the executive powers of the 
crown, the House of Commons and the parliamentary system of 
government.
<P>
	I remind hon. members from all sides of the House that Bill 
C-67 reflects the government's commitment to simply change 
the structure, to streamline the operation wherever possible and 
to ensure federal agencies continue to be relevant to Canada's 
needs and serve Canadians as effectively as possible.
<P>
	The bill is not related to fundamental questions such as the 
checks and balances of the parliamentary system. Those are 
built in. I feel fully confident the bill as discussed and as 
presented with its amendments from the day we studied it clause 
by clause, I think on April 27, is quite satisfactory. This never 
really came up in discussion at any time to my memory.
<P>
	I got quite a kick out of Motion No. 3 proposed by my hon. 
colleague from Nanaimo-Cowichan. He is afraid of this great 
fear the third party has of political patronage. I am not sure 
where it comes from but he nodded and tacitly agreed this was 
behind the proposal he made. I see a big smile on his face. I am 
sure he cannot be serious about this kind of an amendment. He is 
trying to create three classes of members, those appointed for 
three years, six years and nine years.
<P>
	These are quasi-judicial organizations and the appointees, 
while they are not actually judges, are like judges. They make 
some very serious judgments. It would not be in the interest of 
the intent of the bill, it would not be prudent and it would not be 
wise to create a hierarchy among these members. The hon. 
member knows that. For the disability pension system to appear 
fair and transparent it must be clearly understood that all 
members of the new board are equal and they must be seen as 
equal by all parties in the House, no matter which party is in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12304"> 12304 </A></B>
<P>
government. I am sure the hon. member is not too worried about 
his party being in government for a long time. Perhaps it is a 
technical concern which that party has.
<P>
	Historically veterans affairs, and anyone involved in veterans 
affairs can attest to this fact, have been treated in a non-partisan 
way by successive Canadian governments. I think the hon. 
member from the Bloc who put the amendment forward would 
agree with that.
<P>
	Our concern remains first and foremost with the veterans and 
that will continue. I find it very difficult in my heart to support 
these amendments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is the House ready for 
the question on Motion No. 2?
<P>
	Resuming debate. The hon. member for La Prairie.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
happy to rise after the member for Châteauguay to speak to Bill 
C-67, an act to establish the Veterans Review and Appeal Board, 
to amend the Pension Act, to make consequential amendments 
to other Acts and to repeal the Veterans Appeal Board Act.
<P>
	What changes will be brought about by this bill in its present 
form? To put it in a nutshell, we can say that this legislation 
merges the Canadian Pension Commission and the Veterans 
Appeal Board and that, in future, applications for benefits will 
be examined by the Minister of Veterans Affairs. His decisions 
will be subject to review by or appeal to the Veterans Review and 
Appeal Board. Finally, the Bureau of Pensions Advocates will 
become part of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
<P>
	As my colleague, the member for Châteauguay, said earlier, 
the new Veterans Review and Appeal Board is an independent 
board consisting of not more than twenty-nine permanent 
members, to be appointed by the governor in council for a term 
not exceeding ten years, but eligible to reappointment. The 
chairperson and deputy chairperson are also designated by the 
governor in council.
<P>
	This bill also amends the Pension Act. Part I, which defines 
the Canadian Pension Commission, and Part II, which defines 
the Bureau of Pensions Advocates, are replaced by a new part 
describing the minister's powers.
<P>
	In a sense, the minister is inheriting all of the functions and 
powers held so far by the Canadian Pension Commission in 
terms of first applications and first decisions. The eligibility of 
applications for awards will thus depend directly on the 
minister.
<P>
	Is there not a risk that decisions relating to veterans will lack a 
certain impartiality and independence?
<P>
	When Bill C-67 was tabled for first reading on December 15, 
1994, the secretary of state for veterans argued that a thorough 
change in structures was required in order to substantially 
reduce delays in the processing of applications for awards.
<P>
	According to the secretary of state, this initiative is part of the 
review of all government agencies and commissions which was 
undertaken by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.
<P>
	We share the view of the hon. member for Châteauguay, who 
is in favour of the government's basic objective of reducing 
administrative delays and speeding up the decision-making 
process in files management.
<P>
	However, we also share the concern of the hon. member for 
Châteauguay, who is questioning the means proposed by the 
government party to achieve this necessary objective of 
reducing delays in the processing of applications.
<P>
	We, of the Bloc Quebecois, believe that to subject first 
decisions to ministerial authority would be a step backwards and 
a disturbing measure. We wonder why it is necessary to 
repatriate pensions advocates to the department when their 
independence was previously considered essential.
<P>
	The position of the Bloc Quebecois is that veterans' 
applications should be speeded up within structures that are 
impartial, transparent and fair. None of the suggestions put 
forward by the hon. member for Châteauguay challenges the 
principle whereby the decision process and the advocate system 
would remain independent from the minister's authority.
<P>
	Like the Reform Party critic, we too deplore the lack of 
consultation with veterans' associations and the government's 
preference for outside consultants; in this case, it sought the 
advice of two management consulting firms. We recognize in 
this the Liberals' preference for lobbyists and the well to do, the 
owners of these management consulting firms.
<P>
	The Royal Canadian Legion and the veterans of the Canadian 
navy and armed forces have both expressed serious reservations 
about Bill C-67, but the government prefers to listen to well 
paid management consultants. Party fundraising does have its 
price, it would appear.
<P>
	Three citizens came before the standing committee to say how 
much Bill C-67 would harm veterans. I wonder if their remarks 
reached the minister, who will have most of the discretionary 
power in the future.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	We agree with the principle of reducing processing time, but 
we have serious reservations about the means put forward to 
reach this goal. Other more concrete measures might improve 
the processing time without requiring a revamping of the 
administrative structure. We are concerned about increased 
authority for the minister and the decrease in services to 
veterans.
<P>
	The Chrétien government is once again showing its lack of 
openness, its disregard for provincial governments and its 
centralizing tendencies. Once again, the Prime Minister is using 
public funds to treat his friends better, instead of serving the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12305"> 12305 </A></B>
<P>
interests of Canadians. The 29 vacancies of the Veterans Review 
and Appeal Board,  high-paying full time jobs for a renewable 
term of ten years, will be filled by friends of the Liberals.
<P>
	To prevent this new Liberal scheme, we strongly support the 
four motions put forward by the member for Châteauguay, 
which are aimed at increasing transparency within the federal 
government. These four motions ask for the appointments 
required for the new Veterans Review and Appeal Board, under 
clauses 4 to 34 of the bill, to be made only after consultations 
with the provinces and the appropriate committee of the House. 
This would ensure a better distribution of power by not leaving 
too much power in the hands of the minister himself.
<P>
	These motions concern the appointment of permanent 
members and of temporary members, the designation of a 
chairperson and of a deputy chairperson as well as the 
designation of an acting chairperson and of an acting deputy 
chairperson. I strongly support these four motions put forward 
today by the member for Châteauguay.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> As you know, Madam 
Speaker, yesterday, almost everywhere in Canada, we were 
commemorating the end of the Second World War. In my riding 
of Shefford and in Grandby I had the honour to meet with some 
of the veterans and whether it was Mr. Benoit, Mr. Lemay, Mr. 
Brodeur, Mr. Saint-Onge and many others, during the Second 
World War, they were young and served in the military. Some of 
them gave five years of their lives to their country.
<P>
	Today, I am going to give you my point of view on Bill C-67, 
an Act to establish the Veterans Review and Appeal Board, to 
amend the Pension Act to make consequential amendments to 
other Acts and to repeal the Veterans Appeal Board Act.
<P>
	The immediate result of the restructuring will be the merging 
of the Canadian Pension Commission and the Veterans Appeal 
Board. I am particularly concerned with this aspect of the bill 
which appears quite contentious to me.
<P>
	Once the bill is passed, applications will be reviewed directly 
by the minister and his close collaborators, commissioners and 
officials. The decisions so taken will nevertheless be open for 
review and appeal in front of the veterans Board.
<P>
	Consideration of the bill tends to indicate that there might be a 
loss of acquired rights for veterans, without proof that the 
recognized problems which led to this reform will be dealt with 
by this bill.
<P>
	We can rightly believe that the fundamental argument of the 
government to justify the proposed changes is to speed up the 
timeframe for pensions to be awarded. These changes to the 
decision process are deemed to go directly to the root of the 
perceived problems.
<P>
	It is with that in mind that the Secretary of State for Veterans 
tabled Bill C-67 on December 15. He also tabled an explanatory 
note which alluded clearly to the overly long delays and the slow 
processing of applications, and which also criticized the present 
pension awarding system.
<P>
	Indeed, according to an analysis done by the government, the 
main reason for this slow process is the fact that the structures 
and agencies awarding the pensions are widely scattered.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	The Bureau of Pensions Advocates and the Canadian Pension 
Commission are being blamed. In order to resolve the problem 
of the delays incurred in awarding pensions, the government 
proposes to abolish the Canadian Pension Commission, transfer 
its responsibilities to the minister and his officials, transfer its 
resources to a new appeal board, and integrate the Bureau of 
Pensions Advocates into the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
All this would come under the department's control.
<P>
	The bureau will no longer serve veterans, except when an 
appeal is filed. According to the deputy minister, these measures 
should reduce the average delay following the first pension 
application from 18 to 9 months. As you know, those currently 
applying are often 70 or 75 years old. It is therefore necessary to 
reduce delays, and we agree with that.
<P>
	Most of the groups concerned agree that current delays are too 
long and should be reduced. However, as pointed out in the 
Marshall report, the figures now available in this regard are in 
dispute.
<P>
	The red tape involved in processing applications was noted 
for the first time in the 1986 report of the Auditor General of 
Canada, Chapter 13, Section 13.98 and the following sections. 
So this problem is nothing new. It was known even in 1986.
<P>
	As you can see, this delay problem did not surface yesterday. 
Beyond the award system as such, moving the headquarters 
from Ottawa to Charlottetown in 1983-84 was clearly identified 
as a major reason for longer processing delays.
<P>
	This observation does not take anything away from 
Charlottetown employees, who, in my opinion, do their best to 
meet demand; rather, it is aimed at the system in which they 
operate. For example, why are fully qualified district physicians 
required to submit case assessments to the approval of head 
office physicians who are no more qualified than they are?
<P>
	The central authorities' compulsive need to control 
everything is in a way the main obstacle leading to excessive 
delays in the award process. So, what undermines the present 
system is not the various authorities with different mandates but 
rather the duplication of certain phases of verification, 
validation and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12306"> 12306 </A></B>
<P>
consistency between authorities. Would it not be  better to 
decentralize the entire decision-making process to improve 
access to services?
<P>
	In spite of everything, the federal government is considering 
shortening the waiting period for pensions by eliminating the 
Canadian Pension Commission, transferring all of its 
responsibilities to the department, assigning its personnel to a 
new board and making the Bureau of Pensions Advocates a part 
of the department.
<P>
	I wonder about the appropriateness of these measures which, 
as far as I can see, come with no guarantee of producing savings 
within the given time frame, while the right to be represented in 
the first instance is certainly being removed. The Canadian 
Pension Commission is an independent decision making agency. 
Delays directly related to this activity generally do not exceed 
20 days.
<P>
	Abolishing the Canadian Pension Commission is not, in my 
opinion, a valid way of reducing delays significantly. I cannot 
understand, under the circumstances, how the department can 
come to the conclusion that this measure will reduce the current 
waiting period by four months.
<P>
	As for the Bureau of Pensions Advocates, it loses its status as 
an independent agency, becoming a part of the department. 
Moreover, it will no longer provide assistance to veterans filing 
their first application.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	The issue of conflict of interest and independence concerning 
this Bureau was examined extensively in the late 1960s and this 
actually led to the Bureau being detached from the department in 
1971.
<P>
	Incidentally, providing this kind of assistance from the 
beginning ensures that applicants have support every step of the 
way. At present, nearly half of all first applications are approved 
without any further need for review. How will the approval rate 
be affected if there is no more legal support for applications and 
no independent and impartial commission?
<P>
	I seriously doubt that the proposals contained in this bill will 
bring about any reduction in the processing time. The 
government's solution, in my opinion, overlooks such basic 
objectives as the independence of a body, as well as the 
decentralization of power and decision-making. The legislation 
should have focused more on regrouping the eligibility and 
evaluation steps, to speed up the process leading to a pension 
being awarded. As well, entirely favourable decisions should 
only need to go through one stage.
<P>
	Most applicants are older people who need an answer quickly. 
As I said before, I met some extraordinary people in my riding, 
people who have a sense of honour, people who gave three, four 
or five years of their lives. Some were imprisoned; some were 
injured. These people need an answer quickly. This is not a 
question of bureaucratic reorganization, exclusion of services, 
or reduced assistance. The purpose is to ensure the  efficiency of 
a process which is based on favourable consideration of 
veterans.
<P>
	We must not merely say once every 50 years that we love our 
veterans. We must table legislation designed to help them. 
These people need our support, and we must do everything we 
can to provide them with quality service. In my opinion, 
subjecting initial decisions to ministerial authority is a step 
backward. It is worrisome to say the least. There will be much 
more control.
<P>
	I truly hope that veterans will enjoy speedier processing of 
their applications, through measures which are based on 
fairness, transparency and equity.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, you can rest assured that the Bloc Quebecois 
takes its role seriously, and that it will closely monitor the 
government's reform. Our only concern is to ensure that 
veterans are satisfied with the services provided to them.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 7</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-67, in Clause 28, be amended by replacing lines 18 to 23, on 
page 6, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``28. An appellant may make a written submission to the appeal panel or 
may appear before it, in person or by representative and at their own expense, 
to present documentary evidence and written or oral arguments, but the appeal 
panel shall not accept oral testimony.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, our intervention on this is very 
short, sweet and simple. It concerns only clause 28. We do not 
mean to change the intent or meaning of clause 28. Very simply, 
we ask that the wording be clarified to ensure that appellants 
will clearly understand their rights. As it is worded now, it is 
vague as to rights. The intent of our motion is to clear up the 
language to ensure that appellants clearly understand their 
rights.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the comment from my hon. 
colleague from Nanaimo-Cowichan.
<P>
	Motion No. 7 confuses what was a confusing situation which 
was clarified in the amendment. It is difficult if one was not a 
committee member to wrap one's mind around this, but 
essentially the clause instructs the applicant in what can be done 
at a certain process in the bill.
<P>
	In the amendment we clarified with respect to documentation 
presented at the hearing that the documentation could be both 
written and oral, documentation as differing from evidence. 
Nobody meant to change, as the hon. member said, the intent of 
the clause. The intent was that oral and written documentation 
could be presented. Therefore when the veteran came to present 
his case the documentation could be taken in front of the board 
having been considered by the board and then the veteran could 
speak giving oral documentation. Oral evidence could not be 
presented and only documented evidence could be submitted.
<P>
	In committee we essentially did what is being achieved by the 
proposal being made by the Reform Party. It wants to insert the 
term oral. In fact that was taken out of the first clause on 
amendment because it was considered to be confusing.
<P>
	This does not appear in the bill because we felt it was not 
necessary to reprint the bill and we would save the government 
the expense of doing it since there were so few amendments. 
However, to clarify the clause we divided clause 28 into two 
subclauses to say that subject to subparagraph (2) the applicant 
could make oral and written documentation but at his own 
expense et cetera, and could present oral argument.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12308"> 12308 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	To make sure that the understanding is there in subclause (2) it 
is stated that only documented evidence, as opposed to oral 
evidence, can be submitted under subclause (1). Therefore, I do 
not believe the wording does anything to improve on the 
amendment being made.
<P>
	This would be amplified in regulations and would be crystal 
clear to the applicant. Therefore, I do not think there is any need 
for an amendment to clarify the subclause.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
Motion No. 7, introduced by the hon. member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands, echoes debates which took place in 
committee. At our very first meeting to study Bill C-67, on 
February 16, our colleague pointed out that clause 28 is 
ambiguous. This clause stipulates the manner in which a request 
to appear before an appeal panel of the Veterans Review and 
Appeal Board must be made. It stipulates that an appellant may 
present evidence and arguments to support a case, but at the 
same time, as it now stands, the board cannot hear oral 
testimony.
<P>
	Therefore, our colleague asked Brian Chambers, a legal 
advisor for the Department of Justice, a few questions. He tried 
to explain to us the nuance between ``oral arguments'' and 
``evidence presented under the form of testimony''. 
Unfortunately, his explanation was not compelling in the least, 
and we still had doubts and found the clause ambiguous. We 
therefore reached the consensus that we would have to modify 
clause 28, in order to clarify what was meant by the word 
``evidence'' and by the word ``arguments''.
<P>
	This is what the amendment proposed by the Reform member 
does. The amendment essentially aims to specify that, when an 
appellant submits evidence, what is meant is documentary 
evidence. By the same token, when the clause mentions 
arguments presented by an appellant before the appeal panel of 
the Veterans Review and Appeal Board, we can only understand 
that to mean oral and written arguments. This would clarify that 
a veteran or that person's representative cannot present oral 
testimony which contains evidence. All oral presentations must 
be limited to arguments, that is, the reasoning on which the 
appeal request before the tribunal is based. No new facts can be 
submitted in this manner at this stage. If an appellant or a 
representative wishes to submit new facts as evidence, they 
must do so in writing, in the form of a document.
<P>
	The official opposition agrees with this point and 
consequently supports the proposed amendment and Motion No. 
7 concerning clause 28 of Bill C-67.

<BLOCKQUOTE>``24. (1) When a pensioner has been sentenced to imprisonment for a term

	Section 24 of the Pension Act must not be removed. This

Madam Speaker, our response to this motion is a fairly simple 
one and I will not waste many words.
<P>
	A disability pension is a right that should not be taken away. 
The pension is awarded for injuries sustained serving Canada. It 
would be wrong to deny this right after it has been justifiably 
earned.

	I may say parenthetically the discretion is already there to do 
that but in the memory of anyone I have spoken to in the 
department no one can ever remember it being used. I wonder if 
there is really a necessity for it. Whether there is a necessity or 
not, we do not support the motion for the reasons I have given.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
Motion No. 10, standing in the name of the hon. member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands, proposes to amend clause 48 of the bill. 
This amendment would have the effect of maintaining section 
24 of the Pension Act, a section that the bill would repeal. So 
what does this section say?
<P>
	The new section 24 is amended to reflect that the Canadian 
Pension Commission no longer exists and that all its powers will 
revert to the minister.
<P>
	This section concerns what happens when a veteran, for 
whatever reason, is sent to prison. In such cases, section 24 
provides that the pensioner may be subject to certain sanctions 
including the suspension of his pension and transfer of the 
pension or a part thereof to dependants. Also, upon his release, 
his pension will be subject to reassessment.
<P>
	We must understand the principles and moral issues that are 
involved when we give this kind of authority to the minister. On 
the week-end, I heard a broadcast on veterans of the Vietnam 
war: how it had affected them; how they coped with their 
memories of the war; how they had been rejected by their fellow 
citizens who were too anxious to forget about this shameful 
period in the history of the United States; how the deep 
psychological wounds and the terrible burden they carried as 
participants in this war made it extremely difficult for them to 
readjust to a society that would prefer to forget all about them.
<P>
	Many of these Vietnam veterans are now leading a life of 
crime. We cannot dismiss the thought that there may be a 
connection between crimes committed and their wartime 
service. Of course, there is no excuse for crime as such, but we 
cannot be blind to the fact that behaviour is influenced by past 
experience.
<P>
	Furthermore, being punished for a crime is one thing but 
entitlement to a pension is something else. To link the two would 
be to make a moral judgment that a modern society cannot afford 
to make. If a crime is committed, the Criminal Code contains all 
the provisions to punish the crime, and the courts are there to 
determine sentencing. That is one thing. If a veteran applies for 
a pension as compensation for a disability arising from his 
military service, the pension review system is there to determine 
his eligibility and evaluate the level of compensation to which 
he is entitled. That is another thing.
<P>
	Let me give you an example. I used to work for a large Quebec 
company. I worked for 35 years, which entitles me to a pension. 
So, if, tomorrow morning I were to commit an offence, for 
whatever reason, and was sent to jail, would the judge be 
entitled to suspend my pension? No, of course not. I am entitled 
to what I am entitled to. The loss of my freedom is the cost I 
must pay for my offence. It is intolerable to think that the 
Reform Party wants to keep a veteran's pension from him as 
punishment.
<P>
	This is the absurdity at issue. A retired person is still retired, 
even in prison. Similarly, a pensioner who is entitled to a 
disability pension as a veteran is still a pensioner, even in 
prison. A just society would not make payment for services 
rendered conditional on good behaviour.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	It is as if we did not believe in our penal and our legal systems. 
As if we felt they did not do the job well enough and we had to 
compound the punishment with other penalties.
<P>
	This is all in bad taste. It is the old right. I was hoping we had 
seen the last of a right that mixes up everything in the social 
contract everyone has a share in. Veterans deserve to be 
compensated for risking their life and for being wounded. We 
made this commitment long ago. It is a right, and, in my opinion, 
nothing and no one can take it away from them, because no one 
in this House can give them back their health or a limb they lost. 
This is why veterans have a pension. It is a disability pension.
<P>
	We must not get it all mixed up and think that, because 
someone commits a crime, we have to take away not only his 
freedom but his right to a pension.
<P>
	You can see why we cannot support anything so backward as 
Motion No. 10. We understand why the government used Bill 
C-67 to remove this archaic provision, which has no place in 
civilized society.

<P>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 11</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-67, in Clause 73, be amended by replacing line 9, on page 26, 
with following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``do so on application if the person making the application alleges that an error 
was made with respect to any finding of fact or the interpretation of any law or if 
new evidence is''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Motion No. 11 is an important amendment to section 
82 of the bill. During the clause by clause study in committee, an 
amendment was made to section 32 of the bill because it was 
agreed by all that veterans had lost a right and that the 
amendment to section 32 restored that right.
<P>
	Section 32 originally denied veterans the right to have the 
appeal panel review a decision based on the applicant's claim 
that there had been an error with respect to a finding of fact or 
interpretation of law.
<P>
	Veterans could only apply based on new evidence. After being 
amended in committee, veterans can now apply for a review 
based not only on new evidence but based on a claim that an 
error had been made with respect to a finding of fact or 
interpretation of law.
<P>
	Section 82 of the bill is exactly the same as section 32 except 
instead of referring to the appeal panel it is refers to the minister. 
Considering the unanimous consent the amendment to section 
32 received in committee, there is no reason for this bill to 
restrict veterans to applying to the minister for a review based 
on new evidence only.
<P>
	Veterans should have the right to apply to the minister for a 
review based on the claim by the veteran that there had been an 
error with respect to any finding of fact or interpretation of law. 
I call on all members to support this important motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to what the member had to say. 
I looked at his motion and I believe it is unnecessary.
<P>
	If a veteran feels that the minister has made an error in fact or 
law at the first decision the applicant can appeal to the Veteran's 
Review and Appeal Board. That is why we have a quasi-judicial 
board in the first place.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member compared the three levels, the minister, the 
review board and the appeal board. He is absolutely right, we did 
go back to insert the error of fact or interpretation of law at the 
second stage or at the review process because we felt it 
necessary to have it in the quasi-judicial system to equate both 
processes, the review and the appeal.
<P>
	However, in the case of the minister the amendment makes no 
sense from an administrative or a policy point of view. It would 
not result in faster turnaround times, the litmus test of all these 
motions. Nor would it increase the chances of a veteran 
receiving a disability pension. The true safety factor for the 
veteran, the crux of the bill, is that he or she can claim an error of 
fact or law after the final decision is rendered by the new board.
<P>
	This where we need this kind of safeguard, not at the 
ministerial level. At the ministerial level the veteran can 
continue to two further levels where it is important to have it 
written in that the veteran is given the benefit of the doubt with 
respect to the ability to look at, from their viewpoint, the 
interpretation of the law or an error of fact.
<P>
	I believe the safeguard, the intent of what the hon. member is 
proposing, is already in place. It is an amendment which does 
not make administrative or policy sense. It will do nothing to 
help the bill. It will do nothing to reduce the turnaround time for 
veterans. We believe it is unnecessary and therefore I will not be 
able to support it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
Motion No. 11 put forward by my colleague is aimed at 
amending clause 73 of the bill, which amends a number of 
sections in the Pension Act. The section in this act specifically 
targeted by the hon. member's proposed amendment is section 
82 of the Pension Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12311"> 12311 </A></B>
<P>
	This section deals with the minister's power to review certain 
decisions made in the pension award process. This power 
applies first of all to his own decisions relating to initial 
applications not under the responsibility of the new board. This 
reviewing power may extend to all initial decisions made by the 
Canadian Pension Commission until its dissolution.
<P>
	Section 82 of the Pension Act also provides that the minister's 
review may lead to the confirmation, reversal or amendment of 
the decision being reviewed. However, such changes can be 
made only if the minister determines that there was an error with 
respect to any finding of fact or the interpretation of any law.
<P>
	The minister may review these decisions of his own initiative, 
but he may also do so on application if new evidence is 
presented to him. It is this last part of section 82 that the Reform 
motion would amend. This proposed amendment provides 
clarification in several respects.
<P>
	First of all, the amendment specifies that the decision review 
application submitted to the minister must come from the 
original applicant behind the decision. An application by a third 
party to review a decision under the minister's authority may not 
be admissible.
<P>
	The amendment goes on to say that the original applicant may 
also, in support of his application to the minister, submit 
arguments to the effect that an error was made with respect to 
any finding of fact or the interpretation of any law. It is the same 
power as that given to the minister to review a decision. 
Therefore, we think that the original applicant behind the 
decision should be allowed to submit to the minister any 
arguments that the minister could use to review a decision of his 
own initiative.
<P>
	Finally, with this amendment, it will still be possible to 
submit, in addition to arguments on points of fact and points of 
law, new evidence in support of an application for review by the 
minister. Indeed, under section 82 of the Pension Act, an 
applicant in receipt of a decision may ask the minister to 
reconsider his decision by putting forward new developments 
pertaining to his initial application. As I understand it, the 
possible reconsideration of a decision made under the authority 
of the minister is intended as another avenue for applicants who 
are not satisfied with the decision made in their case.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	This means that there are several recourses available to 
veterans applying for disability pension. Before even going to 
the new veterans board, applicants could file an application for 
review or appeal directly with the minister. This can be done 
provided new evidence can be introduced. It can also be done 
under the Reform Party amendment proposal if the applicant 
alleges that an error was made with respect to any finding of fact 
or the interpretation of any law on which the decision was made.
<P>
	We support Motion No. 11, as it seems to make a great deal of 
sense. It gives veterans more rights, while at the same time 
clarifying an ambiguity no doubt created by noted legal scholars 
and drafting officers. This way, the reviewing powers of the 
minister are made clearer. Therefore, we support Motion No. 11.

Income Tax Application Rules and related acts, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, last 
year the member for Calgary Centre rose in the House to raise 
the issue of the complexity of the tax system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12312"> 12312 </A></B>
<P>
	It is really interesting and instructive to listen to the Liberals 
who, in many of their speeches in the House as well as outside, 
tell us how everything is new and wonderful and everything is 
under control now that they are here. We are so pleased about 
that.
<P>
	When I look at Bill C-70 I come to the conclusion it is 
everything the same as before. The old Conservative way of 
doing things or the old Liberal way of doing things of making 
the whole income tax all the less compatible with ordinary 
human beings gives me some sense of distress.
<P>
	Last year my hon. colleague for Calgary Centre addressed the 
House while we were debating Bill C-27. In that speech he read 
the following excerpt from the Income Tax Act. I will give the 
House the interpretation of the Income Tax Act regarding 
superficial loss as presented by my colleague for Calgary 
Centre:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Section 54 of the act is replaced by the following: 9CO was the disposition 
deemed by paragraph 33.1(11)(a), subsection 45(1). Section 48 as it read in its 
application before 1993, section 50 or 70, subsection 104(4), section 128.1 or 
subsection 128(11.3), 144(4.1) or (4.2) or 149(10) to have been made-</BLOCKQUOTE>

of subsection (2) where the dividend is received as part of a series of 
transactions or events in which</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) a person or partnership-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It goes on and on.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	He raised the issue in the House during debate on Bill C-27 to 
put over the fact that we all know the Income Tax Act is such a 
huge volume of information that there is no conceivable way the 
average individual can possibly walk up to and address the bill 
or address the Income Tax Act. That was where my colleague 
from Calgary Centre stopped.
<P>
	Today we debate Bill C-70. How things have changed in the 
last year since the Liberals have taken over. How many 
wonderful new ideas they have an how wonderfully they are 
bringing the Income Tax Act into line with ordinary Canadians. I 
see within the bill an amendment to the particular section I was 
dealing with a moment ago, superficial laws.
<P>
	I am not a tax lawyer. I am not a lawyer. I am a taxpayer. I am 
not a chartered accountant.I am a taxpayer along with many tens 
of millions of other Canadians. I was rather hoping that with all 
of the words the Liberals continue to give to us, they might have 
lived up to the concept of tax reform.
<P>
	I read this section to find the following. They have changed it. 
It now reads: ``Paragraph (e) of the definition superficial loss in 
section 54 of the act is replaced by the following: (e) was a 
disposition of property by the taxpayer to which paragraph 
40(2)(e.1) 25 or subsection 85(4) applies''.
<P>
	I thank the Liberals for making it so much clearer for me as an 
ordinary taxpayer to understand this section on superficial loss. 
Of Course I jest because the Liberals have done nothing to 
simplify the Income Tax Act. If anything they have added more 
layers, more things to be taken off as one would with an onion 
when taking it apart. They have added more layers to the onion 
of the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	I find it rather interesting that one of the most creative 
thinkers with respect to taxation in Canada is a parliamentary 
secretary in the government. His ideas for the single tax, a 
proposal for tax reform, have never been approached, have 
never been touched by the government. I do not really 
understand why unless the Liberals have been around for far too 
long.
<P>
	Taking a look at some of his concerns, he points out that when 
we have a taxation system so complex, first it leads to a situation 
in which ordinary citizens like me, like probably most of the 
people either reading <I>Hansard</I> or watching this on television 
today, are saying to themselves: ``He is right, the income tax is 
so complicated I go to H &amp; R Block or an accountant; I pay $35, 
$50, $100 or $150 to an accountant to get the job done''.
<P>
	I do not mean to do a disservice to accountants but the plain 
fact of the matter is that when ordinary taxpayers reach a 
situation in which the tax act is so complex, so convoluted, so 
completely overlaid as in the picture I gave of onions and onion 
rings with layer upon layer of problems, we end up with ordinary 
citizens at a severe disadvantage.
<P>
	The problem is if we keep the complicated system we now 
have there will be continuing and ever widening abuse of the 
system. When there is a leak, when there is a problem within the 
tax system that has to be fixed, to come up with yet another 
band-aid that sits on top of the existing band-aids, we end up 
with the problem we presently have; people taking a look at 
loopholes upon loopholes and ways of getting around the 
system.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	There is another problem with the tax act being as complex as 
it is. The government is coming to the House now with a bill to 
enact 1994 taxation legislation when people were filing their 
income tax returns about a week ago. To me this smacks of an 
attitude problem: ``We will get around to it''. These ideas are 
imposed on Canadians: ``That is just the way it is. Oh, by the 
way, we will get around to using the rubber stamp of Parliament 
later to actually enact the legislation''.
<P>
	This is not acceptable. The last time I looked we lived in a 
democracy. This act should have come before the House for 
debate long before people were filing their 1994 tax returns, not 
afterward.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12313"> 12313 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not really understand why this government refuses to take 
seriously the concept of at least looking at a flat tax or single tax 
system. The major advantage to a single tax system is that we 
could eliminate the volumes and probably millions of words and 
figures, paragraphs, subparagraphs and subsections. We could 
get it down to something an ordinary citizen could understand. 
We would be able to file taxes in a way that is appropriate to 
ourselves and not to the demand of a government which simply 
says: ``Sorry, that is the way it is to be''. It would give us some 
flexibility.
<P>
	With a flat tax system we would be able to treat all income the 
same way. One of the problems when people look at a flat tax 
system comes when they listen to the council of concerned 
Canadians and other wonderful organizations like that which do 
knee-jerk reactions and say with a flat tax or a single tax system, 
only the people at the top end with the high income will be 
advantaged.
<P>
	Then some people unfortunately in the news media take a 
knee-jerk, short term reaction to that. They listen to that and 
accept it as being a statement of fact. They then go ahead and 
literally throw out the baby with the bath water rather than 
looking first at what exemptions there would be. They would be 
absolutely minimal.
<P>
	The income of people who are presently working within the 
system and taking every advantage they possibly can with all the 
exemptions and exceptions would be captured. That is number 
one.
<P>
	Number two, we would end up taking the personal exemption 
to a significantly higher level than where it presently is. That 
would mean that people at the low end of the scale who are 
presently in the $12,000 to $14,000 income area and are paying 
$600 or $700 in taxes in all likelihood would be advantaged 
under a flat tax system.
<P>
	Number three, because of all the exemptions, just increasing 
marginal tax rates does absolutely nothing to increase income or 
revenue for the government. What happens is that we end up 
going back to what I was speaking of just a few minutes ago 
which is the whole issue of the convoluted ways people can get 
around paying tax by exception or by exemptions.
<P>
	By coming up with a single tax it would simplify things. It 
would allow flexibility of filing dates. It also has the very 
distinct possibility of ending up with people at the low end of the 
scale being advantaged rather than disadvantaged.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	Does flat tax have a problem? Yes, there are some problems 
with the flat tax system. However, I challenge the Liberal 
government, I challenge the ministers of the government and I 
challenge the Prime Minister: If the flat tax or the single tax is so 
unpalatable and unworkable, why would the government of the 
largest economy in the world, the United States, be looking at a 
flat tax or a single tax? When we continue to throw more and 
more convoluted regulations and logic into our income tax 
system, why would we not be prepared to at  least strike an 
independent committee, even a subcommittee of the finance 
committee, to look at the concept of flat tax?
<P>
	We know that good, new ideas are not necessarily to come 
from that side of the House. They might be interested to know 
that the Reform Party is establishing a task force on taxation. We 
will involve members of Parliament. We will involve political 
researchers. We will involve people within our party. We will 
get as much input as we possibly can so that when we come out 
the other side we will have a package which Canadians can look 
at.
<P>
	No changes have occurred between the time my colleague 
from Calgary Centre brought up these paragraphs and where we 
are now. I am sure that if we waited for the Liberals to come up 
with any new ideas on the issue of taxation, we would wait a long 
time. Therefore, in the spirit of reform we are establishing the 
task force.
<P>
	In addition to the task force, we will also be bringing forward 
in the very near future under a private member's bill a taxpayers 
protection act. We have spoken about that in the House. It has 
been spoken about in provincial legislatures, as well as during 
the Manitoba election campaign. We will be bringing forward a 
taxpayers protection act.
<P>
	If Canadians want something new, if they want something 
different, if they a fresh idea, the Reform Party will deliver.

	He said: Madam Speaker, I now address the House on Bill 
C-54, An Act to amend the Old Age Security Act, the Canada 
Pension Plan, the Children's Special Allowances Act and the 
Unemployment Insurance Act.
<P>
	In Motion No. 1, I propose the following amendment:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-54 be amended by deleting clause 1.(2), which reads as 
follows: ``Review Tribunal'' means a Canada Pension Plan- Old Age 
Security Review Tribunal established under section 82 of the Canada Pension 
Plan.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This amendment put forward by the official opposition is 
aimed at keeping separate the appeal processes of the Canada 
Pension Plan and the Old Age Security Program.
<P>
	Bill C-54 integrates the appeal processes of the Canada 
Pension Plan and the Old Age Security Program. Yet, the auditor 
general said in his report that the two-tiered appeal process for 
Old Age Security permits the satisfactory settlement of the few 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12315"> 12315 </A></B>
<P>
cases there are. The process is simple, fast and informal, and 
cases are heard in the regions where the appellants live.
<P>
	As for the Canada Pension Plan's three-tiered appeal process, 
the auditor general criticized it quite openly. So why propose to 
integrate both processes and use the Canada Pension Plan's 
process deemed deficient by the auditor general?
<P>
	The government is not simplifying the appeal process in any 
way. On the contrary, client services will not be improved one 
bit with these measures.
<P>
	Under clause 34, page 20, the first level of appeal of the 
Canada Pension Plan will become a ``reconsideration''. Under 
clause 16, page 8, the reconsideration which is presently 
optional in the case of Old Age Security will become a 
mandatory minister's review.
<P>
	Under clause 35(1), page 21, the Review Tribunals of the 
Canada Pension Plan will be authorized to hear appeals relating 
to Old Age Security and, under clause 35(4), page 22, appeals 
that were directed to the former review committees of the 
Canada Pension Plan.
<P>
	Finally, the Pension Appeals Board will be authorized to 
appoint temporary members. At the present time, someone who 
is dissatisfied with a decision made in accordance with the 
Canada Pension Plan is entitled to three levels of appeal.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	The first level appeals are directed to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development. The second level appeals are heard by 
the Review Tribunals established in accordance with the Act. 
Finally, the third level appeals are heard by the Pension Appeals 
Board.
<P>
	In 1993-94, there were 23,046 first level appeals for an 
increase of 0.5 per cent compared to the previous year. Of that 
number, 83 per cent concerned disability benefits. A total of 
27,077 appeals were processed during those two years.
<P>
	Also, 3,300 second level appeals were filed. Of that number, 
2,675 were dealt with. During the 1993-94 fiscal year, the 
Pension Appeals Board received 498 new benefits appeals made 
under section 83, chapter C-8 of the Canada Pension Plan. It 
heard 274 of those appeals. Moreover, at the request of one of 
the parties, the board suspended 55 appeals to be heard later.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, does not believe 
that streamlining appeals made under the Old Age Security Act 
and the Canada Pension Plan is an improvement. To be 
consistent with the proposed amendment to Motion No. 1, I 
present the following amendment to Motion No. 8:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``That Bill C-54 be amended by deleting clause 25 because it combines the 
Old Age Security appeal process with the Canada Pension Plan appeal 
process''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Therefore the following clause, clause 25 must be deleted: ``The 
definition of ``Review Tribunal'' in subsection 2(1) of the 
Canada Pension Plan is replaced by the following: ``Review 
Tribunal'' means a Canada Pension Plan-Old Age Security 
Review Tribunal established under section 82''.
<P>
	To be consistent with the amendment to Motion No. 1, Motion 
No. 9 should read as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``That Bill C-54, in Clause 35, be amended by replacing lines 20 to 25, on 
page 21, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``section 84(2), or, subject to the regulations, any''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The purpose is to eliminate any reference to appeals to the 
Review Tribunal.
<P>
	For the sake of consistency, Motion No. 10 should read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``That Bill C-54, in Clause 35, be amended by replacing lines 15 to 20, on 
page 22, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``section 81 or subsection 84(2) and may take any action in relation to any 
of those decisions that might have been taken by the Minister under that 
section or subsection, and the Commissioner of''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	To be consistent, Motion No. 11 should read as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``That Bill C-54, in Clause 36, be amended by replacing lines 40 to 42, on 
page 22, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``decision made in respect of an appeal under sub-section 84(2), may''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Consistency is needed regarding Motion No. 14 to keep the 
appeal process separate:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``That Bill C-54, in Clause 46, be amended by replacing line 3, on page 29, 
with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(2) Section 108 of the Act.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Motion No. 16 also refers to appeals made under the Old Age 
Security Act:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``That Bill C-54 be amended by deleting Clause 50''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The same applies to Motion No. 17:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``That Bill C-54, in Clause 53, be amended by replacing line 20, on page 
33, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``53. Subsections 35(1)''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I will leave it to the member for Mercier to explain the official 
opposition's amendment to Motion No. 3, which goes along the 
same lines as my proposed amendments, since it deletes clause 
16 in Bill C-54, because on one hand, this clause provides for a 
ninety day period before appealing to the minister against a 
decision and, on the other hand, it states that the minister may 
stay payment of the benefits during the appeal process.
<P>
	Moreover, I have a proposed amendment to Motion No. 12 
which is in agreement with my colleague's.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12316"> 12316 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I thought I would take 
the opportunity to reply to the hon. member.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	Frankly, the behaviour of the Bloc opposition on this bill has 
been to produce the most puzzling, curious, strange, unorthodox 
and bizarre set of amendments I have seen in a long time in this 
House.
<P>
	It was not so long ago that the hon. gentleman was on his feet 
suggesting problems were being encountered by seniors having 
to make application on an annual basis to receive their benefits. 
The bill before us tries to expedite that by allowing for 
automatic renewal when we have all the information we need. 
But the hon. gentleman is now introducing an amendment to 
force people to go back to the old system of having to make an 
annual application again. He has stood logic on its head. He has 
absolutely reversed the position he has taken in the House. It is 
absolutely and totally contrary to the very words he was 
expressing in the House only a few short weeks ago. He said 
there was an impediment, a problem being faced. He says he 
does not know. He does not know. If he had understood the bill 
he would not be presenting such absurd amendments.
<P>
	It seems he is saying now that people with spousal benefits 
will be required to reapply for their application, which will 
affect 20,000 people per year, rather than giving them the 
automatic renewal we propose. Madam Speaker, do you 
understand that? Can you contemplate the rationale, the reason 
the hon. member would want to impose upon people eligible for 
spousal benefit the requirement to constantly go back and 
re-engage, reapply, go through the rigmarole, go through the 
bureaucratic red tape? I do not understand. If he were some kind 
of bureaucratic <I>menschen</I> who takes great delight in having 
people jump through hoops, then maybe it would make some 
sense.
<P>
	Bill C-54 is a clear example of how we have taken into 
account the problems faced by people over the past several years 
in ensuring that they can have renewals. We are now attempting 
to eliminate those problems, especially in the case of the spousal 
benefit, which is available for those who are 60 to 64.
<P>
	If we have a female client whose birthday is in June, let us 
assume she would also qualify for the OAS, she clearly has some 
needs. If the motion proposed by the hon. member were 
accepted, that person would be forced to obtain, complete, and 
return all application forms to Human Resources Development 
around the month of December, before her birthday. We know 
how busy things get, how much time there is to delay.
<P>
	In other words, the hon. gentleman who proposes this 
amendment has some kind of perverse delight in forcing people 
to fill out forms, go to offices, reapply, and go through all the 
paper work. It must be a strange form of entertainment for him, 
but it certainly makes no sense when it comes to healthy people. 
They will still get their money, but it will take longer, it will be 
more inconvenient, it will be more bureaucratic, and it will cost 
the government more money to go through the forms.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I do not know. You figure; I cannot. I simply 
do not understand such tortuous reasoning from the hon. 
gentleman that he would propose an amendment that would 
force people to engage in this kind of jumping through hoops 
simply for no reason at all. When we look at the bill with the 
whole range of amendments proposed by hon. members 
opposite, they are giving the message that they do not want to 
help people gain access to their old age benefits without fuss or 
bother.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is a clear example that there is a big mistake, that the 
Bloc Quebecois is proposing the wrong measures for senior 
citizens who are only asking for an efficient system. Yet, the 
Bloc is proposing, in these amendment, a process which is very 
complicated, very difficult and which makes no sense.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For the sake of the convenience of our seniors, especially the 
20,000 women on social benefits who would want to be able to 
make full and complete access, not only is this amendment 
absurd, but it would be counterproductive; it would be against 
their interests. Therefore, it deserves to be defeated.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak on this bill.
<P>
	As our country moves into the 21st century, many significant 
changes are occurring, changes that are of great concern to the 
citizens of our country. First, the demographics are changing 
quite dramatically. We have an aging population. In twenty 
years there will be three to four workers for every retiree.
<P>
	We are in a fiscal crisis. That crisis will only get worse. This 
government, as have preceding governments, has not had the 
courage to deal with that onerous problem, which seeks to sink 
the social programs that we have come to cherish in our country, 
social programs such as OAS, CPP, and UI. It is against this 
backdrop of crushing tax burdens to virtually every citizen that 
we see this bill come forth.
<P>
	It is therefore with great consternation, justified as it is, that 
our people on social programs, the aged, the infirm, and the poor 
ponder their future, most of whom have indeed worked very 
hard to be the backbone of this country. We saw today many of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12317"> 12317 </A></B>
<P>
those members here who  have fought and given their blood and 
their soul so that we may enjoy the freedom we have today in 
this the most beautiful country in the world. Some are well off 
but others, as I said before, just scrape by. This can similarly be 
said of our social programs, which are indeed scraping by also.
<P>
	All the people we have spoken about who are relying on our 
social programs ask themselves if they will have enough to 
survive. This is indeed a common denominator, whether we are 
speaking of someone from British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, 
or New Brunswick.
<P>
	Bill C-54, an act to amend OAS, CPP, the Children's Special 
Allowances Act, the UI act, and so on, is conspicuous not for 
what it does but for what it fails to do. It is an opportunity lost as 
we head into the era of the implosion of our social programs, for 
there are no great innovative ideas in this program.
<P>
	What is required is to put forth social programs on firm fiscal 
footing. That is not what this bill does at all. Rather, it is window 
dressing. While it will save the taxpayers some $10 million, 
which is to be applauded, it does nothing when one looks at the 
overall spending of social programs of some $80 billion.
<P>
	One of the great fallacies of Canadian politics is the myth that 
the Reform Party is against social programs and the poor. I 
recently had a conversation with a member of this House who 
said to me ``You in the Reform Party are really not for the poor at 
all, are you?'' Nothing can be further from the truth. In fact I say 
that we are the only political party in the House that wants to 
ensure that the poor and the needy are taken care of in this 
country. As I said before, the opposite is true, from the barbs we 
receive across the way.
<P>
	Every other party engages in a fiscal program that, due to its 
inability to get government program spending under control, 
crushes the ability of the government to pay for the social 
programs it offers to the Canadian people in a mythological 
fashion.
<P>
	Today government spending in general is about $120 billion. 
Because of the budget being put down now-and I do not lay the 
blame completely as the government's fault, because preceding 
governments have contributed significantly to it-what the 
Canadian public does not understand, and what has not been 
communicated adequately to it, is that in three years' time there 
will not be $120 billion to spend, but rather $102 billion. Where 
will the money be cut? Where will it be found? Those who will 
suffer are those who are poor. Those who are rich will not suffer 
because they have the money to take care of themselves. We in 
this party always attempt to be constructive, not merely 
obstructionist.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	Let us take a look at the big picture to see exactly what we are 
looking at. Old age security costs us $14.4 billion every year and 
is rising because of the demographic changes which I previously 
mentioned. GIS costs us $4.3 billion and is rising. CPP costs us 
$13.2 billion and UI costs us $19.1 billion and is rising. It is 
impossible to pay for that.
<P>
	Therefore we in this party have always been of the mindset, 
and we have put forth time and time again, that we need to target 
our social programs to those truly in need. What is so wrong 
with removing the social payments from those people who are in 
the upper third income bracket? If we explain to the Canadian 
public that the money it receives is borrowed from its children 
and grandchildren it will be very reasonable and understand the 
situation cannot continue.
<P>
	It is an absolute affront to engage in the generational blunder 
that we continue to foist upon coming generations by giving 
them a burden of debt which will significantly contribute to the 
negative environment in which they will live in the future.
<P>
	Another thing we in the Reform Party wish to do is focus on 
the family and allow the family to take care of itself. Families 
are better than any government at doing that.
<P>
	I ask my constituents what the biggest problem they have 
right now is. They are burdened with an unwieldy tax. Tax 
crushes their ability to take care of themselves, their children 
and other family members, particularly when they are in need. 
We should allow family members to take care of themselves. If 
we manage to invoke a tax decrease for them, and there are many 
ways to do that, they will be empowered to take care of 
themselves and their families.
<P>
	It is interesting to look back at the early 1990s. The 
government of the day reduced taxes. What happened? 
Government revenues increased. What happened after that? The 
government of the day started to tax wildly; an orgy of taxation 
which included the GST.
<P>
	When I visit the business community virtually every business 
person I speak to will say remove the GST. It is an unwieldy 
system as it stands. That money has to be found somewhere else. 
We do not advocate it being removed, we are saying streamline 
the GST, lower it, simplify it and there will be an added benefit 
because so much of it goes to bureaucracy in trying to manage 
the unwieldy taxation we have. Taxation in general, as I 
previously stated, is so unwieldy it is crushing the ability of 
Canadians to take care of themselves.
<P>
	I implore the hon. minister who is here today to go to the 
Canadian public again. He should not rely on bureaucracy, the 
people who appear in committee or in his office. I ask him to go 
to the Canadian people. He should walk out there to ask 
Canadians what their concerns are. He should ask them how we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12318"> 12318 </A></B>
<P>
can improve the current situation so that the poor people of 
Canada  and those who are bereft of hope can be taken care of. I 
implore the minister to do that. I know members of my party 
would be more than happy to help him to that end.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development was so happy to be 
able to hit the Bloc Quebecois that he did not read correctly the 
amendments that we are proposing. And to be able to hit even 
harder and with more gusto he is taking clause 2, instead of 
subclause (2) in clause 1.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development who is going 
to speak afterwards should apologize to my colleague, the hon. 
member for Argenteuil-Papineau.
<P>
	White hair is a sign of wisdom, because the amendment that 
we proposed is not the one that the minister mentioned. We are 
not opposed to speeding up the process, on the contrary. What 
we are opposed to, however, is senior citizens being required, 
without good reason, to deal with voice mail services. Yes, we 
are going to oppose part of these reforms, but before addressing 
the specifics of this bill, we have to say that it is presented as 
trivial, simply intended to streamline services for senior 
citizens or handicapped persons.
<P>
	The truth is, under its trivial appearances, this bill contains 
provisions that we find very serious, because we believe that 
they open the door to abuse, and we are going to say so.
<P>
	I proposed in these series of amendments that we revert to the 
current Act, under section 16, Reconsiderations and Appeals, 
because the new clause from this defender ``extraordinaire'' of 
Canada's senior citizens introduces a 90-day appeal period 
where there was none.
<P>
	When we talk to senior citizens, seniors of all ages, it is 
important to remember to give them whatever time they need. 
We have to remember that these people often need help and are 
not able to reach the public servants who could give them access 
to a minister or an appeal board. So, we do not agree that there 
should be an appeal period, particularly since it is an 
amendment to the old legislation and we do not see why we 
should go backward like that.
<P>
	Obviously, under the new amendment, the minister can allow 
a longer period for an appeal. He will decide whether there will 
be one or not. Generally speaking, under this bill, the minister 
will have a lot of discretion, and discretion in this context does 
not mean that he will not announce certain things, but that he 
will act as he pleases.
<P>
	We think that where elderly persons and handicapped persons 
in particular are concerned, they must have as many avenues of 
redress as possible. They should not have to rely on the 
discretion of the minister, even if he is well intentioned and says 
that he wants to accelerate the process. The discretion is left to 
any minister who, at one point, could abuse this power.
<P>
	Once again, I ask the Minister of Human Resources 
Development to apologize for the harsh words he had for my 
colleague. I want him to know that he is not the only one who has 
ideas and that he is far from being the only one to come to the 
defence of the elderly. I do not want to question his intentions, 
but our role is to see to what excesses these amendments could 
lead. When one knows that the whole act is based on an 
application which will be handled by public servants over the 
phone, you have to be extremely vigilant. This is our 
responsibility. I would even go as far as to say that this is our 
duty.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, our concerns with this bill as it now stands with 
its proposed amendments relate to a closer examination of the 
bill which reveals some aspects of it are contrary to the public 
interest because they involve a reduction in bureaucratic 
accountability. Our proposed amendment is an attempt to 
correct the most flagrant of these violations of the public 
interest.
<P>
	I will first speak on the proposed Bloc amendments. Grouping 
three motions deals with a combination of two review tribunals 
into one. At the present time there are two review tribunals, one 
under the old age security and one under the Canada pension 
plan. Bill C-54 proposes to combine the two. The Bloc motion is 
against the idea.
<P>
	As Reformers we are against waste caused by duplicity and 
extra waste of time which will result in extra costs as well. As 
usual, when extra labour is involved taxpayers will find 
themselves involved in paying more taxes. I fear in this case it 
will be a waste of overall tax dollars. Hence, Reform is opposed 
to the Bloc motion to retain the two tribunals but is in favour of 
creating one panel from two. This suggests a more accountable 
spending of our tax dollars. Hence, less government is better 
government as I see it.
<P>
	I will digress a bit and give an example. Government is 
expensive. Costs rise and we have more bureaucracy. It follows 
that if we try to eliminate unnecessary numbers even in the 
Chamber we do not have to increase the numbers of MPs to have 
good government. If we try to decrease the numbers we are 
looking at a government which will be just as effective, maybe 
even more.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12319"> 12319 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us look at some of the statistics. According to my figures 
the United States has about 270 million people and about 435 
representatives. We have 27 million people and 295 
representatives.
<P>
	I was recently in the United States talking to some American 
citizens, asking whether they feel they had adequate 
representation. They told me they felt adequately represented. I 
am coming back to less government which we are addressing 
today.
<P>
	If the new electoral boundaries act becomes law we will have 
even more representatives in the House. I am aware that my 
province of British Columbia stands to benefit from the increase 
in numbers. However, when we look at the costs of roughly 
$500,000 per member for office budget, travel costs, telephone, 
salary, et cetera, it is an enormous cost to the taxpayer. If we can 
make do without that, I think we should.
<P>
	If there is less government interference in Canadian lives it is 
more than possible Canadians will be happier. I have often heard 
expressed in my riding that people would like less interference 
by government in their lives. Consequently it follows that less 
government is better government. It will enable us to cut the fat.
<P>
	I will use an example to help express my feelings. In March 
1991 the report of the Auditor General of Canada to the Senate 
made recommendations. In the report to the Senate and the 
House of Commons on matters of joint interest these 
recommendations include in general terms where savings could 
be found in five areas.
<P>
	It suggested a greater collaboration between the two Houses 
on a wide range of matters; for instance, the Senate buses and the 
busses we use. We could have one system. Others included 
contracting out of various services, review and reduction of 
service levels, increased transparency of House expenditures 
and efficiency improvements.
<P>
	Again, what am I talking about? We are returning to cost 
efficiency. We are returning to saving taxpayers money. I have 
to oppose the Bloc amendment and agree with the government 
one at this time, that we do condense and go to one overall body.
<P>
	I make this comparison mainly to point out that wherever 
possible in government matters it is our responsibility as 
legislators to show accountability through cutting out 
duplication, no matter where it occurs. Taxpayers would feel we 
are making an effort to watch the spending of tax dollars while at 
the same time maintaining efficiency and responsibility.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Could I ask the member 
if she is debating Motions Nos. 1, 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 16 and 17?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> I am on Motion No. 3 right now, Madam 
Speaker.
<P>
	In answer to the Bloc proposal, I must conclude that we 
should address accountability and efficiency at the same time. 
Reformers prefer that one tribunal should operate within the 
existing moneys allotted to the Canadian pension plan tribunal. I 
would hope the government would address the wisdom of such a 
move.
<P>
	Under clause 46 of the bill, the government wishes to credit 
into the Canada pension plan account extra money from the 
consolidated revenue fund to help administer the Canadian 
Pension Plan Act. Again I stress that Reformers would like to 
see this new tribunal function with the existing funding it 
currently employs.
<P>
	If Canadians are having to make do with less and work harder 
for less there is no reason why a government tribunal should not 
find ways to do the same. These are hard times we are into today. 
While we would like to be optimistic, it is incumbent on us to 
reinforce in the Canadian electorate that we do care and are 
sincere in addressing cutbacks. Since it is the public's money 
being administered here there must be some accountability in 
the process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to address the issue before us. I will focus quite 
distinctly on the motions in this group which the Bloc is 
proposing.
<P>
	In this grouping we have an interesting juxtaposition of 
Liberal philosophy where the Bloc members want to maintain 
the two separate boards that are conducting reviews and the 
Liberals are proposing to combine the two existing groups into 
one.
<P>
	The comment I will make is appropriate to the philosophy of 
the government. It is looking at who is administering the 
programs and trying to reduce these numbers, as it is in some 
other bills that are floating around these days.
<P>
	The Liberals are talking about reducing the number of 
members on the board of the CBC, and other tribunals and 
appointed boards. They are reducing the number of people 
which is a move, in most instances, that could be applauded. 
However, one needs to ask the question whether it is being done 
arbitrarily and capriciously or whether it is actually based on a 
fair assessment of the workload. The important factor being 
omitted here is how many people can do the work efficiently.
<P>
	The missing question, whether talking about the CBC board, 
this tribunal or any of the other boards it is proposed to reduce is, 
has there been a rational study of the actual amount of work that 
needs to be done? Also, what would be the actual savings 
accomplished by it?
<P>
	The Bloc is proposing we keep these two boards separate. To 
the best of our knowledge the workload these people would be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12320"> 12320 </A></B>
<P>
carrying would be such that the amendment the Bloc is 
proposing is not justifiable. There should be one panel instead of 
two. There would be a  certain degree of overlap and that overlap 
could be avoided if we were to combine them.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	On a very broad spectrum, we need to address very carefully 
the administration of these social programs. As one of my 
colleagues already outlined, total government expenditures are 
some $160 billion a year, $40 billion of which is interest. The 
debt is continuing to grow. Even under the present Liberal's 
plan, we will still be adding $32.9 billion to the debt.
<P>
	You do not have to be a great mathematician to compute that. 
If you add $30 billion at current interest rates, you will probably 
be adding in the neighbourhood of $3 billion to $5 billion a year 
in interest. As soon as you do that, there will be less money for 
social programs. It is $160 billion total, $40 billion of interest 
and interestingly a little more than $50 billion on the four main 
programs of old age security, Canada pension, guaranteed 
income supplement and UI. These programs need to be cut as 
well as the administration of them.
<P>
	While we applaud the government's move to reduce the 
number of boards that do these reviews, we are reducing the 
crew members on the <I>Titanic</I> as it is most surely going down. It 
is a small and ever so gingerly taken step in the right direction 
but it does not address the real problem. We need to bring down 
total spending in these programs. It must be done dramatically. 
It must be done quickly so that we do not lose it all.
<P>
	I want to say one other thing. Undoubtedly the Liberals as our 
opposition would be declaring: ``The Reformers want to cut 
these programs''. We do not. I have said this often. How I wish 
that the Conservative government and the Liberal government 
before that one would have been diligent in managing the fiscal 
affairs so that we did not have this huge debt.
<P>
	If we did not have a debt so large that we are obligated to pay 
$40 to $45 billion per year on interest, we would have more than 
enough money to look after all the needs of all of these people. 
The numbers declare it. It is $52 billion for these four programs 
and $40 to $45 billion for interest.
<P>
	We are talking about cutting these programs because we 
cannot cut the interest. It is not an option. If the previous 
governments would have been diligent in managing our affairs 
so that we would not have this debt load, we would be able to 
carry on with a very good solid social programs. Management is 
what is really critical here.
<P>
	I encourage the members of the House to be opposed, with all 
due respect to my friends from the Bloc, to these amendments 
because we do achieve a small efficiency by going to a single 
board. At the same time I must emphasize strongly that it is not 
even the tip of the iceberg. It is one chip on the top of the tip of 
the iceberg. We are missing the whole point here.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 2</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-54, in Clause 3, be amended by striking out line 21, on page 2, 
and substituting the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``on the first day of the fourth month after the month in which this Act is assented 
to.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I move this motion for reasons of 
fairness and efficiency, which is the proper combination we 
have attempted to apply throughout Bill C-54.
<P>
	When the bill was first introduced in the fall of 1994 it 
contained provisions that made reference to April 1, 1995 as the 
date that notification for the application would be made for 
those to have the retroactivity provision reduced from five years 
to one year.
<P>
	April 1 has come and gone. Therefore in the cause of fairness, 
the amendment that we moved which I will read for the 
enlightenment of members is that we would replace April 1, 
1995 with the comment or the phrase ``on the first day of the 
fourth month after the month in which this act is assented to''. It 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12321"> 12321 </A></B>
<P>
is a somewhat complicated legal way of saying that people will 
have three months beyond the passage of this bill in which they 
would be informed of the new provisions so that they would be 
able to make their plans and their applications.
<P>
	The old age security system has had a somewhat unusual or 
eccentric provision which gave people five years in which to 
make application for their OAS. It meant that those who were 
able to receive advice from various experts could delay making 
application for tax purposes for an extended period of time. This 
provision brings the bill into line with other provisions of the 
Canada pension plan and other acts. There would be the standard 
one-year provision in which people could make application for 
their OAS. We would give them three months to make that 
application through the proper information circles.
<P>
	We are attempting to ensure that the five-year retroactivity 
period is reduced to one year so there is no loophole that allows 
people to get a tax advantage. At the same time it ensures a 
proper period of information for those who want to have at least 
one year beyond 65 years to make application for their benefits. 
Therefore I recommend this motion to the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
perhaps the minister of Human Resources Development expects 
that, inspired by what he said earlier, we will want to maintain 
April 1 as the implementation date of the act. We will support 
this amendment. Considering the delays which occurred, as 
usual, our position being a reasonable one we will support this 
amendment.
<P>
	However, I would like to take the time at my disposal to reply 
to the hon. member of the Reform Party who criticized earlier 
our proposal to maintain the two appeal or revision tribunals, 
that is one for the old age pension plan and the other one for the 
Canada pension plan. As hon. members know, these two plans 
are very different. They are not financed with the same funds 
since the Canada pension plan is paid for by workers who 
contribute to its fund while the old age pension is financed by all 
taxpayers.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	As we know, the government's intention is perhaps to merge 
the two plans in some way as announced in the budget speech. 
We believe however that having only one board is far from being 
the best solution. I believe this has nothing to do with the costs 
linked to the board as my hon. colleague said earlier. The fact is 
those two boards will have to deal with cases that are very 
different.
<P>
	Some witnesses before the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development explained to us how difficult it was for 
handicapped persons to be heard by the board. Unfortunately, 
the model that was chosen and the merger will not be based 
basically on the old age pension appeal board but on that of the 
Canada pension plan.
<P>
	We believe that their merging is not a good idea. We do not 
think it will lead to savings. Quite the contrary, we think that in 
the interests of seniors who will have to deal with a board that 
handicapped persons were not satisfied with, and in the interests 
of the handicapped who have a right to a better process than what 
is currently available to them, it would be better to maintain two 
boards and to improve the existing Canada pension plan appeals 
board.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, Motion No. 2 is a motion to move the start up time of 
the amendments in the bill. The big concern we have is that the 
vote on Motion No. 2 will come before the vote on most of the 
proposed amendments to the bill.
<P>
	The position members of the House might take on this bill as 
to whether it should come into effect at all surely would depend 
on all the motions being voted on and then the House making a 
judgment as to whether the bill should be put into effect. In 
Motion No. 2 we are being asked to put the bill into effect 
without knowing what might be in the bill, because there are 
several other amendments that will then be voted on.
<P>
	On that basis I suggest the method of dealing with the bill is 
not very logical and that the motion is not appropriately placed. 
I suggest the minister consider moving the motion to a more 
appropriate place in the bill.

	She said: Madam Speaker, clause 20 is entitled ``Access to 
privileged information'' and reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Except as provided in this section, all information with respect to any 
applicant or beneficiary or the spouse of any applicant or beneficiary, 
obtained in the course of the administration of this Act, is privileged and no 
person shall knowingly, except as provided in this Act, make available or 
allow to be made available any such information to any person not legally 
entitled to it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	The next paragraph allows the Departments of National 
Revenue, Finance, Supply and Services, Canada Employment 
and Immigration Commission, Statistics Canada or Canada Post 
access to the information.
<P>
	We do not agree with Canada Post having access to the 
information. We were not told, we were not explained 
adequately why privileged information could be available to 
Canada Post, especially since Canada Post, through several of 
its components, is now broken up, and we know the government 
tendency in that respect. So, in this amendment and the others, 
we oppose having privileged information available to Canada 
Post.
<P>
	I must say that we hesitated and that it is with reluctance that 
we accept privileged information being available to the agencies 
or departments that we have mentioned.
<P>
	We are living in an age where the danger of disclosure of 
private information is ever increasing due to the interconnection 
of government data bases and its potential consequences. In 
these days and ages we are running the risk of coming under the 
watchful eye of Big Brother, as described by a famous novelist.
<P>
	Because of some arguments that were made, we concurred 
with the proposition, although reluctantly, and I wanted to make 
that quite clear. Again, a very large part of this legislation will 
be managed by phone. A very large portion of the information 
will be transmitted by computer. In this age of technology, there 
is always the  risk that the information will fall into the hands of 
people who could put it to bad use.
<P>
	Consequently, we are firmly opposed to giving Canada Post 
access to privileged information, considering the changes made.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, this motion is the first of a set of three amendments that 
would remove the minister's ability to disclose limited client 
information to Canada Post.
<P>
	I am truly surprised that members opposite have brought this 
amendment at report stage. It reveals a lack of understanding of 
the purpose of this provision of Bill C-54 and perhaps-and I 
underline ``perhaps''-an unwillingness to prepare for the 
future.
<P>
	The government realizes the importance of using new 
technologies to provide better service to Canadians. This is 
especially important with regard to our income security 
programs for seniors. The provision of Bill C-54 that the 
opposition seeks to delete would enable the minister, under very 
restrictive conditions, to release limited information about 
clients to Canada Post where it is necessary for the 
administration of old age security, the Canada pension plan, or 
the Children's Allowance Act, as the case may be.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	It is widely recognized that there are certain advantages to 
having a specialist work for us. One could hardly doubt that 
Canada Post is a specialist in the field of getting letters out to 
Canadians. This is exactly the reason for this provision.
<P>
	Bill C-54 would allow the department to transmit the text of 
letters electronically to a Canada Post processing centre, where 
computers would print them and machines would place the 
letters in envelopes. Clients would receive information about 
their old age security or Canada pension benefits more quickly. 
The department would save money. Most people in my riding 
would think this is a very good idea.
<P>
	Moreover, the confidentiality of the information clients 
provide to the government is protected in several ways. Canada 
Post employees are bound to maintain the confidentiality of the 
mail they deliver, whether they receive the mail in a red 
mailbox, on a street corner, or electronically by computer. Bill 
C-54 could never change that.
<P>
	The Old Age Security Act, the Canada pension plan, and the 
Children's Special Allowances Act provide that it is an offence 
punishable on summary conviction to disclose client 
information to anyone not entitled to have that information. Bill 
C-54 even strengthens this protection by extending it from just 
employees of Her Majesty to any person who may have access to 
client information. This portion of Bill C-54 allows the  
government to provide service to clients more effectively and at 
a lower cost.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12323"> 12323 </A></B>
<P>
	In spite of opposition attempts to raise the spectre of personal 
information being sold to those who have no rights to it, Bill 
C-54 actually strengthens the government's ability to protect 
clients' information. It is actually the opposition motion that 
could and would jeopardize the client confidentiality.
<P>
	Canada Post is bound by law to protect that confidentiality. 
The opposition would have us open this up to other suppliers 
with the legal safeguards. Senior citizens, who would benefit 
greatly from the changes proposed by this bill, have a right to the 
facts, the correct facts. This bill would allow the government to 
send mail electronically through Canada Post in much the same 
way it currently puts letters in mailboxes.
<P>
	The government is committed to finding efficiency where it 
can and to using new technology where possible to save money. 
This bill does not provide unrestricted access to information to 
Canada Post employees or to anyone else. However, this bill 
does provide adequate and even stringent penalties for illegal 
disclosure of information.
<P>
	Bill C-54 provides sound, appropriate, and highly desirable 
changes to the acts governing our income security programs. We 
have all discussed in detail the concerns raised by the 
opposition, which in some way was reflected in Motion No. 4. 
Motions 13 and 15 seek to do the same thing to the Canada 
pension plan and to the Children's Special Allowances Act.
<P>
	For this and many other reasons I suggest these motions be 
withdrawn and that all members support the speedy passage of 
Bill C-54.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the hon. member who spoke 
before me. I am very glad to hear that there are some stringent 
prohibitions on the use of personal information under this act; 
that was very reassuring. I think we all share the concern that 
underlies the Bloc motions we are discussing. We do have to 
guard against government intrusion into our personal lives, 
especially in an unwarranted way that is not serving our interest 
but is intruding upon our individual liberties.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	I was very interested in the Bloc speaker who was concerned 
about personal information falling into the wrong hands. That is 
a very legitimate concern in Canada.
<P>
	I suggest the Bloc look at another bill before the House, Bill 
C-68, in which there is a great deal of personal information 
being amassed by a bill before the House, very personal 
questions being asked in a process of registration and 
determination. I suggest that if Bloc members really have a 
concern about personal information falling into the wrong hands 
they should be equally concerned about Bill C-68.
<P>
	This is an issue that was properly raised. I was interested to 
hear the remarks of my hon. friend from the government side.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, obviously, I fully support my colleague for Mercier. 
However, the Bloc Quebecois cannot support the provisions of 
Bill C-54 aiming to change access to some information because 
the government intends to increase the number of departments, 
organizations or even individuals that will have access to 
personal information used in the administration of the acts that 
will be amended by this bill.
<P>
	Under the previous act, that is to say the one that is currently 
in force, the following organizations have access to this 
information: the Department of National Revenue, the 
Department of Finance, the Department of Supply and Services, 
the Canada Employment and Immigration Commission, 
Statistics Canada, and the provincial authority. Those 
organizations can have access to that information as long as it 
deals with the entitlement of beneficiaries or the amount of 
benefit, or if their disclosure is essential to the legislation's 
application.
<P>
	One has to be very careful, when trying to obtain personal 
information on senior citizens since it could be used for other 
purposes. We have to protect our seniors against potential abuse. 
The government did not prove that disclosing that privileged 
information was necessary and essential. The government 
always has to prove to senior citizens that the information 
collected will not be used abusively.
<P>
	Governments interfere more and more in the privacy of 
people, as we saw recently in the Bristow case. It should be 
pointed out that the information provisions of Bill C-54 add the 
following organizations to those departments which can have 
access to such information: the Canada Post Corporation, a 
decision which we oppose; the Correctional Service of Canada; 
the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police; the 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada; members of 
Parliament who intervene on behalf of applicants or 
beneficiaries; any other person designated by the minister as a 
health care professional; and the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, as regards the administration of the above-mentioned 
acts or any other federal act administered by that department.
<P>
	Consequently, some information will be accessible to a larger 
number of departments, including Canada Post. The government 
claims that it is a good thing to include that corporation, on the 
grounds that, through the use of new techniques, it could help 
accelerate the processing of cheques to pensioners. It is obvious 
that the government is experiencing enormous difficulties 
solving its administrative problems. However, it has not 
demonstrated the need to transmit information to Canada Post.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12324"> 12324 </A></B>
<P>
	Such demonstration is essential if the Bloc Quebecois is to 
support that section of the bill. We particularly object to the 
inclusion of that corporation, because it is increasingly more 
present in the lives of Canadians. It has increasingly more 
information on each of us. Although the collection of that 
information is often necessary, the government must always 
justify beyond any doubt such new intrusions in the private lives 
of citizens.
<P>
	The government feels that the changes to the disclosure 
provisions do not represent a major departure from the current 
rules. The Bloc Quebecois does not agree with that statement; 
indeed, the communication of confidential information to the 
Canada Post Corporation is a major change. Even though these 
changes must comply with the Privacy Act, we feel that it is not 
acceptable to include Canada Post.

<P>

<B><A NAME="12325"> 12325 </A></B>
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, our purpose is not to delete this 
clause altogether but to amend it. The one-year period for 
collecting overpayments is maintained and the minister is 
obliged to remit the amount owing in the cases specified. 
Consequently, subsection 37(2) is maintained and the one-year 
statute of limitation continues to apply, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) Where a person has received or obtained a benefit payment to which the 
person is not entitled, or a benefit payment in excess of the amount of that 
benefit payment or the excess amount, as the case may be, constitutes a debt 
due to Her Majesty and may be recovered in proceedings commenced</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) at any time, where that person made a wilful misrepresentation or 
committed fraud for the purpose of receiving or obtaining that amount or 
excess amount; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) in any case where paragraph (a) does not apply, at any time before the 
end of the fiscal year immediately following the fiscal year in which that 
amount or excess amount was received or obtained.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In his report, the Auditor General estimates that debts arising 
from pension overpayments are occurring in the range of $120 
million to $220 million each year. According to the Auditor 
General, past efforts to prevent and detect overpayments have 
been minimal and largely ineffective. These figures appear in 
the Auditor General's report of 1993, on pages 483 and 486.
<P>
	The Auditor General also indicated that ``over 90 per cent of 
appeals relate to claims for Canada Pension Plan disability 
benefits. Over the past five years, the percentage of disability 
claims denied rose steadily and now stands at 44 per cent. Over 
the same period, the percentage of those denials that were 
appealed also increased, from 36 per cent in 1988-89 to 60 per 
cent in 1992-93. Prior-year statistics indicate that the majority 
of these appeals will be successful''. These figures appear in the 
1993 Auditor General's report on page 488.
<P>
	Furthermore, the Auditor General estimates overpayments for 
disability pensions alone at $35 million. A provision that would 
allow the minister to suspend benefits during the appeal process, 
together with the increase in the number of appeals justified and 
filed by the department, might be seen as an underhanded way to 
reduce the number of overpayments.
<P>
	Similarly, the decision to repeal this section and thus repeal 
the statute of limitation of one year on recovery of 
overpayments must have been dictated by the government's 
inability to process appeals on time.
<P>
	The government appears to be incapable of doing anything 
other than tightening its rules and increasing the number of 
appeals to avoid overpayment. Seniors will therefore be the 
victims of the government's inability to resolve its 
administrative problems.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, following the delay in issuing guaranteed 
income supplement cheques for seniors, which occurred near 
the end of April, I raised the following question in the House 
regarding the government's inability to manage files regarding 
seniors on April 27:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Since last Friday, Communication Québec, MP's offices and even the PMO 
have been flooded with calls from obviously very concerned pensioners. 
According to the Consumer Help Office, approximately 258,000 pensioners 
will see their old age pension cheques reduced by 50 per cent.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>How can the minister explain that so many seniors received or will receive 
this year a pension cheque not including the guaranteed income supplement to 
which they are entitled?''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I also asked the minister a supplementary question, which was 
the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Speaker, does the minister deny that the Department of Human 
Resources Development's difficulty in processing requests is creating 
hardship this year, mostly among seniors?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development's answer was 
alarming, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Speaker, if in some cases there have been overpayments or problems 
that do not fit the regulations, of course we will be sending out these letters. 
But to make the kinds of exaggerated claims the hon. member has, purely to 
frighten and scare people, is frankly not the responsibility of a good member 
of Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In the May 3 issue of the <I>Journal de Montréal</I>, headlines such 
as ``Vraie course contre la montre pour le supplément de 
revenu''-race against time for the income 
supplement-clearly expose the problems facing seniors with 
low incomes. They are being penalized by the government's 
inability to fix its bureaucratic problems.
<P>
	Journalist Monique Richer mentioned in her article that 
people who are 65 years old or older and who did not receive 
their guaranteed income supplement at the end of the month of 
April have been lining up since the beginning of the week at Guy 
Favreau Complex to find out what is going on.
<P>
	For all these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois therefore proposes 
that the one-year limit on overpayments not occasioned by 
fraud be retained-there would be no limit in the case of 
fraud-so as to force the government to improve the 
management of the program and not unduly penalize seniors, 
who could have to pay back major sums a number of years after 
an error had been made. It would also force the minister to 
forgive overpayments in the following instances: when a debt 
cannot be recovered sufficiently quickly; when the costs of 
recovery are likely to be at least as high as the debt itself; when 
repayment would cause undue hardship for the debtor; and when 
the debt is the result of incorrect advice or an administrative 
error.
<P>
	In closing, Bill C-54 provides in these instances that the 
minister ``may'' reimburse. We propose that there be no 
discretionary power in the above instances in order to protect the 
interests of seniors.
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
thank you for the opportunity to reply to the remarks of the hon. 
member concerning the portion of Bill C-54 which removes the 
time bar on the recovery of overpayments made under the old 
age security program.
<P>
	Let us begin by laying out the facts of the current provisions 
which have led the government to bring the changes contained in 
Bill C-54.
<P>
	The fairness of our current system of income security for 
senior citizens is marred slightly by the fact that the programs 
within this policy area often deal with overpayments somewhat 
differently. This results in a situation which can be confusing 
and therefore not all together equitable.
<P>
	For instance, restrictions placed on the recovery of old age 
security overpayments have resulted in some clients retaining 
benefits to which they were not legally entitled.
<P>
	One such restriction is the time bar which limits the 
government's ability to recover overpayments to amounts 
received by clients in the current or immediately preceding 
fiscal years.
