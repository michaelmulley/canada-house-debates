</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently the auditor general does not have the authority to 
audit the Canadian Wheat Board.  Over the years, the auditor 
general has provided a valuable service to Canadians by pointing 
out waste in federal government as well as showing where 
Canadians have received value for their money.

legislation that would make the Canadian Wheat Board more

later the sexual offender has received a pardon.

apply for a position of trust with respect to children. This bill 
is in response to a public concern and a large petition that was 
received and presented in the last Parliament.  It is aimed to 
better protect our children from potential abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is quite appropriate that it be introduced in the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today is National Child Day and I am pleased to present 
seven petitions with the signature of 150 Canadians from the 
provinces of Ontario and British Columbia.  They are concerned 
that by ratifying and implementing the United Nations convention 
on the rights of the child that government bureaucrats and courts 
will be legally entitled to determine what is in the best 
interests of the child, not the parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners believe that the Government of Canada is 
creating a bureaucracy to police parents and enforce the 
guidelines in the UN charter, which has never been approved by 
Parliament.  Not only are parental rights being undermined by 
implementing this UN convention, but they are concerned that it 
will create greater incentives for families to abrogate their 
parental responsibilities to the state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the petitioners request Parliament to address their 
concerns by supporting my Private Members Motion No. 33 which 
will add protection of parental rights and responsibilities to 
the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the second set of petitions I would like to present 
comes with signatures of 52 Canadians from Manitoba and British 
Columbia.  It is most appropriate for these petitions to be 
introduced on national child day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These citizens of Canada support retention of section 43 of the 
Criminal Code which states: “Every school teacher, parent or 
person standing in the place of a parent is justified in using 
force by way of correction toward a pupil or child who is under 
his care if the force does not exceed what is reasonable under 
the circumstances”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners believe the government is weakening the role of 
parents in determining what is in the best interests of the child 
by continuing to fund research and court challenges by people who 
advocate the removal of section 43.  So your petitioners request 
Parliament to affirm the duty of parents to responsibly raise 
their children according to their own conscience and beliefs and 
retain section 43 in Canada's Criminal Code as it is currently 
worded.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I have received a letter from the hon.

emergency debate.  I will permit him a few short sentences to 
outline what it is all about and we will go from there.

for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  What is actually needed is a statement of 
the reason for the request, not necessarily what is in the 
letter.  I have already read the letter so it is just to give us 
an idea of what this debate would be all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I seek leave to present a 
motion under Standing Order 52(1) and 52(2) for the adjournment 
of the House for the purpose of discussing a specific and 
important matter that requires the urgent consideration of all 
hon. members, the current postal situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is appropriate that we examine all the issues that affect 
every one of the 31 million Canadians in this country.  I am not 
asking that we specifically debate something like back to work 
legislation but rather that we should examine the impact and 
ramifications of this current action, that we examine all the 
different possibilities in terms of what might be appropriate 
actions to take to reduce the harmful impact of this and 
collectively arrive at some decisions as to how we may best serve 
the interests of all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
moments ago I received unanimous consent to introduce a motion. 
The Chair then sought unanimous consent to pass the motion.  I 
refer the Speaker to section 552(1) of Beauchesne's: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every matter is determined in the House of Commons upon a 
question put by the Speaker, on a proposition submitted by a 
Member, and resolved either in the affirmative or negative as the 
case may be. 
This proposition, called a motion, is a proposal moved by one 
Member, in accordance with certain well established rules, that 
the House do something, or order something to be done or express 
an opinion with regard to some matter.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore put it to you, Mr. Speaker, that a voice vote should 
have been held on this motion rather than unanimous consent, 
which was already given in the introduction of the motion and 
which is not necessary to approve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Let me go through the whole thing.  My 
understanding is that this is what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member asked “I would like to seek the unanimous 
consent to move this motion”.  At that point I asked the House 
“does the hon. member have unanimous consent to put the 
motion?”  At that point I heard no one dissenting.  Therefore 
the hon. member had the right to put the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member put the motion I again sought unanimous 
consent.  There was not unanimous consent at that time.  If 
anyone dissents then that dies right there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member does bring up an interesting point that this is 
a motion.  At that point, after I had asked whether there was 
unanimous consent and there was a “no”, my clerk informs me, 
and I agree with the rules, I should have put this to a voice 
vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because I did not do that, it is my fault.  I, as the Speaker, 
made this error.  What I am going to do now, with the permission 
of the House, is do it again.  I invite hon. members to take it 
from there.  I will deal with this the way it should have been 
dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has sought unanimous consent to put the motion. 
Is that correct? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I believe you have gone back 
too far, if I may suggest that, because unanimous consent to put 
the motion was already given by the House.  The part which you 
have to go back to is the moving of the motion itself.  That is 
where we were at.  That was where the error occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I did have unanimous consent to put the 
motion. I am proceeding from that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I am going to ask the House is it the pleasure of the House 
to adopt the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that, as happy as I and my colleagues are to support 
the motion of congratulations to the Queen and Prince Phillip on

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK45">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from November 19 consideration of Bill C-4, an 
act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts, as reported (with 
amendment) from the committee; and of Motion No. 1. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak in support of Motion No. 1 moved 
by my colleague from Yorkton—Melville.  I originally had not 
intended to intervene in the debate at this point, but after 
listening yesterday to the debate in the House and to some of the 
comments on the government side I was motivated to take part in 
the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can speak to the issue before us, the Canadian Wheat Board 
bill, with some authority, being the third generation in my 
family to be involved in the farming profession.  My family held 
a wheat board permit probably since the creation of the Canadian 
Wheat Board and certainly since the creation of the monopoly of 
the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an important consideration to note as we take part in 
the debate because of some of the interventions made by the other 
side, in particular by the member for Hamilton—Wentworth 
yesterday, on the credibility and the willingness of members on 
both sides to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like it understood that my constituents and I support 
the concept of single desk selling for prairie grain farmers. 
Producers in my constituency feel strongly about that and would 
wish to support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Producers in my constituency are simply asking for fairness and 
equality with grain producers in others parts of Canada.  They 
are asking for transparency and accountability on the part of the 
board and an end to the secrecy and the closed situation we have 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the interests of my producers in preserving a single desk 
selling agency and their desire for transparency and 
accountability could be achieved if the government had chosen to 
go that route.  We could preserve the Canadian Wheat Board and 
provide farmers with choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Canadian Wheat Board were acting in the best interests of 
producers, producers would use the Canadian Wheat Board.  The 
problem is that we are setting up a situation that will 
inevitably destroy the Canadian Wheat Board.  Farmers will 
continue to fight for choices and options.  Eventually it will 
mean the destruction of the wheat board and the loss of the 
concept of the single desk selling agency.  That would be a real 
change.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard a lot of discussion in the debate yesterday about who 
the Canadian Wheat Board currently works for and who it will work 
for under this bill if it goes forward.  It is pretty obvious to 
all of us grain producers that the Canadian Wheat Board as far 
back as World War II was not working in the best interest of 
farmers and some of my colleagues raised that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our contribution to the war effort in western Canada, we 
probably contributed more through the loss of revenue on grain 
sales than what the national energy program drew out of western 
Canada. There was a tremendous loss in revenue to the western 
Canadian producer. Yet there does not seem to have been any 
recognition of that and certainly no recognition here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are all kinds of other instances where the Canadian Wheat 
Board has been used as a foreign policy tool and even a domestic 
internal policy tool, much to the detriment of the Canadian 
producer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to respond to the comments made by the hon. 
member for Hamilton—Wentworth yesterday who took great grievance 
because of his impression that somebody over here said that he 
had no right to speak on this issue.  As a member of this House, 
he certainly had every right to speak on this issue, but the 
question has to be about the credibility of those who are 
speaking on the issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters:</B>  My apologies for that error, Mr. 
Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I feel quite confident that the member protects his 
right vigorously to make choices in the way he markets his 
products.  Therefore, I think he lacks some credibility when he 
tries to impose on western farmers something that he does not 
wish to have imposed upon himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  That's right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  A double standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters:</B>  Of course, if we keep going in that 
same direction, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Natural Resources, I believe from the province of Newfoundland, I 
doubt has ever sold a bushel of wheat in his life as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of agriculture, engaged in the profession of 
agriculture, enjoys a wheat board fully elected and fully 
accountable, yet he wishes to impose something different on the 
farmers of western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is a question of credibility of those who speak and 
what they are trying to impose on others that they would not 
impose on themselves.  I think that is an important point to 
make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Natural Resources and the Minister responsible 
for the Canadian Wheat Board, being from the prairies at least 
gives him some credibility, but I would question whether the 
minister has ever sold a bushel of wheat in his life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to perhaps forgive the government a little bit there 
because truly Liberals on the Canadian prairies are becoming as 
scarce as prairie chickens on the prairies these days.  I have to 
understand the limited choice the government had when they chose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to respond to the comments by the hon. member for 
Hamilton—Wentworth about the preamble not being important.  As 
one of my colleagues pointed out, the courts have long been 
famous for using the preamble to determine the intention of the 
legislation when they are drafting the bill.  I do not think 
there is anywhere where that is more apparent than in the courts 
and the rewriting of the Canadian human rights bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly an effort to clarify the intention of the legislatures 
in the preamble would be taken into consideration and an is an 
extremely important point and not to be ignored. 
Our intention is not smoke and mirrors.  It is certainly 
honourable.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to also question the effort by the government through 
this bill to protect from legal action the officers of the 
Canadian Wheat Board and the secrecy, the lack of accountability 
through access to information or the auditor general.  I think 
this effort to protect the officers of the board in good measure 
is a result of the actions of my colleague from Portage—Lisgar 
in his efforts to bring some accountability and transparency to 
the board.  I do not think that there is really support for those 
kinds of actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the lack of time, I simply say in conclusion that, in 
all sincerity, we are not asking for anything in this Wheat Board 
Act that producers in the rest of Canada do not have already.  In 
the interest of fairness, I think it would be reasonable to 
provide some accountability, some transparency to a board that 
works for the farmers.

about the western grain situation.  I wonder if they would take 
the very same position if we talked about the auto pact, that no 
one from the west should be able to speak about the auto pact or 
no one from the west should be able to talk about other factors 
that affect this nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely no question that Ontario produces a 
tremendous amount of grain.  In my riding I would suggest to you 
that that grain is produced and the certificates from that grain 
have to be confirmed by the Canadian Wheat Board.  The Canadian 
Wheat Board, without question, has a tremendous effect on the 
grain farmers in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new law now before Parliament is based on many months of 
consultation with farmers, including public hearings across the 
prairies.  This proposed legislation embodies the biggest changes 
in western grain marketing in a half century.  Throughout its 
history, the Canadian Wheat Board has been governed by a small 
group of commissioners appointed by the government and legally 
responsible only to the government.  But in today's dynamic 
change in this marketplace the producers will have a clear voice 
in what will be happening.  The producers will be accountable and 
the sales will be accountable to the producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new law, it is the first time the Canadian Wheat Board 
will be run by a board of directors.  There will be 15 directors 
in total and two-thirds of them, 10 of the 15 directors, will be 
directly elected by prairie farmers.  They will take office at 
the earliest possible date in 1998 once the new law is passed by 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the powers of the Canadian Wheat Board will be in the hands 
of the directors and because two-thirds of them will be elected, 
they will be directly accountable to producers for how they 
manage the Canadian Wheat Board's business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the power to run the affairs of the Canadian 
Wheat Board, the directors will have specific authority to select 
their own chairperson; to set the salaries of directors, the 
chairperson and president; to review the performance of the 
president and to recommend his or her dismissal, if necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure farmers are getting value for their money, the 
directors will be legally entitled to have full disclosure of all 
facts and figures by the Canadian Wheat Board operations, 
including all financial audited statements.  The directors will 
be able to examine the prices at which grain is sold, the price 
premiums achieved, all operating costs, and whether the wheat 
board is truly efficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through these elected directors the Canadian Wheat Board will 
gain practical expertise in the real producers.  If the directors 
are not satisfied with how the Canadian Wheat Board deals with 
the farmers or its sales strategy or the way it does business, 
they can make the necessary changes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new law will require the directors and officers of the 
Canadian Wheat Board to act honestly and in good faith, 
exercising all reasonable care and diligence.  If they fail their 
duty, they will be exposed and have legal consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the structural changes, the Government of Canada will 
continue to provide the Canadian Wheat Board with financial 
guarantees.  They will cover not only the initial payments set at 
the beginning of each pooling period and the Canadian Wheat 
Board's credit sales program but also all of the general 
borrowings.  Since the Canadian Wheat Board is a multibillion 
dollar enterprise, the amount outstanding under these guarantees 
is very large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason, there is continuing need for the government to 
have a window on the Canadian Wheat Board in addition to the new 
accountability directly to farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a window is also necessary because the Canadian exporter of 
wheat and barley, whether on the prairies or elsewhere, requires 
a Canadian Wheat Board export permit.  This safeguarding of 
public interest will be achieved by the government appointing a 
minority of directors, five in total. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of the directors, whether elected, the ten or five who are 
appointed, will have the same powers, duties and functions.  The 
farmers will hold two thirds of that majority.  The new law will 
put farmers in the driver's seat when it comes to any future 
changes in the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If farmers want to remove some type of grain from the Canadian 
Wheat Board's current single desk system, that can be done 
subject to three conditions.  The directors must make it a 
recommendation, the Canadian Grain Commission must approve an 
identity preservation system to protect the quality standards 
and, if proposed exclusion is significant to all the farmers, the 
farmers must vote for that approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If farmers want to add votes, rye, flax, canola to the Canadian 
Wheat Board's existing mandate, that too can be done subject to 
three conditions.  The farm organization that represents the 
producers of that commodity must make a written request, the 
Canadian Wheat Board's directors must recommend it and there must 
be a vote among the farmers to approve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These new provisions are balanced and fair in both ways for 
either exclusions or inclusions.  In either case, the authority 
is where it belongs, in the hands of themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board is going to be more flexible.  It will 
give to farmers more options in how they are paid and how their 
grain is moved through the system.  It will make cash purchases 
of wheat and barley, increase initial payments quickly whenever 
market conditions warrant, close and pay out pool accounts at any 
time, provide an early pool and cash out option, fully use modern 
risk management tools, issue negotiable producer certificates, 
offset producers' grain storage and/or carrying costs, facilitate 
deliveries on condos' storage systems and receive grain through 
on-farm mobile elevators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board is a very effective marketer of 
Canadian grain.  It has the support of the majority of western 
farmers.  They want realistic and sensible Canadian Wheat Board 
changes but they do not want a scenario that would lead 
inevitably to the board's destruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just how valuable overall has the scheme of things been?  It 
sells some $5 billion of grain per year at marketing costs of a 
few pennies per bushel.  It retains no profit margin.  All the 
rest goes to farmers.  It is one of Canada's most significant 
business enterprises, doing business in more than 70 countries 
around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our fifth largest exporter and our largest net earner for 
foreign exchange.  It has earned, for itself and Canada, a 
positive reputation in the eyes of global customers.  It is very 
important to the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board targets to extract maximum premiums but very 
important, the quality, cleanliness and consistency and our 
technical support are long-term, dependable, for the customer, 
the consumer from which we sell grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board has been rated as number one in the 
world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I believe I am entitled to 
have the member table the grain certificates to which he referred 
in his speech.  Those certificates apply to the provinces of 
Ontario, Quebec and all other provinces that are not prairie 
provinces which have the right, without charge, to export their 
grains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if he could table them so that the House could see how 
unfair the certificates are.  Those provinces can export their 
grain with these certificates but the other three provinces 
cannot.  I believe the hon. member should table them immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Chair will 
consult with the table officers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, with respect to 
this point of order, the hon. member was not talking about the 
specific certificates.  He was talking about the fact that the 
Canadian Wheat Board has to authorize those export certificates 
for other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  In the opinion of 
the Chair this is a point of debate, but the Chair will invite 
the hon. member for Kent—Essex, if he has the papers and wishes 
to table them, to do so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do 
not even know where to start.  I am just amazed to hear all these 
things coming from across the way about the great consultation 
process that went on.  We all know that the panel went across the 
prairie provinces and talked to prairie farmers, but the 
recommendations that were given to the panel are not being 
implemented in the bill.  It does not even come close. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone in the House should have the opportunity to speak. 
Nobody would deny that.  Many MPs from the Toronto region will 
definitely support the government because they have been told 
that is what they have to do in this free country led by that 
outfit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite those Toronto MPs to come to Wild Rose to visit little 
communities in my area and to talk to farmers.  We should let 
farmers convince these people how they should vote rather than 
being told how to vote.  We know that will happen.  We know it 
will be difficult to defeat a poor piece of legislation such as 
this one because of the rules of the Liberal Party, the governing 
body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those ladies and gentlemen should come out to talk to the 
farmers.  In every poll we have done in Wild Rose 80% to 90% of 
the people want dual marketing.  They like to go out there to 
meet with the elite but they do not know anything about farmers. 
They should try it some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I bet you were a businessman before you came to the 
House.  I would bet on that.  I bet you were a producer of goods 
of some sort or that you provided a service.  I bet you did your 
best to maximize profits in your business.  If you did not then 
you were doing a poor job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every manufacturing company or producer in the country tries to 
find the best place to make the best buck and get the best value 
for their product. 
That is good common sense.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, too bad all members of 
the House are not listening carefully to the debate that is going 
on here before casting their votes.  Instead they are waiting for 
the whip of a certain party to pull their strings so the little 
puppets can jump up and vote the way they are told, the way they 
have done in the House for ages.  It is too bad that happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking about maximizing profits, which is what the 
preamble is all about.  It is only common sense.  Anybody with 
the brain of a fish could say that makes sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went to two court trials in Brandon, Manitoba, and spent some 
time watching the proceedings.  Individuals were brought before 
the court for having illegally sold their grain across the border 
without wheat board permits and were charged.  They actually 
broke the law; nobody is denying that.  Their purpose for selling 
grain across the border was not as a protest against any board or 
any particular legislation.  They were trying to maximize their 
profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases the people who were doing this all across the 
border were trying to maximize their profits.  They found 
themselves in the situation that if they did not get the best 
prices for their goods their farms could go under.  They could go 
broke.  They were trying to provide for the livelihood of their 
families.  They had worked all their lives and were saying they 
had to do something or they would go under.  Nobody wants to go 
under.  They made an effort by doing that, but the legislation 
stated that they could not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One court case amazed me.  An individual had broken into a farm 
residence, ransacked the property, killed three dogs, set fire to 
a tractor and stolen a pick-up truck.  Later he was apprehended 
and convicted.  He received a sentence of community service.  The 
same day a farmer was brought in who had tried to maximize his 
profits by taking his crop across the border.  He was taken away 
in shackles and chains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only that.  One farmer who had done it two or three times 
received a consecutive sentence.  I have been screaming at the 
government for ages about consecutive sentences.  Clifford Olson 
should not be serving one life sentence; he should be serving 
eleven.  We finally got a consecutive sentencing.  We got it for 
a farmer who tried to maximize his profits by taking his crop 
across the border.  That is the wisdom of the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is terribly frustrating to look at farmers being hauled off 
in chains and shackles while a guy who destroys and steals 
thousands and thousands of dollars worth of property gets 
community service.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  It is absolutely ridiculous.  All 
they are asking for in the region of Wild Rose is an opportunity 
to market their own product, the same opportunity for every 
individual producer or manufacturer of any kind in the whole 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are they being targeted as the ones who cannot?  They are 
asking for that opportunity.  They are not asking to scrap the 
wheat board.  They want to keep the wheat board as an option, as 
one of the choices they may make in marketing their goods.  If 
they choose to do that, fine.  If they choose not to, they should 
have the freedom to do so.  That is common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was a young fellow farming and raising crops I did not 
decide where we sold our grain.  My dad did.  He shopped around. 
Although it was in a different country, we would load the truck 
and he would instruct me on where to deliver the grain.  He had 
made some phone calls and had chosen the place where he would 
deliver his grain.  Guess why he chose the place?  It was because 
he was maximizing his profits.  It was the best price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would drive to that place.  Provided it passed a required test 
to pay the price I would deliver the grain.  If the test was not 
quite as good as they wanted it, I would go to another place that 
would take the grain, maybe at a lower price.  We had choices all 
over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What those people did after they bought the grain, whether they 
exported it to China, to Japan or to Russia, we did not know.  We 
had the choice on how to maximize our profits.  That was fairly 
nice.  We did not have a body of people accountable to no one to 
tell us what we should do with our grain.  We did not have to get 
something signed by a group of wheat board individuals about 
whose expertise we were not too certain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is asking farmers in the western prairies to 
continue the same process.  Bill C-4 does not change anything. 
Even the agricultural minister from Alberta writes that it was 
extremely disappointing to discover the changes served only to 
continue government control of grain marketing, that no other 
industry or no other individual was being treated in this unique 
manner, and that in many respects it was something requiring 
close scrutiny before passage of the proposed legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of agriculture in Alberta pointed out a number of 
things in his letter that were wrong with the legislation.  Much 
of it applied simply to the fact that they lived in a free 
country.  When will they start giving people the freedom they 
ought to have to do with their product as they see fit? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are the ones that sweat hard.  They are the ones who put 
the seed in the ground.  They are the ones who try to chase the 
hail clouds away.  They do not even know if they will get a grain 
crop into the bin, but when they get there they should be allowed 
to own it and to choose how to market it.  It is their crop.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to rise to speak on this topic, the 
most important topic in my entire constituency.  Interest in the 
bill is growing and growing and growing every week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to alert members to a statement once made by Edmund 
Burke.  He said that the people never give up their liberties 
except under some delusions.  Ever since the wheat board began it 
presented a delusion to many western Canadian farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Yorkton—Melville emphasized the use of the 
word maximizing.  If the returns to the farmers of western Canada 
are to be maximized, it involves another component, 
transportation.  We will talk about that later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read to the House a statement made by a lawyer 
employed by the Canadian Wheat Board.  This was before the 
Manitoba Court of Appeal. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to note carefully what he had to say: “To dispose 
of grain in the best interest of the federal government the wheat 
board has no obligation to obtain the best prices for the 
farmers”.  That is what a lawyer for the Canadian Wheat Board 
had to say.  You come west and try to sell the Canadian Wheat 
Board with statements like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Less than three months ago we had a major dumping of Canadian 
grain into the Iranian market at $15 a tonne less than the world 
price.  We only found out about that just a few days ago.  When 
the wheat board tells you that it has no obligation to maximize 
the return to the prairie farmers, that they exist only for the 
benefit for the government, at least it is speaking the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wheat board has its annual report out.  I would like to read 
a few statements from that annual report.  Historically the 
Canadian Wheat Board at numerous times has not marketed grain to 
ensure the maximum return to the farmers.  Now hear what it had 
to say: “All proceeds from sales, less Canadian Wheat Board 
marketing costs, are passed on to the farmers”.  If it is 
operating totally on behalf of the farmers then they had better 
take a look at what they are trying to do in Bill C-4.  If the 
farmer is smart enough to grow the grain, he is smart enough to 
market the grain. This is phoney thing between five members, ten 
members, do not go out west and say that you democratized the 
wheat board.  They will laugh right in your face.  We all know 
what is going to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago we had two very learned people who did a lot of 
work on this.  I would like to read what they had to say: “Until 
World War II the Canadian Wheat Board was a government owned 
agency with a mandate to operate in the best interests of the 
producers”.  That is before World War II.  The next point is: 
“The role, structure and powers of the Canadian Wheat Board 
changed drastically during the war.  It became the federal 
government's chief means of controlling wheat prices”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wheat board is in a position and it is attempting to control 
prices, not to do what my hon. member has in this amendment, 
maximize the prices.  It has not been the responsibility—and we 
have enough evidence that it has not always sought out to operate 
in the best interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read again from this report: “Its main aim was to limit 
grain price increases so as to safeguard the government's wage 
and price controls”.  Who paid that price?  The farmers paid 
that price and they paid heavily for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Point three: “When world market conditions began to push up 
wheat prices in 1943 the government granted the Canadian Wheat 
Board its monopoly powers to enable it to impose strict controls 
over grain prices”.  The Canadian Wheat Board is doing exactly 
the same thing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This report, which came from two eminent scholars, said further: 
“The Canadian Wheat Board was the government's instrument of 
choice in the immediate post-war period to control wheat 
prices—into a peacetime market economy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it says that both Liberal and the Conservative 
governments extended the Canadian Wheat Board monopoly because 
they viewed wheat as a national strategy measure.  Only wheat was 
used in this way both the Liberal government and the Conservative 
government.  They used the wheat of the hardworking prairie 
farmers to the benefit not of the prairie farmers.  That was not 
utmost in their minds.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at the dumping practices of the wheat board today and it 
is not accountable and it does not know where the grain is going. 
The farmer, like the hon. member, at least knew where the grain 
was going. We do not know where it is going.  It dumps wheat on 
to a foreign market where there is no competition and sells it 
for less money. That is a terrible shame, and it exists today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to draw attention also to the control of the grain 
industry by the government.  We read that lawyers have said 
that the first responsibility of the Canadian Wheat Board is to 
the government and the producers are secondary.  We out west are 
tired of that attitude.  We are fed up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read:  “Control of the grain trade by a government 
agency was consistent with the aims of those Canadian bureaucrats 
who were dictated to introducing the principles of Keynesian 
economics into the regulation of the Canadian marketplace”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know what the hon. member said. I know that people are saying 
that the act was made in Ottawa and therefore it must be good. Do 
not be fooled. They never adopted one single principle of the 
strategy committee that came before them. Not one principle is 
embedded in this new act.  They predetermined what the act was 
going to be. They went through the phoney stage of talking to 
people.  The bill is before us now without one single 
recommendation from the advisory board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that this Canadian Wheat Board bill that we have today is 
going to do one thing for sure if it is passed.  The number of 
people opposed to the monopoly of the grain market industry, the 
number of producers, is going to drop, drop, drop until we reach 
a real revolution on the prairies because of the government's 
monopoly in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish everybody opposite would come out to the prairies, talk 
to the people.  It is a crying shame that an industry that brings 
billions and billions of dollars into this country cannot even 
control itself.  The big bad government controls it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a terrible shame.  I beg them to read the bill and not to 
support it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, some people will try to say that because this is just 
the preamble of the bill that they are seeking to amend that it 
is not important and it is not necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to argue that point very vigorously. This is a very 
necessary amendment.  For the record I would just like to read 
what I consider to be the most important portion of this 
amendment: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas such an organization will have a very significant effect 
on the producers of grain and must therefore have the securing of 
the best financial return to them as its object and first 
priority and must be accountable to them for its performance. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, this amendment places fiduciary responsibility 
on the board to act in the best interests of farmers. About 
six weeks ago— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Excuse me.  We do 
not seem to be getting the French translation. Could we confirm 
that we are getting the French translation, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps if the member resumes we can try it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know at what point 
the translators may have been cut off.  I will backtrack just a 
bit. 
I read the portion of the amendment which I feel is most 
important and I stated that I feel this is extremely important 
because it places fiduciary responsibility on the board to act in 
the best interests of farmers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>About six weeks ago a three-justice panel of the Manitoba Court 
of Appeal ruled that the Canadian Wheat Board has no fiduciary 
duty to make the best possible deals on farmers' behalf or even 
to treat them equally and with fairness.  The board's only legal 
obligation, according to this panel, is not to farmers but to 
Ottawa.  This is supposed to be our board, but it has no 
obligation to serve us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anything which can be added to this bill, even if it is only in 
the preamble, is bound to be an improvement.  The fascinating 
thing about Bill C-4 is that it is equally repugnant to 
organizations as diverse in their outlook as the National Farmers 
Union and the Western Canadian Wheat Growers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been polling my constituents specifically on this bill to 
determine how the majority of them would wish me to vote on their 
behalf.  Thanks to the brilliance of this government we now have 
no postal service.  With no postal service I cannot complete my 
poll to find out how the people in my constituency would like me 
to vote on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I have done other polling on the Canadian Wheat Board 
with my constituents.  I have also done formal scientific polling 
by telephone through a professional polling organization.  I have 
a pretty good handle on how they feel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is regrettable that the government, with all of its grunting 
about going back to the people to find out what they are 
thinking, does not do a little more of this type of work.  When 
it does have its road shows and it goes about to get the opinion 
of people on the issues of the day it is too bad it does not pay 
attention to the results it gets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had these visitations, and I use the word advisedly, of 
people from Ottawa who say “We are from government, we are here 
to help you, we want to know what you think.  Now that we know 
what you think, get lost”.  That is the Ottawa way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bud the Spud over there would have us always believe that these 
are the people with our interests at heart.  They know what is 
best for us poor, benighted, agricultural drones of western 
Canada.  We do not know what is good for us but, man, Ottawa sure 
can show us the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have polled my constituents and, to my surprise, I discovered 
that on one commodity, that commodity being wheat, they want in 
my riding to retain single desk selling.  However, for 
barley they want dual marketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They did not get a chance, when the government had its famous 
plebiscite last January and February, to vote on that option. They 
got a chance to say “are we doing to have barley all onboard or 
all off board?”  In or out.  Take it or leave it. What the 
farmers actually would have liked was not on the ballot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  You listen up over there, you one 
Liberal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B> 
I wish the hon. member for Wild Rose would quit heckling.  He is 
throwing me off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know how my constituents stand on that particular issue, but I 
do not know how they are going to come out on Bill C-4 because 
there is nothing in Bill C-4 which directly relates to whether or 
not we retain single desk marketing.  It is just a hodgepodge. It 
is a bunch of bandaids applied to the wrists, elbows, ears and 
whatever other part of the poor western farmer has been damaged 
by Ottawa.  There is nothing substantive—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  The most changes in its history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  I hear a voice in the wilderness 
telling me that there have been substantive changes.  I suppose 
that the reference will be to this remarkable new elected board, 
a board which will be ruled in effect by appointees from Ottawa 
who will tell them what to do, when to do it and how to do it. 
With 10 elected members, the government need only get three of 
those ten to agree with their appointed hacks and they will have 
the majority.  This is democracy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CEO is a government appointee.  Give me a break.  This is 
not democracy.  This is pseudo-democracy.  This is a Soviet type 
of democracy, if I may use the term loosely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to the point that we do not have questions and 
comments at report stage.  I did want to make a comment to the 
hon. member for Wild Rose when he was expressing surprise at the 
discrepancy in sentencing of people who committed serious 
criminal offences and those who broke the wheat board 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to him that he should read a very excellent book 
entitled <I>The Gulag Archipelago</I> in which it is spelled out 
very clearly that in the prison system in the Soviet Union the 
people who were most severely dealt with were those who had 
committed political crimes.  Ordinary criminals who merely 
robbed, raped, or killed people were treated relatively leniently 
even in the camps.  However, it was the political criminals who 
were nailed to the wall.  I think the hon. member should take 
that into consideration.  It is very easy to explain if one stops 
and thinks about it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we in 
the New Democratic Party caucus support the preamble in Bill C-4 
and, quite frankly, do not understand why the government is so 
opposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the agriculture sector is an integral 
part of the Canadian economy.  There should be no question that 
we need an organization that will work to secure the best 
financial return for all producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Grain producers in Canada recognize the value of marketing their 
product through one body.  They recognize the value of working 
together and having a system that gives small and large producers 
opportunities and viability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Producers have survived tough economic times because of the 
wheat board.  I believe that the Canadian Wheat Board has the 
support of the majority of producers and there are very few who 
have not supported the wheat board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and my caucus will continue to encourage changes that will see 
the board fully elected by producers as well as the chair and CEO 
appointed by the board.  I urge the government to work in that 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to go on and on without having anything 
worthwhile to say.  However, I do want to mention that for the 
sticks and stones throwing between potato producers, grain 
producers and someone else, I think it is extremely important 
that we work to unite this country and to understand the 
different areas of the country, whether it be the east, the 
middle east or the west. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was under 
the mistaken impression growing up that this was a free country. 
I listened to what the hon. member for Cypress Hills—Grasslands 
was saying about the <I>Gulag Archipelago</I> and the treatment of 
Soviet citizens who dared to challenge the government.  That was 
their crime.  It was not that they challenged another member of 
society.  It was not that they committed serious criminal acts 
but that they dared to challenge the government and paid the 
price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we see the disparity of treatment in this country. 
When anybody dares to challenge the government by directly 
defying what the government has ordered shall be, they will pay a 
very severe price indeed. 
I started out by saying that I thought this was a free country. 
As I grew older, I began to recognize that we actually live in a 
police state, and we do.  We have environment police, we have tax 
police, we have land police, we have regulatory police.  We even 
have in this country egg police and milk police.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can you imagine the serious circumstances of the Canadian people 
if by God we did not control the production of eggs and we did 
not control the production of milk, butter and cream?  What a 
threat to our national security that would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing that we do not have is pork police.  We should 
have because we know about all the pork that goes on on the other 
side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a person who lives on the west coast of British Columbia, and 
there is virtually no grain farming taking place in the riding I 
represent, I come to Ottawa and I get to understand the grain 
issue a little more.  I find out that we have grain police and we 
have a country where a man or a family on their own piece of 
land, which they own and have bought and paid for, grows a crop, 
reaps that crop and sells it where the government tells them they 
are not allowed to sell it.  What does the government do?  As my 
hon. colleague said, it takes them away in shackles and chains, 
fines them tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of 
dollars, confiscates their equipment and just about drives them 
out of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not marijuana or heroin or cocaine.  We are talking 
about grain.  What does the government do?  It takes the people 
and treats them like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest, Mr. Speaker, that you can get away with this kind of 
treatment of your citizens for a time. The Liberal Party members 
are the ones who dreamed up the egg police, the milk police and 
the grain police.  They want the government to control all 
aspects of our lives.  There are also the gun police— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  On a point of order, 
the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the fact of the 
matter is that it was not the Liberal Party.  It was a request 
from the producers themselves calling for national products 
marketing agencies and these requests were abided by in terms of 
living up to the wishes— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Chair thanks the 
hon. member for that point of clarification.  Resuming debate, 
the hon. member for Skeena. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, all I have to do is remember 
people like Eugene Whelan when I think about the kind of Liberal 
approach to managing and controlling all aspects of our economy 
and the kind of marketing boards that were set up by the Liberals 
in the sixties and the seventies.  We all remember the trainload 
of rotten eggs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude my remarks, we live in what is ostensibly a free 
country, but we continue to encroach on the freedoms and the 
rights of citizens by such things as the grain police.  Members 
opposite might think that this is humorous but I tell you, Mr. 
Speaker, that there will be a day of reckoning for treating 
people like this.  There is going to be a time when this is no 
longer tolerated.  I cannot say how that will come about.  I 
cannot say when it will come about.  But I can say that you 
cannot treat your citizens like this on an ongoing basis without 
serious repercussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask hon. members in this House today who are going to be 
voting on this bill to consider the ramifications.  This is an 
issue that is very important to many people in the prairie 
provinces in western Canada and we cannot treat them like this. 
We cannot expect them to continue to live in a civil society on 
these kinds of terms and conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that, I will conclude my remarks and thank the House for 
its indulgence.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to stand in this House and bring the concerns of 
the farmers of Dauphin—Swan River.  As you know, my riding is 
very agricultural-based.  There are farmers right through it, 
from one end to the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my short break at home I heard many concerns about the 
new bill, about the attempted change to the Canadian Wheat Board. 
I must say that the majority of the farmers in my constituency 
support the Canadian Wheat Board, but they want real change. They 
want change that is going to impact the farmers' lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One comment that has been raised continuously is:  Why is it 
that we, the producers of the crops, have no control on how it is 
marketed, no control on the price, no control on the 
transportation to market?  I really have no way of responding to 
these types of questions because the Canadian Wheat Board is a 
very big monopoly that basically dictates.  It is very 
paternalistic in its approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers in Dauphin—Swan River are asking for a real change that 
will bring about real democracy.  The purpose of the Canadian 
Wheat Board should be for the benefit of the grower and the 
producer, not the people who live in Ottawa who sit in this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern that is raised continuously in my riding is the 
question:  Why are farmers that are trying to market their 
product across the border treated like criminals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, in this country we really do not have a justice 
system, not the way the courts operate.  These farmers are 
treated in the worst way, worse even than criminals, by far. That 
is a question that is continuously raised.  These people probably 
did break the law as it exists today in transporting their 
products to market, but we need justice in this country.  We have 
to treat them in a fair and equal way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague indicated previously, that is the political 
crime that they have committed by doing this.  Anyway, the people 
of Dauphin—Swan River feel that this is not fair.  It is not 
fair to treat people in this manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third concern is about the Canadian Wheat Board and the 
control of the direction of the full grain and how they market 
the grain and how they transport it out of this country.  As you 
know, the port of Churchill with the amendment to the Marine Act 
is becoming part of the private sector and also, with the 
privatization of CN, it is going to be a big plus for the 
province of Manitoba in terms of exporting grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering that the port of Churchill was built in the 
thirties, someone at the federal level had a vision for the 
farmers of western Canada back in 1930.  We have lost that vision 
over the last 60 years.  That port is totally underutilized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big advantage of using the port of Churchill as I have 
vented in this House is that it is 6,800 kilometres shorter to 
European markets than it is from the Thunder Bay port.  Yet, over 
the last 60 years this port has been totally neglected.  In fact 
this year the Canadian Wheat Board has shipped, I believe, less 
than 400,000 tons through the port of Churchill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, on behalf of the farmers, the wheat board has to 
increase the amount of grain that it ships out of this country. 
It is high time that the grain started moving north and south 
instead of east and west at a cost to the farmer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shipping grain through the port of Churchill will save the 
farmer of western Canada $20 per ton and that $20 will go in the 
pockets of the farmers, which will in effect improve the local 
economy and in effect will increase what goes into the pockets of 
Ottawa as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that the Canadian Wheat Board has been a good 
thing in the past. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1145"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mean in the past because I am reminded by older farmers who 
went through the tough times of the 1930s and the pre-war period 
that the wheat board was there for their protection.  Today we 
live in the 1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the age where governments talk about entrepreneurship, 
Internet technology, the shrinking global economy.  There is no 
doubt that there are many farmers out there who can ship their 
own products much more effectively and efficiently than a 
monopoly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that the government should not be marketing the 
product but I believe the farmers in Dauphin—Swan River want 
that option.  They want an option to market their product on 
their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all about accountability.  The constituents of 
Dauphin—Swan River are looking for accountability with the new 
Canadian Wheat Board accountable to the farmers and not to the 
politicians in Ottawa.  They want accountability through the 
organization's being more transparent and they also want more 
options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final analysis is that they want the Canadian Wheat Board to 
work on behalf of the farmers and not on behalf of big business 
and government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today as a western Canadian farmer certainly 
concerned with the future of our grain industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The quality of life on western Canadian farms is definitely tied 
to the power of this unaccountable wheat board.  There is a 
growing dissension with the market status quo on the prairies 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister were to hold meetings in the west, he would find 
the people attending would most certainly have different things 
to say.  Our input costs are rising.  The end of the Crow 
drastically increased our transportation costs.  Canadian Wheat 
Board grains are backlogged and plugging the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, farm returns are now non-existent.  As a result of 
wheat board policies, we also find that we are not allowed to 
bring our feed grains and so on into different marketplaces. 
Interprovincial trade and access to these markets is not there 
for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member from Manitoba talked about using the port of 
Churchill.  That may also give us cheaper access into the 
maritimes with our feed grains for their poultry and hog 
industries.  Those types of things are not done now under our 
wheat board system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many sections and subsections of Bill C-4 that farmers 
in my riding on both sides of this issue agree are fundamentally 
wrong, mainly the continuation of the unaccountability to 
producers of their board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cash purchase clause that they are trying to put in through 
Bill C-4 circumvents the final payment values derived through the 
pooling system that we have now.  The board, as it is shown in 
Bill C-4, would consist of 15 directors, 10 elected and placed 
at the discretion of the minister.  That is a major point.  Four 
are then appointed by the minister to sit on this board and the 
president or CEO is appointed on the recommendation of the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these people are there at the discretion of the minister and 
can be removed at any time should they go against the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board also may indemnify from, in layman's 
terms remove, any legal liability or responsibility for the 
actions of its employees.  This section goes on to say that this 
also covers the employees' heirs and legal representatives and 
would cover all costs, charges and expenses included in amounts 
paid to settle or satisfy a judgment.  No one is accountable. 
This clause certainly protects the board over the producers it 
serves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board annual operations plan will be 
submitted to the minister and will require his approval before it 
can be implemented.  This certainly would seem to circumvent the 
elected portion of this board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the record I certainly do not oppose the Canadian Wheat 
Board concept in principle.  However, when I see the entrenched 
lack of accountability of the board in this bill, my 
constituents, through me, can do nothing but oppose it until it 
can be amended for a positive impact on the depressed industry we 
see in western Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak on Bill C-4, an act to amend the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  I wish it were to be some real amendments 
because I think the Canadian Wheat Board is mired in the last 
century and has yet to come into this century and we are just 
about to go into the next one.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hoped this organization would have wanted to bring 
itself up to date and that the minister would have wanted to 
bring the organization up to date to address the global 
marketplace in which we now live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My interpretation of this bill is that it is just a reiteration 
of where the board stands.  The bill maintains the board with 
arm's length monopoly powers when many farmers wish the board 
could be opened up.  We do live in a free society, and I 
emphasize that.  But for some reason this government wants to 
maintain that every farmer in the three provinces of the prairies 
shall sell his grain to the board with no alternative 
opportunities.  Yet farmers in Ontario can operate differently. 
And I thought it was a free country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it rather strange that we would say you have only one 
buyer and no other buyer for your grain when there are people 
around the world who would like to participate and purchase our 
grain.  There are buyers in the United States we know would like 
to buy our grain, but we have to give it to the wheat board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a travesty and an insult to the farmers on the prairies 
who are part of the great bread basket of the world, who have 
worked hard to produce a wonderful environment and a way of life 
that sometimes involves struggle.  And the wheat board sits there 
with more and more powers and makes some noise about trying to 
get itself modernized, but when we take a look at the intent of 
the legislation nothing has happened.  The minister knows it but 
the minister will not say it.  All he wants to do is to entrench 
that little monopoly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If monopoly is not bad enough, we have to add secrecy on top of 
that.  The auditor general is not allowed to look into the 
workings of the wheat board.  The legislation prevents him from 
doing that.  Access to information that allows anybody access to 
government documentation allows us to ask questions about 
government but we cannot ask questions about the wheat board. The 
law says that we cannot ask questions about the wheat board and 
have them answered because we are specifically denied access to 
the Canadian Wheat Board and what is going on there. Yet it is a 
monopoly that is protected by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board does not report to Parliament.  It does 
produce an annual report but it does not report to Parliament. It 
cannot be investigated by the auditor general.  An individual 
cannot ask questions through access to information.  It is a 
complete and absolute closed door shop and we as parliamentarians 
and as Canadians have no idea what is going on in that 
organization but we are being asked to endorse the status quo. 
Surely we as parliamentarians have the right to know what is 
going on in that organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This perfunctory thing that we are going to have a few elected 
members on the board I do not think will change very much because 
those members' hands will be tied.  The minister will have a 
majority on the board.  It is fine for the minister to tell us 
that this will be great stuff since he will be opening it up for 
elections.  But if they are a minority on the board, the minister 
can get what he wants.  That is how he can maintain his ironclad 
policy of no information about the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think about the people who have stood up for democratic rights 
in Canada.  We have seen people in China stand up for democratic 
rights who were sent off to jail.  The whole world stood up and 
claimed it was an outrage that people who stand up for their 
rights in China should go to jail and be punished severely by the 
state.  Yet we have farmers standing up for their rights in this 
country who are saying all they want is the right to sell what 
they produce to a buyer who is prepared to buy their produce. 
They have had to go to jail and what outrage have we seen from

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not even heard a murmur from the government as it applies 
the heavy arm of the law and drags these people off in chains and 
puts them in jail as they stand up for their rights in a 
democratic and free society to sell what they produce to a buyer 
who wants to buy their product.  Is that so bad?  Apparently so. 
Apparently it is bad because this government is not prepared to 
introduce legislation which is going to give them the opportunity 
to sell their produce in a free and open market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NAFTA, the world trade organization and the GATT are all 
organizations to build opportunities for free trade where we can 
buy and sell our goods, our produce and our services across the 
country and around the world, but not the prairie farmers. 
Ontario farmers yes, farmers in other provinces yes, but not the 
prairie farmer when it comes to producing grain for human 
consumptions and grain for export. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ludicrous that any government should take this dictatorial 
attitude today.  It is an offence and an affront to democracy and 
to all of Canadians that farmers would be locked into this type 
of situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to let the government know that I am upset because I 
believe in openness and accountability in government.  I look at 
the bill, section 313, which deals with indemnification. This was 
a proposal being brought forward by the government.  It says 
“the corporation shall indemnify present or former directors or 
officers who acted—against criminal charges”.  I know that 
they have backed off a little on committing.  Rather than 
“shall” indemnify, it is “may” indemnify.  To me that is not 
a reversal. It just says if we feel that it is in our own 
interests we will indemnify these people against criminal actions 
if they act honestly and in good faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It even goes on to say “—in case of a criminal or 
administrative action or proceeding that is enforced by monetary 
penalty believed on reasonable grounds that the conduct was 
lawful”.  Just as long as they think or stand up and say “I 
think my conduct is lawful” the board will indemnify them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard of lots of situations when people have been in 
court and have said “I thought I was on the right” and the 
court says “no, you were on the wrong”.  They are left with a 
sentence and the cost of their own defence.  But we now find that 
the government is going stand behind, if it so chooses, past and 
former people who have committed illegal acts, maybe with good 
intentions.  Lots of people have found themselves on the wrong 
side of the law with good intentions.  What is the phrase, the 
road to that place is paved with good intentions, and we may all 
get there but hopefully we don't.  Let us hope we do not.  Let us 
hope the government does not get there either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really concerned about the wheat board and the fact that it 
is wrapped in a cloak of secrecy that is ironclad.  We can 
get no information out of this organization.  This government is 
doing nothing about it in a free and democratic society.  People 
who want to do something today get dragged off to jail in irons. 
I emphasize in irons.  I talked to several RCMP in my riding, one 
who had 20 years service on the force.  He said there was only one 
occasion that he had to drag an offender off to jail in irons. 
He was a rather violent offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Did he get caned? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  I am not sure whether he got caned but 
he certainly got locked up in irons and presumably locked up 
elsewhere for a long time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the bill.  It appears the 
government is trying to ram through a bill that will strengthen 
the dictatorial powers of the Canadian Wheat Board and will give 
it a tremendous amount of power to operate within a scope that is 
pleasing to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not from a prairie part of the country, but it has always 
been my assumption that the Canadian Wheat Board had a 
responsibility to operate in the best interest of prairie wheat 
farmers.  If this is the case certainly the bill we are debating 
today does not do that.  It gives the Canadian Wheat Board the 
power to operate in the best interest of itself and of its 
political influence in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government of the day is dominated by members from the 
province of Ontario and other provinces that are not involved 
with the Canadian Wheat Board. They have a lot of authority in 
the debate and will have the power of the vote by sheer numbers. 
The government is influenced by a part of the country that has no 
particular interest in the Canadian Wheat Board because it does 
not apply to the growing of grains in those other provinces. They 
will ram through a bill that will impose a detrimental effect on 
wheat farmers on the prairies and in the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some personal knowledge of the operation of the Canadian 
Wheat Board.  I return for a moment to the fact that it should be 
assumed the purpose of the Canadian Wheat Board is to get the 
best possible price for grain products for prairie farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the case it would only seem logical the wheat board 
would be willing to sell products on behalf of farmers in a 
manner that would be in the best interest of farmers, which means 
whoever approaches with a proposition that would bring a good 
price for the product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From second hand experience I know that over the last three 
years the Canadian Wheat Board was approached to supply large 
quantities of barley and grain at the top level of pricing for 
the day.  These were to be cash deals. There was no government to 
government financing involved.  It was cash on the barrel head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board would not supply the product.  It would 
not take the products it had in the elevators and sell it through 
this additional source of marketing for cash money at a higher 
than average price.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make matters worse, I have absolute knowledge that the sales 
offered to the Canadian Wheat Board never went through any of the 
other sources of established marketing of the Canadian Wheat 
Board.  They were lost to other countries that supplied the same 
product to customers willing to pay cash to the Canadian Wheat 
Board, if it would sell it, but it would not sell it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They not only lost several cash deals.  They not only lost 
finding another source of marketing for their product in addition 
to what they already had.  They not only lost the opportunity to 
have a clean sale with no government financing required.  They 
lost the sale, period.  It never happened.  The purchase went to 
another country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been in business all my life, not in the grain business 
but in business.  If those in the private sector have a product 
to sell, they want to sell it where they get the best price for 
it, the cleanest deal and the best benefit for their business. 
Certainly that is not the case with the Canadian Wheat Board.  It 
cannot be the case with the Canadian Wheat Board based on the 
examples I have expressed today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It begs a question.  How on earth could a government, which 
happens to be the Liberal government of the day and the Tory 
government before it, support an organization like the Canadian 
Wheat Board which has shown by example that it does not work in 
the best interest of prairie farmers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to see there are Liberal members in the House today 
who have a direct interest in this matter and who have a 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  One Liberal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Oh, one Liberal.  That shows just how 
much the Liberal government is interested in what the people of 
Canada have to say.  We are truly representing the farmers from 
the prairie provinces over which the Canadian Wheat Board has 
jurisdiction.  It shows how much the Liberal government cares 
about representation on this side of the House on this very 
important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about the livelihood of western Canadian grain 
farmers.  We are talking about the livelihood of families.  We 
are talking about the buoyancy of the economy in the prairie 
provinces.  Those farmers depend on good prices for their 
product.  They depend on good markets for their product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In huge numbers they would like to have the ability to grow 
agricultural products and sell them without having the government 
in their face every step of the way and so that they get maximum 
value for the fruits of their labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has to do with rights.  We are talking about the right of 
Canadian citizens to work hard, to toil long hours at their 
occupation, which in this case is farming, and to expect the 
harder they work the more they will be rewarded.  Is that too 
much to ask? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4 takes away that right.  It gives the Canadian Wheat 
Board more power to say to prairie farmers that it does not care 
how hard they work. 
It does not care how big their farm loans are.  It does not care 
how many kids they have to educate.  It does not care how many 
mouths they have to feed.

farmers by way of the bill.  That is simply unacceptable.  I am 
embarrassed for the Liberal member in the House today, who is not 
from the prairie provinces incidentally.  The member sits and 
represents the government on this line of thought.  It takes away 
our right to succeed as a result of our hard work and labour.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, as I was saying before the call 
for a quorum, I am pleased to speak today on the report stage of 
the Act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other Acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I approached this bill by asking myself what type of impact 
this kind of a bill would have on Quebec.  Certainly, at this point 
western farmers are the main ones concerned, but I have analyzed 
the bill within this context: what sort of comments, suggestions, 
proposals for amendments would the farmers of Quebec have to make 
if the agricultural sector in Quebec were affected by this bill? 
I was struck first of all by the dichotomy surrounding the 
necessity of organizing the wheat trade.  In my region, no one 
denies the pertinence of this.  However, there are significant 
elements missing between the desire to organize the wheat trade 
properly and what this bill contains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing is that the bill does not give sufficient 
power to farmers or board members, to those who make their living 
selling their wheat, to those who have to live with the effects of 
government policies in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this bill, could the government not have used the 
opportunity to make sure the farmers were given a voice, so that 
the reserve fund would truly be a management tool? 
We have experienced this in other areas where, because sufficient 
reserves were not made for hard times, the money is often taken from the 
consolidated revenue fund, and, when this is done, the people end up 
paying, even if they have nothing to do with this type of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best example of that is what the Conservatives made us go 
through with unemployment insurance several years ago. There were no 
reserves, we had terrible deficits, and people who are contributing to 
employment insurance today are still paying for this lack of foresight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must avoid this type of situation in the area of the wheat 
sales. We could very well go through this type of experience again in 
the coming years because, we know from past experience that the wheat 
market can be very volatile. There can be some very good years and also 
some very bad years. 
Everything is linked to crop results in other countries and the buying 
power of other countries, to international politics. So there should 
have been a reserve fund ensuring solid management to balance variations 
between good years and bad years, and there is nothing on this in the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of my presentation, I said that I would address 
this bill by looking at its impact on Quebec, and there is a significant 
impact on oilseeds management. In Quebec, oilseeds represent a promising 
market. It is a market for which production could be increased in the 
future. 
When we look at this bill and when we consider that it could cover 
oilseeds, this is perhaps not the way of the future for Quebec, 
precisely because there are markets here, such as linseed or other 
products, that could be developed and that would become mixed up in a 
type of management that is not suitable for them. Interesting and well 
structured markets already exist for those products, and these markets 
are working well. This bill would raise a barrier in a sector that is 
already operational. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So things should not be mixed up. We should avoid adding barriers 
in areas that already work and we should ensure that the Canadian Wheat 
Board does not intervene in areas that are already well structured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important issue for Quebec farmers, and this is worth 
considering because we all know that agriculture is undergoing 
tremendous changes. 
In the past, there has been a lot of specialization in agriculture, 
since there was a sort of division in production: dairy products were 
mostly the specialty of Ontario and Quebec, especially Quebec; other 
products were the specialty of the west, and so on. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But with the expected changes to international agreements and 
the desire to diversify production in the various regions of 
Canada, we must make sure that we leave the door open to the future 
and do not put in place structures, legislation, and regulatory 
requirements that would then stand in the way of development in 
these sectors.  We know that when bureaucracy gets a hold on a 
sector, it is very difficult to dislodge it.  It would perhaps be 
better to do so something about this now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other aspects to this bill that are of concern to 
Quebec's agricultural sector. 
They are not in line with Quebec's agricultural tradition. This 
tradition includes the Union des producteurs agricoles, a strong 
union highly representative of the agricultural sector and one 
which works in collaboration with government, which expresses its 
viewpoint and which is accustomed to being able to operate with a 
certain degree of transparency that is missing from the bill before 
us.  If this spirit had been respected for matters such as access 
to information, real transparency would be possible. 
There would be a way of making information available, to ensure that 
those affected by Canadian Wheat Board management have access to it so 
they can assess whether the board is relevant and doing a good job and, 
on the basis of the information available, make representations to their 
elected representatives and to the government, and have something on 
which to base their assessment. There is no such provision in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the agricultural tradition is such that the federal 
government would have wanted to ensure, for instance, that the directors 
are elected by the producers, by those representing the industry. There 
is no such provision in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While appearing to be open, the government is maintaining 
significant control over the Canadian Wheat Board. The terms and 
conditions for electing directors are set by the government. The 
president of the board is appointed by the governor in council on the 
minister's recommendation. 
Does that not leave the door open to partisanship? Would it not have 
been possible to find a way of ensuring that the president is selected 
without any appearance of conflict of interest or partisanship? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of the many questions we can ask ourselves about 
this bill as we consider a rather substantial amendment. Some major 
changes are being proposed, and this legislation will not be reviewed 
for a while. It will affect Canadian trade in wheat and several other 
products, as we can see and as I referred to earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must make sure it is a framework law that will facilitate 
operations in Canada's agricultural sector, that will facilitate the 
wheat trade, and that will allow the various regions to develop new 
products without having to face administrative obstacles or restrictions 
we can no longer afford in the current context of free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All in all, this is a bill which had to be introduced. It would 
have been possible to make it acceptable with a number of changes. The 
government made some efforts, but not enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government does not support amendments—particularly the 
ones that we are proposing—that would make for more democratic and 
longer term management of the Canadian Wheat Board, so as to even out 
the good and the bad economic years, the Bloc Quebecois will have to 
oppose the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government majority to listen to our arguments and 
accept those that are relevant. I hope we can state our views during the 
debate on the other groups of motions, particularly in these areas, and 
convince the government to adopt the best possible legislation for 
Canada's wheat trade.

Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today during report stage to 
contribute the very important debate on this bill.  It is 
important to me for a number of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent the constituency of Saskatoon—Humboldt which has a

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is going to have a dramatic impact not only on the 
rural component of the constituency but the urban as well. 
Although Saskatoon is a growing city with a vibrant economy, 
agriculture is still a core industry in Saskatchewan. Therefore 
the bill will affect not only the rural part of my constituency 
but the entire province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I have lived in Saskatoon since the early 1980s and I 
represent Saskatoon—Humboldt, I am originally from a family farm 
in Unity, Saskatchewan.  All my life I have been actively 
involved in farming until I got into politics. I believe this 
bill will impact not only on all my constituents but it goes deep 
enough to affect my family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a great deal of concern on the prairies about the 
contents of this bill and of course it is very well founded.  The 
amendments that have been advanced by my Reform colleagues would 
improve Bill C-4 and address the concerns farmers are raising 
about the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One need only travel throughout the constituencies of 
Saskatchewan and into the small towns and coffee shops to hear 
the discussion on the bill and the widespread opposition to it. 
The opposition is from many angles.  However, I would like to 
specifically address Motion No. 5 which was submitted by my 
colleague from Prince George—Peace River. That motion would 
allow the entire board of directors of the Canadian Wheat Board 
to be elected which along with the minister would decide who 
would be president of the board. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>   Madam Speaker, on a 
point of order, I think I just heard my hon. colleague say that 
he wanted to discuss Motion No. 5.  I thought that we were still 
discussing Motion No. 1.  I would encourage the debate to go in 
that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I would ask the hon. 
member to please confine his comments to Motion No. 1, which is 
being discussed right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Madam Speaker, Motion No. 1 is with 
respect to returns that producers will get for their commodity. 
This has a direct bearing on that because it will affect the 
returns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is perhaps one of the most important debates that 
will occur in my term in this Parliament as the representative of 
the constituents of Saskatoon—Humboldt.  I find the remark that 
my comments were straying slightly beyond the scope of what was 
strictly being debated somewhat obstinate but not surprising 
considering who it came from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To continue, the current bill the way it stands, if passed, 
would allow 10 directors to be elected by the farmers, but the 
remaining 5 directors of the Canadian Wheat Board would be 
appointed by the minister, of course one being the president.  It 
would seem logical that there would be opposition to that when a 
full third of the board is being appointed by the minister. That 
would ensure that the government's grip on the activities of the 
Canadian Wheat Board is maintained and the desire for 
accountability and for farmers to have control and direction over 
the wheat board through a farmer elected board is circumvented by 
allowing the appointment of members by the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, if experience tells us anything, Liberal ministers 
have not been shy in the past about handing out plum patronage 
positions to their party faithful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To illustrate just how bad this can get, I would like to cite 
some examples that have taken place so far this year. The 
Liberals have made 510 prime appointments to date to the Senate 
and various boards, agencies and commissions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As unbelievable as it is, it seems that they are even worse than 
Mulroney with their political patronage appointments.  I would 
suggest that the Liberals are truly number one at doling out 
parliamentary pork.

appointed to consul general in Boston, the Prime Minister's 
legislative assistant, Graeme Clark, was appointed as ambassador 
to Peru and Bolivia—

about.  What does this have to do with Motion No.1? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon.

directly relevant because they are going to be allowed to appoint 
the members of the board of directors.  I think we have to look 
at past examples of their appointments to see what we can expect.

examples such as the former president of the women's commission,

not on the topic in terms of Motion No. 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This ridiculousness can be carried too far.  This member is 
filibustering and he is not even on topic. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on the same point of order regarding the issue of 
relevance, I would call the attention of the Chair to Motion No. 
1 where it says that such an organization will have a very 
significant effect on the producers of grain.  It must therefore 
have the securing of the best financial return to them as its 
object and first priority must be accountable to them for its 
performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would consider that the whole issue of the board of directors 
is very relevant to Motion No. 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Chair would 
appreciate it if the member for Saskatoon—Humboldt would confine 
his comments to the appointments to be made to the board of 
directors of the Canadian Wheat Board.  The hon. member will then 
be relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is fair enough.  My 
point is that the blatant examples of patronage from the past 
leave farmers wondering just how many Liberal cronies this 
government is going to appoint to the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, these appointments will make the appointees beholden 
to their political masters since the government has ensured that 
the president of the Canadian Wheat Board will be an appointee. 
They have ensured their control over the organization of the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  That is the fear and the concern of 
western Canadian farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, their ability to appoint the members of the board 
of directors would ensure that the board of the Canadian Wheat 
Board is under that type of influence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, if Motion No. 5 of my colleague from Prince 
George—Peace River would be adopted, that would ensure that the 
board of the Canadian Wheat Board is democratic and accountable 
to its electors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, these electors in consultation with the minister 
would select the president rather than the minister appointing 
who the president is going to be.  This is a fair and equitable 
amendment which I am hopeful at least the other parties would be 
able to support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neville Nankivell in the <I>Financial Post</I> had some 
interesting comments about the election of the board as it 
presently stands under Bill C-4.  He wrote that because the 
government still appoints directors, it will create a 
quasi-advisory group rather than a proper independent board of 
directors that should have the power to hire and fire the CEO. 
The way the bill currently stands, that power will not be in the 
hands of the farmers, which is just further evidence of the type 
of control that the minister will have over them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Nankivell also wrote that there is almost universal condemnation 
among farm groups of the government's intention to appoint the 
CEO.  Yet the Liberals are determined in their desire to be able 
to do that.  As I stated earlier, it is for one reason.  It is so 
they can continue with their political patronage appointments. 
That comes as no surprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-4 the Liberals want a board of directors which is 
mired in the past, not one that is structured to meet the demands 
of the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact when Ted Allen of the United Grain Growers appeared 
before the committee, he said that Bill C-4 is fundamentally 
flawed and is an attempt to make time stand still or even turn 
back the clock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Western Canadian farmers need to look to the future and not be 
mired in the past by regressive Liberal policies which are based 
upon political patronage appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to strengthen the measure of accountability, we also 
need to bring the Canadian Wheat Board under the purview of the 
Access to Information Act and the auditor general.  Bill C-4 does 
not propose to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The election of the board is certainly important, but of equal 
importance is the scrutiny of its operations by the public and 
the federal government's watchdog. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this is not the only organization which the government 
has exempted from scrutiny.  Canada Post and a litany of other 
crown corporations are not subject to access to information 
requests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  Do you mean there is another wheat 
board? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  There are lots of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, my colleague from Nanaimo—Alberni has been an advocate 
of opening up these organizations to scrutiny.  He has advanced 
private members' bills on the subject and he has raised our 
awareness about the importance of not allowing government 
organizations to operate behind a veil of secrecy.  I hope that 
his efforts in this area will continue.  I know that his concerns 
certainly apply to the Canadian Wheat Board as presently 
structured.  I urge all members to consider that when they oppose 
this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise today to speak to the 
second group of amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in my intervention on the first group, which comprised 
only one motion, the amendment put forward by my hon. colleague 
from Yorkton—Melville to create a preamble, it is very 
confusing.  I am sure it is not only confusing to us, but it must 
be confusing for the viewing public to follow how these 48 
amendments have been grouped.  However, we will try to work our 
way through them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Group No. 2 consists of three amendments.  Motion No. 2 is an 
amendment put forward by me.  Motion No. 31 was also put forward 
by me.  Motion No. 41 was put forward by my hon. colleague from 
the Progressive Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In speaking to these three motions, Motion No. 2 quite simply 
would delete the clause that makes Bill C-4 binding on the 
provinces. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT32"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT32"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1240
<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In actual fact this clause would block a province from making 
changes which could be demanded by the majority of farmers in 
that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition believes quite strongly that this is 
undemocratic.  We point to a possible example in the future where 
one province might want to bring forward its own wheat board or 
wheat marketing board.  For example, Alberta might choose at some 
time in the future to have an Alberta wheat marketing board 
similar in structure to what exists for the farmers in Ontario. 
The case can really be put that by having this binding on the 
provinces, this would prevent a province such as Alberta, 
Saskatchewan or Manitoba from doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular clause further entrenches the inequity and the 
inequality of the Canadian Wheat Board.  What one province is 
free to do, in this case Ontario has its own wheat marketing 
board, another province in western Canada would be denied from 
doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second motion in Group No. 2 is motion 31, also put forward 
by me.  It has to do with removing all the references to the 
contingency fund.  This is where it really gets odd as to how the 
exact amendments are grouped.  This particular amendment No. 31 
goes hand in glove with amendments and Motions Nos. 25, 26 and 27 
which are found in another group.  All of those amendments deal 
with deleting any reference in Bill C-4 of the contingency fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At committee and while travelling throughout western Canada and 
speaking to farmers and farm groups in my riding and other 
ridings, it has become painfully obvious that the majority of 
farmers view this contingency fund as simply another tax on 
already overtaxed farmers.  That is why we have put forward these 
four amendments that would delete any reference to the 
contingency fund, the farmer supported, the farmer paid for 
contingency fund which currently exists in Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that one of my colleagues earlier 
referred to the need to survey his constituents, his farmers in 
his riding.  He referred to the fact that he is prevented from 
doing this at the moment because of the postal strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did survey the farmers in Prince George—Peace River when this 
bill's predecessor, Bill C-72, was before the House last winter. 
It was interesting to note that while the farmers in my riding 
were, as I think they are across western Canada, very split on 
this highly divisive issue of reform of the Canadian Wheat Board, 
the one thing they were not split on was the issue of the 
contingency fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one question I asked was would you support a compulsory 
farmer check off to help establish a capital base for a 
contingency fund?  An overwhelming 76.7% of respondents, the 
actual farmers, Canadian Wheat Board farmers in Prince 
George—Peace River, said no they would not support that concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other polls which other members have done and that 
other entities have done across western Canada that would 
indicate a similar conclusion.  This contingency fund, as long as 
the Canadian Wheat Board remains mandatory, a compulsory, 
government state run organization which farmers do not have the 
chance or freedom to choose the option of marketing their product 
outside of the Canadian Wheat Board, farmers are going to resist 
very strenuously another input cost being hoisted upon them in 
the form of a contingency fund, especially when it is not defined 
in the act in Bill C-4 how much it is going to be allowed to grow 
to, how quickly they are going to accumulate the funds, how much 
it is going to be taken off every time the farmer markets wheat 
or barley through the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a major concern.  This is why it is accompanying Motions 
Nos. 25, 26, 27 which are in a subsequent group.  We need to pass 
that and remove any reference to the contingency fund. 
How much time do I have, Mr. Speaker?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  The hon. member from the governing party 
said “too much”.  It has become painfully obvious that 
throughout the debate the Liberals do not want to see the bill 
properly debated.  That is why they hustled it off to committee 
without a proper second reading.  That is why we went through the 
charade— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  On a point of order, Mr. Speaker.  The 
member is not on the topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  I am being very relevant to the main issue 
at stake here.  For the hon. member across the way to take the 
issue so lightly points to the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over here we have members who have grown up on farms and farmed 
year after year in western Canada.  They are speaking out on an 
issue of vital importance to western Canadian grain producers. 
Over there we have people like the hon. member who treat the 
issue frivolously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will briefly address Motion No. 41 put forward by my hon. 
colleague.  The motion would delete the exclusion clause from the 
bill.  We run into a problem here.  I support the motion as put 
forward, but we must realize it goes hand in glove with a motion 
to delete the inclusion clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One great argument put forward by government members both in the 
limited debate in the House and at committee was that when a 
clause excludes certain types of grain from Canadian Wheat Board 
jurisdiction, in fairness there must also be an inclusion clause. 
Hon. members from the opposition responded by saying that was 
fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is so much resistance and so much fear of the 
inclusion clause in the grain sector that we have said, if that 
is the strongest argument of the government against bringing 
forward an inclusion clause that hardly any farmer would support, 
let us take them both out.  Motion No. 41 is part of Group No. 2 
and moves to strike the exclusion clause.  It must be viewed in 
conjunction with the subsequent motion to delete the inclusion 
clause. 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise once again on Bill C-4 and to deal with the 
three amendments in Group No. 2.  One of them is mine and two are 
from hon. members of the Reform Party.  I promise to be relevant, 
as relevant as members on the government side have been.  I 
promise not to be boring.  I hope that will please the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will clarify a couple of points.  I do not believe anybody on 
this side of the House necessarily wants to see the demise of the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  It is very important to recognize that. We 
are simply saying that we have the opportunity to make this the 
best possible legislation available so that western Canadian 
producers are able to take advantage of new techniques and new 
opportunities within legislation.  The legislation as put forward 
does not allow that to happen.  It is simply a regurgitation of 
the existing legislation with some minor amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Usually when legislation is being proposed there is at least one 
segment of the society affected that would totally support it.  I 
can honestly say the government in its wisdom has alienated just 
about everyone.  There is no one who totally supports the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked a number of witnesses in committee whether the 
divisiveness among producers in western Canada would stop, 
whether they would be happy to go forward with the legislation. 
To a person, including those in support of Bill C-4, they said it 
would not stop divisiveness, that it would not stop the anger 
with respect to the controls Bill C-4 would place on producers in 
western Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak to the three motions put forward in Group No. 2. 
The first one, the deletion of clause 2, put forward by the hon. 
member for Peace River, says that the act is binding on Her 
Majesty in the right of Canada or a province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also clarify that when dealing with provinces I do not believe 
anybody on this side of the House would suggest members of 
government should not have the opportunity to debate any piece of 
legislation or to put their opinions forward on any piece of 
legislation, no matter where they come from.  Whether they come 
from Prince Edward Island or from Vancouver Island, it is very 
important for elected members of the House to have the 
opportunity to put forward their opinions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope Canadians realize the legislation affects only producers 
from Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and a very small portion of 
British Columbia.  When individuals from Prince Edward Island, 
Newfoundland or Quebec, my good friends from Quebec, deal with 
the legislation I would expect them to listen to and understand 
the views put forth by those people who come forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not see that happen in committee.  I saw people put 
forward their concerns and their views, but they were not 
listened to.  If they had been listened to, the amendments we are 
speaking to right now would have passed at committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was an opportunity for me to be at a committee hearing for 
the first time.  I actually thought we could include better 
amendments that would make the legislation workable.  It did not 
happen for the simple reason it was a foregone conclusion.  The 
witnesses were in effect wasting their breath in speaking to us. 
It would have been nicer if we had listened and taken their 
concerns under advisement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces that are being affected should be listened to, the 
people of those provinces should be listened to and the 
provincial governments of those provinces should be listened to. 
Two of the three provincial governments accept the fact that 
there should be some major changes.  One unfortunately decided 
that the particular legislation should be maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second motion was spoken to most eloquently by my colleague 
in the Reform Party.  It deals with the contingency clause.  It 
is important for Canadians to understand what it is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three pillars to the Canadian Wheat Board.  The first 
pillar is that of pooling.  We will get into that a little later 
when we talk about the options or the opt in and opt out and the 
opportunity of cash buying.  That is not being dealt with in this 
amendment.  It will be dealt with later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second pillar of the Canadian Wheat Board is monopoly.  We 
have talked a lot about monopoly purchasing and the selling of 
one commodity, particularly wheat.  We will get into that as well 
at a later date when considering other amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third pillar of the Canadian Wheat Board, which is not 
necessarily a bad one, is that of government guarantees.  The 
reason we have the Canadian Wheat Board is that the federal 
government guaranteed producers initial payments and adjusted 
payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I mention this is that the contingency fund being 
proposed in the legislation concerns not only me but producers. 
The reason it concerns producers is that there is an opportunity 
for the Canadian Wheat Board and the government to charge 
producers, whether it be per bushel or per tonne, whether it be 
$1 or whether it be 10¢.  We do not know that yet.  That will be 
struck by the board.  It will have the opportunity via a tax to 
have a contingency fund that could be in excess of hundreds of 
millions of dollars.  It could be half a billion dollars if that 
is the way the Canadian Wheat Board wants to operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The danger is that ultimately if there is a contingency fund in 
those numbers the Canadian Wheat Board or the government could 
say there is no need for particular guarantees from governments. 
Guarantees could be funded out of a contingency fund.  This is a 
very serious danger to the existing Canadian Wheat Board and 
certainly to producers themselves.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some advantages and disadvantages, but the majority of 
people who spoke to us, whether pro or against the Canadian Wheat 
Board, indicated their desire not to have a contingency fund. I 
have talked to producers, as have other members on this side of 
the House, who had serious concerns about the contingency fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this amendment we are saying that the contingency fund should 
be removed from the legislation and the guarantees of government 
should simply be put back into place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants a Canadian Wheat Board which is subject to 
the controls of government, of its executive officer and of 
members of the board. If 10 of 15 board members are to be elected 
it does not mean the Canadian Wheat Board will be accountable to 
producers.  It will still be accountable to the minister 
responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board.  It is written in the 
legislation that the minister has the final authority and say. We 
should not be confused by the fact that 10 of 15 members will be 
accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be made a truly elected board by having 15 of the 15 
members elected by producers.  It could be made a truly 
democratic process by having the board hire the chief executive 
officer.  That makes sense corporately and has to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My amendment speaks to the exclusion clause.  As the member for 
Peace River indicated, it is a marriage between two clauses, an 
exclusion clause and an inclusion clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-72, the predecessor bill, inclusion was never 
mentioned.  Now it is in this bill.  When asked at committee why 
there was an inclusion clause, the answer was simple: if we have 
exclusion then we have to have inclusion. It was not a good 
answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked people who appeared before committee if they would be 
prepared to give up their exclusion rights to get rid of 
inclusion.  We literally heard from dozens of organizations and 
only three did not want it.  Almost unanimously they said that in 
order to get rid of inclusion they would give up exclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion has been put forward to get rid of exclusion.  The 
motion should pass.  We will deal with inclusion when that motion 
is being debated.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
thank you for giving me the floor so promptly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4 is a major bill for western grain producers, so much 
so that consideration of the bill had to be spread over more than 
a year.  In its great wisdom and clarity of vision, the Liberal 
government had planned to have Bill C-72 passed during the 35th 
Parliament, but the early call for a general election on June 2 
forced us to scrap everything that had been done.  This meant a 
considerable waste of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would, however, like to emphasize that, on the agriculture 
and agri-food committee, we heard the views of scores of people. 
The large majority of them expressed discontent with the wording of 
Bill C-4, which will, according to the Liberals, modify the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act from <I>a</I> to <I>z</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our opinion, this is a very tiny step forward, and as a 
result I can announce to you, to the great chagrin of the hon. 
member for Malpeque, that we will support this amendment to Bill 
C-4 for a number of different and important reasons.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons is as follows.  I would like to know—and 
from you directly, Mr. Speaker—why the Prime Minister gave 
responsibility for the Canadian Wheat Board to a minister other 
than the minister of agriculture.  Is the new minister of 
agriculture too incompetent to manage the Canadian Wheat Board on 
his own?  That is my question.  Does the Prime Minister not have 
confidence in him?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on a point of 
order, the member from Frontenac is getting into inflammatory 
remarks against the current minister of agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Chair would 
consider that to be a point of debate, not a point of order. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would invite my friend 
from Prince Edward Island, the hon. member for Malpeque, to listen, 
which is no mean feat in his case since you cannot tell him 
anything.  However, he can learn a thing or two from the member for 
Frontenac—Mégantic, which is what I want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the government, under the Prime Minister, gave 
responsibility for this bill to the Minister of Natural Resources, 
on the grounds that he comes from the west.  I have more fingers on 
my hands than there are Liberal members from the West in this 
House, so he did not have a choice if they were going to give it to 
someone from the West.  So he gave it to the Minister of Natural 
Resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggested to my friend from Malpeque that the auditor 
general, who is above all reproach and whose appointment was 
approved by all parties in this House, should go and root through 
the books of the Canadian Wheat Board.  The Liberals turned the 
suggestion down saying that a group of auditors from the west—one 
of the famous accounting firms like Raymond, Chabot, Martin, 
Paré in Quebec—could do the audit. In the West it appears to be 
Touche Ross & Co. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Reform colleagues went at the Prime Minister 
himself on several occasions because it appears that he gets a lot 
of financial support from these groups of auditors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When an organization like the Canadian Wheat Board has its 
books audited, only the invoices presented are audited.  The 
auditors find that it matches the invoice, but do not check if the 
invoice is valid.  Do you follow me? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the Reform Party, the Bloc Quebecois and all the 
opposition parties in this House agree that the auditor general should 
audit the books. I made some calculations. The Canadian Wheat Board will 
be managing sales representing between $6 billion and $7 billion. That 
is a substantial amount. A 1% error would cost $600 million. That is 
quite a lot of money. 
You will tell me that I am exaggerating. I agree, 1% is too high. 
Take 1% of 1%, or one thousandth. That is $6 million. I am pretty sure 
that if one thousandth of the sales were poorly managed, western farm 
producers would lose $6 million without anyone noticing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the auditor general, with his flair, with his team and with his 
expertise, would figure out in no time that something is wrong and would 
not hesitate to single out individuals in his annual report or to point 
out any inappropriate spending. 
Then we could rub Liberals' noses in it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, this is a step forward, but a very tiny step indeed. The 
board of directors will include 10 elected members; 10 western grain 
producers will sit on the board. But five other directors, two of whom 
will be major players, will be appointed by the governor in council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to submit to the hon. member for Malpeque, 
who is running this debate for the government, that the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture and Agri-food should be consulted. I am not 
asking that it be given a veto, just that it be consulted. The hon. 
member for Malpeque does not want to. He does not even trust—I am 
afraid my name is about to get crossed off of his list of friends, but 
we will see what can be negotiated later—the members of the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture and Agri-food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to the appointments in question. This morning's 
papers report that the Prime Minister revoked an appointment made by his 
predecessor, Lester B. Pearson.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand that my friend, 
the member for Frontenac—Mégantic, can get quite worked up—I'm 
not sure which hormones are involved—but I think we should stick 
to the point.  What Canadians want to hear is his position on— 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> In the opinion of the 
Chair, the debate of the hon. member for Frontenac—Mégantic was 
relevant and we will add that time to the hon. member's time.

were to allow me the two minutes I have left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, the Prime Minister expelled a Liberal senator 
appointed by Lester B. Pearson.  I will not name him out of respect 
for his children.  The fellow will earn $500,000 for doing nothing. 
This is coming out of our pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, I hear about these appointments all the time. 
Voters turfed out Mary Clancy.  Not two weeks had gone by before 
the Prime Minister found her a spot paying more than MPs' wages. 
Voters showed Francis Leblanc the door because of the treatment of 
the unemployed in his riding.  The Minister of Human Resources 
Development will get him to administer the employment insurance 
fund.  This did not—

on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Mr. Speaker, you know what I am good at. 
If you want us to start rhyming off the names of members of the 
Bloc Quebecois who have demonstrated their incompetence rather than 
focus on the present debate, that is fine by me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the voters in my riding of Bourassa want to know what is 
going on with this bill and I would ask the member, who is perhaps 
not often in his riding, to stick to important issues, in this case 
the Canadian Wheat Board. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> In so far as the 
government will be appointing members to the board of directors 
of the Canadian Wheat Board, debate concerning the record of the 
government's past appointments to previous boards is relevant. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> Mr. Speaker, you can see as well as I 
that the rookie member for Bourassa lacks experience and is doing 
everything he can to distract us, to keep us from criticizing the 
blunders of the Liberal Party, headed by the member for 
Saint-Maurice, who can sometimes be inherently devious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder the government— 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  With respect, I 
think the hon. member for Frontenac—Mégantic has gone a bit 
too far this time.  With respect, I would ask that his most recent 
remark concerning the hon. member for Saint-Maurice be withdrawn.

inherently devious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get back to the appointments, the former mayor of Quebec 
City ran up against my colleague, the hon. member for Québec, in 
the 1993 election.  He lost the election and three days later— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> I am sorry, but the hon.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Resuming debate with the hon. member for Simcoe—Grey. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to address remarks by two members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First to the hon. member for Brandon—Souris regarding his 
comments, I found them rather insulting and borderline prejudice. 
For him to suggest for one moment that as members of Parliament 
we are not supposed to deal with national issues, with a $6 
billion industry that this government backs and because we are 
from one specific area or another, those comments are nothing 
more than prejudice.  Absolutely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to his comments of inclusion, as a new member of 
this committee I did listen.  I listened to my Reform colleagues. 
I listened to the witnesses and I listened to Conservative 
colleagues.  Unlike the member for Brandon—Souris, I took back 
some of the answers the people had given me.  There was a very 
simple statement made.  What was best for the farmers was 
inclusion.  That is why it is there, not specific special 
interests groups that do not necessarily represent certain 
numbers of farmers.  That is what is best for the farmers.  That 
is why it stands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the member for Frontenac—Mégantic, he should 
hang his head in shame.  He should be embarrassed for 
the comments he made.  To insult the minister of agriculture 
completely unacceptable.  To sit here and question 
the integrity of the prime minister is also unacceptable, likely 
one of the respected politicians in the entire world and 
certainly in Canada. Those types of statements are completely 
unacceptable in this House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on a point of order, do you know what the biggest insult 
is right now?  The minister responsible for the wheat board and the 
agriculture minister are not here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The hon. member will 
know we do not refer to the absence or the presence of other hon. 
members.  The hon. member would also know that is not a point of 
order. Resuming debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, these types of shenanigans 
my Reform colleagues are pulling are completely disrespectful of 
this House.  They too should be completely ashamed of the tactics 
they use.  They are not only embarrassing themselves but they are 
embarrassing their constituents.  I suggest they reflect on their 
actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, the comments directed at our minister of 
agriculture and our prime minister are completely unacceptable. 
Again, the member should be extremely ashamed of himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was asking some pointed questions with regard to why the 
minister of agriculture was not overseeing the Canadian Wheat 
Board discussions, the same questions he asked at committee.  He 
received completely detailed and very acceptable answers.  Then 
he brings those questions to the House for no more reason than 
grandstanding and insulting members when he knows they are not 
here to defend themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board is good for farmers.  The inclusion 
clause is good for farmers, despite what these colleagues across 
the floor are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that note, I request a answer from the member for 
Brandon—Souris.  Are we not entitled to discuss issues relevant 
to Canada in an industry which encompasses $6 billion dollars or 
should we just sit here and remain quite?

asked the question— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  With respect, that 
was a point of debate and perhaps that debate would be best 
behind the curtains.  Resuming debate, the hon. member for 
Palliser. 
<P><A NAME="LINK81"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the next grouping of motions that are 
before the House this afternoon.  Specifically, we are looking at 
Motions Nos. 2, 31 and 41 as has already been outlined by 
previous speakers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I listened carefully to the mover of two of those three 
motions, it was clear that on Motion No. 2 what the mover of the 
motion is seeking is the ability of a province to opt out of the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  Motion No. 31 deals with a contingency 
fund and Motion No. 41 deals with the exclusion clause as well 
and obviously the inclusion clause is part of both of those, as 
has been pointed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is beginning to become clear is now that we are past the 
words in the preamble, the support by the members in the 
opposition for the Canadian Wheat Board is like Liberal support 
on the prairies, a mile wide and an inch deep. That is 
particularly true of some of the speeches that have been coming 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Motion No. 2, clearly what is at play here would 
be, as the member for Prince George—Peace River pointed out, 
that a province such as Alberta could opt out.  Obviously a move 
like that would totally cripple the Canadian Wheat Board.  We 
certainly would oppose any reference to an opting out provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the three motions that are before us, Motion No. 31 is 
critical. It would delete clause 8 which deals with using any 
profits from bonds, debentures, notes or other evidence of 
indebtedness in payment of expenses incurred by the corporation 
or putting money into the contingency fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that some members of this House, in particular 
members of the Official Opposition, want to eliminate any 
reference to a contingency fund and so does our caucus, but I 
think we have different motives in mind.  What is at stake here 
is to delete any reference to the contingency fund and not to 
have any borrowing contingencies from the federal government.  In 
other words, the Canadian Wheat Board would stand or fall on its 
own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not supportive of that.  We do support the wheat board 
and recognize that there needs to be government guarantees along 
this line.  In fact, we want to see the government guarantees be 
the same as they have always been for the Canadian Wheat Board. 
This has not been a big drain on Canadian taxpayers to have had 
that kind of support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to us to be a very difficult argument to persuade 
western Canadian wheat and barley growers that a new, improved 
wheat board bill is going to be good for them and at the same 
time have significant increased input costs, costs of production, 
to maintain the contingency fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tried during committee stage to have some estimate of how big 
that contingency fund might be.  We never did get a satisfactory 
response from government officials, although some people have put 
it as high as $575 million.  Whether that is 10% of the value of 
the Canadian Wheat Board, I do not know where that figure comes 
from, but it is from usually reliable sources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not know and farmers obviously do not know how big that 
contingency fund is going to have to be or how much they are 
going to have to pay for it.  We certainly reject the idea of a 
contingency fund.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, we would like to see the Government of Canada 
continue to have the borrowing authority for the Canadian Wheat 
Board, more correctly, to be able to go through the government 
for its borrowing requirements on an annual basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board, it seems to me, is a classic example 
of farmers in this case banding together to create an entity 
which would allow them to do collectively what they could not do 
individually or separately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because there has been a lot of chatter about the history of the 
wheat board and how it was invoked on an unwilling farm community 
in western Canada, I would like to quote from an eminent Manitoba 
historian, Gerald Friesen, who says that Prime Minister Bennett's 
cabinet was under enormous pressure to relieve the burdens of 
farmers and to judge by the leaders of prairie farm movements, 
the prairie preference was for a national wheat marketing board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers supported the wheat board in the dirty thirties and they 
are still supporting it in the nebulous nineties as we saw from 
the vote last year, to the member from the Reform Party. 
Sixty-seven per cent, as a matter of fact, of the barley growers 
voted to have the board continue marketing their crop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What do you know about farming? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  I represent some farmers.  I thought I 
heard a lot of chatter.  I know the difference between Motion No. 
2 and Motion No. 5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  With regard to Motion No. 41, the 
Conservatives and the Reform propose to do away with the 
exclusion clause.  Again, we see rugged individualists at work 
here far more in common with the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange and 
the Canadian Federation of Independent Business and the National 
Citizens' Coalition than with grain farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think it is a simplistic solution to say that we do not want 
the inclusion clause, therefore we will take out the exclusion 
clause as well and we will all live happily ever after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our preference in this caucus is to give the Canadian Wheat 
Board both options of exclusion and inclusion clause for the 
future.  We may all have our views about what the future holds 
for the Canadian Wheat Board, but no one can say with certainty 
what it will look like in five or ten years from now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think not to give those kinds of options to the board of 
directors of the future Canadian Wheat Board would be to 
hamstring it significantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, it would be a democratic decision, including a 
vote.  There is certainly nothing wrong with that.  We say that 
farmers should be allowed to vote on inclusion clause and 
exclusion clause as the bill currently is, although we will have 
something to say on deleting a portion of the inclusion clause 
when we get to that portion of it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK82"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to 
address a couple of points and provide some information that 
might be helpful as this debate goes forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member from the New Democratic Party who spoke last 
wondered out loud about the size of the contingency fund.  He 
intimated that he could not get a proper answer as to how large 
the contingency fund might be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a reasonable question but I think if people are in 
possession of the facts, they will understand that the answer to 
that is that no one really knows exactly how large that fund will 
be.  It will depend on the decisions made by the board of 
directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members have to remember that 10 of the 15 directors will be 
elected by farmers.  People from the Reform Party always have 
real difficulty in listening to facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I could just proceed, the size of the contingency fund will 
depend on decisions made by the board of directors. 
For example, how much use will they make of cash buyouts or the 
early cash pools? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1325"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It depends on what the board of directors does.  If it does not 
use those options very often, it could be that the contingency 
fund will be quite small.  However, it could choose to use the 
extra tools which we are giving it, the tools which farmers have 
wanted.  One of the reasons for the bill is to give the farmers 
and the wheat board more flexibility.  If it chooses to use those 
options very seldom, chances are the contingency fund will be 
quite small. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the amendment proposed by the hon. member for 
Brandon—Souris, his proposal concerning the contingency fund 
would rob the board of one more flexible tool.  If we considered 
his motion, the only way that a contingency fund could be built 
up would be through the route of check-offs.  The way the bill is 
written now profits could be used from the sale of bonds, 
debentures, notes and other financial instruments to credit the 
contingency fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Reform Party saying “No, we should not give the board of 
directors those options.  No, we want to handicap it.  We want to 
tie its hands”?   Let us get serious.  Surely the board of 
directors should have as much flexibility as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Brandon—Souris has proposed in his 
amendment to get rid of the exclusion clause.  What is the 
exclusion clause about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has the same principle as the inclusion clause.  It sets down 
a set of rules for orderly procedures.  If someone wants to take 
a grain away from the wheat board, under this bill there will be 
a set of rules and much of the uncertainty will be removed. 
Would farmers not want that?  I think they would.  But not the 
Reform Party.  It does not want any rules or procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The exclusion clause sets out a procedure.  The inclusion clause 
does exactly the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is seeking orderliness, a set procedure.  If we talk in 
those terms to most farmers, they will understand that there is a 
need for rules so they will know exactly where they stand.  Right 
now, if someone wanted to exclude a grain from the wheat board, 
what is the rule?  It is all up in the air.  The bill addresses 
that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same thing with inclusion.  What rules are there to 
add a grain to the board?  There are no rules.  That is what the 
bill is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B>  I know that members of the Reform Party 
have trouble with facts.  They have trouble with information. 
Any time we try to bring facts to the debate, what do we hear?  A

</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario has its own wheat board.  Many Albertans, quite frankly, 
want to have that same type of board.  The board would have a 
completely elected body and it would give choice to the farmers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They have to go through the token process of getting a Canadian 
Wheat Board permit to export but those are granted routinely. 
Many farmers in Alberta would be very happy to have that kind of 
situation.  That is the first amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second amendment which was also put forward by the Reform 
Party would remove the contingency fund completely from the 
legislation.  It is difficult to understand why these two motions 
were grouped together because they do not really relate to each 
other in any way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third amendment in this group was presented by the 
Conservatives. It was also presented by Reform. It would remove 
the inclusion clause, a clause that would allow the inclusion of 
grains other than wheat and barley into wheat board jurisdiction. 
Try to figure how that relates to the other two. I am very 
concerned about the groupings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth amendment in this group would remove the president as 
an appointed member of the board.  The Freshwater Fish Marketing 
Board has demonstrated very clearly that we do not want the 
president appointed by the minister.  The president should be 
hired and fired by an elected board of directors.  That is the 
situation we should have within the wheat board.  The Freshwater 
Fish Marketing Board has a board much like that being proposed 
under Bill C-4 with some members being appointed and some being 
elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A situation developed recently in which a former Liberal was 
appointed as president CEO of the board, much as a Liberal could 
be appointed as president or CEO of the wheat board when this 
legislation passes.  In that situation the board was so much 
against having this person running its marketing board that the 
board completely removed the power the president would have so 
the person it wanted to run the board would retain that power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What those board members did will help them.  At least they will 
have the person they chose to run the board.  But there will 
probably be interference from this patronage appointment. 
Meanwhile the 2,500 fishermen who have their fish marketed 
through this board are paying for that salary, which is about 
$103,000, plus all the perks that go with this patronage 
appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the situation in the Freshwater Fish Marketing Board, 
which is what would happen if the proposed changes in Bill C-4 go 
through.  That is the reason we have put forth our amendments in 
this grouping.  Those amendments would at least make the 
president a position that required hiring by what we want, an 
elected board of directors.  Under this legislation that position 
requires appointment by the minister. The legislation also 
specifies a board with five appointees and ten elected members. 
In a nutshell that is what is included in this group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will discuss the amendment related to inclusion and exclusion. 
I recently saw a letter that pointed out four groups in support 
of the inclusion clause in Bill C-4.  These groups were the 
National Farmers Union, the Family Farm Foundation, the Catholic 
Rural Life Ministry and some of the delegates of the Saskatchewan 
Wheat Pool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter failed to mention the various groups that have stated 
in committee and through letters to the minister that they do not 
want this inclusion clause in the legislation. I will go through 
this list for the members opposite who should know if they have 
been paying attention to what has been going on with this 
legislation that in committee these groups have vigorously 
opposed the inclusion clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first group is the Canadian Canola Growers Association, one 
of the largest producer groups in Canada. 
The second is the Manitoba Canola Growers Association.  These two 
groups represent thousands of farmers from western Canada who are 
very happy having canola marketed on a completely open marketing 
system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in the early 1980s we had a plebiscite on the inclusion of 
canola into the wheat board and it was defeated by a large margin 
even back then.  The mood of farmers now certainly is not for 
more inclusion under wheat board jurisdiction.  If the members 
opposite on the government side would just look at the polls that 
have been done, at the surveys that have been done, they would 
know that the mood in Canada today among western farmers is 
clearly toward having the monopoly completely removed from the 
Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the plebiscite in Alberta, a plebiscite which I think 
was well run. It showed that 62% of farmers in Alberta preferred 
a voluntary board or a dual marketing systems in wheat. 
Sixty-seven percent of farmers in Alberta preferred a voluntary 
board for the marketing of barley. That was for domestic and 
export marketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the farmers of Alberta support a completely voluntary 
board and in no way support this piece of legislation and are 
particularly against the inclusion clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Saskatchewan, which wanted to get the results 
showing that the monopoly should be retained, found to its shock, 
even with the poll as it was done, that 57% of farmers in 
Saskatchewan were in favour of voluntary marketing.  They were in 
favour of a voluntary board, a dual marketing system run by the 
Government of Saskatchewan, even though it wanted a much 
different result.  That is clear evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own constituency of Lakeland I had a professional pollster 
out of Edmonton, a reputable organization, do a poll and in that 
poll there were about 700 and some people involved.  We were 
polling on different issues.  We had a response of somewhere 
around 250 farmers in that constituency and about 80% favoured a 
voluntary marketing system.  I know that in my constituency 
farmers do not support the inclusion clause.  They do not support 
this wheat board monopoly in any way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To finish the list, the Flax Growers Western Canada are strongly 
against the inclusion clause.  The Oat Producers Association of 
Alberta, the Alberta Winter Wheat Producers Commission, the 
Canadian Federation of Independent Business and its members 
polled do not support this inclusion clause. The Saskatchewan 
Canola Growers, the Alberta Canola Producers, the Canadian 
Oilseed Processors Association, the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange 
and the Western Canadian Wheat Growers, being one of the larger 
associations with a completely voluntary membership, which has 
with it a pretty hefty membership fee— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, the 
Canadian Federation of Agriculture, which has a membership larger 
than all the organizations he mentioned, supports this clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is a point of 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am really quite 
shocked that these members want to interrupt us at every 
opportunity they get.  That same Canadian Federation of 
Agriculture is against this piece of legislation as it is.  It 
wants some major amendments to this legislation before it will be 
put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So if the member is going to refer to the Canadian Federation of 
Agriculture, he had better give the whole story.  It does not 
support this legislation as it is.  In fact, even the wheat board 
advisory committee is strongly against.  It said it wants this 
bill defeated if the parts of the bill that refer to cash 
purchases are not removed.  It does not even support it, if you 
can believe it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the only witness who supported this bill, and even with 
amendments or with relatively minor amendments, was the current 
chief commissioner of the Canadian Wheat Board, Lorne Hehn.  He 
is the only one.  In committee I asked Chief Commissioner Hehn if 
he in fact was not in line for an appointment as president, CEO, 
and he did not deny it.

Lac-Saint-Louis is quite correct.  The hon. member was responding 
to another comment that was thrown across the Chamber, “yahoo”, 
both given in the same spirit, both received in the same spirit. 
The Chair ruled that we had had enough and that we were not going 
down that road any further.  Resuming debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I 
do not think you will find in Beauchesne's that the word yahoo is 
unparliamentary but certainly the word crook is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  With respect, I 
think the House should note that the Chair has a great deal of 
respect for the hon. member who has just made this point. 
However, it is in the Chair's opinion that there are no words in

and use of the words which make them unparliamentary.  Resuming

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Saint-Eustache—Sainte-Thérèse, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to address Bill C-4, an act to amend the Canadian 
Wheat Board Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the Bloc and I agree with the government's 
intention to amend this act. It is interesting to see that, finally, the 
government seems to want to give more decision making powers to grain 
producers. I say seems to want, because the amendments to the act are 
being made by the government, not by and for the producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been in order for the government to first seek a 
consensus among producers before making these amendments, but it did not 
do so, if we are to believe what we are hearing in this House. I will 
not get into the technical aspects of the act, but I will raise the 
issues of fairness, honesty and patronage as they relate to the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I firmly believe, as do the majority of members sitting on this 
side of the House, that the Auditor General of Canada should have the 
right and the authority to look into the activities of the Canadian 
Wheat Board. I sometimes wonder. Why are government members opposed to 
the auditor general doing that? Why are they opposed to the auditor 
general checking into the Bank of Canada? Why are they opposed to him 
looking into the Canada Post Corporation? Why are they opposed to him 
checking into the Canada Ports Corporation? 
I could go on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are corporations which are funded by us, the taxpayers. The 
auditor general must not just write an annual report. His primary role 
is to check on how public money is spent and then report on it, so that 
this government can make the necessary changes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have here a few questions. What would have been the 
government's response to cases involving the Canadian Wheat Board 
if the auditor general had looked into this?  It is all very fine 
and well to use chartered accountants—my colleague, the member for 
Frontenac—Mégantic, said they will check the books—but 
accountants do not make recommendations about mismanagement of a 
corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wonder how it is that our friends opposite did not pay 
attention to the Canadian Wheat Board mini-scandal over the 
revamping of Churchill Falls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that our friends opposite turned a deaf ear to the 
pleas of the mayor of Thunder Bay?  How is it that the mayor of a 
city in Ontario is forced to turn to a member from Quebec for 
support?  The mayor of Thunder Bay, like all residents of Ontario 
in the Lake Superior area, is wondering why the federal government 
invested $44.5 million on window dressing in that city.  Why did 
this government's Department of Transport give $16 million to CN in 
compensation for selling off the Winnipeg—Churchill Falls section 
to Omni Tracks, which Omni Tracks operates on Hudson Bay Rails?  CN 
received $16 million in compensation for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Department of Transport investing over $14.4 
million in a dust control system in the port of Churchill and $1.6 
million in a system to unload trains? 
This unnecessary spending adds up to almost $50 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What purpose will it serve?  Instead of grain going to Thunder 
Bay, across Lake Superior and then up the St. Lawrence to Europe, 
it will go to Europe through Churchill Falls, a port that is not 
open 12 months a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This change, according to figures provided by the city of 
Thunder Bay, will send 700,000 tonnes of grain through Churchill 
Falls instead of through Thunder Bay, which will deprive Thunder 
Bay of $35,750,000 annually.  This pointless spending will cost 12 
Thunder Bay employees their jobs.  In addition, this policy will 
cost Thunder Bay $1.7 million in taxes annually.  To put it 
plainly, the government is robbing Peter to pay Paul. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The experts—not me, but the experts—say that from a common 
point between Vancouver and Redford, Saskatchewan, and from Redford 
to Thunder Bay or to a port on the St. Lawrence, the cost per tonne 
of grain, of wheat shipped, differs—

discussed in two or three years. Pardon me if I go from one group to the 
other, but I will now move on to Group No. 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I way saying, it costs $76.33 a tonne to ship wheat from Redford 
to Vancouver. From Redford to Thunder Bay, it costs $53.80. 
I wonder why the Canadian Wheat Board ships its grain, its barley and 
its wheat to countries like Irak, Saudi Arabia, Germany and Belgium 
through ports in Vancouver. Why not ship the wheat through Thunder Bay 
and then through the ports in Quebec? This makes no sense, I cannot 
understand it. I cannot understand it, unless this is part of a certain 
Plan B to isolate Quebec from Europe. Maybe that is the reason. I cannot 
understand it.

part of the bill.  I would like to challenge some of the 
statements that have been made.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point that out because during the late 1970s and 1980s we 
moved tremendous amounts of grain to the Soviet Union and other 
east bloc countries.  We could move it for about $30 or $40 a 
tonne cheaper through Churchill.  They even offered to bring in 
icebreakers to move the grain out of that port.  For some reason 
there was enough clout either in Ottawa or somewhere else to 
defer all that grain down the St. Lawrence, which cost us an 
extra $38 a tonne to move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial governments should have some clout.  They should 
have some say.  I cannot comprehend why hon. members would object 
to that.  Ontario, for example, runs its board completely by 
itself.  It ships its grain in whatever direction it wants and 
sells it to whomever it wants.  It seems very strange that the 
bill would specific that provincial authority or provincial input 
should be outlawed.  That just does not make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would think we would want to make sure the bill was beneficial 
to farmers and put the most money back into their pockets.  Those 
are the people who have sweated and worked hard.  They have taken 
chances.  They have paid all the input costs and should get out 
of it what it is worth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing I want to comment on for a few minutes is the 
contingency fund.  I do not know why farmers would support a bill 
with this type of fund when they have no actual control over it. 
With the five appointed commissioners or directors the government 
would still have control because it will put in the CEO at its 
pleasure and fire the CEO at its pleasure.  Why would we want to 
put money into a fund that we cannot control?  That seems to be 
plainly ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the wheat board appeared before us as witnesses. They 
were asked what the contingency fund would cost farmers and what 
percentage of the funds from what is to be sold through the cash 
market will be deducted for the contingency fund?  They said that 
it would be from 5% to 10% of the gross amount of that cheque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if Liberal members have not paid attention to the 
return on agriculture investment today.  The top investment money 
one can get from one's assets today is probably 1.5% to 1.75%. If 
the board is to deduct 5% as a minimum and up to 10%, farmers 
will lose money selling their grain.  There is no way to make the 
contingency fund pay.  Why would any farmer be so foolish as to 
sell his grain in that kind of market?  It does not make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand why a person would want to take money out of 
his pocket and put it into a fund where the auditor general 
cannot even look at it to see whether it is invested properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A year ago I introduced a private member's bill to put the 
auditor general in control of the wheat board.  Every member on 
that side said no way.  They did not want accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That nice book the hon. parliamentary secretary to the minister 
of fisheries holds up in the air is a smoke screen.  It is not 
worth putting a match to it.  If members want to find out why 
they should look into the elections act to find out how many 
millions that auditing firm paid to the election fund of the 
Liberals.  It is very interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I flew back to Ottawa in August to do some work.  I picked up 
the <I>Hill Times</I>, and what did I see?  I saw a whole page ad 
by the Canadian Wheat Board telling western farmers how good it 
was.  How many western farmers read the <I>Hill Times</I>?  It 
cost western farmers $3,200 to put that ad in the paper.  Can you 
believe that, Mr. Speaker?  I cannot believe it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One way we can come to the aid of honest Canadians currently 
facing a growing mountain of personal or small business debt 
would be to enforce tougher penalties for those who abuse the 
bankruptcy process.

supporting Africa's efforts to achieve faster growth and sustainable

to find solutions to the debt problem and to encourage the development 
of the African economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's efforts in these areas leave much to be desired. Canada's 
contribution to poor countries over the next several years will fall 
below 0.2% of GNP. In 1998, Canadian international assistance will be at 
its lowest level since the 1960s.

poor countries and especially from Africa. We urge the government to 
respect its commitment to earmark 0.7% of its GNP for official

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on this 
National Child Day I would like to bring attention to the plight 
of the children in Canada whose parents are finding it difficult 
to feed and clothe their families, a situation which the 
government has perpetuated through high taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases the troubles families find themselves in are no 
fault of their own.  Families that work long hours, work more 
than one job still find that their after-tax income is not enough 
to properly care for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average family spends more on taxes than on food, shelter 
and clothing combined.  This causes a great deal of anxiety and 
pain to hard working Canadians.  This situation does not need to 
exist nor should it exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will this government wake up, get its hands out of the 
pockets of hard working Canadian families and give them their 
money back?  Through inflated income tax, job killing, high EI 
premiums and now an almost doubling of CPP premiums, the 
government continues to take, take, take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children are living in poverty in Canada because the Liberal 
government is taxing their families into the poor house.

this debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the light of this damning report, could the Minister of Canadian

</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister, who is responsible for the integrity of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr.

allocated to the promotion of the official languages and gave the money 
to Option Canada. This is six times the annual subsidy to the Fédération 
des communautés francophones et acadienne du Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will simply remind the hon. member and anyone else interested 
in this issue, that the amount of the funds allocated to Option Canada 
is exactly the same as the amount given by the Quebec government to 
Option souveraineté Québec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Banks have registered record profits over the past five years. Part 
of the reason for this is the service charges they require their 
customers to pay. It is easy for the banks to strangle their customers. 
This government does not require them to publish the figures that could 
explain such charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not set up a parliamentary inquiry to determine how much of 
these profits were made at the expense of Canadians? 
<P><A NAME="LINK144"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if banks 
are making profits, the leader of the NDP can rest assured that we will 
tax them. This government, in fact, levied $100 million in taxes on 
banks in its second budget. This government has taxed major 
corporations, and this includes major financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a good thing that the banks are stable, but we are ensuring 
for Canadian taxpayers that we are getting our share of the pie. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK145"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
issue is why banks are making obscene profits while Canadians are 
paying obscene service charges.  Bank service charges are user 
fees.  They are regressive taxes feeding massive profits and they 
play a part in preventing over 400,000 low income Canadians from 
even having a bank account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of Finance introduce legislation requiring 
financial institutions to provide a lifeline account, assuring 
basic, affordable financial services to all Canadians? 
<P><A NAME="LINK146"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International

investment and progressive participation in the Canadian 
economy”.

surely, that he wants to pass on.  The point is well taken by the 
House.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>THE LATE ROBERT THOMPSON 
</H3><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, we will now proceed to 
tributes to Mr. Thompson, who was with us.  He was a member of the 
Social Credit Party and also a member of the Conservative Party. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to Dr. Robert Thompson who came to this 
House in 1962 to represent his constituents of Red Deer, Alberta 
and to lead the Social Credit Party at a time of great political 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He served in the House from 1962 until 1972, a decade.  What a 
decade in political life.  In those ten years there were five 
general elections.  The Social Credit Party which Bob Thompson 
led in 1962 was a power to be reckoned with in the west and in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Press accounts of the day paint a picture of a new leader and a 
new party running against the establishment.  When the Social 
Credit Party collapsed, he ran successfully as a Progressive 
Conservative and in 1968 he was a member until the general 
election in 1972. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bob Thompson served his country in Parliament and also in 
the Royal Canadian Air Force when Canada was engaged in pilot 
training during World War II. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He served humanity as an educator here and in Ethiopia.  He was 
a minister of education in the imperial Ethiopian government from 
1947 until 1951.  After his political life, he maintained his 
interest in teaching and public affairs.  In 1982 he prepared a 
model constitution for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His strong religious faith is reflected in his coat of arms, the 
motto being translated “In the will of God”.  Mr. Thompson was 
made an officer of the Order of Canada in national recognition of 
his service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the House of Commons pays tribute to him.  In doing so, we 
thank his family for sharing him with Canada.  His eight children 
and his widow Evelyn had less of his presence and time because 
of his public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we mourn him, we honour his memory and we thank his family 
for sharing him with this House and with Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is with regret that we learned of the passing of Bob 
Thompson.  His career was rich and varied in service to others. 
Bob taught school in Alberta before the war.  He was an officer 
in the Royal Canadian Air Force.  He went to Ethiopia in 1943 
both as a teacher and as an air force officer.  During the 
forties and fifties he served with distinction as an educator in 
Ethiopia and in the Sudan before returning to enter public life 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was the national leader of the Social Credit Party from 1961 
to 1967 and was elected an MP for Red Deer in 1962, 1963, 1965 
and 1968.  When he retired from Parliament in 1972, he resumed 
his career as a university teacher and administrator and 
completed his public service as a member of the parole board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I served in this House of Commons with Bob throughout his 
parliamentary career.  I recall him as a man of substance and 
integrity.  He was at the centre of events at a time of unusual 
political tumult.  But even those of us with greatly differing 
political points of view came to respect and admire him for his 
sincerity and his personal high standards of parliamentary 
conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is fair to say that despite what a distinguished 
Canadian author called the distemper of the times, Bob Thompson 
was a leading parliamentarian without personal enemies. He made a 
strong contribution to this House and to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I wish to extend our sincere condolences to his 
widow Evelyn and to his family.  Bob will certainly be missed in 
terms of service to Canada.  Once again, our sympathy to his 
widow and his family. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of the official opposition to pay tribute to an 
amazing Canadian today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Robert Norman Thompson gave his life to public service in 
teaching, missionary work, elected political life and as a 
roaming emissary, specifically in Ethiopia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bob was active as a very young man in the Social Credit movement 
in Alberta.  He honed his political skills at the feet of William 
Aberhart.  This would stand him in good stead for his entire 
lifetime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bob, his wife Hazel and their children served in Ethiopia for 
years as missionaries.  Bob was a teacher who organized and 
helped set up the modern education system there.  He organized an 
air force training school and was the head of a leprosy mission, 
among other things.  Bob got things done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he arrived back in Canada, Bob took over the leadership of 
the federal Socred Party in 1961 and, as has been mentioned, he 
was elected to Parliament for Red Deer in 1962 and re-elected in 
1963 and 1965.  He then ran as a Conservative and was re-elected 
in 1968. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1972 Bob left politics and moved out to the west coast.  He 
helped found Trinity Western University in Langley, B.C.  He 
taught political science there and sponsored many Ethiopian 
students over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was at Trinity that I met Bob Thompson in the mid-1970s.  One 
strong memory I have of him was when I was involved in a terrible 
accident with the Trinity van.  He was planning on taking a 
singing team out that same evening and called me after I had been 
released from the hospital.  He said to me “Well, sis, what am I 
suppose to use for a vehicle tonight now that you have wrecked 
the van?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was elected to this Parliament in 1989, Bob became an 
instant adviser.  How I appreciated him as a mentor.  I mentioned 
the other day that Bob was fast, feisty and a fierce competitor 
when it came to political debate.  We had some wild and exciting 
political discussions which taught me a lot.  He was a wonderful 
role model to me and I appreciated that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After Bob's wife Hazel passed away, he married a long time 
friend and fellow missionary, Evelyn Brant, in 1993.  Lew and I 
also married in 1993, so we considered ourselves the twin 
couples. Lew and I quickly fell in love with Evelyn and all 
enjoyed every chance we could get to have a visit when we were 
out in the Vancouver area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just this past summer we enjoyed a wonderful visit, complete 
with Bob's giving me advice about my new position as a member of 
Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition.  It is a special memory that I 
will always treasure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The world is a better place because Bob Thompson was in it. 
Thank you, Bob, for all you gave us.  Thank you, Evelyn, and all 
Bob's children for sharing him with us.  Bless you all.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, both personally and on behalf of my colleagues in the Bloc 
Quebecois, I would like to offer my most sincere condolences to the 
family of Robert Thompson, who passed away on November 16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Thompson was born in Duluth, Minnesota.  After World War 
II, he was involved in the reconstruction of Ethiopia, holding a 
number of senior positions within the Ethiopian government.  He 
earned particular renown as the director of the Ethiopian Air Force 
Academy, and subsequently as the deputy minister of education, a 
position he held for 16 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On his return to Canada in 1958, Mr. Thompson got actively 
involved in politics. He became the leader of the Social Credit 
Party in 1962.  That same year marked his first election to the 
House of Commons.  He was to represent the people of Red Deer for 
10 years, first as a Social Credit MP from 1962 to 1967, and then 
as a Conservative from 1968 to 1972. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once he left politics, Mr. Thompson moved on to a distinguished 
career as a professor of political science and vice-chairman of 
the board of governors of Trinity-Western University.  In 1975 he 
was appointed Canadian High Commissioner to Singapore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We parliamentarians realize full well how demanding political 
life is, and what commitment and generosity it demands.  For this 
reason, we must pay particular tribute to the professionalism and 
devotion shown by Mr. Thompson throughout his entire political 
career.  His family and friends have every reason to be proud of 
him and of all his accomplishments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do 
want to add the voice of the New Democratic Party to those of 
others in expressing our sadness at the loss of Mr. Bob Thompson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was first elected to Parliament in 1968 he was a member 
of the Conservative Party, actually sitting in the House roughly 
where the Conservative Party sits today.  I remember speaking to 
him.  I was only 22 years old and he was one of the more seasoned 
veterans, what I considered to be a very older person in those 
days, although he was probably only in his fifties at the time. 
He certainly was a very wise and honourable member of the House 
and I really appreciated him very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was very unique in many ways.  First, he was a teacher, but 
he was also a chiropractor, a combination we do not see very 
often.  He was a flight lieutenant in World War II with the Royal 
Canadian Air Force and then, as members have heard, he became 
involved in Ethiopia where he spent many, many years involved in 
education and in government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was also very unique because he was the Minister of Education 
for Ethiopia and later on, of course, a Canadian member of 
Parliament.  Those are a couple of unique combinations and very 
rare indeed.  He was a very interesting man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He returned to his country in 1960, I believe, and became 
President of the National Social Credit Party.  That was an 
interesting time because the Social Credit Party had been wiped 
out in 1958, the CCF was down to eight seats at that time and 
both parties were in the process of rebuilding.  The Social 
Credit Party did rebuild, came back with a stunning 30 seats in 
the House, with 26 from Quebec led by the deputy leader Réal 
Caouette, who later split away and formed the Ralliement des 
créditistes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Thompson persevered and stayed on and ran again in 1963 and 
in 1965 and was re-elected as a member of the Social Credit 
Party.  If my understanding is correct, he did not like the 
direction that his party was taking or the configuration of the 
party after the split with the créditistes.  He switched parties 
in 1968 and ran as a member of the Conservative Party in the same 
riding of Red Deer and, of course, was re-elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party differed on many of the ideas and philosophies that 
Mr. Thompson held, but we respected him as a very honourable man 
who made a great contribution to the House and to this country. I 
think we can learn a lot from his legacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all sincerity, I wish to convey my condolences and the 
condolences of the New Democratic Party to his wife Evelyn, his 
eight children, to his many grandchildren and great grandchildren 
and his friends.  This country will surely miss him.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Bob Thompson was a most influential political force in the House 
during the 1960s, but that is not where his political influence 
started or stopped.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>His involvement as a political science professor at 
Trinity-Western University, the very university he was a founder 
of, has influenced many a student to change this country for the 
better. The deputy leader of today's Reform Party, my colleague 
from Edmonton North, was indeed one of the people influenced by 
Bob Thompson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very few people have influenced our nation in so many ways as 
Bob Thompson has.  How was it possible for one person to be an 
officer during the Second World War, a federal member of 
Parliament, the organizer of Ethiopia's boy scout group, a school 
principal, a deputy minister of education, a leader of a federal 
political party, chairman of the board of governors of a 
university, founder of a school for dyslexic children in my 
riding, an author, and on and on and on his influence goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, through all of that, he devoted much of his time to his 
family, his friends, his community.  His influence on me was 
significant.  Bob often shared his vast experiences with me even 
when I was a rookie candidate.  He advised me, he informed me 
when I was on the wrong path and as recently as a couple of 
months ago, he summoned me to discuss my position and 
responsibilities as opposition house leader and how to deal with 
the complexities of the unity issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was proud to be asked to speak with him.  He was a sincere, 
knowledgeable and wise visionary.  Bob Thompson's family, 
friends, community, church and country will miss him dearly and I 
send my sincere condolences to all of them.  As for me, I shall 
miss the greatest political mentor of my life.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK244">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-4, an act to amend the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act and to make consequential amendments to 
other acts, as reported (with amendment) from the committee; and 
Motions Nos. 2, 31 and 41. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Portage—Lisgar 
has four minutes remaining in his intervention. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to take the last four minutes and address 
the issue of exclusion costs.  The hon. member for 
Brandon—Souris moved this amendment to exclude both the 
inclusion and the exclusion clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You would wonder why this clause became an issue.  We were 
dealing more or less with the exclusion clause in Bill C-72 and 
we did not hear too many complaints about the exclusion clause 
until an ill wind from the east brought up the idea of an 
inclusion clause.  This idea was planted in committee.  It was 
planted in hearings that we held in western Canada.  We found out 
very quickly that this inclusion clause that was proposed for 
C-72 would create a lot of problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we see what this has really done.  The member for 
Brandon—Souris, and I think rightly so, has made an amendment to 
exclude both.  When we looked at the commodity groups or had them 
before as witnesses, they were dead set against this inclusion 
clause because their farmers that control the commodity groups 
would have nothing to do with the inclusion clause.  I was 
somewhat surprised why they were so hesitant or why they objected 
the most to this clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking to some railway officials just this last week and 
we got by accident on this inclusion clause and I said:  “Can 
you inform me somewhat why, in the special crops industry, this 
is such a harsh clause or this is such a harsh thing to deal 
with?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They explained to me that with the exclusion of the special 
crops from the wheat board, the commodity groups controlled 
completely the buying of the grain, the moving of the grain and 
the transporting of the grain across the ocean.  When customers 
want to buy some of the special crops like canola, sunflowers, 
canary seeds, they buy it on the basis that it is delivered right 
to their plants. 
That relieves a lot of headaches for them.  They demand delivery. 
When they buy a product, that product better be delivered on time 
or else there are huge fines or huge discounts. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The companies that control these special crops have a tremendous 
record of getting that crop to the destination.  This has always 
been the problem of the wheat board grains.  We do not want to 
just blame the board for some of these problems but the board 
grains are always on the basis f.o.b. Vancouver, Thunder Bay or 
Montreal and that is where it stops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After that, it is up to the customers to try to find 
transportation to organize it, to bring that product to their 
plants or to their processors.  This has become a real issue as 
far as the Canadian Wheat Board grains are concerned, the 
delivery of those board grains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Customers demand that they have delivery on time because it 
offsets their production times.  It offsets the commitments they 
have made to the finished end users of their products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this clause has to be removed.  If it takes the 
exclusion clause to go along with the inclusion clause, that has 
to be supported by this House no matter what because we do not 
want to ruin or hamper the special crops industries which have 
really been the survival of western farmers in the last decade or 
two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we should take away the special crops, farmers would all be 
bankrupt today and they would not be able to survive on just the 
wheat board grains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sometimes hard to believe the issues that arise when some 
of these bills or amendments are dealt with.  It has made me a 
little wiser as far as the transportation of special crops is 
concerned.  I think we have to do everything humanly possible to 
either amend this bill to a point where it is acceptable by 
farmers or completely table it and forget about it until some 
other government will take the bull by the horns and give western 
farmers what they want, a choice that will make the system work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As one of the Liberal members asked, how can we fix this 
inclusion and exclusion clause issue?  It is very simple.  All we 
have to do is make the Canadian Wheat Board a voluntary 
institution and all these problems will be resolved by 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers will take their product to the place where it is 
shipped, where it brings the best price, where it is delivered to 
the customers because they want to produce a product that is used 
and has benefited other countries as well as our own. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to propose a lawyer board at this time. 
Rather than a wheat board, I think we should have a lawyer board 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All lawyers' services should be marketed through a central 
agency and this central agency should have its contracts approved 
by government.  It should apply only to the lawyers in Ontario 
and Quebec and these lawyers should not be paid directly.  All 
earnings should go through a central fund. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order.  I do not believe this member is talking about the 
motion before us.  Maybe he is proposing a new agency that the 
Reform Party might support, but we are really talking about the 
Canadian Wheat Board here and how to maximize returns back to 
primary producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I noticed that the 
hon. member for Yorkton—Melville in his remarks did not seem to 
have ones that were immediately relevant to the bill, but I 
assumed that he was going to draw a parallel between the board he 
was discussing and the bill before us and indeed the clauses that 
we are currently debating in Group No. 2.  I know the hon. member 
will do that soon so that it will be clear to all hon. members 
that he is on topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, anybody who was in 
this House for the last two days would know the relevance of what 
I am saying.  We are discussing the Group No. 2 amendments which 
apply to only three provinces.  They are very undemocratic.  They 
control only farmers.  I am drawing an analogy and I am going to 
continue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lawyer board I am advocating, analogous to the wheat board, 
would not allow lawyers to market their services outside this 
area.  It could only market its services to certain customers, 
not to everyone.  The lawyer board would control profits.  It 
would prevent lawyers from making certain contracts because the 
lawyer may make too much money.  The board should not, however, 
be allowed to be audited by the auditor general.  If the funds 
are not being properly managed that should not become public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many lawyers would protest would not matter.  They would be 
forced to pool all their returns and distribute them equitably, 
except for those who could maybe manipulate the system and get 
outside it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any lawyer who was caught marketing his services outside the 
designated area would have his property confiscated, be put in 
jail, in leg irons and handcuffs.  He would be strip searched 
every three days because he marketed his services in a way that 
the government did not want him to.  He would be kept there for 
five months even if it meant changing the law within an hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lawyers would be limited on where they could deliver their 
services.  Lawyers would have quotas, limits on how many clients 
they could have.  If after 50 years of this lawyer board they 
thought it was an undemocratic lawyer board and the government 
felt some pressure to change it, the government could come up 
with a question that would have a predetermined outcome to keep 
control over lawyers by the board and the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question would probably read something like this, if we 
could ever get lawyers or anybody to agree on that kind of 
question.  Do you want lawyers to be paid adequately for their 
services?  What do we think lawyers would say?  Lawyers would 
probably say yes.  Then the government would come around and say 
that means they want to have a lawyer board.  That is how fair 
the question was that the government asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am trying to make a point that relates directly to the 
amendments.  Why does the government single out one particular 
area of the country, discriminate against one narrow sector, the 
agricultural sector?  Why does it not pick lawyers.  Why does it 
not start having a lawyer board and put control on them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something very seriously wrong here.  I am very 
concerned about this issue.  I have worked on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning I asked a Liberal member to table a piece of paper. 
I do not have it yet.  I happen to know what is on it in any 
event, or I would not have asked for it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, that item was 
tabled this morning.  Maybe the hon. member was not in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the parliamentary secretary 
is indicating that the document was tabled.  The hon. member can 
continue his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is just 
trying to interrupt me.  I hope I get some extra time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw that document.  It was illegible.  The Table apologized 
and was going to try to get me one that I could read.  I was here 
when it was tabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event the point I am trying to make in relation to all 
this is that it is not fair.  There is a blank on these 
applications to export wheat or barley.  The export licence asks 
the number of tonnes to be exported, who wants to export it and 
so on.  Then it says exported under the export licence 
application dated and that it was grown in the province of. If 
three words appear in that line an export certificate will not be 
granted.   Those three words are Alberta, Saskatchewan and 
Manitoba.  It is as simple as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you get the point I am trying to make, Mr. Speaker?  It is 
undemocratic.  It is not fair.  That is the point we are trying 
to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to my Bloc colleague this morning.  He began by 
saying he supported Bill C-4.  I thought everything they are 
saying contradicts the fact that they are supporting Bill C-4, 
very flawed legislation.  I began to ask myself why they were 
supporting Bill C-4.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Could it be that it continues to guarantee the Canadian Wheat 
Board can determine that grain from the prairies will be shipped 
through the sea ports of Baie Comeau or Montreal rather than 
through the port of preference for the people in my constituency, 
that being Churchill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he agree with a board controlled by the federal government 
that shipped products from Quebec through the prairies?  I do not 
think he would agree with that any more than lawyers would agree 
to a lawyer's board.   Nor would the Bloc want to have all of 
their products shipped through the prairies if that were not cost 
effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers in my area want more grain shipped from Churchill. 
Because it costs less, they would be able to put more money in 
their own pockets.  However, the Canadian Wheat Board controls 
their wheat and barley and the route by which it will be shipped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have something else to reply to from this morning.  I was shut 
down by the Speaker but I think it needs to be mentioned. The 
member said that we were insulting the House by raising some of 
the points we have in relation to government controlling this and 
all that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do members know the biggest insult?  The people in my riding are 
saying it.  It is not that we rise on points of order and that 
the minister does not have courtesy.  One of the greatest insults 
to the House is that the government is not listening.  We have 
not had the minister responsible for the wheat board here one 
minute yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  I am sorry, Mr. Speaker.  I apologize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I know the hon. member is interested 
in the attendance of all members of the House, but he also knows 
that it is quite improper in debate to refer to the presence or 
absence of members in the House.  I know he would not want to 
breach the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Anyway, what is the bottom line on 
Bill C-4, the Canadian Wheat Board bill we have before us? The 
bottom line is that it does not solve the problems with the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  None of the proposals that have been 
brought in address the division, the problems or the big issues 
that concern farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the Canadian Wheat Board have the exclusive jurisdiction 
over grains like wheat and barley?  Farmers want control over 
their property.  How does the bill diffuse the division that 
exists?  Not one speaker on the Liberal side has addressed that 
serious problem.  It does not in fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have the other underlying issue of property rights which 
my colleagues have adequately addressed and I will not take the 
time to do so.  I appeal on behalf of all farmers to the 
government to listen.  Our city cousins should take note of the 
debate that is happening here.  Without their help we cannot get 
rid of this discriminatory legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I lived in Quebec and hollered “separation” if you did not 
pay attention to what I want, I would probably get some 
attention. However, if I am a farmer from Saskatchewan I am not 
getting that attention.  I am not about to holler “separation”. 
Surely to goodness we can have some fairness in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I was an aboriginal and I wanted to suddenly export all my 
grain, would the government suddenly listen?  The bottom line is 
that it is not fair.  I showed the certificate earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the inaction of the government the Canadian Wheat 
Board will be destroyed.  I have in my hands a statement that 
reads “the constitutionality of the Canadian Wheat Board is 
going to the courts in February 1998”. Why?  It is because the 
government has not addressed the serious problems that exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Property rights will be the focal point of the challenge. 
However discrimination may prove to be the trump card”, this 
person says.   This will be a very important case with regard to 
property rights in Canada.  The bill of rights, United Nations 
conventions, common law and international investment agreements 
concerning this issue all address property rights.  If we do not 
look at the amendments that the Reform Party is putting forward 
we will lose our wheat board for those who truly want it as a 
marketing agency.  There should be some concern about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I one to talk about process. There was an argument about the 
legislation being sent to the committee before second reading. 
Now we are reporting it back from committee.  We were assured 
there would be many witnesses and those witnesses would be 
listened to.  I want to ask a question of the government.  How 
many substantial changes were made to the bill because of the 
witnesses and their testimony? 
I sat there and I listened. I looked at the bill and those 
concerns were not addressed.  It is a slam in the face to 
democracy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to listen to the witnesses and not simply to go 
through the formality.  Listening means that we hear what is 
being said.  The parliamentary secretary to the fisheries 
minister sits here casting cat calls with a smirk on his face but 
not hearing what we are saying. That concerns me greatly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the board were to become more accountable it might change the 
way it operates.  We are asking for that.  Producers want to be 
assured that will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have many other remarks but I will have to wait to finish. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform member 
said that the government party is not listening, and he is right. 
This government is truly not good at listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the member who just spoke does not seem to be 
terribly good at listening himself, because the Bloc Quebecois 
members who spoke before me all said we were opposed to the bill. 
For at least two minutes, he got some mileage out of Quebec and the 
Bloc Quebecois by saying we were in favour of the bill, but that is 
not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is opposed to this bill.  On initial 
examination, certain provisions are interesting, but they do not go 
far enough. 
There is mention of greater participation by representatives of 
agricultural producers, of wheat or grain producers sitting on the 
board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here I agree with the Reform Party member that the federal 
government is retaining too much authority over the administration 
of the Canadian Wheat Board.  In the end, the only opportunity for 
industry representatives, for producers, to manage the board is 
symbolic and somewhat meaningless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, that is the position of the Reform Party, and on 
this point we are in agreement.  But the members from Quebec 
represent first and foremost the interests of Quebec and it must be 
remembered that we do not produce enough grain in Quebec for export 
purposes, or at least very little.  That is why, when it comes to 
the Canadian Wheat Board, we would not necessarily want to stand in 
the way of others, but this is not yet an issue that concerns us 
greatly. 
We do not produce enough grain crops to be able to export. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Reform Party and other parties are saying is that the 
current situation, even if it remains unchanged in the bill, means 
we are not creating a large enough contingency fund for the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  When a problem arises, who pays up?  The 
government and thus all Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we are still in a federal system and as Quebec represents 
24% of the population, it means that each time the Canadian Wheat 
Board has to pay out subsidies, the shortfall will have to be made 
up.  The situation is the same as in the case of the famous 
harmonized GST in the maritimes, where Quebec has received no 
compensation and has to pay its share to help the maritimes 
harmonize their tax.  It is the same situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the Minister of Human Resources Development, who 
wants to make known his presence in the House, is trying to 
question me, but he is also distracting me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we in the Bloc Quebecois oppose the bill and I 
have a hard time understanding—and this is my closing point—all 
the arguments of the Reform members, or at least those of the 
last one to speak.  He gave the House the impression that we 
support this bill, when we oppose to it. 
Is it a problem of language?  Perhaps, but regardless, I want to 
dispel the misunderstanding immediately.  We oppose the bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just like to comment on something he said.  I found 
it—I was going to say in poor taste—let us say unpleasant.  It 
is as if he were saying that the Liberal government opposite did 
not listen to the people in his province or to those in the two 
other western provinces.  He said “Yes, but if I were in Quebec, 
this government would certainly listen to me”.  He is wrong there, 
because one of the problems Quebeckers face with the federal 
government and the federal system is they are not paid enough 
attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he thinks he is not paid as much attention as we are, there 
is a serious problem, because we have a very hard time getting 
Quebec's point across in the House.  In several the standing 
committees, we have a hard time getting documents in French.  This 
morning, we spent an hour explaining that the French version of a 
clause did not say the same thing as the English. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And yet, he, who speaks the same language as most Canadians, 
is saying that, despite that, he does not feel he is listened to or 
understood.  It is not enough just to be listened to, people have 
to be understood.  Understanding requires two or three mental 
states: openness, receptiveness and a willingness to be convinced. 
Without these, a debate becomes a monologue and not a dialogue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will have the opportunity to talk about other groups of 
motions on the subject of this bill, because it covers a variety of 
aspects.  I will draw on my experience as assistant to Jean Garon, 
who was the Quebec minister of agriculture at one point in time. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to clarify one important thing for my 
colleague who who has just spoken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board and the movement and selling of grain 
has never been subsidized, never since the beginning of the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  The contingency fund is not a subsidy 
fund.  It is a fund that the western Canadian farmer eventually 
pays if he does not pay it up front.  I want to make that clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I began my study of this, I went back and read two very 
important books on the history and origin of the Canadian Wheat 
Board.  Depending on the history book, the origin of the board 
and the purpose for its beginning are dubious.  But this is 1997 
and we are soon going into a new year, soon going into a new 
century and we are still trying to move grain under a board which 
is completely out of date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today there is a whole new generation of farmers.  These young 
people do not have just $20,000 invested.  Many of them have $3 
million and $4 million invested.  They know what is going on in 
the country and what is taking place with sales around the world. 
They know when the Canadian Wheat Board is selling grain.  They 
know that they are being taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say that all but two letters that have crossed my desk 
have stated that people are very afraid of this new bill.  Why 
are they afraid?  It is because of the inclusion clause.  Western 
Canadians are afraid of the inclusion clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may argue that if they want in or out, they have to have 
the same regulations.  They got out of the business of growing 
wheat for the simple reason that they did not want to be mastered 
by a wheat board which was made in Ottawa, not made in western 
Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a real fear that they have.  We have a new era of farmers. 
They are going out.  They are growing different crops. The real 
fear of the young person who is coming on is what they are doing 
in the way of specialty crops such as the canola crop flats and 
so on.  Some dingbat of an organization is going to give them the 
idea, let us include it and put it to some phoney vote, and I 
want to say phoney.  Every person in western Canada would tell 
you that the latest vote was a phoney. It was phoney because it 
was an all or nothing at all vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While those people will tell you that it was a major victory for 
the wheat board, it was a major disgrace for the wheat board.  It 
was 37%.  I would like to tell you if that same vote was held 
today it would be 47%.  In a year's time it will be 57% if the 
government continues with Bill C-4 the way it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are going to kill themselves.  Do not blame the Reform 
Party for that.  Blame nobody but yourself.  We are the new era 
of transportation.  We have huge boats that come in the harbour 
of Prince Rupert.  Most important, western Canada should now have 
the right to dictate where its grain is going and to what 
transport facility.  Whatever brings the most dollars back to the 
farmers of the west, that is the route the grain should go.  If 
we can fill the terminals in Halifax and in Montreal by going 
through a cheaper route, then it is the God-given right of 
western producers to have their grain sent that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Right on, right on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  We are not going to tolerate this. If the 
government does not want to listen, then it had better start 
listening to a $6 billion industry which is being controlled from 
Ottawa.  They dictate the transportation route. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a new era also in communications.  Most of these young 
farmers are on the Internet.  They know what is going on.  You 
cannot fool them anymore by Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say this.  This bill, if not amended, is doomed to 
die.  Maybe it will get passed in this House.  But as we go into 
the new year and into the new century, this type of ancient 
marketing, a monopolistic marketing on the international trade 
that we have today and unless a farmer is given some freedom, 
will self-destruct and nobody will be to blame.  That phoney 
document says that the Canadian Wheat Board, the document the 
government is so proud of, does not always sell grain in the best 
interests of the farmer.  That is exactly why were are here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too bad the country cannot see and hear what we are trying 
to do.  We are trying to preserve an industry that is a billion 
dollar industry, although we do not have as many people involved 
in the industry.  We want to save it.  This government is going 
to destroy it by this bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we are here today to discuss Motion No. 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am having a great problem with everything in this bill.  Let 
us take a look at the clause.  This clause makes the Canadian 
Wheat Board Act binding on the provinces.  This would block a 
province from making changes demanded by a majority of its 
farmers.  Correct me if I am wrong, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not quite two weeks ago, November 11, when I happened to 
speak at a function on a day called Remembrance Day in this 
country of Canada. 
While I was there I talked to many of the old vets.  Many of them 
were farmers.  Many of them still have children on the farm in 
the prairies.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to wonder just exactly what they fought for.  They fought 
to be independent, to be allowed to make their own decisions and 
to freely sell their products in this country.  Everybody seems 
to be able to do that except western farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario the board members are freely elected.  With this bill 
the board in the west will have ten elected members and five who 
will be appointed by the government.  They will be patronage 
appointments, including the president and the CEO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is only one message that a person can take from this.  The 
government does not think that our farmers are capable of 
managing their own affairs.  The government needs positions in 
which to put its friends, relatives and defeated candidates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are not silly.  It will not take them long to realize 
that all the rats are not in the granary when they look at what 
the government is trying to impose upon them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the people who have spent literally hours, more than 
many members of this House are willing to put in, trying to 
scrape together a living, only to have the government intrude in 
every facet of their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that under socialism the object is that the farmer grows 
the product, keeps part of it and the government takes the rest. 
Under communism the government just takes it.  Under liberalism 
farmers will not only buy product in order to seed the field, 
they will not only care for the product, they will not only cut 
it, harvest it and get it to the shipyards, but they will be told 
who they can sell it to, where they can sell it, at what price 
they can sell it and what route it will take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When farmers go broke, our caring, sharing Liberal government 
says “That is too bad”.  The farmers are not given any handout. 
They do not get a bit of help. I have to wonder how long the 
farmers will put up with this.  I would suggest not too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would block a province from making changes demanded by 
a majority of its farmers.  Who the heck does the government 
think has spent the time to get the product ready?  It sure as 
heck was not the government or any of its members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government refuses to allow not only farmers but the 
majority of citizens in this country to work for profit.  The 
government fully recognizes that the biggest threat to that side 
of the House is a farmer or any other businessperson who can 
stand up and say they are independent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will do everything in the world to block any 
fashion of businessperson in this country from being able to say 
that because it knows full well that when a person can stand and 
say they are independent they no longer have to depend on the 
government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet that is one of the functions that we were taught very young 
in school.  When I went it was that the harder someone would 
work, the better they produce, the earlier they could retire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is bills like this that make that impossible.  Today the 
harder the farmer works, the more he is penalized.  Does that 
make any sense?  It does not.  Does it make any sense to the 
government opposite?  Yes, I see some nods over there that it 
does. I have to wonder is the government in place to govern for 
the people or to the people. I see over there it is to the 
people, not for the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I have to wonder why our farmers, along with other parts 
of society, took up arms in order to protect a so-called 
democratic society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see today that it is a total farce.  There is no such thing 
in this country any more.  We have to look at some of the 
functions that farmers play.  These are the people who will feed 
the people and their families, but not as long as they are being 
driven out of business, not as long as they cannot get the best 
price they can for the product, not as long as they are told who 
they can sell to, when they can sell and how much they can 
charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not what farming was all about, yet farming was one of 
the basic institutions that built this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They can sit there opposite and smile because they know it will 
not directly affect them.  They will allow other parts of Canada 
to become independent and allow them to freely elect the members 
of their board who will make the decision on how they will make 
their livelihood.  They will do that but not out west. God help 
us if we ever get that decision.  The farmer may be able to put a 
few dollars in his pocket when he goes to town so that he can 
afford to buy new clothes for his family for a change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to wonder just how far this government is willing to go 
to make sure every facet of society is kept broke.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the election results are very important.  We have 
some balance back in this Parliament, so this kind of misleading 
information will be challenged in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put on record, and let them yelp if they want, that 
here are some of the players that support the inclusion clause. 
The Government of Saskatchewan— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  They may laugh.  Here is a government 
that has the support of about 60% of the Saskatchewan people.  It 
is one of the most popular governments anywhere in this country 
that represents— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  38%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Run against us.  If you want to get 
into provincial politics, run against us.  Here is the Reform 
Party that does not have the guts to run in provincial politics 
in Saskatchewan, a government that has MLAs from all parts of the 
province, urban and rural.  It supports the inclusion clause and 
they said nobody does.  Misleading of the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Canadian Federation of Agriculture 
supports the inclusion clause.  Is that an irrelevant 
organization?  Does it not speak for a few farmers across the 
prairies and in the province of Saskatchewan?  I am sure it does. 
The people should be aware that the Reform Party is misleading 
the House and the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  There's some cheap barley in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  That is true.  Now let them squirm and 
let them listen because they are being taken to task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who else supports the inclusion clause?  The Saskatchewan Wheat 
Pool and the prairie pools. Reformers laugh.  The biggest company 
in Saskatchewan is the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool.  The wheat pools 
speak for thousands and thousands of farmers.  It is the majority 
farm organization, it markets grain and it supports the inclusion 
clause.  And the Reform Party says that nobody does. The 
Saskatchewan Wheat Pool does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party should not be misleading the House, and that is 
why we in our party are very proud to support the Saskatchewan 
Wheat Pool.  My family has been involved as members of the 
Saskatchewan Wheat Pool since its foundation.  It supports the 
inclusion clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Keystone Agricultural Producers Inc. of Manitoba also supports 
the inclusion clause as well as the Concerned Farmers for Saving 
the Wheat Board.  Finally, the wheat board advisory committee, 
whose members are elected by prairie farmers, supports the 
inclusion clause.  The overwhelming majority of people across the 
prairies and in the province of Saskatchewan are in support of 
the Canadian Wheat Board and they want an inclusion clause so 
that if farmers want more grains in the wheat board, they will 
have that right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about time the Reform Party was taken to task.  The Reform 
Party is not telling the truth in the House of Commons and not 
reflecting its constituents' views.  That is the party that said 
it would reflect the voices of its constituents when it was in 
the House of Commons.  It is not doing that.  The Saskatchewan 
government is supportive.  The wheat pools are supportive.  The 
wheat pool is a big, credible organization.  The Canadian 
Federation of Agriculture is supportive.  The wheat board 
advisory committee which is elected by farmers supports the 
inclusion clause, but here is the Reform Party, which is not used 
to being challenged in the House, trying to mislead the Canadian 
people that prairie farmers oppose the inclusion clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the member for Souris—Moose Mountain who used to be a 
member of the provincial Conservative Party in Saskatchewan as an 
MLA.  We know what happened to that party.  It has now been put 
to sleep for 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party believes in referenda and in consulting people. 
A while back a very clear question was put to the prairie 
producers.  It concerned whether or not they wanted barley 
marketed by the wheat board or outside the wheat board.  The 
prairie producers responded with 63% who voted that yes, they 
wanted to keep barley in the Canadian Wheat Board, while 37% 
voted no.  They responded to a very clear question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is supposed to be reflecting those views in the 
House of Commons.  Reformers are supposed to reflect the views of 
their constituents in the House of Commons or resign or be 
recalled.  Why do they not reflect that point of view in the 
House of Commons?  It was a clear question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Farmers Union is also in support of the inclusion 
clause.  The farmers union itself, which has been very involved 
in these issues, thought the question was clear.  I wonder where 
the Reform Party comes from.  When it comes to really 
representing the point of view of its constituents in the House 
of Commons it just does not do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure the House that the people of Saskatchewan support the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  They have always supported the Canadian 
Wheat Board.  They want some collective clout in the marketplace 
and we will reflect that point of view here in the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another concern that was raised by the Reform Party, that 
there is no reference to provinces.  It has been said in the 
House with some of these rather right wing points of view that 
they would like the provinces to opt out. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT74"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT74"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1610

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, of course, Reform Party members applaud these extreme right 
wing points of view, these friends of Conrad Black, friends of 
the Canadian grain exchange and of the Canadian Taxpayers 
Federation.  They listen to them instead of listening to the 
wheat pool of Saskatchewan, the farmers union or the federation 
of agriculture or the people's organizations.  They just listen 
to the people who have the money.  They want to destroy the wheat 
board.  They want a province to have the option of opting out of 
the Canadian Wheat Board like the province of Alberta.  Of 
course, if that power is put into the act it will be the 
destruction of the wheat board.  So I certainly oppose that as 
well. I am sure that Canadian farmers will also oppose that point 
of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some so-called farmers from British Columbia and 
Alberta who are campaigning against the Canadian Wheat Board. 
However, I can assure members of the House that there is very 
strong support for orderly marketing and for the Canadian Wheat 
Board.  All the major credible farm organizations that support 
the board want the inclusion clause. They want farmers to have 
the right to vote if they so wish to include other grains under 
the authority of the Canadian Wheat Board.  They also support the 
exclusion clause so that farmers if they so wish can vote to have 
a grain taken out of the authority of the wheat board. Why is the 
Reform Party against that democratic right?  It is a right that 
the farmers want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the truth hurts.  If we listen to the Reform Party we 
would think there was never a vote on barley or that the question 
was fudged on barley.  The question was very clear and there was 
a very clear answer.  I am very surprised that the Saskatchewan 
Reform members, in particular, are talking this way. In 
Saskatchewan the yes vote for the inclusion of barley was higher 
than in Alberta and Manitoba.  Why are Reform members not 
reflecting the wishes of their constituents in the House? Why are 
they not listening to their constituents?  Why should they not be 
recalled? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will this very shy member from Souris—Moose Mountain not 
get up and say “the farmers in my riding voted to have barley in 
the wheat board”?  Instead he stands in the House and says 
people in the province do not want the inclusion clause. They are 
against it and they are fearful of the inclusion clause.  That is 
a bunch of bloody rubbish and he would know it if he used his two 
ears to listen to his people.  People are very supportive of that 
clause.  It is important that be put on the record. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>   Mr. Speaker, it is 
very difficult to sit hear and listen to some of these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member who just spoke to come out and stand on 
the street corners of Hussar, Standard, Olds, Sundry or Didsbury 
and talk to the farmers I talk to day in and day out.  He would 
find out that what he is saying is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What really amazes me is that they are not talking about freedom 
of choice.  It does not seem to me that they want it.  But then I 
have to stop and remember these people are of the old line 
governments and parties that figure they always know best and 
they want control.  It is as obvious as it can be.  If the 
government is not involved, it is no good. That is the old rule, 
the old way of doing things.  That is in the past. Count on it. 
It will be gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very wise man said to me when I was elected in 1993 “There is 
one thing about it, you have now obtained power.” I felt like 
sticking my chest out a little bit.  I had not had much power 
before in my life and now he said I have power.  He said he 
wanted me to remember one thing, “Please remember this on behalf 
of us.  When you go to Ottawa, the power you have received is the 
power to serve”, not the power to dictate like they do behind 
closed doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is legislation coming out from behind closed doors day in 
and day out. It is brought in and presented to the House like 
Bill C-4, and all the little puppets will have their strings 
pulled and they will jump up and vote the way the party told them 
to vote. That is the way they do it.  The Liberals will do what 
they are told.  They will vote the way they are told to vote.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members were truly serving Canadians and were truly using 
their power, they would take the time before casting their votes 
to go out to the ridings of prairie farmers where the legislation 
has the most effect and talk to them.  They should not be like 
the phoney Liberal panel that was set up.  It backfired because 
the panel brought back all kinds of recommendations from farmers. 
The Liberals  got rid of that panel and did not follow those 
recommendations because they did not suit their little cup of 
tea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same old story over and over again.  The Liberals, the 
NDP, and right down the line.  Every old line party that has ever 
been here says “We know best.  We will have it our way”.  That 
is something Canadian people are sick and tired of.  That is 
something I am sick and tired of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 when the Conservatives were in power they had the wisdom 
to open up the intercontinental barley market.  They did that for 
a while.  Guess what?  During that time farmers did better than 
they had ever done in the history of growing crops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guess what else?  The wheat board did better than it had ever 
done.  For the first time it had some competition.  It decided it 
had to get off its backside, get out there, get to work and find 
some of these markets as well.  That is good healthy competition. 
That is why farmers are saying keep the wheat board but give us a 
choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that is asking for too much.  I can hardly wait 
to go back home.  A Wild Rose constituent asked me when I 
expected the minister to rise in the House and announce that 
canola growers want to market through the board.  My constituent 
hit the nail on the head.  After all, canola growers have 
nurtured, researched and developed a former niche industry into 
an agricultural powerhouse.  The farmers did it.  Canola 
producers did all this without any dictated government 
involvement.  Now that it is to be such a success, mark my words, 
one day the government will want control of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's power is to dictate.  It has not learned the 
power to serve.  I challenge government members to do that.  I 
challenge every one of them when they vote on this piece of 
legislation to vote in the interest of the people it is 
affecting, prairie farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>God help me if I ever vote against any legislation that hurts 
the fishing industry.  I do my best to try to represent them with 
my vote, and I do not have anything but little brook trout in my 
riding.  I try to understand their problems and try to vote in 
their interest.  I talk to fishermen whenever I get a chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Come on out to Wild Rose.  Stand on the street corners and talk 
to the farmers who grow grain.  Ask them what they think about 
Bill C-4.  Talk to them one on one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps those members want to continue to listen to phoney 
panels and the phoney things they do across the country.  They 
fly around, as they say, consulting with the elite and making 
sure all the right ones are in the ivory towers of Calgary 
instead of visiting Hussar, Standard, Olds, Didsbury or other 
small communities where farmers live and thrive.  Then it might 
change some things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government ought to start thinking about the power to serve 
and stop the power of dictation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It is my duty, pursuant to Standing

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, once 
again I remind Reformers that they are obviously having a very 
hard time listening to the number of people who support the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  I would like to mention some of them. 
They are the Government of Saskatchewan, the Canadian Federation 
of Agriculture, prairie pools, the Keystone Agricultural 
Producers, the National Farmers Union, the Concerned Farmers 
Saving the Wheat Board and members of the Canadian Wheat Board 
Advisory Committee who are elected from across the prairies to 
provide advice to the board's operations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely important that Canadians do not get caught up in 
the usual Reform rhetoric that goes on and on about nobody 
representing the people of Canada except Reformers, that we will 
never have freedom unless we listen to Reform.  If we want to 
talk dictatorship let us talk about Reformers spouting they are 
the only ones who are here on behalf of Canadians and serving 
them.  I had to listen to the rather childish diatribe from the 
member for Saskatoon—Humboldt who said “I'm a farmer, I'm a 
farmer, I'm a farmer” as if nobody else could understand what 
farmers go through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Numerous people in Canada know what farmers go through, what 
fishermen go through and what every other person goes through if 
they take the time to consider those people and to make 
themselves aware of their troubles.  I suggest that just once 
Reformers should take a look at the whole picture instead of 
their own narrow vision. 
<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
several things come to mind as an opener, not the least of which 
is that I too am a farmer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess another thing that should be said is that the times, 
they are a'changin'.  It is a long time since my father and my 
father-in-law saw the birth of the Canadian Wheat Board.  A lot 
of things have changed since that time when farmers would haul 
most of their grain in the winter.  Practically all the grain was 
hauled on sleighs.  The roads were bad during the summertime when 
they could only use wheeled vehicles and they did not have enough 
horses to pull a load of wheat through the muddy roads.  They 
hauled their grain in the wintertime, when they had time to do it 
as well.  They would haul about 100 bushels of wheat five, ten, 
twenty or whatever miles it required to get it an elevator.  Most 
elevators were about 20 to 30 miles at the very most from farming 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The grain would be hauled in dribs and drabs by today's 
standards to the elevators where it would be loaded on to rail 
cars and shipped out in greater quantities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technology has evolved now to the point where we have trucks 
that can hold two or three the capacity of old time granaries. 
Once they get the truck rolling it really does not matter how far 
they have to travel.  Once it is loaded on the truck it can be 
destined for almost anywhere in North America.  The marketing of 
grain has changed immeasurably in the 50, 60 or 70 years since 
the birth of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board is stuck in the 1920s.  I listened with 
great interest to my colleague from the NDP trying to defend the 
system and all the people he claims support single desk selling. 
I am reminded of a discussion with a friend back home who was of 
like mind.  He thought the single desk marketing of grain was the 
only way to go because that was how to get the best results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked him to extrapolate his thinking a bit.  He also raised 
cattle.  Maybe I should become the single desk buyer for cattle. 
He could sell all his cattle to me.  Everybody in Alberta could 
sell their cattle to me and I would get the best price that I 
could. 
He thought about that for not even a second and said no, that he 
could not do that.  He could not possibly think about selling me 
all his cattle exclusively and all the cattle of all producers in 
that area, in that province or maybe in all western provinces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to be in that position.  Most people in the House 
would like to be in the position where they would have an 
absolute monopoly.  That is what we are talking about today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers in western Canada have overcome drought, flood, hail, 
poor weather, too much rain, not enough rain, seed borne 
diseases, late yielding varieties and all sorts of things in the 
production of grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now there are better seed varieties and better genetics.  Seeds 
mature earlier.  We are avoiding frosts.  We have better 
machinery than we have ever had to work the land, to cut the 
grain and to combine the grain.  It would seem oftentimes that we 
have more grain than we know what to do with, or at least what 
the Canadian Wheat Board knows what to do with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem production is not the challenge it once was.  The 
huge challenge today is the marketing of grain. Because our input 
costs are so high that our margins naturally are proportionately 
lower.  The marketing of grain is of the utmost importance.  By 
introducing these amendments we are trying to put some 
flexibility into an absolutely inflexible Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP member from Saskatchewan accused us of wanting to do 
away with the wheat board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston:</B>  It would appear our NDP friend from 
Saskatchewan would agree with that sentiment.  He has it wrong, 
as usual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to have a flexible wheat board.  We want to have a board 
where we can be in or out.  Why not have a choice? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give my esteemed colleague examples of some things I am 
sure he supports.  What about co-ops?  What about credit unions? 
What about pools?  I am sure my friend from the more socialist 
party believes those are good things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a quick look at how they operate.  Do the credit 
unions in Mountain View, Ponoka and Bashaw, Saskatchewan, operate 
under a board that is appointed by the premier of the province or 
the reeve of the county?  No.  Those people are elected.  The 
boards of directors are elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of those people are not even paid.  They may collect 
mileage to and from meetings.  They may get their registration 
fee paid to attend conferences and that sort of thing.  A lot of 
these people donate their time to the board.  They are elected by 
the members of the credit union, by the producers in the hog 
pool, or whatever it is, or by the people who are members of the 
co-operative.  They are accountable to the people who elect them. 
Those elected people hire an administrator.  The administrator 
makes administrative decisions and the elected board makes 
political decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there any resemblance between what I have just described and 
the Canadian Wheat Board?  None whatsoever.  They are not even in 
the same ballpark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking for a completely elected board of directors that 
is accountable to producers, a wheat board farmers could be 
members of or excluded from and market their grain one way or the 
other.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My NDP friend from Saskatchewan said “it will not work if you 
are not all in it”.  How does he know that?  If it did not work 
because it was not a monopoly, if it will not work without being 
a monopoly then it must be a pretty poor system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that anybody in this House would say that competition is 
good.  I am sure my hon. colleague feels very good about the fact 
that he ran against other opponents in the election and was 
victorious.  In that case he would say “Certainly competition 
is great.  Competition is good”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is competition not good in the grain market business?  We 
evolved immensely in agriculture in the 60 or 70 years since the 
dawn of the wheat board.  What we are trying to do is to drag the 
wheat board and proponents of same kicking and screaming into the 
21st century in a marketing system that answers the requirements, 
in fact the demands, of the producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish I could think of the member's riding.  The member for 
Qu'Appelle likes to say these groups support the inclusion.  Let 
us have a look.  The National Farmers Union, the National 
Foundation and three others we have listed here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, because of time constraints I have 12 groups of 
people listed here; Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association, 
Winnipeg Commodity Exchange, Canadian Oilseed Processors 
Association, Alberta Canola Producers, Saskatchewan Canola 
Growers Association, Canadian Federation of Independent Business, 
Western Barley Growers Association, Alberta Winter Wheat 
Producers Commission, Oat Producers Association of Alberta, Flax 
Growers Western Canada, Manitoba Canola Growers Association and 
Canadian Canola Growers Association all are vigorously opposed to 
the inclusion.  I think we will find certainly not the least of 
which should be added to that is the Reform Party of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
first of all I have to wonder why the Liberal government is bound 
and determined to ram this legislation down the throats of 
western farmers?  It does not represent the west.  How many 
Liberal MPs come from the west? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here representing western farmers.  Many of us are 
farmers and we are telling them plain as day we do not want this. 
We want the option.  Why will they not give us a choice?  Why can 
farmers not have the choice?  Wouldn't that be good?  Other 
marketing boards would spring up.  There would be competition. 
The Canadian Wheat Board would be driven to get better prices, to 
find newer and better markets for farmers.  Everybody would 
benefit.  Why will they not understand that?  Well I can tell you 
why.  I see one Liberal member in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Tempting as it may be, and I have 
experience at this I assure the hon. member, to refer to the 
presence of members, it is improper to refer to the absence of 
members.  The way the hon. member is phrasing his remarks, he is 
clearly referring to the absence of certain members. I invite him 
to comply with the rules and refrain from making such 
suggestions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, I am trying to 
draw attention to the fact that they do not care. They are not 
here engaging in the debate.  It is sad to feel that we are here 
trying to tell them why the farmers are asking for changes to the 
act, but it is falling on deaf ears.  It is falling on no ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing I find interesting in the debate today is 
members of the NDP.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They insult me and make fun of me for saying that I am a farmer 
and for representing the farmers in my constituency.  The member 
for Qu'Appelle who was going on and on in his Marxist-Leninist 
rant did not even run in the rural riding that represents 
farmers.  He had to put his tail between his legs and go to 
Regina. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who live in Regina also are going to be impacted by this 
because what hurts farmers hurts every community in Saskatchewan 
and everyone in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  —Marxist-Leninist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  They continue to insult me when I stand 
up and attempt to defend the right of farmers to have a wheat 
board that they can participate in when they want, to have a 
wheat board that they can be elected to, to have a wheat board 
that is accountable to them and that they can be represented by 
and not a wheat board that is run by Ottawa under the dictates of 
Ottawa from Ottawa politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about having farmers run the Canadian Wheat Board and have 
farmers determine what is best for them?  Why force that upon 
anybody? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the idea of an inclusion clause.  We grow a lot of 
canola on our farm.  What right does anybody have to tell me 
where I can sell it?  What right does anybody have to do that to 
me? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if canola is grown in Ontario, that is okay.  That will 
not apply.  They will be able to market it wherever they want. If 
we apply the inclusion clause to canola in the west, then I am 
going to be bound to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say—they can insult me all they want—on behalf of all 
farmers, we do not want that.  How much clearer can a guy be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What about the barley vote?

the impression to the House that I was suggesting or making fun 
of farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In actuality, I have the utmost respect— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I think the hon.

really a point of debate.  Resuming debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think hon. members must realize that remarks are not intended 
to be personal to hon. members.  I hope they are not taken as 
such in a debate of this kind.

Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise and address my comments 
to Group No. 4 of the amendments before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that it is exceedingly difficult for all of the 
members from whatever party and whatever point of view to address 
such a large group of amendments because they deal with so many 
different areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have 16 amendments in this group that we are going to 
endeavour to try to adequately address and debate in a short 
10-minute intervention.  In light of there being 16 amendments in 
10 minutes, I will have to confine my comments to just a few of 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps for the viewing public watching this debate at home with 
interest I am sure, I should note that Group No. 3 comprised 
Motion No. 3 and was dropped because apparently it had been 
brought forward at the committee and therefore was ruled out of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did want to make the point when I put that motion forward that 
what it did was remove reference to the president as a member of 
the board of directors.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this issue has been 
debated at committee and lost.  The member is debating Group No. 
3 which has been ruled out of order by the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I thought the hon. member was making 
a passing reference.  He did say it had been ruled out of order 
and I am sure he is not going to continue discussing the motion. 
He is proceeding with his remarks, I am certain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was just making passing 
reference to it for the sake of the viewing public at home who 
might not have known why we moved straight from Group No. 2 
amendments to Group No. 4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On to Group No. 4 amendments of which, as I have indicated, 
there are some 16, Motion No. 5 is an amendment put forward by 
myself on behalf of the Reform Party of Canada, the official 
opposition. It calls a fully elected board of directors.  The 
rationale for this is that if this board is going to be put into 
place for the best interest of farmers, for the best interest of 
western grain producers, then certainly they should have the 
right to elect all of the directors to the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the situation in this legislation where the government 
and the minister still retain the right to appoint five 
directors, one of which will be the president and the chief 
executive officer of the board of directors.  We find that 
completely reprehensible.  We do not understand the inequity, the 
inequality in the system whereby the Ontario Wheat Marketing 
Board can have a fully elected board of directors to run the 
affairs of the Ontario Wheat Marketing Board and yet western 
grain farmers are denied that fundamental right of electing their 
entire board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would certainly urge all members of the House in light of 
that to support Motion No. 5 and ensure that this bill is amended 
so that we have a fully elected board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 7, also in this Group No. 4, deletes the powers of 
the board of directors.  The bill, as it is presently structured, 
lays out different powers for the appointed directors and the 
elected directors.  Of course, if Motion No. 5 is successful and 
passes and you have all 15 elected as they should be, then there 
would be no need to have a differentiation in the powers of those 
individual directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 9 ensures that the elected board and not the minister 
would have control over the hiring and firing of the president. 
If farmers are to truly have a say in the way that the board 
operates, I think that this is fundamental.  During committee 
hearings, the witnesses who appeared before the committee, and 
time after time we heard this, the groups who appeared, as short 
as the list was and as confined as the time was allowed at 
committee, did make the point that they felt that the board of 
directors should have the power to hire and fire the president 
and the chief executive officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had some of my hon. colleagues remark about that earlier and 
cite examples of the credit unions and the co-ops and other 
successful co-op enterprises where Canadians have seen fit to 
band together for their mutual financial best interest on a 
voluntary basis, but they retain the right to elect their board 
of directors and that board of directors then hires the 
administrators.  We see no reason whatsoever that this new 
structure, this new Canadian Wheat Board, would not have a 
similar process in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add to that and to the comments of my hon. 
colleague from Wetaskiwin who spoke a few moments ago.  I find it 
more than a bit strange that the more socialist people in this 
country, whenever a state run enterprise is under scrutiny, 
always fall back and say that it cannot exist in a free market 
economy.  It is in the best interest of the producer, but we have 
to protect that interest because if there were any competition, 
it simply would not survive. 
In the long term interests of the farmers, in this case the 
western Canadian grain farmers, we need to ensure that the 
monopoly, the compulsory nature of the Canadian Wheat Board, is 
retained.

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find that somewhat puzzling, just as my hon. colleague from 
Wetaskiwin did, in the sense that there has been a longstanding 
tradition in western Canada as there has been across this country 
of enterprises that have not only survived but have indeed 
thrived in a free market economy.  He cited the examples of the 
co-ops, the pools and the credit unions which I am familiar with 
as I am from a rural area and was a farmer in my previous life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody said when credit unions were put into place that 
Canadians would be forced to join a credit union.  No one said 
you cannot do your business at a bank because it is in your best 
interest to belong to a credit union.  Imagine the open rebellion 
there would be in this country if everyone were forced to bank at 
the same institution.  The credit unions have done quite well. 
They have filled a niche market and they continue to enjoy 
enormous support especially in the rural areas of western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 10 would ensure some minimum production level so that 
the vote of a hobby farmer would not totally cancel out the vote 
of a full time farmer, someone who is earning his living and has 
a lot more at stake with the business conducted and the decisions 
made by the Canadian Wheat Board than someone who is earning all 
or most of his income off the farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rationale for Motion No. 11 is that once the initial 
elections have taken place, the minister's involvement in the 
election of the director should be limited if farmer interests 
are to be served.  The minister's control of the barley 
plebiscite earlier this year proved that at times when a minister 
is directly involved, he can structure a vote to ensure the 
outcome he wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 14 also refers to the hiring and firing of the 
president.  At the end of the day it is the board of directors 
that must retain that control over the president and the 
president cannot be beholden in any way to the minister or to the 
government of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very difficult when we look at the way many of these 
motions are grouped to go through them in a singular manner.  I 
refer briefly to Motion No. 19 which ensures that the new 
corporation will have to adhere to the code of ethics guidelines 
for corporations.  The federal government initiated the signing 
of this code by Canadian businesses in September 1997.  The code 
sets out standards for ethically, socially and environmentally 
responsible business practices.  However, the federal government 
did not instruct its departments and agencies to sign the code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that the wheat board markets extensively abroad we feel it 
is more than appropriate that the corporation become a signatory 
to the code in which it would commit among other things not to 
make illegal and improper payments or bribes and will refrain 
from participating in any corrupt business practices. That is 
just a small part of the code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that question was put to the 
government by an hon. member during question period, that it is 
pretty hypocritical of the government to insist that businesses 
now adhere to this code when crown agencies themselves are not 
required to.  That is the purpose of that amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to a return of the lively debate we have seen 
over the past hours.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in this interesting grouping as previous 
speakers have indicated.  Motions Nos. 4 through 19 include a 
large variety of important items, the election of all directors, 
giving the standing committee some insight into the ongoing work 
of the Canadian Wheat Board, the equality of those who are 
elected and those who are appointed, the removal of the president 
and how we would proceed on that important note should it ever 
come to that, minimum production levels, which I will come back 
to in a short while, regulations respecting elections and the 
staggering of elections, which I think is an important point as 
well, the terms for the president, code of ethics and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did want to talk a bit about Motion No. 10.  This is a motion 
put forward by the previous speaker, the member for Prince 
George—Peace River.  I think I understand what he is getting at 
here.  He wants a minimum level.  In fact, he talked about the 
difference between a hobby farmer and a somebody who earns his 
living in farming and who should have the right to vote and who 
should not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go on record to say that this caucus will very 
strongly oppose that.  I heard a member from that party talk 
about two tier.  If there is anything that is two tier it is 
clearly this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this caucus we think that as long as a farmer is sending one 
bushel of grain to the wheat board that he or she should have 
the right to a vote on the election of the board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to talk about Motion No. 13 which is contained in 
Group No. 4.  I think how the directors are elected is very 
important.  I want to take a minute for the benefit of the people 
listening to read Motion No. 13: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3) Directors shall be elected by producers on the basis of one 
vote per producer permit book 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(4) There shall be limits placed on the expenditures made by any 
candidate for election to the Board of Directors. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important aspect of it: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(5) There shall be limits placed on the expenditures made by 
any third parties toward the election of candidates to the Board 
of Directors. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to elaborate on Motion No. 13 if I may. If the wheat 
board is to have a board of directors, and we certainly go along 
with that, then it is essential that the majority of them are 
elected through free and fair elections. That means, as I said 
before, one vote per producer holding a wheat board permit book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me on Motion No. 10 that the Reform Party wants to 
see the large scale agribusiness farmers have more votes 
and more clout than their neighbours. We say this is totally 
anti-democratic and we want no part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fair elections also mean a limit on campaign spending by 
candidates just as in federal and provincial elections so that 
wealthy individuals do not have an unfair advantage. Fair 
elections mean the strict and transparent limit as to how much 
third parties can spend on elections and how much they influence 
the outcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are reminded of the million dollars that the Alberta 
government poured into the barley vote last year to try to 
influence that one and fortunately to little or no avail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been pointed out repeatedly, the wheat board is a $6 
billion industry and certain corporate interests would love to 
get their hands on it.  Western grain farmers do not want those 
folks with deeper pockets than the rest of us to influence these 
elections unduly on the board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also witnessing what could only be termed as a 
disgraceful media campaign by other friends of the Reform Party, 
the National Citizens Coalition, again to try to discredit the 
Canadian Wheat Board.

all know that it is bankrolled by the friends of the Reform Party 
and the the big business community in this country. We know who 
is in line to be the next president of the National Citizens 
Coalition, a former member of the Reform caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With those points, we think it is very important that the 
election of the new board of directors be done in a free and fair 
way.  We will be watching and hoping that the government will 
move to make some accommodation so that can result.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have 
come to Group No. 4.  I will go through the motions one by one, 
after which I will give an overview, because I have the feeling we 
will not go any further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first motion in Group No. 4, Motion No. 4 moved by Mr. 
Borotsik, proposes that 10 out of 15 directors be elected.  There 
is a small problem, however, because this motion means that 
directors would be elected according to regulations made by the 
governor in council as set out in clauses 3.06 to 3.08.  This 
eliminates what makes clause 3 attactive, which is that producers 
are appointed by other producers.  There is no longer a specific 
reference to their being elected by producers, as was the case in 
clause 3.02. 
This reduces the significanace of the representation by producers 
on the board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same for the amendment deleting the paragraph about 
the maximum term of office of directors, and this is unthinkable. 
We are therefore going to be voting against this motion, although 
we were very much in favour of greater representation by producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 5 would increase the number of directors on the 
board from 15 to 20.  For the reasons I gave earlier, we will vote 
in favour of this amendment, which fits in with our wish for 
greater representation and a greater role on the board of directors 
for producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, on to Motion No. 6. I am certain that, had my colleague, 
Mr. Chrétien, been able to debate it, he would have done a splendid 
job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Jean-Guy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie:</B> Jean-Guy Chrétien of the Bloc Quebecois. 
Jean-Guy on this side, not Jean on that side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Chrétien pointed out that the government does not want the 
president to be appointed by members of the board of directors but 
by the governor in council.  The Bloc is therefore moving that this 
appointment be considered by the Standing Committee on Agriculture 
and Agri-food.  We did not get the results we were hoping for when 
this bill was considered in committee, but we still believe in the 
strength of this committee and the interventions that must be made, 
and we think that the appointments should be subject to the 
approval of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to Motion No. 7.  The proposed amendment would 
create a potential distinction between the powers, duties and 
functions of a director who is elected and those of one who is 
appointed.  At this point, we have little or no idea of what this 
amendment would mean in practical terms, and in the absence of 
information, we are abstaining.  We will therefore vote against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now comes Motion No. 8;  I feel like a school teacher.  In 
Motion No. 8, the proposed amendment would set the board's quorum 
at two-thirds of the board members and a ratio of two elected 
directors to one appointed director. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT84"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT84"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1700
<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we keep looking at what it wanted at the grassroots level, 
namely, greater control by grain producers, farmers and people who 
have a major interest in this bill, we do of course support an 
amendment that would see a quorum of at least two-thirds of the 
board members, thus twice as many elected directors. This is 
consistent with what we want, which is more board members who are 
producers.  This is why we support this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings us to Motion No. 9. Under this motion, the board, 
in consultation with the minister, decides the terms of removal of 
the president of the board and implements them. 
The amendment substitutes the chairman of the board for the 
president.  We therefore support this amendment, because it puts 
power in the hands of the board.  And as we want the amendments to 
increase the number of farmers to be agreed to, for reasons of 
consistency we support this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings us to Motion No. 10.  Under this amendment, in the 
bylaws for board members, the governor in council should give a 
vote to producers producing a certain quantity of grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with considerable interest to remarks made in this 
House on this motion.  However, the experience I have had in my 
riding of having many part time farmers and realizing that they 
provide strong and solid support to the agricultural community 
makes it hard for me to oppose their participation, however 
limited, in the Canadian Wheat Board. If the Canadian Wheat Board 
is there to efficiently market a crop—I heard some colleagues 
say this morning that it was a bit of a monopoly, but it is not a 
monopoly when it is in the hands of the producers, in my 
opinion—it is appropriate for all these producers, even the 
smallest ones, if the Canadian Wheat Board is a good one, to be 
protected by a structure for the marketing of their crop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, when a person has thousands of hectares, this may 
be an amusing question, but in real life we sometimes see part time 
farmers or small scale farmers end up as large scale ones. They all 
make a valuable contribution to agriculture and we find it very 
hard not to consider them all, to reject them.  For this reason we 
will vote against this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads us to Motion no. 11.  Here the amendment makes it 
not the minister who makes regulations in consultation with the 
board, but the board which makes regulations in consultation with 
the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very subtle point, but basically the power is given 
to the people who have to do the administration, and not the 
minister.  I have been surprised to hear very little reference to 
increased federal government power over the Canadian Wheat Board 
where there is a possibility of some difficulty with the rules of 
international trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment returns much more power to the board of 
directors, and moves the minister onto the back burner.  This may 
not be what our friends across the way are after, but I believe we 
must attain that objective if the Canadian Wheat Board is to be 
properly administered.  That is why we will vote for Motion No. 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 12 is much like 11.  Moreover, in the motions that 
follow there are some things that overlap.  That is why I will have 
far less to say about the following ones, for example, Motions Nos. 
14 and 15.  In Motion No. 14, the proposed amendment sets a limit 
for the mandate of the president to be determined by the board of 
directors, so in Motion No. 15 this should also be the board of 
directors and not the governor in council. 
We totally agree with this motion, which reduces the federal 
government's power to appoint someone to this position for an 
indeterminate period. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You can see that the same logic has been followed from the 
start and there is an attempt to give more power to farmers on the 
Canadian Wheat Board and the board of directors, and thus to move 
it a little away from the control of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Motion No. 16, its purpose is to have the president 
implement measures no later than six months following the first 
election of the board of directors to include the Canadian Wheat 
Board as a signatory to the International Code of Ethics for 
Canadian Business.  This, I believe, is self-evident. 
We will therefore vote in favour of this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We shall do likewise for Motion No. 19, which is a 
consequence, or at least a corollary, of Motion No. 16, in which it 
is stated, as has already been mentioned, that the code of ethics 
governs the conduct of Canadian businesses abroad by ensuring that 
they do not exploit child labour and that they apply the same 
labour standards elsewhere as they do here.  What this means, 
therefore, is that the Canadian Wheat Board must act as a good 
corporate citizen both here and elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now for Motion No. 17, the amendment on the absence or 
inability to act of the president, I think that this is a routine 
matter, this is normal.  We will therefore vote for there to be a 
replacement when required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, to address Motion No. 18, where the amendment 
stipulates that the board members shall act in the performance of 
their duties with integrity and good faith, which I do not doubt. 
We will therefore vote in favour of this statement of good 
intention.

<P><A NAME="LINK276"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
once again I am pleased to speak to the amendments.  We are now 
debating Group No. 4.  In this grouping our party has 
two amendments.  I will speak to those amendments as well as 
others.  These amendments have been grouped together, as a number 
of them work in conjunction with each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two areas in this legislation about which I am 
concerned.  One of the areas has been dealt with to a certain 
degree and we will get to it a little later when we debate the 
amendment with respect to the inclusion clause.  Exclusion and 
inclusion are very serious components of this legislation and 
should be amended in order to improve the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second area about which I have very serious concerns is the 
governing section of the legislation. There have been substantial 
improvements put forward in this legislation which improve the 
existing governance of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who do not know, the current governance of the 
Canadian Wheat Board consists of a membership board, a commission 
if you will, with a maximum of five commissioners.  Currently 
there are three commissioners acting as the head of the Canadian 
Wheat Board.  There is also an advisory board.  The advisory 
board is made up of elected representatives, but the advisory 
board has absolutely no power.  It is a eunuch.  It simply 
advises not only the commissioners but the minister responsible 
for the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As proposed, this legislation would improve that governance.  In 
fact, there would be 10 elected board members out of the 15 who 
will comprise the membership of the Canadian Wheat Board.  Ten 
will be elected and five will be appointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our motion we have proposed a change to make it a fully 
democratic board of 15 elected members.  There is no reason the 
government should have any objection to having a fully 
accountable board of directors elected by the producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A precedent has already been set with respect to this type of 
governance. The Ontario wheat board has a fully elected board of 
directors. It makes sense that a parallel organization, the 
Canadian Wheat Board, should have elected members. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT86"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT86"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1710

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will say because it has certain requirements and 
certain guarantees that are outstanding for the Canadian Wheat 
Board that it has to have five appointed members of which one is 
the chief executive officer.  That is absolute hogwash.  It is 
not necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of governance there is a manager, a chief executive 
officer, referred to in the legislation as president.  The 
president under this legislation will be appointed by the 
government and the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say from experience I have had in the House over the very 
short period of time that the government has not given us an 
awful lot confidence in those people it will be appointing to the 
position of chief executive officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been examples of people who do not understand the 
business of being appointed as chief executive officer.  This is 
not the chairman of the board.  This is not a board member.  This 
is the individual who is going to be taking a corporation from 
the year 1997 into the 21st century.  Here is an individual who 
has to have an awful lot of business acumen, understanding of the 
business, understanding of the industry, understanding of trade 
arrangements and organizations in order for us to succeed as 
western Canadian grain producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This cannot be a Liberal patronage appointment, which 
unfortunately has been shown to happen many times in the past.  I 
am very nervous of that situation.  There is no reason why an 
elected board of directors cannot have the confidence placed in 
them to appoint and hire a chief executive officer. That is what 
these amendments speak to.  They speak to the point that this 
chief executive officer should be hired and report to the board 
of directors who would hire him, not to report to the government 
and the minister who really have no understanding of what is 
happening to the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talk about governance.  We have the board of directors and a 
chief executive officer.  I have some further concerns when we 
talk about the current commissioners who are now operating the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  They run under a very sheltered cocoon 
operation, obviously, having it as a monopoly corporation.  It 
runs basically the same way now as it did in 1943. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have with me a interview which was done by the current chief 
commissioner of the Canadian Wheat Board.  It was given to the 
<I>Manitoba Co-operator</I>.  I would expect that would be a 
fairly reasonable source and acceptable source by the members of 
government.  It says Chief Commissioner Lorne Hehn said: “`I 
said to the minister if the board and the minister want me to be 
there, I will be there for one year but not beyond that', Hehn 
said after speaking a Manitoba pool annual meeting.  `I am 
prepared to do it, be the chief executive officers, but the price 
has to be right”'. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some concerns about that because, quite frankly, what has 
to be right has to be right for producers and Canadian farmers, 
not what is right for a chief executive officer or for a minister 
of the crown.  It has to be right so we can put into place the 
proper marketing measures to compete in a global society right 
now, to compete in a global marketplace where there is 
substantial competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So that speaks to these amendments, where in fact we should have 
a fully accountable elected board of directors and an appointed 
chief executive officer by the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two other motions I would like to touch on.  One is Motion No. 
8.  The reason I bring this up is I originally tabled this motion 
at committee and then withdrew it.  It obviously found its way to 
the amendments here.  I bring it to the attention of the House. 
It says “—rum at the meetings, which shall be at least 
two-thirds of the board”.  That obviously means quorum, but when 
I read this I almost had unanimous consent of the committee. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1715"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT87"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT87"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1715
<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the amendment is a legitimate and logical one.  It 
speaks to a quorum being struck for the board of directors.  It 
should be two-thirds board members and a ratio of two elected 
directors to one appointed director.  For every meeting of the 
board of directors there has to be two elected members to one 
appointed member and two-thirds of the board present for a 
quorum.  That makes good corporate, business sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be speaking against an amendment which is obviously not 
mine.  It was an amendment put forward by the hon. member for 
Peace River.  It speaks to the actual election of the board of 
directors and the criteria people must achieve before they can 
register a vote for the board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand where the hon. member is coming from because there 
are large and small producers.  All producers should have a vote 
for the person they wish to have on the board of directors of the 
Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not be supporting the amendment.  I appreciate where it 
is coming from and I understand why it is there.  It has merit 
but it flies in the face of democracy.  It should not be based on 
the number of bushels produced or the numbers of acres farmed. It 
should be that farmers and producers have the right to elect the 
board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In wrapping up on this section I do not know if the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries would like 
to be the CEO of the Canadian Wheat Board. He seems to be heading 
in that direction.  I have some concerns with respect to the 
appointment of the CEO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a brief rebuttal, let me say that a number of organizations 
and people are still very concerned about the inclusion clause. 
We will have a chance to speak to that in another category that 
is coming up. 
<P><A NAME="LINK277"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, earlier 
today in the Chamber the hon. member for Skeena started to talk 
about the Liberal approach to managing and controlling all 
aspects of our economy.  He referred to marketing boards that 
were set up by the Hon. Eugene Whelan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It shows the lack of understanding of marketing boards of the 
member for Skeena. What was even more ironic was that he talked 
about the Liberal approach in the 1960s and 1970s.  He should be 
aware that when Eugene Whelan became agriculture minister there 
were already over 108 marketing boards in existence in Canada, 
mostly provincial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member talked about it being a Liberal policy, it is 
ironic that the provinces with a long history of Conservative 
governments also had a long history of marketing boards.  There 
were 25 marketing boards in existence under the government of 
Bill Davis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ensure the member for Skeena knows what a marketing 
board is if in the future he wants to talk about it.  I thought I 
would put on record that marketing boards vary in practice but 
the principle is very simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a system whereby producers, in this case the farmers in 
case the Reform Party does not know what those are, pool their 
products, decide on a cost price formula, when and how much to 
produce, how much to sell and at what price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was not understood by the member for Skeena, farmers have 
democratic control over a marketing board.  They run it 
themselves.  It is not forced on them.  A marketing board for 
perishable products makes the most sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the difference.  The member for Skeena did not 
understand that marketing boards are mainly for perishable 
products in Canada. Some products can be stored in a bin for 
years but that cannot be done with a pound of butter or meat.  To 
produce a surplus of perishable products and assume that the 
market will take care of it is utter economic nonsense and 
wasteful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“A marketing board is an efficient way of protecting domestic 
producers and assuring that there will always have a supply for 
domestic consumption”.  The hon. member could have read that. It 
is a quote from a book published by Eugene Whelan, in case he has 
not had the time.  It was given to him in 1993 to read. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also talked about rotten eggs.  Again it showed a lack of 
understanding of the industry. 
The incident he referred talked about the number of eggs spoiled. 
The number was quite small when one looks at the industry in 
context.  It was only about a half of 1% of a year's production 
which under any circumstances is not bad for any perishable 
product.  I challenge the member for Skeena to find another 
industry that did so well.  It is quite impressive when we 
remember that we are dealing with a perishable product.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that the person he referred to, Eugene 
Whelan, was not responsible for the storage facility but only for 
the legislation establishing the board.  It is even more ironic 
that same person, Eugene Whelan, became the first agriculture 
minister in Canadian history not to have to subsidize the poultry 
industry.  I thought that would be something the Reform Party 
would reward.  I thought they would be happy to hear there was no 
subsidy under his leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting how the Reform Party throws in comments and 
does not recognize the importance of marketing strategies or, in 
particular in this case, the difference between marketing boards 
for perishable products and the Canadian Wheat Board.  The 
Canadian Wheat Board is guaranteed for all farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To end my comments today, I wanted to say that the only rotten 
egg in parliament today was the member for Skeena. 
<P><A NAME="LINK278"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is 
a hard act to follow and I will try not to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about Group No. 4.  It contains over a dozen 
amendments to Bill C-4 which deal with a wide range of issues. 
The issues are so wide ranging that it will be very difficult to 
touch on half of them in the time I have.  I am concerned about 
the fact that the amendments are not grouped in a way that would 
make debate a little easier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first motion I want to talk about is Motion No. 5 brought 
forward by the Reform member for Peace River.  The member for 
Brandon—Souris already talked about this amendment.  It was 
interested that he was quoted in a newspaper recently as saying 
he had found friends in the Liberals and the New Democrats but 
would never co-operate or find friends in the Reform.  Yet here 
he is fully supporting the amendment of the member for Peace 
River.  I appreciate the change of heart on the part of that 
member.  I think it is progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Brandon—Souris presented the case on Motion No. 
5 quite well.  I think I can leave it at that.  He did a good job 
of explaining that amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next amendment I will talk about is Motion No. 8 which I put 
forward.  The purpose of the amendment is to set out what a 
quorum would be on this partially elected and partially appointed 
board which it seems the Liberals are determined to give us. What 
Reform wants is a completely elected board.  We think farmers 
will settle for nothing less.  We are to get a partially 
appointed and partially elected board.  The board will consist of 
15 members, 5 appointed under Bill C-4 as it stands and 10 
elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Depending on how quorum is set by the minister, I have concern 
that a quorum could consist of all appointed directors.  In a 
case where a meeting is called and for some reason the elected 
members cannot make it to the meeting, we have nothing to assure 
us that a board of only appointed members could make serious 
decisions about the future of the board or about operations of 
the company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think this amendment could possibly be opposed by 
government members.  It would ensure that we have a good quorum 
with at least two-thirds of the members, 10 out of the 15, and 
that we have a ratio of at least 2:1, two elected directors and 
one appointed. 
That is very important.  We can then be assured that at least the 
elected directors will be there and will have their say at the 
meetings.  I encourage the government to support Motion No. 8. It 
will be difficult to understand why It would not.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk a bit now about Motion No. 9.  It concerns the 
hiring and firing of the president-CEO.  The way Bill C-4 amends 
the Canadian Wheat Board Act the minister would appoint the 
person to the position of president-CEO.  It is very unusual for 
a president and a CEO to be the same person.  It is very unusual 
to have the chief executive officer whose job is to run the daily 
operations of the company also sitting on the board as its 
president.  It is extremely difficult to understand why the 
government would propose that type of a situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the background, at the philosophy of wheat pools, 
for example.  Members opposite often refer to what pools offer 
and how pools operate.  If they looked at how pools and 
co-operatives operate they would know that no one but an elected 
board of directors would hire or fire the president of the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, delegates and directors of the Alberta Wheat Pool 
are elected by members who meet.  First they elect a president. 
Then the same board of directors hires the chief executive 
officer.  At any time they choose they can fire the chief 
executive officer.  These people would never be the same two 
people.  It is a situation which to some extent would involve a 
conflict of interest, having the chief executive officer who is 
to carry out the wishes of the board of the directors sitting on 
the board as president.  Having one person filling both positions 
is extremely unusual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the model set out by co-operatives and by the 
prairie pools we find that it is in complete conflict with what 
the government has done in Bill C-4, an act to amend the Canadian 
Wheat Board Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 9 in the name of the member for Prince George—Peace 
River is an extremely important amendment.  It is important that 
this is passed.  I hope members opposite will understand the 
importance of the motion, especially those who so strongly 
support co-operatives as I do.  Let us learn from what we have 
seen in co-operatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several other motions that I want to talk about, but I 
will have to limit myself in that I only have a few minutes. The 
next one is Motion No. 10.  It deals with who should vote and how 
many votes a certain operation should have.  We do not know how 
the voting will be set up.  That will be dealt with in the 
original election under the regulations.  That is a concern 
because it should be in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules for voting should be right in the legislation so that 
we know how the voting will take place.  That will not happen. 
The regulation will be set after the bill is passed as it surely 
will be because the government will ram it through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member of the NDP said earlier that a farmer that grows one 
bushel of grain should have the same vote as a farm that has a 
permit book and may be the sole means of support of three, four 
or five families.  Many farms have one permit book for several 
families.  That member said that a farmer who grows one bushel of 
grain should have one vote the same as a farm that supports 
three, four or five families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nonsense.  It makes no sense.  That is why we have an 
amendment that would at least say that a minimum of 50 tonnes of 
grain have to be produced to be eligible to vote, and 50 tonnes 
is not much. 
A commercial farm would grow many times that.  It is certainly 
not a number that would eliminate any farmers who are anywhere 
near being commercial farmers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another change that must take place in the voting arrangements 
is to make it so that farmers who do not have a permit book but 
who grow grains like wheat and barley that are under wheat board 
jurisdiction will have a right to vote.  Many farmers have chosen 
not to use the wheat board so they do not get a permit book.  It 
is a very deliberate move on their part.  Why should they not be 
allowed to vote when it comes time to elect a director to the 
Canadian Wheat Board?  The answer is very difficult to 
understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard several members of Parliament from other parties 
say that is the way it should be.  If you do not have a permit 
book, you should not be eligible to vote.  Of course that will 
all be determined in the regulations and we do not know what will 
be in the regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very concerned about the voting.  I was hoping this bill 
would never get to a stage where there would be a vote.  Maybe 
the government will see the error of its ways here and completely 
scrap this bill.  It might happen.  In my dreams it will happen. 
I suppose it is not very likely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This piece of legislation should be scrapped because clearly it 
is not going to do anything to improve the Canadian Wheat Board. 
It is not going to make it any more accountable to prairie 
farmers. It is not going to reduce the power and control of this 
government and of the minister.  I think that is another 
extremely important amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I am getting an indication that my time is up, I will say 
that I have so much more that I would like to say to these 
amendments.  If I have no more time, I will make some further 
comments when we get to future amendments.  It is important that 
there are members of the Reform Party who can really identify 
with the farmers who will be affected by this legislation to 
speak out on these amendments.

<A NAME="LINK281">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK282"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  moved that Bill 
C-203, an act to amend the Agreement on Internal Trade 
Implementation Act, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise to speak 
to my private member's bill which I believe will do an awful lot 
to remove barriers to trade between provinces within Canada and 
between businesses within a province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give some background to this bill, I will speak on what 
Bill C-203 will do, I will talk about the importance to Canadians 
of implementing this bill, then I will do something very 
important and read from letters of support I have received from 
various institutions and individuals across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement on internal trade was passed in this House in 
1994.  It was signed in 1994 by this federal government and by 
all provinces and the territories.  It came into effect in July 
1995 and I took part in the debate that preceded the passing of 
the bill.  I supported the bill.  I did not think it had gone far 
enough, I did not think it was strong enough, but I supported 
many aspects of the bill as did the Reform Party.  It was right 
to support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of our concerns were very legitimate. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT91"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT91"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1735

<A HREF="#LINKT90"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement came into effect in 1995, but what the agreement 
really did was set a timeline and a framework for future 
negotiations that would complete an Agreement on Internal Trade, 
that agreement which would remove most of the barriers to 
internal trade within the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, every timeline that was set in that Agreement on 
Internal Trade which was passed in 1995 has passed and has not 
been met.  None of the timelines have been met.  The dates that 
were set have passed.  What we find is a situation where a piece 
of legislation which had good intent, which was passed by this 
government in 1995, has had very little positive effect on its 
stated purpose which was to remove the barriers to internal trade 
within this country.  So it has not done the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A main part of the reason that it has not done the job is due to 
a couple of terms used in the agreement, particularly the term 
“agreement by consensus” between the provinces, the federal 
government and the territories, or between all provinces and the 
territories.  This term “agreement by consensus” has been 
interpreted by this group to mean “unanimous consent”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the provinces and the territories have been interpreting 
this term “agreement by consensus” is that every single 
province and each territory and the federal government must all 
agree to any change which would help complete the Agreement to 
Internal Trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill would remove that unanimity requirement that has been 
self-imposed by the board.  It would instead put in place a 
mechanism which would require consent of at least seven 
provinces, including at least 50% of the Canadian population. 
That is a formula which is much more realistic and which will 
allow, I believe, the completion of this Agreement on Internal 
Trade.  With the completion of the Agreement on Internal Trade 
will come removal of most of the barriers to trade within this 
country.  I will talk a little later about the importance of that 
to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back to a little bit of background, I have had people say: 
“With what you are proposing”—not many, mind you; they have 
mostly been from the Liberal Party—“are you not letting the 
federal government be heavy-handed in this issue?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, that is not the case at all.  It is not the case at all 
because again what I am saying is that only in cases where the 
provinces and the federal government and the territories together 
have not been able to reach an agreement could the federal 
government impose a settlement when we have had agreement of at 
least seven provinces, including at least 50% of the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Bill C-203 would apply only to cases where the proposal 
falls within the federal legislative powers as established by the 
Constitution Act of 1867.  That is the part of the act that 
relates to the interprovincial trade.  Particularly, we are 
talking about section 91 of the BNA Act of 1867, which states 
that legislative authority of Parliament extends to the 
regulation of trade and commerce, and section 121 of the BNA Act 
which states that all articles of growth, produce or manufacture 
of any one of the provinces shall, from after the union, be 
permitted into each of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, section 121 of the BNA Act says that it is the 
obligation of the federal government to ensure free movement 
between provinces.  The federal government has abdicated this 
responsibility in particular for the last 80, 90 years and it has 
allowed one barrier after another, after another, after another 
build up so that we do not have free movement of goods in this 
country anymore. 
It has come to the point where people who run successful 
companies have come to me and said “It is absolutely ridiculous 
in this country when it is more difficult for me to move goods to 
another province than it is for me to do business with a company 
in the United States”.

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also had people who run successful companies come to me 
and say “I have stayed in Canada as long as I possibly can.  I 
want to be a Canadian.  I want to do business in this country. 
But if I want to do business with all ten Canadian provinces and 
the territories, I can do it much more easily from a company 
based in the United States”.  That is the situation we have 
today.  It makes no sense.  It is costing Canadians an awful lot 
of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will mention some of the studies that have been done which 
have shown the cost to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Chamber of Commerce stated that a 10% increase in 
internal trade would result in 200,000 new jobs.  With 
unemployment hanging around 9%, those 200,000 new jobs would be 
very important indeed.  Of course, an increase in internal trade 
beyond 10% would mean even more jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Fraser Institute stated that removing interprovincial trade 
barriers would increase family income by $3,500 a year.  The 
average family income would increase $3,500 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Manufacturers' Association stated that removing 
these barriers to internal trade would mean $6 million to $10 
million more being put into the Canadian economy.  That would 
have a huge impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know I only have five minutes remaining, so I am going to skip 
over some of the things I was going to cover.  However, I am 
going to refer to two studies which I believe must be referred to 
when we are talking about the complete lack of success of the 
agreement on internal trade that was passed in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A federal study leaked last May found that the agreement on 
internal trade only addresses 13% of the thousands of 
interprovincial trade barriers faced by the 50 companies who were 
taking part in this government survey.  The study found that 56% 
of the trade barriers could be addressed if the agreement were 
completed.  Only 13% had been removed, but 56% of the barriers 
would be removed if the agreement were completed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to wonder why this government has not been more serious 
about removing these barriers.  Surely that alone should indicate 
that this government should implement this bill.  If it does not 
like the bill exactly as it is, then I say “Go ahead.  Make the 
changes that you want to make to it, but put in place legislation 
which will implement the agreement on internal trade”.  It is 
too important to Canadians to ignore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last spring the Canadian Federation of Independent Business 
asked their members the following question:  Should the federal 
government take steps to ensure that the provisions of the 
agreement on internal trade are enforced without further delay? 
Of those who responded, 58% said yes, 21% were undecided, 10% 
were not interested in the issue and only 11% said no.  When 
asked a question which directly relates to my private member's 
bill, only 11% said “No, don't do that”.  Fifty-eight per cent 
said “Yes, and do it quickly”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to refer to some letters of support which I 
received from important groups in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first letter comes from the British Columbia Chamber of 
Commerce.  This letter is dated November 3, 1997.  I sent a 
letter to a couple of dozen key institutions across the country 
and asked them if they would write a letter of support 
specifically for my private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This letter is from John Winter, president of the British 
Columbia Chamber of Commerce.  It reads: “The British Columbia 
Chamber of Commerce would like to commend you on your initiative 
to improve trade opportunities within Canada.  Much has been made 
of the success Canadian businesses enjoy in a free trade 
environment within North America, and the opportunity to improve 
trade conditions in Canada is overdue.  We support you in your 
efforts and wish you much success in passing An Act to amend the 
Agreement on Internal Trade Implementation Act.” That is the 
title of my bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT92"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is from the British Columbia Chamber of Commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, Catherine 
Swift, CEO, a letter written November 4, 1997 in response to that same 
letter: “Thank you for your recent letter on Bill C-202, an act 
to amend the Agreement on Internal Trade Implementation Act. 
Small and medium size businesses in Canada have long supported 
the elimination of internal trade barriers and welcome your 
initiative on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“In your letter, you cited CFIB's recent mandate ballot survey 
which showed that 58% of the respondents supported the federal 
government ensuring that provisions to the agreement on internal 
trade are enforced without further delay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“I have attached the full text of the question as well as two 
earlier member votes on related topics to your information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Please be assured that Canada's small businesses are supportive 
of your initiatives in this area”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the C.D. Howe Institute, I want to make clear up front that 
this letter is from Daniel Schanen, a real expert in this area. 
He does say, and I want to get to this first: “Our mandate as an 
independent institute does not allow us to support or disapprove 
of particular bills”.  But the rest of his letter goes on to 
show strong support for the initiative that I have taken through 
this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also expressed the importance of the barriers to internal 
trade being removed in this country. So many of the letters 
really stressed their disappointment in the lack of action on the 
part of this government when it came to making some progress on 
implementing the agreement on internal trade, finishing the deal 
so that we have barriers to trade reduced and eliminated in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the information from studies on the importance of 
removing these barriers to internal trade.  The industry minister 
has stated on several occasions that he thinks this is an 
important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess I have to ask why this same industry minister who again 
and again has stressed the importance has said, and I have a 
quote here on that, that maybe it is time that the federal 
government went beyond what it proposed to really do what it has 
a right to do and ensure that this deal is completed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every single province and every territory in this country said 
that if the agreement on internal trade is passed, the people of 
their provinces would be better off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That confirms the information that has been received from 
studies and from the responses I have received from the letters I 
have sent out on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the time given to me to present my bill and to make 
some key points on it.  I look forward to the debate from other 
members on this bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK283"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to 
speak on Bill C-203, an act to amend the agreement on Internal 
Trade Implementation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill serves as a timely reminder of how important trade is 
to Canada not only in international but in domestic trade. From 
its very beginning, Canada has been a trading nation.  Trade is 
the lifeblood of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The well-being of Canadians depends on our ability to create and 
profit from competitive trading environments both at home and 
abroad.  It was for that reason that the federal government and 
the provincial governments during 1993 and 1994 negotiated the 
agreement on internal trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the agreement was to create a framework for 
continued co-operative efforts among governments to open up the 
domestic market.  It established a set of rules and a work 
program aimed at ensuring the free flow of goods, services, 
people and capital and, more generally, governing trade and trade 
disputes between provinces and territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement on internal trade came into effect July 1, 1995. 
It is no secret that there are problems with the agreement.  From 
the start, the government recognized that the agreement was only 
a first step. 
We have accordingly consistently sought to bring other 
governments to agree to make it a more effective instrument for 
economic growth.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry has at every meeting on internal trade 
pressed his provincial colleagues to ensure the work mandated by 
the agreement was done within the deadlines set.  He has 
repeatedly challenged the other parties to the agreement to 
seriously consider ways to improve both its scope and the way it 
operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent studies and reports by business organizations such as the 
chamber of commerce and other observers have underlined many of 
the weaknesses in the agreement.  They have pulled few punches in 
identifying the reluctance of various provincial governments to 
live up to the spirit or the letter of their commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of these observers have identified the decision making 
process and the agreement, that is, its requirement for a 
consensus as a major impediment to progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill reflects an attempt to address that particular issue. 
The intent is understandable. The bill itself, unfortunately, is 
neither realistic nor practical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As most hon. members will recall, last year we considered and 
passed the Agreement on Internal Trade implementation Act which 
this bill proposes to amend.  The government introduced that 
legislation in 1995 because we were then and remain today firmly 
committed to making the agreement work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Agreement on Internal Trade and Implementation Act enables 
the federal government to meet its obligations under the 
agreement on internal trade.  That legislation was necessary to 
give the government the appropriate authority and specific tools 
to act within its own areas of direct responsibility.  However, 
it is most important to recognize that our Agreement on Internal 
Trade Implementation Act and the agreement on internal trade are 
quite different and distinct instruments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one is legislation by and for only one government within its 
own jurisdiction and powers.  The other is a collectively 
achieved accord on how all the governments that are party to it 
will exercise their respective powers within their own 
jurisdictions.  The agreement on internal trade was the outcome 
of a difficult process of negotiations between the federal 
government, the provinces and the territories during 1993 and 
1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The authority of the agreement on internal trade does not derive 
from federal legislation. Rather, the authority of the agreement 
on internal trade derives from the commitments, obligations and 
undertakings which all governments accepted when they signed it. 
That is a fundamental point which the bill before us fails to 
recognize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply put, no one party to the agreement on internal trade 
can on its own amend that agreement.  That is what this bill 
is attempting to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are therefore two main reasons why this bill is 
inappropriate. First, it cannot accomplish what it wishes to do, 
which is amend the agreement on internal trade without the 
agreement of all the other governments that signed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it directly conflicts with the fundamental basis on 
which the agreement was negotiated, co-operation, joint action 
and national interest. The Canadian business sector has a 
legitimate expectation that the agreement on internal trade 
should deal effectively with internal trade barriers and 
impediments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has a legitimate expectation that the agreement should also 
deal with the burden of extra costs imposed by conflicting, 
overlapping and duplicate regulatory requirements.  Ordinary 
Canadians have a legitimate expectation that the agreement should 
make it possible for them to live and work wherever they can be 
gainfully employed or wherever they are able to provide 
marketable services.  All Canadians have a legitimate expectation 
that the agreement should make it possible for them to invest 
freely and conduct honest business freely throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement as it now stands does not deliver on those 
expectations. It is only a first step. The fact is that dealing 
definitively with internal trade issues is not a simple task.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to read through sections 91(a) or 121 of the 
Constitution and conclude that what is needed is bold and 
decisive action by the federal government; easy but simplistic 
and ultimately ineffective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is simplistic because unilateral federal action could not 
address some areas that are exclusively within provincial 
jurisdiction like labour mobility or local government spending on 
subsidies and other incentives.  It is ultimately ineffective 
because it fails to recognize how this country works best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Permanent, practical and effective change is best achieved when 
based on acceptance and co-operation among governments, not on 
the basis of legalism and coercion.  All governments in Canada 
must work together to ensure that the national economy is strong, 
efficient and producing new products, services, jobs and growth 
opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to that end that all governments be pressed to 
make the agreement on internal trade work better.  The agreement 
belongs to all its parties.  Its implementation is the 
responsibility of all its parties, not just the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I cannot support this bill before us for the reasons I 
have outlined, I hope its message will not be lost by other 
governments and that the member opposite proposing this bill 
encourage in his own province that his own province be proactive 
and a leader in making sure that internal trade barriers come 
down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard, it is encouraging that the provincial premiers 
at their annual meeting in August directed their ministers and 
officials to complete the outstanding work of the agreement and 
to embark on a major expansion of the activity under it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government certainly can be counted on to continue to try 
to co-operate and work with others to strengthen and improve the 
agreement on internal trade.  We look to others to work with us 
and be proactive to make things happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great interest that I rise to speak to Bill C-203, the purpose of 
which is to amend, and I will come back to this in detail, the 
Agreement on Internal Trade Implementation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to see you there, Mr. Speaker, because I am sure 
that this is a topic of great concern to you and that you will 
listen closely to what I have to say.  Two topics seem to have you 
terribly worried lately; obviously, the postal dispute, and the 
impossibility of delivering mail from your riding, as well as your 
inability to send out your seasonal greetings in the coming weeks. 
I know that this concerns you greatly, and that internal trade 
weighs just as heavily on your mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the bill before us all about?  I will read the bill's 
summary, which explains this very clearly. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment will give the Governor in Council— 
</UL>
<In other words, cabinet.  I continue: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment will give the Governor in Council the 
power to bring a proposal into force under the Agreement if, 
although not having unanimous provincial consent, it 
nevertheless has the consent of two thirds of the provinces 
that have at least fifty per cent of the population of Canada. 
This would apply only to cases where the proposal falls within 
the federal legislative powers established by the Constitution 
Act, 1867 that relate to free interprovincial trade. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two parts to this bill: the first is the amending 
formula, and the second deals with the jurisdiction of the federal 
government in matters of interprovincial trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start with the first point.  Right now, the approach is 
based on consensus, meaning that the agreement of all the provinces 
is needed before proceeding.  It strikes me as very appropriate to 
ensure that the parties involved agree before the rules affecting 
them are passed. 
The big risk in the proposed formula is that the government would 
be imposing rules on the provinces with which they were not in 
agreement, and the odds are that, if these provinces were not in 
agreement, it would be because their citizens were not in agreement 
either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to questions of trade, whether we are talking 
about opening up borders to international trade or about 
interprovincial trade, there is obviously very strong pressure to 
liberalize that trade, but at the same time there is also pressure 
to do so with respect for the particular characteristics of diverse 
industries. 
There is, for example, the whole issue of the colouring of 
margarine, which is of concern to a lot of dairy producers.  We 
have to understand their concerns. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, it is certainly not up to the federal Parliament to decide 
to impose rules without a consensus among the provinces involved. 
So, I repeat, the current practice, a relatively recent one, is to 
obtain the unanimous support of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second element of the formula proposed, which is in fact the 
seven and fifty formula, that is seven provinces and 50% of the 
population, was never accepted by Quebec.  It had long 
claimed—all sorts of problems arose subsequently—to have veto 
power. However, no Bloc Quebecois member would agree in this 
House to this formula, which, in the case of interprovincial 
trade, would reduce the powers currently enjoyed by Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a warning, because I know the members of the government 
are listening carefully.  There is a danger in interprovincial 
trade.  This is my second point, and I will move to it now because 
it follows nicely.  The danger is that little by little the federal 
government—and the supreme court has given it all the tools it 
needs—will claim that many sectors of interprovincial trade are 
under its jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have long seen the Constitution from the standpoint of the 
sections that speak of sharing jurisdictions.  There are two ways, 
however, that the federal government can use the Constitution to 
acquire new powers. 
There is public order and good government, and there is the 
Criminal Code.  We are not concerned with the Criminal Code here, 
but I will explain how that would work anyway.  The federal 
government would introduce criminal offences in a particular sector 
to claim that it had jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever there have been disputes, the supreme court has 
always ruled in favour of the federal government.  This happened 
again recently.  There were a series of decisions recently—I will 
not look at all of them individually—which meant that everything 
was on the table if the federal government decided to go ahead and 
use this provision of good order or good government to take over 
areas of provincial jurisdiction with respect to interprovincial 
trade.  This is undesirable and I hope the federal government will 
not resort to this. 
It knows very well that, because of the way the court interpreted 
the Canadian Constitution in its decision, there would be the 
potential for the federal government to centralize further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, as I was saying, there are two aspects to the bill. 
The seven and fifty formula, which is unacceptable to a province 
such as Quebec, would also be inconsistent with the claims of a 
number of political parties, although in the case of the Reform 
Party, this is less and less obvious, that they support the unique 
character of Quebec, the new phrase we have been hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This formula merely adds force to our argument that Quebec can 
been considered to have a unique character on paper, in a 
declaration with no constitutional value, but when it comes to 
introducing bills or making legislation, and so forth, that does 
not count. 
This has symbolic value, it is a piece of paper that can be given 
to Daniel Johnson to parade around with in the next election 
campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This must not have any legal impact, though, and still less 
have any use as a means of recognizing more powers, or specific 
powers, for Quebec, never, never.  It is clear that if the Calgary 
declaration were sold under that angle, it would sell even less 
well than now.  That agreement is not out of the woods yet, but 
that is not what we are debating now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now back to the second aspect, which states that the seven and 
fifty formula ought to be used for jurisdictions currently 
belonging to the federal government. This is what I am explaining. 
The problem is that the federal government is then going to claim 
that other areas of jurisdiction belong to it, where 
interprovincial trade is concerned.  We can pretty well bet that 
the supreme court would back it up, as usual. 
There is an old expression in Quebec, with which you are very 
familiar, which says that the supreme court is like the Leaning 
tower of Pisa, it always leans in the same direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of interprovincial trade, once again they are 
nibbling away at the powers of the provinces—in the case I refer 
to, the powers of Quebec—so that the federal government from the 
heights of its great wisdom here in Ottawa can declare that it is 
in the best position to ensure the proper operation of government. 
They would say that good governance and law and order should be left 
with the federal government. The government would then gradually invade 
provincial jurisdictions. So we cannot agree on either count.

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, as far as interprovincial trade per se is concerned, it would 
clearly be desirable to further harmonize all kinds of existing 
regulations. I am in a good position to comment on this, since I live in 
a border riding. Geographically, the riding of Témiscamingue is in 
northwestern Quebec, on the border with Ontario. Naturally, we do a 
great deal of trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a very serious transportation problem. There is all sorts 
of regulations, and trucking regulations in particular. 
In our riding, on the border, there is this company called Tembec Inc. 
Its trucks only have to travel a few hundred feet to cross the border 
but they are subject to a different set of standards regarding loading 
and so on, depending on which side of the border they are on. That does 
complicate things somewhat and there are serious problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this does not mean we should give the federal government the 
power to decide what would be best for these people. Hopefully, the 
provinces will step up negotiations to improve interprovincial trade, in 
the interest of businesses, individuals, workers and ultimately 
consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some cases, it is easier to trade with a foreign country, and 
the United States in particular, that between two Canadian provinces. 
Everyone agrees improvements are required, but certainly not along the 
lines of the proposals contained in the bill before us today, as it 
would not be in keeping with the amending formula Quebec wants, it would 
not give it a veto. On the other hand, it would enable the federal 
government to avail itself of this means to help itself to more and more 
power in the area of interprovincial trade. In the end, this would lead, 
once again, to a greater centralization of powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these two very valid reasons, we cannot support this bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to Bill C-203. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us proposes to amend the powers of the 
government to enforce the agreement on internal trade.  Under 
Bill C-203 unanimous consent from the provinces will no longer be 
required to reduce interprovincial trade barriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Internal trade is an area of great interest to me.  My 
background is in small and medium size business.  My family have 
been historically involved in small and medium size business. Our 
family and our region in Atlantic Canada prospered under more 
liberalized trade both with other Canadians and with people 
around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently 20% of our national income and over 1.9 million 
Canadian jobs are created by trade among provinces and 
territories.  Trade between the provinces totalled $314 billion 
in 1995 alone.  Recognizing that internal trade in Canada is a 
vital part of our economy, I am distressed that since the 
internal trade agreement was negotiated and implemented it has 
received very little attention and even less leadership from the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Working harder to eliminate interprovincial trade barriers might 
stop or at least slow the recent increase in the unemployment 
rate.  Canadian consumers, Canadian taxpayers and Canadians 
looking for work are paying the price for inaction on reducing 
internal trade barriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The initiative on the internal trade agreement was brought 
forward by the former Conservative government in partnership with 
the first ministers of the day.  In 1987 the partners reached an 
agreement in principle to negotiate an agreement on internal 
trade.  In the spring of 1993 negotiations began with a deadline 
of June 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately this agreement has not had the effect its 
originators had envisioned for it.  This is especially 
distressing when one reads the red book distributed by the 
government in 1993.  In it the Liberals promised to urgently 
address the issue of internal trade if they were to form a 
government.  Today Canadians still find the economy hampered by 
internal trade barriers which give the provinces protectionist 
powers that cost Canadians jobs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current agreement is fundamentally flawed.  There continue 
to be differing rules for a wide range of goods and services and 
specifications for things as ludicrous as the colour of margarine 
to the standards that trades people must meet in neighbouring 
provinces.  Self-governing professional groups have erected 
qualification and certification barriers that prevent mobility of 
the workforce between provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current agreement does not cover the $50 billion public 
procurement market involving municipalities, universities, schools 
and hospitals.  A recent proposal to open this market was vetoed 
by the British Columbian government.  Since the agreement 
contains no enforcement mechanism, when a province wishes to 
break the agreement it can do so without fear. These trade 
barriers are creating false economies, are creating higher costs 
for consumers, taxpayers and are hindering employment growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party has in its past fought free trade.  Now it 
cannot get enough of it.  One week it will sign a deal with 
Chile.  The next week it will sign a deal with Israel.  While we 
are supportive and have been consistent in our support of the 
principles of liberalized trade and have recognized its benefits, 
it is time to bring down the barriers that create more trade 
barriers between Newfoundland and Ontario than exist between 
Newfoundland and Chile or Newfoundland and Israel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an issue of partisan politics as members of each 
party recognize the importance of bringing down these barriers 
and ensuring that we further grow the Canadian economy through 
liberalized trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Liberals negotiated the agreement they have continued 
to pass legislation that increases barriers to internal trade. 
The current Minister for International Trade, the government's 
latest choirboy for trade internationally, was singing a 
different tune just a short time ago when as minister of the 
environment he championed Bill C-29 which created internal trade 
barriers within Canada that are now being contested under chapter 
11 of the investor state provisions of NAFTA.  This represents a 
potential $350 million loss to Canadian taxpayers because of his 
ineptitude at the time he championed Bill C-29. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former minister for international trade, now the defence 
minister, cautioned the member for York West in a letter dated 
February 23, 1996.  He told the minister “Bill C-29 could have 
many adverse implications for Canadian trade without compensating 
environmental benefits”.  The government is guilty of creating 
more internal trade barriers within the country, not eliminating 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-29 created internal trade barriers and is inconsistent 
with our current international trade minister's philosophy du 
jour espousing the benefits of liberalized trade.  Now the 
minister's trade policy contained in Bill C-29 has brought the 
lawsuit from Ethyl Corporation.  It is one of three lawsuits now 
against the Canadian government from foreign companies under 
chapter 11 provisions of NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only did the government introduce Bill C-29 but it also 
tried to push taxation barriers on the Atlantic provinces through 
the implementation of the HST.  Tax-in prices would have done 
more to create internal trade barriers and would have cost more 
jobs in Atlantic Canada.  It is completely contrary to the basic 
principles of liberalized trade the government consistently 
represents, at least in terms of its rhetoric.  It is completely 
inconsistent in terms of its policy inaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion put forth by the member for Lakehead is headed in the 
right direction as it asks for trade barriers to be reduced.  It 
has enabled the House to have a lively debate on the important 
issue of internal trade.  The motion on its own is too simplistic 
to completely address the barriers surrounding internal trade.  I 
fear that what is needed is leadership from the government on an 
issue that is all too important to be downsized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has shown a propensity to downsize and offload 
responsibilities to the provinces in the race to fiscal 
responsibility.  We cannot offload or downsize leadership.  That 
is what I fear has happened with this important issue of internal 
trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems with this agreement are much deeper than unanimous 
consent of the provinces.  This is an example of the need for an 
enforcement clause which I touched on earlier. 
Furthermore, the motion asks the government to unilaterally 
change the internal trade agreement without consultation with the 
provinces.  It is this type of federalism that the Official 
Opposition has used at times to divide Canadians while our party, 
the PC Party, is trying hard to unite Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party believes it is time to deal with this problem of 
internal trade barriers with a holistic approach.  The jobs at 
stake are simply too important for the federal government to sit 
on the sidelines.  We believe that free internal trade can be 
negotiated co-operatively with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs to provide courageous leadership on this 
issue.  The government has demonstrated basically that it is not 
interested in playing that important and critical role with the 
provinces on these types of important negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this spring my party proposed making internal trade an 
integral part of something we call the Canadian covenant.  Under 
the Canadian covenant the PC Party proposed forging a new and 
lasting federation with a new level of co-operation between the 
federal government and the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides health care and post-secondary education, the covenant 
would have focused on interprovincial trade.  We support the 
establishment of a commission to regulate and enforce the rules 
of interprovincial trade.  We need to negotiate with the 
provinces to harmonize provincial standards in areas of corporate 
and business registrations, professional or occupational 
certification so that the costs of doing business in this country 
are not increased but in fact are reduced. The PC also supports 
strengthening internal trade through the transportation 
procurement provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, interprovincial trade like international trade is 
vital to our economy.  The current government has focused too 
little time on improving trade conditions right here at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Chamber of Commerce estimates that a 10% increase 
in interprovincial trade will create 200,000 very necessary and 
important jobs for Canadians.  It is time for a Team Canada for 
Canada and it is time that we demonstrate leadership and it is 
time that the federal government actually works hard to provide 
this type of leadership at this critical time for the Canadian 
people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK286"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to rise and speak on Bill C-203, a bill to amend the 
Agreement on Internal Trade Implementation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate the member for Lakeland for this 
initiative.  I would like to congratulate our government as well 
for making some early moves in the right direction.  As the 
parliamentary secretary indicated, more needs to be done, but I 
am very happy that we have started the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at it from the point of view of economic efficiency, 
it does seem somewhat ironic that as we are breaking down 
barriers to trade internationally, we still do have some barriers 
to trade within our own country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within that context I wonder if we could talk briefly about the 
brewing industry.  The brewing industry and the location of 
brewing plants in Canada has been one of those issues within the 
context of the internal trade agreement that has received some 
profile and some attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Etobicoke North I have two very large breweries, 
a big Molson brewery and a big Labatt brewery.  I have many 
dealings as a result of that with the brewing industry. When I 
speak with them we often discuss how the brewing industry in the 
United States has evolved.  There are typically very large 
brewing plants in the United States in one location or two 
locations and they serve the domestic U.S.A. market and perhaps 
the market internationally.  They tend to have huge plants and 
they capitalize on some tremendous economies of scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada the brewing industry has developed somewhat 
differently.  We have a number of smaller plants which are 
relatively large in size but compared to the megaplants in the 
United States, they tend to be smaller and they tend to be spread 
out across Canada.  As I understand it, the reason that has 
evolved is that many provinces—including I suspect the province 
of Alberta, but I do not know that for certain—but various 
provinces have insisted that for the national breweries to do 
business in their province, they have restricted transport 
movements of beer.  It really has meant that the brewing industry 
has been required to set up brewing plants in very many of the 
provinces. 
Presumably some of the major breweries have established plants in 
Alberta.  Again, I do not have those facts in front of me.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the barriers to internal trade are removed for the brewing 
industry, it would undoubtedly mean that some of the smaller 
plants across the prairies, in British Columbia, in the maritime 
provinces and in Ontario would shut down and a lot of the 
production would be consolidated into megaplants.  I wonder if 
the hon. member for Lakeland would see that as a positive step 
and whether he would support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  If the hon. member for Lakeland 
speaks now, he will close the debate.  The hon. member for 
Lakeland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will respond to some 
of the issues which were brought up by the members who spoke. I 
do not have much time obviously to spend on the response to any 
one particular member.  I will start by responding to the 
questions posed by the hon. member for Etobicoke North.  He asked 
what would happen to some of the smaller breweries if barriers to 
internal trade were removed.  He asked about Alberta 
specifically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member wants to refer to Alberta, it would be important 
for him to know that the province of Alberta has led the movement 
to remove barriers to internal trade.  Unilaterally it has made 
many of the changes which will be and should have been put in 
place by a completed agreement on internal trade.  Alberta has 
done it unilaterally because it feels that this issue is 
important to Albertans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been a few people who have complained about this 
unilateral action.  They feel that Alberta should have waited 
until the agreement is completed.  That is what my private 
member's bill would do.  It would lead to the completion of the 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members who have called it simplistic obviously have not read it 
and thought it through.  It is simple.  It is a simple amendment, 
but it is not simplistic and it will do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the breweries, many successful breweries are in fact 
micro-breweries, smaller breweries.  I cannot say for sure that 
some would not close down as a result of removing barriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, every province, each territory and the federal 
government, when they signed the agreement on internal trade 
agreed that there would be a net benefit to the people of each 
and every province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to the comments made by the Bloc member.  He was 
concerned that Quebec would lose its veto within the formula 
which would remove the unanimous consent requirement and put in 
place the consent of at least seven provinces having at least 50% 
of the population.  His concern is completely unfounded.  In 
fact, the Government of Quebec signed the agreement on internal 
trade.  It agreed to a step by step process to complete the 
agreement.  All my bill would do would be to allow for the 
completion of the agreement on internal trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concerns put forth by the hon. Bloc member are completely 
unfounded because Quebec has already agreed to it, as has every 
other province and territory in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, I believe that Bloc members supported the 
implementation agreement which was introduced in 1995 and passed 
in 1996.  This nonsense about Quebec losing its veto is 
completely unfounded.  It has already expressed the desire to 
have this agreement completed and that is all my bill would do. 
It would put in place a more realistic formula for approval for 
each step in completing the agreement on internal trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reactions of government members have been very vague in some 
ways.  However, they did say they were concerned because the 
agreement on internal trade was signed by all governments in 
Canada, so how could the federal government alone make this 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the parliamentary secretary if the government has 
even attempted to consult with the provinces and the territories 
to make this change or a change like this.  I do not care if they 
use the exact method that I am putting forward. I do not care.  I 
just want the job done.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has far more resources than I have in terms of 
coming up with a way of doing it.  I believe it will work, as do 
members of these institutions who have studied the issue in some 
depth.  They agree it will work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe it is simplistic.  I believe it is simple. The 
concerns the government has expressed are completely unfounded. I 
will use some quotes from Liberal ministers in the last 
government to back that up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is from Alan Toulin, writing in <I>The Financial Post</I>, 
October 25, 1996.  He referred to the minister from Edmonton West 
hoping for agreement on internal trade in electricity.  She also 
raised the possibility that Ottawa would use its constitutional 
powers to manage the country's economic union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would mean a more active federal government, a role in 
bringing about deregulation for that minister and the Minister of 
Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 25, 1997 the Minister of Industry spoke to a group 
of Edmonton small business people at a small business conference. 
He said that from his point of view it would soon be time for 
the federal government to consider alternative strategies.  To 
say that he was disappointed, angry or frustrated is not only how 
he felt but an understatement.  Being this far along into the 
agreement with so little progress to show indicated to him that 
it was certainly time to re-examine the strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close with that.  I had several quotes from 
constitutional experts.  I would be glad to table them if I am 
requested to do so.  I thank members for their input.  I thank 
them for their clear support in dealing with the issue.  It was 
unanimous, I believe.  If government members do not believe my 
bill is the best way to go in this regard, I encourage them to 
come up with their own and I will support it wholeheartedly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on October 24, 1997, I questioned the 
Minister of Human Resources Development about the fact that the 
matter of the use made of the surplus of billions of dollars in the 
employment insurance fund should be included on the agenda of the 
next federal provincial conference.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not forget that, last summer at St. Andrews, the 
premiers decided that there were two things the federal government 
had to do about employment insurance.  It had to lower 
contributions and improve the living conditions of workers who are 
between jobs, that is unemployed people receiving benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then, there has not been a peep out of the federal 
government.  The minister told us that the agenda was not his 
responsibility, it was the Prime Minister's.  Today, we have 
reached that point in the autumn when—and we can see it at the 
InfoCentres—in Shawinigan they are getting calls from all those 
who are dissatisfied with the employment insurance reform. 
Our riding offices are systematically flooded with calls from people who 
say they can no longer get through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this wonderful federal system, it used to be that each Canada 
employment centre could provide answers to those it served. Through some 
incredible coincidence, it was decided to centralize everything in 
Shawinigan, in the Prime Minister's riding, and nothing works any more. 
There is no one to answer the phone. People call and call, but the line 
is always busy. This is example of the contempt shown by the Liberal 
government, which did not heed the message sent by the public during the 
last federal election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several Liberal MPs from the maritimes lost their jobs here. They 
were replaced by New Democrats or Conservatives because the public sent 
a clear message to the government that the employment insurance issue 
had to be reconsidered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People do not call it employment insurance. They still talk about 
unemployment insurance. They know that the new program is not a 
guarantee of employment, but a guarantee that they will have 
increasingly less money when they find themselves between jobs. They 
want to know whether the government is prepared to lower the requirement 
of 910 hours of work for first-time contributors, such as graduating 
students or women who re-enter the labour market. Would it be possible 
to lower this requirement to a more reasonable figure, so that people 
will not give up? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it be possible to change the fact that, at the end of every 
20 weeks of collecting employment insurance, people will see their 
benefits diminish by 1%? It means that if someone is starting this fall 
at 55%, he or she will get 54% in 20 weeks. If that person needs to rely 
on employment insurance again next year, the same thing will happen. The 
clock is not set back to zero. 
This means that in three years, seasonal workers will find themselves 
with 50%, while a person who lives in another region and who does not 
have to rely on employment insurance on a regular basis will get 55%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there any possibility that the federal government can promise to 
put this issue on the agenda at the first ministers' conference that 
will be held in December, as requested by the Quebec premier and the 
other provincial premiers last summer? That would tell us something 
about this government's ability to show compassion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to the 
hon. member's question by reminding him, and the Minister of 
Human Resources remarked on this recently, that the last federal 
budget and the main estimates already contain a great deal of 
information on the employment insurance account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, there is no great mystery regarding the employment 
insurance account reserve.  A reserve is necessary since it makes 
it possible to apply more stable premium rates throughout the 
economic cycle, thus making it possible to avoid increasing them 
in a recessionary period.  In addition, the reserve makes it 
possible to ensure that there are sufficient funds to pay 
benefits when they are most necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us recall for a moment what happened in the last recession. 
A $2 billion surplus in the Employment Insurance Act turned into 
a $6 billion deficit in two years and it was necessary to 
increase premiums by 30% in what was already a difficult time for 
job creation.  That is no time to increase premiums. 
Consequently the government believes that it is wise to 
establish a reserve in the employment insurance account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The size of the reserve varies continually.  It increases and 
decreases depending on the rate at which benefits are paid out. 
The reserve is currently estimated to contain some $12 billion. 
However, this amount is to be reviewed and the government will 
soon be announcing its decision in this regard.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be remembered that the funds are kept in an account in 
anticipation of future expenditures that might be incurred under 
the program.  The interest is credited to the employment 
insurance account.  As indicated in the main estimates for 
1997-98, interest this year totalled $345 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance premiums of workers and employers make 
it possible to provide income protection.  That is very important 
for persons who unexpectedly lose their jobs.
