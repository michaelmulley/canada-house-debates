	<B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-309, 
an act to amend the Food and Drugs Act (ingredients of food sold in 
restaurants), be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, restaurants are important places in our 
communities. Whether for pleasure, business or while travelling, 
most Canadians eat out from time to time.
<P>
	Families with food allergy sufferers know how confusing and 
dangerous this situation can be. So I am pleased today to rise in 
support of my private member's bill, Bill C-309, which proposes to 
amend the Canadian Food and Drugs Act to provide greater 
protection for those Canadians who suffer from serious food 
allergies.
<P>
	When implemented, Bill C-309 would require restaurant owners 
to ensure that reliable information is available regarding the 
ingredients in their menu items. It would not seek mandatory 
labelling.
<P>
	Before beginning my formal comments on the bill, I would like 
to acknowledge Mrs. Betty Lou Taylor of Burlington, Christian 
Taylor's mother. Christian died at the age of 17 after eating an 
apple turnover secretly flavoured with ground hazelnuts.
<P>
	It is due in part to Mrs. Taylor's perseverance that the bill has 
made it this far. Mrs. Taylor has worked hard to ensure that 
Canadians who suffer from food allergies are protected. Through 
her efforts to raise awareness of the severity of food related 
allergies, more Canadians are informed and respectful of possible 
allergic reactions to certain types of food.
<P>
	At 17 Christian Taylor was very aware of the effects that 
hazelnuts would have on him. He was careful to avoid hazelnuts. 
But Christian had eaten apple turnovers in other fast food 
restaurants and in the absence of labelling on the package or in the 
restaurant, Christian  assumed he was safe. His assumption and the 
absence of labelling cost Christian his life. Yet Christian was doing 
what most of us do on a regular basis, enjoying a meal in a 
restaurant. Unfortunately for Christian on this particular occasion 
eating out would have a very tragic ending.
<P>
	As we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this bill, I 
encourage all Canadians, whether or not they personally suffer 
from food allergies, to remember that we have an opportunity to 
ensure that we support the type of legislation that reflects our 
concern for the health and safety of Canadians as well as our 
appreciation for good common sense.
<P>
	Bill C-309 meets both of those criteria. It does not mean 
mandatory labelling. It is a simple bill. It asks restaurant owners 
and their staff to take responsibility for the foods they serve and to 
recognize that some of their patrons suffer from something that 
cannot be controlled with medication but something that can be 
prevented with education and access to information.
<P>
	The bill addresses a medical condition known as anaphylactic 
shock. At least 50 Canadians die in anaphylactic reactions each 
year. These types of reactions can be triggered by minute amounts 
of allergen. For example, in 1994 a student on a field trip to 
Algonquin Park in Ontario died from trace amounts of peanut 
butter which had been transferred to a jam jar. Essentially 
anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that can lead to rapid death 
if untreated. Like less severe allergic reactions, anaphylaxis occurs 
when the body's immune system reacts to harmless substances as 
though they were harmful invaders.
<P>
	However, instead of developing the familiar runny nose or rash, 
suffers of anaphylaxis respond with extreme body reactions. The 
reaction may start with itching, vomiting or swelling of the lips and 
face. Within moments the throat may begin to close, choking off 
breathing and leading to unconsciousness and death.
<P>
	At least 25,000 Canadians are presently at risk of food related 
anaphylaxis. As I mentioned, an average of two Canadians die per 
month due to anaphylactic reaction from food allergy.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	One in 15 children suffers from a food allergy. Not all 
anaphylaxis related deaths are reported as such because they are 
usually 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7210"> 7210 </A></B>
<P>
recorded in the provincial records as  death by natural causes. One 
in 50 adults suffers from a food allergy. Some 35 per cent to 60 per 
cent of Canadians are avoiding specific ingredients each and every 
day for a medical reason. The bottom line is that issue affects a lot 
of Canadians, it does not discriminate, it occurs for the young and 
the old. And yet what is the current legislation?
<P>
	At the present time the Canadian Food and Drugs Act has 
provisions regarding ingredient disclosure in the food industry, but 
it applies only to prepackaged foods sold in grocery stores. 
Individuals with adverse food reactions are totally dependent on 
ingredient information. There are no medications or injections 
available to prevent these adverse food reactions, but once the 
reaction is under way adrenalin is needed immediately. For those 
who suffer and for those who know somebody who does, epipens 
and anakits are the two products available for those with an allergy. 
An epipen is a tool to self-administer adrenalin and an anakit 
contains benedril capsules and a double dose injection of adrenalin.
<P>
	How do you prevent anaphylaxis shock? Avoidance is the only 
way to prevent anaphylaxis and this is where Bill C-309 can make 
the difference between life and death. How many people here 
realize that walnuts are commonly ground into salad dressings or 
added to dishes such as chicken or Cornish hen? How many know 
that peanut oil is frequently used to fry foods? It adds a nice flavour 
to fried chicken. Some restaurant chains have in fact built their 
success on its flavour, but it can kill some of our fellow citizens. 
How many people know that ground almond is commonly added to 
pastries and that ground hazelnut is commonly added because it 
adds terrific flavour to chocolate?
<P>
	If one takes an item out of a food store there is a label and one 
can avoid an anaphylaxis reaction. In a restaurant one is playing 
Russian roulette. Bill C-309 attempts to reconcile the public safety 
concerns of consumers with the legitimate concerns of the 
restaurant industry regarding the prohibitive costs involved in the 
mandatory labelling of all restaurant foods.
<P>
	As I have said many times, Bill C-309 does not seek mandatory 
labelling. It seeks to protect food allergy sufferers by giving them 
something as simple but crucial as access to reliable information 
regarding ingredients.
<P>
	There are two scenarios for how it would work. One relates to 
the individual restaurant and the other relates to a chain restaurant. 
In an individual restaurant customers with food allergies or other 
ingredient related concerns would approach an employee in a 
restaurant. That employee would recommend that the person speak 
to the designated individual, usually the cook, to find out what 
ingredients are about to be used in the food that is being served 
them. It does not demand that they have long list. It can be as 
simple as saying: ``I am going to cook with this oil, with this can of 
tuna and with this box  of pasta. You read the ingredients and you 
make a decision''. It is not hard to administer.
<P>
	In a chain restaurant the customer would approach an employee 
and that person would either again refer to the designated employee 
or check in a binder of information. In some restaurants we have 
seen people list their ingredients on a board that people can refer to. 
Most McDonald's restaurants have a binder and in other kinds of 
chain restaurants one could rip off the end of the box that contained 
the buns that arrived at the restaurant for the hamburgers and if 
there is a change in supplier that is put in the back of the binder and 
people can make their own decisions.
<P>
	There has been a lot of support for this bill since I have started to 
talk about it. There have been many days where there have been 
whole page articles in the Toronto <I>Star</I> or in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> and 
the Hamilton <I>Spectator</I>. There have been at least 36 municipalities, 
15 boards of education and numerous national and provincial 
groups and associations that have specifically passed resolutions 
asking the federal government to act on this issue. Many Canadian 
schools have developed policies to protect anaphylactic children. 
Some have taken more drastic steps than others, banning certain 
types of foods altogether.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	The federal government, in co-operation with the school board 
association, recently launched a booklet to help schools organize 
themselves around this issue. It is a terrific handbook and 
something that was desperately needed for schools.
<P>
	The Canadian Food and Restaurant Association launched 
``Allergy Aware'' in 1991. It is a voluntary program that requires 
participating restaurants to give patrons accurate ingredient 
information on request. Because it is voluntary, it is difficult to 
enforce, not well supervised and there is a very low participation 
rate. Not all restaurants in Canada are members of the Canadian 
Food and Restaurant Association.
<P>
	The risks are that its campaign is not fully understood by 
employees. To test it out one evening, I asked someone who was 
proudly displaying the ``Allergy Aware'' sign at a convention type 
venue what that person could tell me about it. I was told that it was 
an ``Allergy Aware'' program. I then asked what I would hear if I 
said I was allergic to nuts, in reference to the food being served. 
Instead, the person told me not to eat nuts. Critical information was 
needed about the food that individual was serving me and yet that 
individual had no clue how the program worked.
<P>
	I spoke to the Canadian Medical Association. Dr. Peter Noel in 
Newfoundland has been a great source of assistance, information 
and encouragement.
<P>
	I did a survey of all members of the House of Commons and had 
a terrific response. Eighty-seven per cent of the MPs surveyed were 
supportive of this bill. Finally, and most importantly, Burlington 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7211"> 7211 </A></B>
<P>
residents support this bill. We received over 100,000 signatures on 
a petition asking the federal government to take action in this area.
<P>
	What do the opponents of Bill C-309 say? They argue that some 
restaurants will be driven out of business because of the costs. They 
suggest that it is too hard to administer. To these people I suggest 
they consider the following. Bill C-309 does not seek mandatory 
labelling. Surely it is not unreasonable to expect that something 
you are about to be served and consumed that you should be able to 
get some information about what you are about to eat. It is not 
unreasonable to think that the chef or the cook would know what 
the ingredients are in the food you are about to eat. This is life or 
death for a number of individuals. It does not impose unreasonable 
costs on restaurant owners. Providing a manual is a low cost 
solution to a life and death problem.
<P>
	This is really not about cost. This is about health and safety. 
Food allergy is not a trivial disease. It is not easy to manage and 
can be fatal. More and more people are suffering from adverse 
reactions to food.
<P>
	This bill suggests an easy way to implement a prevention 
program. Emphasis on prevention allows consumers to make 
informed choices instead of playing Russian roulette.
<P>
	We have the responsibility to ensure that where possible we are 
protecting the health and well-being of Canadians and those around 
us. Bill C-309 is about accepting that responsibility. This bill is 
about ensuring that no other mom has to lose a child as precious as 
Christian Taylor.
<P>
	I hope I have the support of all members on this bill. I ask that 
unanimous consent be given for Bill C-309 to become votable.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member has moved that the 
matter be made a votable one. Is there unanimous consent that it be 
votable?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I hear a little no. I have to say that the 
matter may not be votable at this point.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise and speak to this bill. Prior to this life, I spent a 
number of years in health care as a hospital nurse and saw a lot of 
situations where allergies, anaphylactic shock and these kinds of 
things occurred.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	I have mixed feelings about the bill. The overall objective is very 
worthy, but I have some difficulties from the point of view of onus, 
or sense of responsibility. It seems to me that we are placing a 
heavy responsibility on  the providers of the food, the manufacturer 
or the restaurant. We must make that an equal responsibility for the 
individuals themselves.
<P>
	It would have been nice to have heard some statistics in the 
previous member's speech in relation to those persons with 
allergies versus persons without allergies. What kind of 
percentages are we talking about? How many people have actually 
suffered from this kind of thing at restaurants and so on?
<P>
	To get on to some of my other concerns, the bill as stated would 
require restaurant owners to make all employees familiar with the 
issue of food allergies, their potential serious consequences and be 
able to answer customers' queries about the ingredients that may be 
contained in the food sold in the restaurant or prepared in the 
restaurant and sold for consumption outside the restaurant. That is 
one possible scenario.
<P>
	The second choice to meet this need would be to have one 
employee designated as having that information or making 
reference to it. I caution here and stress, as the member said in her 
remarks earlier, that we are not asking that waitresses become 
nutritionists and that they must have at their fingertips exactly what 
is in the contents of the meal.
<P>
	The bill would require restaurant owners to maintain a list of 
ingredients of all food prepared and sold by branch restaurants. I do 
not know about branch restaurants. That does not seem to be too 
unreasonable for restaurants. I am talking not only of restaurants 
but deli type establishments as well, where one grabs a muffin or 
whatever in passing and leaves.
<P>
	The thing that comes to mind here, and I cannot seem to move 
away from it, is that this looks as if we are assimilating the 
WHMIS program in relation to poisons which was introduced into 
the hospitals. To give an overview of the WHMIS program, 
basically what happens there is that in the workplace-I said it was 
introduced in hospitals but it was introduced in the workplace 
across the country-any potential hazardous material has to be 
listed and the appropriate action taken should an employee come in 
contact with that material.
<P>
	Two things came out of that. One was that it was going to be a 
horrendous task for organizations to do this. Basically the onus 
went back to the manufacturers and in their instructions with the 
product there was sufficient information for agencies or employers 
to put it in their binder and have it readily accessible to all staff.
<P>
	The other thing that arose out of that was the trade secrets in 
relation to the product. Under the WHMIS program if a company 
feels that their product has been violated they can take it to a 
committee to attempt to keep the secret. Kentucky Fried Chicken is 
the obvious one with the famous 11 herbs and spices in the chicken.
<P>
	What has to be looked at is not the recipe actually being 
accessible to the waitress or designated person. We have to look at 
the chemicals, just as the chemicals are listed on a can that we pick 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7212"> 7212 </A></B>
<P>
up on the grocery store. That may help allay the problem of the 
secret recipe.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	There is another plus to this. Labels have been put on products in 
grocery stores to better inform customers about their purchases. 
For example, when I make a meat loaf at home I know what is in it 
if I read the ingredient labels. It does not seem too difficult to move 
to the next step. Instead of my having to cook the meat loaf, 
someone else will cook it in a restaurant. But I still should be able 
to see the list of chemicals versus the recipe in relation to that meat 
loaf.
<P>
	There is a great amount of concern over what this means to a 
waitress or a cook in relation to his or her job. It is very important 
that the responsibility not fall totally on the restaurant. The onus 
should not be on the restaurant to assure the public that there will 
not be any allergic reactions. That must be stressed. If the 
individuals have that binder, they must be aware of the products in 
restaurant food to which they are allergic. The restaurant's 
responsibility stops with the provision of the binder. That does not 
seem to be stressed in the bill.
<P>
	This may be a bit of a moot point but there are other food sources 
like delis, bakeries and food courts which should be included. I 
would like to see the word ``restaurant'' expanded to include any 
food source. Consumers should be informed about exactly what 
they are buying in terms of chemical content.
<P>
	Anaphylactic shock is a very quick medical emergency. In most 
cases there is only 10 to 15 minutes to respond. Remember in days 
gone by when some people would be dead within a few minutes of 
receiving a bee sting? Then an alternative was introduced where a 
person could carry a syringe along with a little ampulla of 
adrenalin.
<P>
	Today there is another life threatening food to some people, 
peanut butter. I suggest very strongly for those persons with very 
acute allergies that they should take some sort of medical 
precaution. They should carry that little vial or whatever it may be. 
You cannot expect a restaurant to save your life if you go into 
anaphylactic shock or if you have any allergic reaction. Not all 
allergic reactions end up being anaphylactic shock. We should also 
be aware of which allergic reactions are life threatening when we 
interpret statistics.
<P>
	My approach to this bill is that it has its good points and points 
that need more development. We talk of recipes in the bill. I would 
like to see that developed into chemical components of products.
<P>
	For any restaurant it is quite common to standardize recipes so 
that the vegetable soup made on Monday tastes the same as 
vegetable soup on any other day. It is usually a standardized recipe 
and that is just economics. Instead of letting every cook do 
whatever, there are standardized recipes. Of course the other thing 
too is that the  customers acquire a taste and if the food is good, 
they certainly will come back.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	With a standardized recipe when someone uses the ketchup as 
was previously stated, it would not be that difficult to take the label 
off the bottle or to have it reproduced in some way and placed in a 
manual.
<P>
	I would like to stress very strongly that I do not see the need for 
every waitress or even one person in the restaurant at any given 
time having to be learned in the nutritional aspects of whatever the 
food products are that are being served. If someone does choose to 
inquire about what is in a food product, I would like to see that the 
written material is available and they themselves can sit down and 
make the judgment decision as to whether or not they are going to 
partake.
<P>
	Those are my main points on this subject. If this moves into a 
WHMIS type situation, it is a whole new debate because there are a 
number of problems with the WHMIS program. I would hate to see 
that kind of thing arise.
<P>
	When we get into the nitty-gritty of looking at this, it should 
move from recipes down to ingredients. There should be a definite 
stressing that the onus is on the individual. Also, the employees 
should have access to the information. They should not have to 
qualify, explain or whatever as the onus should rest with the 
individual and not the employee. If someone asks what this is, it is 
up to that individual to know what it is, not the waitress or the cook.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to comment on the speech just made by the 
Reform Party member for Surrey North.
<P>
	She seemed to have great concerns about the private member's 
bill of the member for Burlington. The member for Burlington 
wants restaurants to provide information about the content of the 
food they are serving so that people will not die from sudden shock 
which might happen with a reaction to the food.
<P>
	I was surprised that the member for Surrey North was not more 
sensitive. She said that putting too much responsibility on 
restaurants is what our colleague wants. On the other hand, she said 
that we cannot expect restaurants to save someone's life if the 
person goes into a food reaction shock, that the onus is on the 
individual. I would suggest it is the responsibility of the restaurants 
to know what their products are all about because the lives of their 
clients might be at stake.
<P>
	The member for Surrey North also suggested that we should 
have more statistics in order to justify this bill. This is awful. 
Should we have one death, 100 deaths or 1,000 deaths in Surrey, 
B.C., or should it be in Montreal?
<P>
	People want to know what is in food.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> That is not what she said.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7213"> 7213 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> I hear some members from the Reform Party 
stating that I am a little silly in my presentation. They do not want 
restaurants providing information to clients, obviously. They feel 
that in order to make all the employees knowledgeable of the food 
content would be an overstatement and an exaggeration of a 
commitment.
<P>
	The member also stated that restaurants would be giving away 
trade secrets.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Eugene, at least tell the truth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> Obviously, I must be hitting a sore spot with the 
Reform Party since I am being heckled from the other side. They 
would like to protect the trade secrets of Kentucky fried chicken. 
Imagine that, 11 herbs. We do not want to know about the herbs, we 
want to know about the contents which could create a reaction, 
certain nuts for example. We do not want to know the secrets, we 
want to know the contents which could create a reaction.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	I hope there are more opposition MPs who will support this bill 
at least in principle.
<P>
	People who pay for food should receive good food. They should 
be able to get information about the food they receive. I commend 
the hon. member for Burlington for her very sensitive approach to 
this problem.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it has turned into a rather lively session this morning.
<P>
	Before we go any further, I want to say that the member opposite 
completely misrepresented the hon. member for Surrey North. I am 
really sorry when that happens in the House. If we do not have 
honesty between us, we have nothing. We have to treat each other 
with decency and respect. The hon. member for Surrey North 
actually supported the bill with caution. I am sure that every one of 
us has enough good sense to say that when we hear it. It upsets me. 
It has bothered me since I have come to this House.
<P>
	Bill C-309 which the hon. member for Burlington put forward, if 
implemented would require restaurant owners to ensure that 
reliable information regarding the ingredients in menu items was 
readily available to food allergy sufferers. In essence that is 
needed. I do not think any of us could argue with that. We need to 
make informed decisions. That is what it comes down to.
<P>
	The bill does not seek mandatory labelling. I know a bit about 
that because I have put forward a bill which does seek mandatory 
labelling, not in this case but in others. The concern here is one of 
awareness. The consumer must be aware of the contents of food, 
especially if they have a health problem. I would agree with the 
hon. member for Surrey North that those knowing they have an 
allergy or a health problem must  also be held responsible. When I 
say that I am referring to something which happened.
<P>
	It had nothing to do with food allergies, but had to do with 
McDonald's being sued because someone spilled hot coffee on 
them. The person who ordered the coffee spilled it. The legal claim 
awarded was absolutely ridiculous. It appears that none of us is 
responsible any more when we order a cup of coffee. If it is too hot, 
we can blame the restaurant. This is what I am concerned about. 
This is what might appear to be wrong.
<P>
	The hon. member for Burlington said that restaurant owners and 
their staff will take the responsibility for the food they serve. 
Indeed, I would hope they would be willing to do so. However, the 
legal ramifications of that statement are what I am concerned about 
in light of what happened with the hot coffee which was spilled at 
McDonald's. That was absolutely ridiculous. Restaurants across 
the country are now afraid to serve hot coffee. That is a word of 
caution.
<P>
	The responsibility has to lie with the person who has the allergy, 
the one who suffers. I agree with the hon. member for Surrey 
North. If those people could be handed a binder or something, as 
suggested by the hon. member for Burlington, it would be all 
written down. That would stop the legal responsibility and the onus 
would then be on the person who suffers with the allergy. That 
change might help. I am not sure how the hon. member for 
Burlington feels about that.
<P>
	I agree with the hon. member for Burlington that ground nuts, 
peanut oil, ground almonds and ground hazelnuts are used in all of 
these things. Let us face it, they are flavourful, they are tasty and 
most of us enjoy the products which contain them. That being the 
case, I would like to express my other thoughts.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	I do not think it is a surprise to anyone here that I am very 
concerned about where we are heading today with our food chain. I 
am not the only one who has grave concerns. On the weekend I 
watched three different television programs which dealt with it.
<P>
	The member for Burlington spoke about informed decisions. 
That is what I am concerned about. I have two bills before the 
House. One concerns labelling any product that contains the 
hormone rbGH or rBST. That means all food products. If Canada 
starts to use injections of rBST, we will find that our butter, cheese, 
yogurt and our milk will also contain it. That is one of my major 
concerns. The other one is that we label any food product which is 
tampered with genetically. If there is biotechnology involved then 
it should say so on the label. It does not have to say exactly what it 
is. That is not necessary. But it must let the consumer know. Why?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7214"> 7214 </A></B>
<P>
	Today we have the flavour saver tomato which apparently has 
a longer shelf life. By tampering with it, we no longer have a 
tomato as we know it and we do not know what the results of this 
may be over a long period.
<P>
	Salmon in B.C. are also being engineered genetically, 
interestingly enough with fish genes. A scientist who spoke on the 
weekend said that some of the side effects are that those fish are 
aggressive feeders. If they are aggressive feeders and are released 
into the wild, it is not unlikely that we would see the demise of our 
natural salmon because they are not aggressive feeders.
<P>
	We are looking at things in canola and soybeans. Vegetarians 
across the country are very concerned about the soybean which is 
being tampered with.
<P>
	When do we as parliamentarians become responsible to our 
constituents? When do we make ourselves aware of all these 
changes and do something about it? This is not a light subject. Let 
me say to every member in the House that this is a very serious 
subject.
<P>
	I recently watched ``Jurassic Park''. I am not a movie goer, but I 
picked it up on TV this past weekend. It was not very scary to me, 
but what alarmed me was the suggestion of change in science. The 
question I am sure everyone got out of that movie was not can we 
do it, but should we do it? I am suggesting to the House that those 
of us who feel that the people who are concerned about these things 
are way to the left had better rethink where they stand. We had 
better be responsible for these changes, because if as elected 
members of this legislature we are not responsible, who is? If it is 
not up to us to let our constituents know when things are 
happening, who is it up to?
<P>
	When I came to the House I did not know anything about rBST. I 
looked into it. People on both sides of the House told me not to 
worry, that there was nothing to it. Fortunately, I did not stop there. 
I visited universities. I visited with Professor Joseph Cummins. I 
took the time to find out about something I did not know about. As 
a result I found that rBST may be very harmful, and I say it may be.
<P>
	In the United States the FDA has already approved it. Although a 
group of Wisconsin farmers is fighting very hard to keep their milk 
products labelled ``no rBST''. They are in the courts with this right 
now. And we have lifted the moratorium in Canada, but is our 
health body going to say at some time that it is okay to inject our 
cows?
<P>
	I read something from Joseph Cummins this morning. He says 
that such concerns are not as grave as those related to new findings 
showing that rbGH treatment stimulates the cow to produce insulin 
like growth hormone, the IGF-1 factor, which stimulates the 
growth of cells. He says that contrary to official claims, IGF-1 in 
milk is not destroyed in the human digestive system. Excessive 
IGF-1 causes a condition called gigantism accompanied by 
tumours of the colon. Tumours of the colon. Do we treat that 
lightly? The hormone also prevents programmed cell dealt leading 
to tumour growth. Insulin resistance leading to diabetes may follow 
excess IGF-1 exposure.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	Ralph Kazer has suggested that IGF-1 exposure at high levels 
during fetal life and during puberty may imprint the female with 
abnormal IGF-1 sensitivity. That activity is believed to play a 
significant role in the development of breast cancer. We all know 
the number of people who are dying of breast cancer every year in 
our country. It is suggested that the IGF-1 causes too much cell 
division at critical times during breast development.
<P>
	The bill put forward by the hon. member for Burlington is 
important in the fact that she is telling us of one very serious factor 
occurring right now in our society. I am suggesting that we cannot 
look at it in isolation because we are being hit every day with a 
group of them.
<P>
	What about safety and health issues in biotechnology? This issue 
was put forward from Westech Microbes, which was charged with 
the occupational health and safety in biotechnology.
<P>
	I wonder if this bill, put forward by the hon. member for 
Burlington, could be referred to the health committee for further 
study. There are so many ramifications. As members of a 
legislature, each one of us must make sure they are dealt with 
seriously. I thank the Speaker for the time and I thank the member 
for the bill.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am happy to support Bill C-309 proposed by my colleague, the 
member for Burlington.
<P>
	The debate this morning seems to be revolving around the 
question of responsibility; that is, who is responsible when a person 
dies of anaphylactic shock based on a food allergy. The proposer of 
the bill is suggesting that the responsibility be charged.
<P>
	I do not think there is any attempt to say that the person with the 
allergy or that person's parents are trying to shun their 
responsibility at all. The problem is that in many cases they cannot 
accept the responsibility fully because they do not have the tools 
with which to exercise that responsibility.
<P>
	This bill is simply an attempt to give individuals in our society 
the tools with which to solve their problem in a responsible way. To 
that end we have support in the community of 100,000 people who 
have suggested that indeed they want the collective responsibility 
of the Government of Canada to be shown through some legislation 
that would require people who serve food for a living to equip the 
people with allergies with the information they need.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7215"> 7215 </A></B>
<P>
	It is a moderate proposal. The bill is only asking the owners 
of restaurants to ensure that servers in their restaurants take the 
questions asked to them by customers seriously. It does not require 
that every server have all the information about all the ingredients 
of the food to be served. Rather, it requires that they understand 
it is a serious question and that they refer the customer to the 
designated person in the restaurant who has the required 
information. In all cases it would be only one designated 
employee. It would be the ingredients based on chemicals and it 
would not reveal the trade secrets of the merchant. There is no 
obligation to give amounts, just the content.
<P>
	A previous speaker asked about statistics. Statistics show that 50 
people a year die but there are other victims of these situations 
when they arise. For example, a responsible restaurateur would 
want to have such a system in place because the uproar in a 
restaurant is very distressing to his other clients who are sitting at 
other tables and to his staff. To be a responsible employer and 
protect his staff and try to maintain his good reputation with his 
other customers, it would seem to me that a system, a methodology 
that would solve this problem quickly and give people the 
information they want would be advantageous to all.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	Of course we have to think about the families of these victims, 
the secondary victims. One cannot explain the depth of upset when 
a surprising event like this takes place.
<P>
	The odd thing about allergies is that not everybody who has one 
knows. Therefore the onset of an allergic reaction is sometimes a 
surprise to the victim. Those people who have had odd reactions to 
medications have experienced this sort of thing.
<P>
	We know that 35 per cent to 60 per cent of Canadians are 
avoiding certain foods because of medical reasons. They are acting 
responsibly once they know.
<P>
	In summary, this bill deserves support for some basic reasons. 
We have this ever increasing phenomena of allergies in our society, 
and 100,000 Canadians are asking that this government fulfil its 
responsibility by a piece of legislation that would provide the 
information necessary to the victims.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank hon. members 
who have intervened on this bill. They have expressed some very 
valid concerns and have raised some very important issues.
<P>
	I have to ask myself whether there is a perception out there that 
Health Canada and the Minister of Health are doing nothing. If that 
is a perception that somehow members and their constituents are 
labouring under, then perhaps we should dismiss that.
<P>
	What we want to do is take the opportunity to review some of the 
activities of the health protection branch of Health Canada and of 
the Canadian food industry in addressing the problems of food 
allergies. Health Canada is concerned about food sensitivities, as I 
believe we all are.
<P>
	Several years ago the department embarked on a national 
program of public education on the issue. The program includes 
issuing information on food allergies through various channels 
such as the medical profession, the provincial ministries of health 
and education.
<P>
	Health Canada has also recognized the importance of consumer 
education in dealing with allergies and has produced fact sheets on 
sulphites and monosodium glutamate, known as MSG. These fact 
sheets are available to the food industry and to consumers. They 
provide information on what these substances are, why they can be 
a problem for some people and how consumers can avoid these 
substances. As I say, they are available to everybody, people in the 
industry, in restaurants and consumers.
<P>
	Representatives of Health Canada have consulted with 
organizations such as the Allergy-Asthma Information Association 
and the Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology to 
obtain their input on the extent of the problem of adverse reactions 
related to food.
<P>
	Based on the results of these meetings, allergens associated with 
frequent or severe adverse reactions were identified. 
Representatives of the health protection branch at Health Canada 
have consulted with representatives of the food industry and the 
food service industry about implementing a mechanism to supply 
the consumer with information on the presence of reaction causing 
substances.
<P>
	The seriousness of the problem of adverse reactions was quickly 
grasped by the food service industry and it began to develop a 
comprehensive plan to address this issue among its membership. In 
fact, in November 1991 the Canadian Restaurant and Food Services 
Association introduced a voluntary program entitled ``Allergy 
Aware''. In this program the participating outlets displayed an 
``Allergy Aware'' symbol in their windows and a poster inside the 
facility explaining the program.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Torsney:</B> Sometimes employees do not know.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> We have not taken a survey of every single employee 
in every single service industry but maybe the member might want 
to do that.
<P>
	Each establishment provides ingredient information through one 
or more of the following: a food allergy and sensitivity chart, 
complete ingredient information on three or more main menu 
items, and/or complete ingredient information on three or more 
prepackaged meals.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7216"> 7216 </A></B>
<P>
	In addition, a senior staff member on each shift is responsible 
for inquiries from patrons and has direct access to recipes and the 
kitchen staff.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	This program is not just limited to providing information to 
allergy sufferers. The program also provides information on foods 
commonly associated with intolerance reactions such as those 
experienced by some individuals to lactose or gluten. The program 
has proven to be very popular and has received a considerable 
degree of approval from the restaurant clientele and individuals 
with sensitivities. This program is a first in the world and has been 
acknowledged in the prestigious <I>New England Journal of 
Medicine</I>.
<P>
	We have taken additional initiatives at Health Canada. They 
include a contribution to the development of an educational video 
on the problems of food sensitivities for use in training workers in 
food service establishments. This contribution entailed financial 
resources as well as expert advice and spokespersons to appear on 
the video.
<P>
	Regulatory amendments have been passed to require the specific 
identification of peanut oil on prepackaged foods. Amendments 
have also been proposed to require the label declaration of 
sulphites on alcoholic beverages.
<P>
	A third item is Health Canada has established a system of 
recording adverse reactions to food, food ingredients or food 
additives. Based on the information available to date it would 
appear that the incidence of adverse reactions to food in the general 
population is low. It should be at zero.
<P>
	Through this recording system the department has been able to 
identify very specific areas where a regulatory response is 
appropriate. For instance, due to the potential severity of these 
adverse reactions to certain allergens such as sulphite, Health 
Canada has taken action to minimize such reactions in susceptible 
individuals.
<P>
	Since salad bars were identified as the major source of adverse 
reactions to sulphites, Health Canada has amended the regulations 
to prohibit the use of sulphite on all fresh fruit and vegetables, 
except grapes, sold or served raw to consumers. Health Canada is 
supportive of all efforts aimed at alleviating the problems of 
individuals who have adverse reactions to foods.
<P>
	The department will continue its educational thrust to assist 
consumers on the seriousness of such adverse reactions and to offer 
guidance to affected consumers as well as food operators.
<P>
	Bill C-309 is intended I think to assist those who are afflicted by 
sensitivities to food or food ingredients, but we must also bear in 
mind the wide range of programs and activities already in place. 
Additionally, we find ourselves in an era when the government is 
trying to reduce the number of regulations affecting various  
industries in Canada and we must count the cost any additional 
regulations may place on the food service industry. While that is 
legitimate I want to remind all members that Health Canada at no 
time is going to engage in that kind of activity at the expense of the 
health of Canadians. It is important that members understand that.
<P>
	We believe that the programs in place now should be given a 
chance to develop and produce meaningful results in assisting 
those who are subject adverse reactions to foods.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I thank you for your attention and for that of the 
members who have contributed to this debate.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Burlington may 
under our standing orders sum up the debate. She has about three or 
four minutes to do that.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Torsney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to make sure that everyone 
understands that people are asking to take the responsibility 
themselves. Again, the issue is that they are not being given the 
tools to take responsibility.
<P>
	In fact, I have been there many times over many years where 
people are laughed at or told no, there is no coconut in something 
when there clearly is coconut in something. This is not a joking 
matter. It is life and death. Fifty Canadians or more die every year.
<P>
	The program that the parliamentary secretary has mentioned has 
been in place for some five years. At the time when it was done the 
manual said ``take this seriously, folks, or we are going to have 
legislation''. Here we are five years later, 250 more dead Canadians 
at least, and the government is not taking it seriously.
<P>
	I challenge the parliamentary secretary to go with me to each and 
every restaurant within five miles of here and I doubt if we could 
even find one individual who knew that there was an allergy 
awareness program or knew what it meant. I was talking to a fellow 
who was serving roast beef. That has nothing to do with nuts. He 
could not figure out what it meant. This is a serious issue. People 
are asking for a tool.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	I find it ironic, since the most common and the most deadly 
allergen is peanuts, that the only time the parliamentary secretary 
mentioned peanuts was with respect to peanut oil in packaged 
foods. We are talking about restaurants. We are talking about food 
service establishments which play with our lives each and every 
day. They are not giving us something we use externally. They are 
giving us something we use internally. This is serious. Give us the 
tools to make educated decisions.
<P>
	Thirty-five per cent to 60 per cent of Canadians today are trying 
to avoid a substance in their food for a medical reason. It is not for 
cosmetic purposes. It is not for fun. It is not because they do not 
like it. It is because it is life threatening.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7217"> 7217 </A></B>
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary is right that the minister takes this 
issue seriously. We are trying to work on additional initiatives 
together. However, it is not enough and it is not fast enough. Hon. 
members have an opportunity today to make a change for the 
benefit of all Canadians.
<P>
	Restaurant owners must tell their employees that this is a serious 
issue. They must take it seriously and they must designate an 
employee or write the ingredients in a binder. The customer must 
be told: ``This is serious. If this is life and death for you, you can 
make a decision by looking at this information or by checking out 
these packages''.
<P>
	It is not about disclosing recipes or quantities, it is about finding 
out if there is a hazelnut in the food or if the food has been near a 
hazelnut. It is about finding out whether it has been cooked in 
peanut oil. It is about finding out about sulphates and lactose and 
gluten, as the parliamentary secretary mentioned. It is about 
people's lives each and every day. It is about the Christian Taylors 
of this world who do not have the opportunity to ask those 
questions and who pay with their lives as a consequence of 
sometimes uncaring employees or people who do not realize the 
risks involved.
<P>
	I ask hon. members once again for unanimous consent to make 
this a votable item. I would like the government to work in concert 
with employers and food service establishments across this country 
in ensuring that consumers have basic information.
<P>
	We have not even begun to talk about the cost to our health care 
providers and the medical system to treat these cases. A physician 
called me to say that three times he has had to bring his child to the 
emergency ward of the hospital. A physician cannot even get 
accurate information for his child because restaurant servers do not 
take the issue seriously. Some of them are working very hard. They 
have a lot of things to juggle. They have to ensure that the right 
order gets to the right place. However, there should be someone 
who can say: ``Table No. 6 has a child with a peanut allergy. How 
do we make sure this poor child does not die while in our 
restaurant?''
<P>
	The hon. member for Oakville-Milton was absolutely correct. 
Surely owners should care whether someone is dying in their 
establishment. They should care what their patrons think about 
eating in their establishments. That has not happened.
<P>
	It is costing money. It is costing lives. It is a simple matter of 
creating a preventive program which will ensure that people have 
access to information so they can take responsibility for their own 
lives.
<P>
	Again I seek the unanimous consent of the House to make this a 
votable item. I thank all parties for supporting me in this initiative. 
Reform members, BQ members and my Liberal colleagues have 
been supportive  in developing this legislation. If this is not made a 
votable item, even if it is the parliamentary secretary's job to 
ensure it is not, we can at least know that the public has had an
<P>
opportunity to hear more about this very serious issue. Perhaps it 
will prevent some children and adults from not meeting a horrible 
fate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time provided for the consideration 
of Private Members' Business has now expired, and this item is 
dropped from the Order Paper.

	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (for the Leader of the Government in the 
House of Commons, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House take note of the fifth report of the Standing Committee on Finance 
presented to the House on Thursday, December 5, 1996.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Peterson (Willowdale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to have this opportunity to speak on the basis of our report. 
I intend to speak on a number of things. First, I will look at 
Canada's economic record over the last three years. Second, I will 
look at some of the difficulties we faced as a finance committee in 
making the difficult decisions needed to make our 
recommendations for the next budget. I will then go through some 
of the decisions we did take and then conclude.
<P>
	Looking back over the last three years, the financial record of the 
government and the Minister of Finance is truly remarkable. When 
we took office, Canada's debt was at $500 billion. Combined with 
the provincial debts of $188 billion, every single Canadian, man, 
woman and child, owed $24,000.
<P>
	When we took office the deficit was $42 billion. In his three 
budgets, the Minister of Finance has taken us from that $42 billion, 
or 6 per cent of our gross domestic product, down to a figure well 
below 3 per cent of our gross domestic product. In his economic 
statement to the House of Commons, the finance minister said that 
by the year 1998-99, the deficit will be down to 1 per cent of gross 
domestic product or $9 billion.
<P>
	When this figure is achieved it will no longer be necessary for 
the government to borrow from the markets to fund its annual 
deficit. This will mean that the deficit will be balanced in the eyes 
of every other country in the world because they go on the basis of 
financial requirements as opposed to the national accounts that we 
have pursued.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7218"> 7218 </A></B>
<P>
	Part of this has been achieved through low interest rates. 
Because of the minister's fiscal responsibility, Canada has been 
able to lower its interest rates 20 times since March 1995. Interest 
rates have come down by five full percentage points. It started 
off two and a half percentage points higher than the Americans 
on the short end. It is now two and a quarter points lower for short 
term bonds and debt instruments. We are also equal to or less than 
the Americans going out to 10-year bonds.
<P>
	Foreign borrowing requirements, which were the highest of the 
G-7 when we took office, are now being brought under control. 
This means that a degree of economic sovereignty has been 
reintroduced into the fiscal process. International financial markets 
will dictate to us less and less in terms of what Canada can and 
cannot do. This is so important in giving us the options for the 
future to set our economic agenda.
<P>
	Over this period of time economic growth has increased. The 
Bank of Canada now recognizes that next year the economic 
growth rate will be 4 per cent or greater. This will be the fastest rate 
of economic growth of any of the G-7 countries.
<P>
	In spite of all of this good news, one of the very difficult and 
agonizing facts of life is that unemployment is still very high at 10 
per cent. If members from every side of the House could have one 
wish, I am sure it would be to see that every Canadian who wants a 
good job has a good job.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	What is our record in spite of this very sobering fact about 
unemployment? Over the past three years, Canada has created 
644,000 net new jobs. This is not to be scoffed at. This is at the 
same time that the federal and provincial governments have been 
going through incredible downsizing and unfortunately having to 
lay off public servants.
<P>
	When we look at the record of 644,000 new jobs, what has 
happened in other countries in the world? Those 644,000 new jobs 
created in Canada is 87,000 jobs more than the four European 
members of the G-7, more than Germany, England, France and 
Italy combined over the same period of time.
<P>
	The growth in jobs in the United States has been about 
comparable to that of Canada. We still have a huge gap. Therefore 
the finance committee of the House of Commons asked Professor 
Andrew Sharpe to come before us because of the work he had done 
in putting together a number of research papers and economic 
thinkers in this area.
<P>
	He explained to us that the Canada-U.S. unemployment gap can 
be explained as follows. Seventeen per cent of it is definitional 
because United States does not count passive job seekers. Eight per 
cent of it is because the U.S. has about four times as many people 
incarcerated in jails and prisons. Naturally, these  are going to be 
the people with the lower educational levels and the ones who 
would not likely fit as readily into the job market. That accounts for 
25 per cent.
<P>
	Fifty per cent of it is because of the cyclical weakness in the 
Canadian economy and the output gap we have vis-à-vis the United 
States. The remaining 25 per cent, he explained, was largely due to 
structural differences, namely higher benefits for the unemployed 
and second, different immigration policies.
<P>
	We do not take any consolation from this because we realize that 
what we have to do is get more and more Canadians back to work. 
This has to be our major priority and preoccupation.
<P>
	How can we best do this? We are seeing how the low interest 
rates are now creating incredible benefits for Canadians. We are 
seeing how the decrease in interest rates have resulted in a saving 
to a homeowner on a $100,000 mortgage of $3,600 a year.
<P>
	We have seen how this decrease in interest has resulted in a 
decrease in the cost to a person buying a car on time of $525 a year. 
That is a $15,000 car. This decline in interest rates has resulted in 
savings to a business person who is borrowing $1 million a year of 
$34,000.
<P>
	It is critical to the economic progress, to the increase in the 
growth rate and to job creation to maintain a course of monetary 
and fiscal policy that will ensure low interest rates. Nothing can do 
more to help create jobs in the future.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	Over this period of time we have been in office, the Minister of 
Finance has had a record of achievement unparalleled in my 
generation not only in terms of the things I have talked about but in 
meeting his deficit targets and reintroducing a sense of credibility 
into the office of the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	In the past, deficit targets had not been met. They never were. 
They were done on a five year rolling target basis where 
governments typically put off the difficult decisions until the fourth 
and fifth years. On the other hand, our minister has stuck to the two 
year rolling targets and in every year has not only met his deficit 
target but has surpassed it. His last deficit target of some $32 
billion for 1995-96 he surpassed by more than $4 billion.
<P>
	We in the Finance committee had to deal with the issue of what 
we do now that we are in a surplus position vis-a-vis our deficit 
targets. We had three alternatives. One was to use these surpluses to 
further reduce the deficit and eventually perhaps start to pay down 
our enormous and growing debt load.
<P>
	The second one which many people called for was to introduce at 
this time a major tax cut. We had many suggestions as to what the 
tax cut should be.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7219"> 7219 </A></B>
<P>
	A third option, urged on us by many, was to increase 
expenditure programs. One big item where we were called upon 
to increase expenditures, including by the official opposition, was 
in transfer payments to provinces.
<P>
	We wrestled with all the options that were open to us and we felt 
that on balance we have come up with an approach which is 
balanced. We must above all else continue to finish the job of 
meeting and surpassing our deficit targets. But because we do have 
a little room to manoeuvre and subject to an update of economic 
circumstances before the next budget, we have suggested targeting 
six different areas. Those selected target areas were selected based 
on our Canada wide consultations, listening to Canadians and 
hearing their priorities, and also as members of Parliament 
listening to what we have heard in our constituencies and from our 
own colleagues.
<P>
	The six areas we have chosen to target for action in the 
forthcoming budget, all within the context of finishing the jobs we 
have started, are the following.
<P>
	First, children and poverty. We have suggested that the working 
income supplement might be increased in order to target the 
children of the working poor. Families that are among the working 
poor, as we heard before our committee, often have benefits of 
$3,000 a year less than those who are on social welfare. This 
creates the welfare wall, a disincentive for those on social welfare 
benefits to go into the workplace.
<P>
	Second, we have targeted Canadians with disabilities. Over the 
past number of years, decades, the benefits going to those with a 
disability have eroded mainly because of the lack of indexation.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	A wonderful job was done by the hon. member for 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury and his task force in identifying the 
increased cost that people who have a disability suffer simply 
because of that disability, increased costs which can prevent them 
from becoming active members of Canada's economy. We have 
called for modest measures to help recognize the added costs of 
those with disabilities.
<P>
	Third is the area of literacy. We were shocked to learn in our 
deliberations that 42 per cent of Canadians do not possess the 
literacy skills necessary to deal with basic reading material such as 
newspapers. Even more shocking, only 22 per cent of Canadians 
have the highest literacy skills which are required in the new 
knowledge based economy of the future.
<P>
	We owe a great deal of credit to Senator Joyce Fairbairn who 
established the Secretariat for Literacy which mobilizes thousands 
upon thousands every year to deal with this issue of literacy. We 
have called for substantial increases in its small budget which is 
only $22.3 million.
<P>
	Fourth, we have asked that consideration be given to helping 
students who are bearing highly increased costs to get their own 
education. We have suggested three income tax measures which 
could help recognize the increased costs of tuition and attending a 
post-secondary institution.
<P>
	Fifth, one of the great reasons that we have this huge 
unemployment gap with the United States is, as Dr. Andrew Sharpe 
pointed out, the problem of our output. It is basically a question of 
productivity. Since the 1980s Canadian productivity has not gone 
up and this is the major reason for our high unemployment.
<P>
	One of the reasons we have not had this increase in productivity 
is that Canada does not fare well by international standards when it 
comes to our level of research and development. We feel it is 
important to target research and development and science and 
technology at this time. We have called for three different 
measures.
<P>
	The first is to renew the program which funds the Networks of 
Centres of Excellence. According to George Connell, who 
appeared before us, this program for the Networks of Centres of 
Excellence is the most effective instrument yet discovered for 
capturing the benefits of academic research for the advantage of the 
Canadian economy; universities and businesses collaborating on a 
nationwide basis to apply our basic research and get it 
commercialized.
<P>
	Second, we have called for increases to Canada's three granting 
councils. These are the Medical Research Council, the humanities 
council and the NSERC, the engineering council and science and 
council. They grant moneys to post-secondary graduate students in 
our universities to help them do their research on a post-doctrine 
basis. It is one of the most effective programs we have for ensuring 
that we have highly educated people here in Canada who do stay 
here to do their graduate work and hopefully afterward.
<P>
	Third, we have called for a new type of infrastructure program.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	Infrastructure one was good. Six billion dollars was mobilized in 
the three levels of government to replace wasting infrastructure at 
the municipal level. This was a concrete and mortar type of 
program. We of course cannot afford that type at this time.
<P>
	We have said we should have a new type of infrastructure 
investment in our future going into our research and development 
facilities of our universities, hospitals and other research 
institutions. The Government of Canada would put up one-third 
and another one-third could come from the other levels of 
government or the private sector. This is the type of infrastructure 
that would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7220"> 7220 </A></B>
<P>
create short term jobs during the building, yes, but even more 
important, it would give rise to an expanded base for R and D in 
Canada and the creation of those long term jobs which conduce to 
our productivity and our economic future.
<P>
	The sixth area where we have asked the government to target in 
the next budget is the voluntary and charitable sectors. We have 
had enormous cutbacks over the past three years. We realize that 
many Canadians have seen their programs diminished. Many 
Canadians have suffered as a result of that. We take no joy in that.
<P>
	However, at the same time, we have seen a renewed commitment 
by the voluntary sector to help make this a better and stronger 
country. Over six million Canadians every year volunteer their time 
and efforts to help their fellow Canadians. This amounts to about a 
billion hours of contribution in terms of work. That is the 
equivalent of 617,000 full time workers or 5 per cent of all jobs in 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> At what salary?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peterson:</B> At zero salary, contributing their knowledge, 
their time and their efforts to help their fellow Canadians.
<P>
	At the government level we have had to cut back because of 
economic necessity. We are now calling on the government to 
increase the tax incentives available for charitable donations in 
order to help these voluntary organizations and charitable agencies. 
They impact so vigorously on the lives of each one of us.
<P>
	We have looked at a number of proposals. We have 10 
recommendations. Some are designed to help the major 
foundations and our major institutions in health and the arts get 
some endowment funding, but they also apply right down to the 
United Way and the smaller charities; enhanced tax incentives 
which we believe will not be costly but will help to mobilize the 
funds to enable the voluntary and charitable sectors to do those 
thing which government no longer can do.
<P>
	Having discussed these six priorities, children in poverty, the 
disabled, literacy, students, research and development and the 
charitable and voluntary sectors, let me go back to talk a little about 
our tax levels in general. There were many people who came before 
us and told us that we had to reduce their payroll taxes and income 
taxes.
<P>
	Since 1980 Canada's overall level of taxation in relation to the 
size of our economy has gone up about 20 per cent, whereas in the 
United States it has remained fairly constant. Overall now we are 
about in the middle of the G-7 countries in spending, with 35.4 per 
cent of our GDP coming from taxes. In the United States, however, 
this figure is 27.6 per cent, 30 per cent lower than in Canada. This 
is the group we have to compete with because 80 per cent of our 
trade and investment is with the Americans.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	When we look at the individual taxes, in Canada our personal 
income tax rates are 13.4 per cent of GDP whereas in the United 
States they are 9.8 per cent. We are significantly higher in terms of 
personal taxes. In terms of corporate taxes, our level is just the 
same, 2.5 per cent of GDP. In terms of payroll taxes, we are 
actually below where the Americans are. We are at 6.1 per cent of 
GDP and they are at 7 per cent.
<P>
	With respect to the necessity for being competitive in terms of 
job creation, our corporate taxes are comparable to those in the 
United States in terms of overall levels and our payroll taxes are 
actually lower. This is one of the reasons we cannot conclude at this 
time that we actually need a cut in payroll taxes in order to be 
competitive. What we have done-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Their taxes are 30 per cent lower.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peterson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be happy to talk to the hon. 
member from Calgary afterward and respond to his concerns. I am 
always delighted to hear from him.
<P>
	Look at what we have already done in terms of payroll taxes 
even though we have a lower level of payroll taxes than the United 
States. Since we have been in office, we have taken six major 
reductions in those payroll taxes.
<P>
	We reduced the statutory formula which would have taken us 
from $3 to $3.30 and we held it at $3. We reduced the rate from $3 
to $2.95 in 1996. Just recently the minister announced that it was 
going from $2.95 to $2.90. Every time we reduce it a nickel, it 
costs us $350 million. We reduced the maximum insurable 
earnings from $875 to $750, again for monstrous savings. In 
December 1995 we gave premium relief for small businesses and 
we extended that again last year. The sum of these six reductions 
has been to reduce payroll taxes by some $4 billion since we have 
come to office.
<P>
	We recognize there is a surplus building in terms of employment 
insurance. We recognized that but we said that because of our 
priorities in order to be competitive we do not have to further 
reduce the payroll taxes or the corporate taxes because when we 
combine them they are already lower than those in the United 
States.
<P>
	Where we have really high levels is in terms of our personal 
income taxes. We heard from the scientific community and the 
high tech community how these high levels of taxes in Canada are 
hurting us. We have heard, and the finance critic for the Reform 
Party has mentioned this many times, that Canadians with an 
income over $50,000 constitute 10 per cent of tax filers but they 
pay 50 per cent of the taxes. We also heard that a single wage 
earner earning $6,500 is also on the tax rolls.
<P>
	Our priority as a committee was to say that because our personal 
income taxes are out of line, in the future when we might be able to 
afford cuts, which we cannot afford today and we did not
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7221"> 7221 </A></B>
<P>
recommend them for today, our priority for tax cuts would be in 
terms of personal income taxes. What did we recommend in our 
majority report? Apart from targeting the six priority areas I 
mentioned, we called for minor tax reductions.
<P>
	Again this year as last year we called for income averaging for 
people whose income fluctuates significantly from year to year and 
they suffer a tax penalty, people such as artists and writers. We 
have called for extending the deduction for medical and dental 
benefits to those who are self-employed. We called for abolishing 
the tax on jewellery, the 10 per cent excise tax and we looked at 
some other measures such as ones dealing with heritage property 
and the high cost of mechanics tools for those who are required to 
purchase them before they can get a job in a garage.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	We called for tax increases as we did last year in terms of 
tobacco. We want those taxes on tobacco products to go up just as 
quickly and as often as circumstances relating to smuggling will 
permit. We know it is a deterrent to the iniquities of smoking. We 
have called for a tax on lotteries, a 15 per cent withholding tax on 
winnings from government run lotteries of anything over $600, as 
we did last year. We have also asked that the government consider a 
few other measures.
<P>
	We recognize that big businesses are not going to be the job 
creators of the future in Canada. Job creation will largely fall on 
our small and medium size enterprises. We are still concerned 
about the role of our financial institutions in providing financing 
for small business start-up, equity and operating capital. We are 
pleased to note that this year, due largely to blandishments from the 
Minister of Finance and from the industry committee, the banks 
have taken very seriously their role of providing funding to small 
businesses. I compliment the banks on the number of steps they 
have taken in this area.
<P>
	We have seen a tremendous blossoming of the labour sponsored 
venture capital fund. There is now $3 billion available to help small 
businesses get started, to expand and create jobs. We urge those 
who cannot get money from traditional lenders to take a look at this 
fund.
<P>
	We are pleased that the business development bank has extra 
capital of $350 million. We were pleased that a group we 
recognized last year, the Calmeadow foundation, under the 
leadership of Martin Connell has increased its efforts to lend 
money to the small entrepreneur. We call it micro lending. It is for 
the person who needs $3,000 or $5,000 to get into a business. We 
commend these efforts and the steps taken in concert with our 
financial institutions to try to institutionalize this type of initiative, 
to take it beyond just the simple efforts of Calmeadow. This means 
co-operation with the banks.
<P>
	Our finance committee recognized in its report on financial 
institutions which was tabled in this House in October, that it would 
be very helpful to consumers and small and medium size 
businesses if we increased competition. We have asked that 
Canada's doors be opened wide to foreign lending institutions, that 
the administrative barriers be removed. This will help meet the 
future needs of our small businesses.
<P>
	We have also said that one of the biggest bangs for the buck we 
can get is through encouraging foreign direct investment in 
Canada. We recommended this last year and the government has 
taken steps. I understand there are now about 15 individuals 
working directly on this.
<P>
	Studies done by KPMG Peat Marwick Thorne and others have 
shown that cities right across Canada have a competitive edge over 
American cities as places for new foreign direct investment. We 
have to get this message out to the big companies and investors 
right around the world. We recommend expanding these efforts to 
attract direct foreign investment in Canada which would create jobs 
here. We have such an incredible product to sell.
<P>
	We heard from many Canadians, not just those in the voluntary 
and charitable sectors, who are making a tremendous difference in 
the lives of Canadians. There is one person in particular who came 
before us, Mr. Charles Pielsticker from Toronto.
<P>
	A couple of years ago Mr. Pielsticker realized that business was 
not getting involved with our educational institutions so he formed 
the Learning Partnership which is funded basically by business 
contributions. It is doing many things, for example taking kids to 
work for a day, which involves hundreds of thousands of kids and 
their parents; and having volunteers work with teachers in public 
schools to help them teach science. This type of thing is all done on 
a voluntary basis.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	A woman who is doing the same type of thing also appeared 
before us. It is another voluntary organization which teaches 
science to teachers to make it particularly interesting for their 
students. Again, it was another volunteer driven organization. We 
commend these people for the type of leadership they are giving us.
<P>
	We heard considerable cries for Canada to increase the payments 
for transfers to the provinces. This came from the official 
opposition. Part of the cutbacks we have had to do unfortunately 
fell in the areas of post-secondary education, health care and 
helping those who are on welfare. Like everything, they had to be 
cut or we would not have got to our targets.
<P>
	It was our finance committee having listened to Canadians a year 
and a half ago said that we cannot cut all the cash transfers, we have 
to have a minimum cash base in order that we can as a federal 
government ensure the five principles of the Canada Health Act are 
adhered to. We saw how the Minister for Human Resources  
Development went across the country talking to his provincial 
counterparts to try to get agreement on the principles that underlie 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7222"> 7222 </A></B>
<P>
the CHST to the provinces, the transfers for health care, welfare 
and post-secondary education.
<P>
	As Judith Maxwell who appeared before our committee said, we 
can no longer impose these federal standards unilaterally. We have 
to work in dialogue and in co-operation with the provinces. This is 
what she called the management of our interdependence. We 
encourage the government in its efforts to do this. This is so 
important, particularly in terms of the Canada Health Act because 
we all know that health is critical to Canadians but good health is 
also good for our economic future.
<P>
	Tax harmonization was an incredible theme we heard going right 
back to the summer when we met with people working with the 
task force headed by Dr. Jack Mintz. He was appointed by the 
minister to look at our business taxation to see if it was 
competitive.
<P>
	We heard in testimony before us how one corporation with four 
affiliates had to file 1,100 pages of tax returns. This is insane. Why 
should we have provincial and federal income tax, capital taxes, 
sales taxes, excise taxes and different payroll deductions, different 
administrations, different tax laws and different enforcement 
officers going in?
<P>
	Canadians said: ``We are only 30 million, we cannot afford it as 
taxpayers. We cannot afford it as companies that have to comply. 
Get your act together. You are politicians. You can agree on similar 
harmonized laws in all these areas. We expect you to. We expect 
nothing less of you. We do not want these petty jurisdictional turf 
wars''. This is why we want a national securities commission. Why 
do we need 11 or 13 different jurisdictions dealing with securities 
in this country?
<P>
	We heard from Canada's cultural industries. Our cultural 
industries employ one million Canadians. They contribute $30 
billion to our gross domestic product. One of the wonderful things 
about people who are artists, performers or whatever, is that they 
do not need high paying jobs. They have found ways to cope and to 
supplement their income. To create a new job in the arts costs only 
$20,000. But these are the people who give us a raison d'etre for 
being Canadian. They are the ones that give us the heart and soul of 
what we are. We cannot do without our culture.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	We encourage the government to look at a number of the 
measures we have suggested. In particular, we feel that the 
recommendation for vastly enhanced tax incentives for charitable 
donations are the ones which will impact very directly on the 
cultural industries and will give them the multi-year stable funding 
they need in order to plan for the future.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to thank all members of the committee 
from all parties who worked so co-operatively. I thank the 
incredible staff of the House of Commons who arranged the 
meetings, the researchers, the person who advises on the text, Mr. 
David Abbott, people in our offices who worked with us.
<P>
	Mostly I would like to thank Canadians. The last three to four 
years have not been easy. We have had to cut back in order to 
restore fiscal health and to protect the programs and the way of life 
which we consider to be so important. It is Canadians who have had 
their programs cut and have been the ones who have suffered. They 
have borne with us and shown a fortitude, an acceptance and a 
generosity of spirit toward their fellow Canadians and toward one 
another in sharing the burden we have imposed.
<P>
	We must not detract from the overall goal of keeping on a sound 
monetary and fiscal track so the deficit targets are met and 
surpassed. In the meantime, because we have exceeded those 
targets to such a great extent, we believe it is good for the economic 
future but it is fundamental that we make some strategic 
investments at this time. These investments will introduce greater 
fairness into the system and are critical for a vigorous economic 
future. I am talking about investments in disadvantaged children 
and those with disabilities, in literacy, in students, in research and 
development and charitable and voluntary sectors.
<P>
	I thank members for their indulgence and I look forward to the 
debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak in the debate on 
pre-budget consultation. I will start by addressing two remarks to 
my Liberal colleague, the chair of the finance committee.
<P>
	The first is that it is very difficult for the official opposition to 
buy the compassionate speech made by the hon. member, since, for 
the past three years, this government has been trampling on the 
clientele he claims to defend on behalf of his government.
<P>
	For example, as far as assistance to students is concerned-this 
was one of the recommendations in the Liberal majority 
report-along with assistance to the sick, to the most 
disadvantaged in our society like welfare recipients and the least 
well off, and to the unemployed, as well as job creation, we have 
trouble believing the sincerity of the hon. members across the way 
for one simple reason: this clientele, the most disadvantaged, has 
been attacked by the government.
<P>
	The cuts this government has implemented in the past three 
years in the Canada social transfer were intended precisely to 
reduce transfers in the areas of social assistance, postsecondary 
education and health.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7223"> 7223 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	We judge the government not on the wish of Liberals that 
appears in the Liberal majority's report, but on the government's 
actions. In the last three years, these actions consisted in bullying 
people who are among the neediest in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	The second remark on which we can agree partly with the 
chairman of the Standing Committee on Finance concerns the 
government's performance in terms of sound management of 
public finances.
<P>
	When we compare these results to what we observed three years 
ago, there certainly are notable differences. But, we must also say 
that four factors contributed to these results, and they have nothing 
to do with the Minister of Finance's sound management. They have 
nothing to do with the government's sound management. And this 
sound management played only a minimal part.
<P>
	Four factors contributed to the situation. First, the situation in 
the U.S. When the U.S. is doing well, chances are Canada will also 
do well. In the last three years, the situation in the U.S. was 
conducive to economic growth in Canada, to an increase of 
Canadian exports to the U.S., which helped our economy.
<P>
	Second, the situation in Canada, which is clearly influenced by 
the situation in the U.S. In the last two years, the interest rates have 
dropped in a way we had not seen for years. However, this drop was 
attributable partly to the situation in the U.S. and partly to the 
problem of underemployment in Canada, where the unemployment 
rate is higher than 10 per cent, where people work less, where they 
consume less, where inflation is lower, and, consequently, where 
interest rates are lower. This is not a result of the government's 
policy.
<P>
	Third, the massive cuts in transfers to the provinces. It is easy for 
a finance minister to say: ``I am putting our fiscal house in order so 
I am not giving you any more money''. That is what this 
government and this finance minister have done. One of the largest 
contributions to the objective of putting the federal fiscal house in 
order was cutting transfers to the provinces. It gave the federal 
government some room, but it made it hard for Quebec, for 
example, to put its own fiscal house in order.
<P>
	I remind you that Bernard Landry, Deputy Premier and Minister 
of Finance, said recently-and we do not repeat it often 
enough-that if it were not for federal cuts in transfers, the Quebec 
government would not have a deficit today. It would be a zero 
deficit. It is easy to say: ``We will meet and even exceed our 
objectives''.
<P>
	Fourth, and this is not insignificant, the finance minister and his 
colleague, the chairman of the finance committee, can brag all they 
want about this excellent performance with regard to the sound 
management of public finances, but it does not change the fact that, 
without a $5 billion surplus in the unemployment insurance fund, 
the finance minister would not have the same results. And that 
surplus did not come from his contribution or his government's 
contribution, but from the contributions made by employers and 
employees to the unemployment insurance fund.
<P>
	The government took this $5 billion surplus in the UI fund and 
instead of spending it, or at least part of it, to create jobs, applied it 
to deficit reduction. This is easy to do. Anybody could have done as 
well or maybe even better than the finance minister.
<P>
	When you look at the overall spending cuts, the largest savings 
come from cuts in transfers to the provinces and to individuals. 
This is how the government has put its fiscal house in order. Cuts in 
departmental operating budgets over the last three years represent 
about 17 per cent of the overall cuts. It is not much.
<P>
	With regard to sound management of public finances, the 
government could have done a lot better, which is what the auditor 
general has been telling us for three years. Recently, he also 
reminded us that there were significant shortcomings in the 
management of public funds and public stocks.
<P>
	The fact that Quebecers and Canadians have been paying more 
taxes in the last three years is not mentioned, even thought that fact 
goes hand in hand with the situation I was describing earlier and 
with getting our public finances in order. Did you know that in the 
last three years, the individual tax portion of the federal revenues 
increased by 17 percent?
<P>
	Quebecers and Canadians saw their federal income tax increase 
by 17 percent in the last three years but their personal revenues 
increased by only 7 percent. That means that after three years of 
Liberal management of public finances, Quebecers and Canadians 
are poorer. Federal taxes increased faster than individual 
taxpayers' wealth. And the Liberal majority's report boasts about 
the government's accomplishments.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	We made recommendations to the Minister of Finance about 
what he should put in his next budget. If I may, I will describe these 
recommendations briefly, for the benefit of members and of those 
watching.
<P>
	The first recommendation made by the official opposition-and 
I see the chairman of the finance committee across from me, 
perhaps to intimidate me, you never know-was to say to the 
finance minister: You have managed to come up with some leeway. 
We may or may not agree on the means, but you have come up with 
some leeway. Furthermore, in the Liberal majority report, this 
point is emphasized, and I quote: ``This year, after two thirds of the 
period, it is virtually certain that the government will exceed its 
objective; a deficit of $24.3 billion, or 3 per cent of GDP''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7224"> 7224 </A></B>
<P>
	As a result, and I mentioned this earlier, we look to the federal 
government and see some breathing space; we look to the 
provinces, however, and they are scrambling. Only the provinces, 
Quebec in particular, have found ways of balancing their budgets.
<P>
	I was telling you earlier that, after three years, the government 
had slashed provincial transfer payments for social assistance, 
postsecondary education, higher education and health. These are 
areas that come under provincial jurisdiction. Just like that, the 
government decided it was making cuts, despite its bilateral 
contract with the provinces.
<P>
	We are, therefore, asking the Minister of Finance to do 
everything within his power to restore part of what he has sneaked 
away from the provinces in order to solve his own public finance 
problems, so as to allow the provinces a little more leeway. That is 
the first recommendation. I might make an aside here: while he is 
at it, he could perhaps allow Quebec a little leeway in order to 
compensate it for having harmonized its provincial sales tax with 
the federal tax, since it has received no compensation whatsoever, 
unlike the three maritime provinces with their billions in 
compensation. Perhaps it is time for him to give some thought to 
some form of compensation for the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	The second suggestion we made to the Minister of Finance, in 
our dissenting opinion accompanying the Liberal majority's report 
on pre-budgetary consultations, was to use part of the surplus 
generated by the unemployment insurance fund, not to absorb his 
deficit but to promote job creation. And as we suggested many 
times to the Minister of Finance, that is what he should be doing. 
The position taken by the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, 
was supported by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. We asked 
the Minister of Finance to substantially reduce employer and 
employee contributions to the unemployment insurance fund. 
When we say ``substantially'', we mean up to 60 cents for every 
$100 of insurable earnings. That is not peanuts, not 6 cents or 7 
cents, but something substantial that could boost job creation.
<P>
	The contribution rates to the unemployment insurance fund have 
a significant impact on the capacity of businesses to create jobs. 
This is a payroll tax, a tax on employment.
<P>
	Yet, despite the efforts of the government-and I do recognize, 
as the chairman of the finance committee said earlier, that there has 
been a light reduction-we are talking about a significant 
reduction, which is extremely urgent, in my opinion. The situation 
is getting worse every day. Despite the number of jobs created in 
the last three years, we still have a deficit of 900,000 jobs. It was 
850,000 jobs one month ago but the most recent data indicate that 
we would need up to 925,000 new jobs to regain the level of 
activity and the rate of participation in the work force that we had 
before the 1990 recession. We are unable to create jobs, which 
should be our absolute priority.
<P>
	Speaking of which, in our third recommendation, we suggested 
the finance minister reform the corporate income tax system. We in
<P>
the official opposition were very happy and flattered when the 
finance minister took note of the corporate tax expenditure analysis 
we released three weeks ago. We conducted an extensive analysis 
of tax expenditures. For the sake of our listeners, tax expenditures 
are any means available to Canadian corporations to avoid paying 
taxes or to have them deferred.
<P>
	Some tax expenditures are quite appropriate and still relevant in 
view of the way Canadian businesses have evolved. However 
others, according to our analysis-analysis which, I will remind 
the House, had not been carried out for 25 years-should be 
scrapped. Others yet should be streamlined in order to redirect the 
potential savings through the years toward job creation support. 
This is what the Bloc Quebecois did. This is what the official 
opposition did.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	We have worked on this analysis for weeks. I will remind you 
that there had not been a comprehensive analysis like the one 
carried out by the Bloc Quebecois over these many weeks since the 
Carter Commission in the mid-1960s.
<P>
	We have analyzed 30 tax expenditures, or 30 ways businesses 
can avoid paying taxes for various reasons, some good, some not so 
good, depending on the economic situation and the times. Of these 
30 expenditures, 22 were identified as warranting further analysis, 
because of their importance either in explaining federal 
government revenue losses or for their impact on both Quebec and 
Canada, according to the tax experts we consulted. Of these 22, 12 
were the subject of an in-depth analysis and led us to make 
recommendations to the Minister of Finance three weeks ago.
<P>
	This close scrutiny of corporate taxation has shown that federal 
government revenues could be increased by up to $3 billion per 
year without raising the corporate tax rate, without increasing the 
tax burden on small business. Simply by redefining objectives, we 
could use this $3 billion to create thousands, if not hundreds of 
thousands of jobs.
<P>
	Let me give you just one example. One of these tax expenditures 
is the partial tax exemption on capital gains. This is offered to both 
corporations and individuals but we had given ourselves the 
mandate of reviewing corporate taxation; personal taxation will be 
next.
<P>
	Let us get back to fiscal spending. On every dollar you earn as a 
private citizen, you may have to pay as much as 40 per cent in 
federal and provincial income tax. This dollar is the basis on which 
your income tax is calculated.
<P>
	However, if you make one dollar in capital gains, only 75 cents 
of this dollar is taxable at a rate of between 19 and 20 per cent. 
Twenty-five per cent of this capital gain,  for instance, if you have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7225"> 7225 </A></B>
<P>
shares and each share earns a dollar, 25 cents of this dollar is not 
taxed at all.
<P>
	Wage earners who pay income tax cannot shelter part of their 
income from the tax tables. However, in the case of wealthy people 
with a lot of capital, especially companies with portfolios of shares 
which increase in value, only 75 per cent of the value is subject to a 
minimum tax on capital gains.
<P>
	This measure made sense until the wealth tax was abolished. 
When this happened, there was no longer any need for the capital 
gains exemption. It was the subject of heated discussion under the 
Conservative government, not so much under the Liberal 
government, because they did not have the same political will to 
deal with problems where taxation of the rich is concerned. They 
are worse than the Conservatives, and sometimes more astute.
<P>
	We can say that under every government there has been a heated 
debate around this exemption. The conclusion was always a 
rational one. And the conclusion we heard from the tax experts was 
that it made no sense to maintain this exemption.
<P>
	So we suggest abolishing this exemption, which would allow the 
federal government to collect around $400 million in new revenue 
without increasing the tax burden on corporations or private 
citizens. The exemption should not exist because it makes no sense 
at all and costs and the government a half billion dollars annually. 
All the tax experts we consulted, without exception, told us that 
this measure was entirely unfair.
<P>
	Another area where we asked the Minister of Finance to act, and 
I am still on subject of corporate tax reform, is the whole issue of 
deferred income tax. As you know, businesses in Quebec and 
Canada have the option of deferring their income tax for seven 
years and also the option of going back three years, and I am 
referring to taxes they would normally have to pay because of their 
profits.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Deferring income taxes is not a bad principle per se; we think it 
should be upheld because new companies could need some help in 
starting up for example. Profits made the first year should be 
ploughed back into a business since this increases profitability and 
efficiency.
<P>
	There are also companies which operate in very cyclical sectors. 
They can make considerable investments for two or three years and 
see the results only seven years down the road. At the end of the 
seventh year, they have to offset the loss of income from three 
years before. That is normal.
<P>
	However, added to other provisions of the corporate tax 
legislation, the system creates situations where some very 
profitable companies never pay a single penny in income tax, year 
after year. Some business people even boast about it. That is not 
normal.
<P>
	The amount of deferred income tax accumulated to date is 
certainly not trivial; it stands at $36 billion. This is $12 billion over 
and above next year's deficit according to the estimates of the 
finance minister.
<P>
	It seems to me we could strengthen the rules so that one day 
profitable businesses, most of them large corporations, will have to 
pay at least part of what they owe Revenue Canada.
<P>
	Those are two examples of tax reform that we have proposed to 
the finance minister in order to help the government put its fiscal 
house in order and, most of all, to support efforts to create jobs.
<P>
	Besides, now that some of these tax expenditures have been 
tightened or abolished, we urge the government to adjust some of 
them so that small and medium size businesses as well as VSMs or 
very small businesses-which have created the most jobs in the last 
ten years-can continue and be encouraged to create even more 
jobs, since we still need about 1 million jobs to get back to the 
conditions that existed before the last recession.
<P>
	Fourth, we recommend that the federal government immediately 
launch a review of individual income taxes. We came to the 
conclusion, and the Liberal majority report agrees with our 
concerns, that individual income taxes have reached a ceiling. The 
underground economy problem is related to that. We should 
undertake a comprehensive review of our tax system.
<P>
	It is perfectly useless to make suggestions right and left the way 
Reform members have been doing. Besides, that is all they have 
been doing ever since we came here. There is no point in making 
piecemeal proposals to reduce personal or corporate income tax 
before a very probing assessment of the situation is done.
<P>
	We had an opportunity to sort out the problems in the personal 
income tax system. Major changes may be in order, because there 
has not been a comprehensive review of this system since the 
Carter commission in the 1960s. We do not advocate lowering or 
increasing taxes. Certainly not increasing them.
<P>
	There are still loopholes in the personal income tax system, and 
some very rich taxpayers-with taxable revenues of $200,000 to 
$250,000 and more-still do not pay their fair share. There are 
some gross inequities between these wealthy individuals and the 
people who make from $30,000 to $125,000.
<P>
	We are currently carrying out an in-depth review of individual 
taxation. We are also developing options for families, single 
people, the elderly, etc., to be applied before and after the reform 
we will put forward. We will prepare very succinct options, 
because the government is not doing its job.
<P>
	For three years now, we have been asking the government to 
review the tax system and all it ever had  to say was that it was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7226"> 7226 </A></B>
<P>
going to set up an expert panel to examine the corporate tax system. 
A few weeks ago, the government announced that it was 
postponing this review until after the election.
<P>
	In terms of individual taxation, nothing was done. The 
government does not want to address that issue. Maybe there are 
some people around the government who benefit from these 
loopholes, we do not know for sure. But the lack of political will is 
quite obvious.
<P>
	What are we going to do? We will do as we did for the corporate 
tax system. We will suggest to the minister ways for him to do his 
job.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	We will also give him some hints on ways to make the individual 
income tax system fair and equitable. Who knows, maybe we will 
go as far as to suggest a reduction of the individual tax burden. But 
that would require an in-depth review, so we urge the Minister of 
Finance to at least consider that option for his next budget, because 
he has been at it for three years now. He is just coasting along, 
carried by the economic conditions, with the four main factors I 
mentioned earlier, without making any great effort to try to put his 
own house in order. Maybe the time has come for him to take a 
good look at his own back yard.
<P>
	Speaking of his own back yard, the auditor general-and this is 
our fifth recommendation-raised serious questions in his last 
report about good management of public finances by this 
government. Referring to stock management, among other things, 
the report mentions excess spending of $1.25 billion. This is not 
normal. This government is boasting about being a good manager. 
There is a limit. I will show that this government has nothing to 
baost about.
<P>
	As I said earlier, as a result of the government's effort to put its 
fiscal house in order, the real reduction in spending in departments 
and crown corporations represents between 16 and 17 per cent of 
the effort of the last three years. It did not play a major part. It 
should have but it did not.
<P>
	The sixth recommendation of the Bloc Quebecois proposes that 
the finance minister-and it should be one of his major efforts- 
review in a minor, non-diruptive way, the inflation targets of the 
Bank of Canada. The government has had the power to do so since 
1967. While leaving the Bank of Canada as much autonomy as 
possible, the finance minister does have the power to establish a 
general direction for general inflation targets, for instance. He does 
have that power.
<P>
	Moreover, the Liberals, in the Liberal majority report, 
acknowledge-and I see the chairman nodding, although I do not 
understand why there was no recommendation on this, yet he is 
nodding.
<P>
	I quote the Liberal majority report: ``The tightening up of 
Canada's monetary policy aggravated the 1991 recession, but it had 
two other consequences as well: it produced the very low rate of 
inflation we have at the present time, but it also led to the high 
unemployment levels and high cost of servicing the debt, as a result 
of the high interest rates, which go along with this policy''.
<P>
	Why did this analysis not include some approaches for ensuring 
that what has happened since 1991 does not continue in 1997, 1998, 
or any other year? Why was this not taken to its logical conclusion? 
The government has got us used to a bit of logic, but it never 
follows it through. Sometimes its actions are totally illogical in 
relation to the logical analysis that preceded them. Why not follow 
the reasoning through to the end?
<P>
	There is no doubt that the monetary policy has hindered job 
creation. There could have been a balance between the optimum 
rate of unemployment in the economy and the rate of inflation. The 
government preferred the role of obsessive inflation fighter-that 
is going a bit far.
<P>
	The Governor of the Bank of Canada, Mr. Thiessen, 
acknowledged only last year that, three quarters earlier, they should 
have loosened controls on increases in interest rates in keeping 
inflation in check and that they probably weakened the economic 
recovery that gives rise to new jobs. He acknowledged it himself.
<P>
	That is not where the problem lies. The Liberals also 
acknowledge it, but made no recommendation on the effect of the 
monetary policy. No recommendation was made on the approach of 
the policy and yet there are studies, including that of Professor 
Pierre Fortin, which say essentially: we should keep inflation at 3 
per cent over the long term. The Bank of Canada would intervene 
on the money market to keep inflation at 3 per cent in Canada. A 3 
per cent rate of inflation is no big deal.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	It is now under 1 per cent, which could mean deflation. That is 
disastrous, because deflation is worse than an inflationary spiral. I 
will spare you the demonstration for the time being.
<P>
	If we had a long term objective of 3 per cent like the U.S., where 
the inflation rate is currently between 3.2 and 3.3 per cent, we 
could eventually bring the unemployment rate down to 7 per cent 
or thereabouts. Do you know how many jobs that would represent? 
An additional 460,000 jobs would be created. That is half the total 
number of jobs we need in the Canadian economy to restore 
pre-recession labour market conditions.
<P>
	Instead of considering the possibility of readjusting the inflation 
target range-they need not redefine the thrust of the monetary 
policy from A to Z, but only to set a new inflation target-the 
Liberals would rather say: ``No, we are staying the course. There 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7227"> 7227 </A></B>
<P>
are problems with job creation; we realize that we may have 
squeezed a little  too tight in our obsessive deficit reduction effort, 
but that is the way it will be.'' I wonder what the logic is behind 
that.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is not calling for a relaxation of inflation 
control efforts, quite the contrary, but for balanced control. There is 
no need for this manic-depressive attitude over inflation control. 
We are now asking ourselves a number of questions, and so are 
experts who do not necessarily support the Bloc Quebecois or the 
official opposition because, with an inflation rate of less than one 
per cent, given the margin of error, we may well be, as I said 
earlier, in a period of deflation.
<P>
	A period of deflation is basically an indication that wealth may 
be decreasing. If prices are expected to stay at the same level or 
even to fall, how can entrepreneurs be tempted to invest in the 
economy? Less investment means less production. And if there is 
less production, there are fewer jobs. It is all interrelated and the 
deflationary spiral causes a general downturn affecting the 
economy and job creation. It is worse than an inflationary spiral.
<P>
	With a one per cent rate of inflation, it seems to me we should try 
to redefine the targets, or at least try to avoid triggering deflation, 
which would be worse than what we have been experiencing for the 
past three years with the attempts to create jobs. It is time the 
government thought about this; it is time Liberal members stop 
conducting analyses and start making recommendations that make 
sense, recommendations that are relevant.
<P>
	Things are going well in the United States. The inflation rate 
there is 3 per cent, while the unemployment rate stands at 5.2 per 
cent. There is a connection between the unemployment and 
inflation rates. Americans have managed to maintain their 
unemployment rate at 5.2 per cent, which is described as a 
balanced unemployment rate. Interest rates come into play, as does 
the money supply, and rates remain at around 3 per cent for 
inflation and 5 per cent for unemployment.
<P>
	The United States does not have a one per cent inflation rate and 
a 10 per cent unemployment rate like Canada does, something 
which makes no sense. Year in and year, out we forgo billions of 
dollars in economic spinoffs because we have decided to be overly 
scrupulous, as my mother would say, we have decided to outdo the 
right wing in the United States and to be blindly obsessive in our 
war against inflation. It is time to put an end to this madness.
<P>
	In essence, these are our suggestions to the finance minister. We 
would rather have the finance minister listen to what we have to 
say, instead of praising the work of the Bloc Quebecois in matters 
of taxation, congratulating us as he does for the seriousness of our 
work, our great ability to analyze the corporate tax system, our 
good recommendations.
<P>
	We will accept the government's congratulations, since we do 
not get them often. We will accept them also because they show, at 
least in part, how useful the official opposition is, how useful the 
Bloc Quebecois is. And we will be even more useful over the next 
few years, until Quebec decides to go for another system than the 
federal system.
<P>
	I would like to tell you this: when I look at the remarks made 
over the past three years by the Bloc Quebecois, by myself and by 
all my colleagues, who are doing a wonderful job, and when I 
compare them with the remarks made by government members and 
members of the other opposition party, I see that every time a 
member of the Bloc Quebecois rose in this House, it was to defend 
the interests of those who sent us here.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	I see that every time a member of the Bloc Quebecois rose in this 
House, it was to defend the interests of the people we are here to 
represent. We rose to defend the disadvantaged, the unemployed, 
students, seniors, the right of women to dignity through work, day 
care centres. Then I looked at what the others did.
<P>
	The finance minister rose to defend the right of large 
corporations to do whatever they want as far as taxes are 
concerned. He rose to defend the tax free transfer of a $2 billion 
family trust to the United States. He rose to defend the right of very 
rich Canadian taxpayers to a partial capital gains exemption. Every 
time he rose, it was to defend the interests of rich people and large 
corporations.
<P>
	I will not say a word about Reform members. They did the same 
thing as the government. That showed me how useful the Bloc 
Quebecois is. That is why my colleagues and myself are here, to 
defend the interests of real Canadians, to defend the interests of the 
disadvantaged, to defend real job creation measures and not 
measures to help the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
<P>
	I thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak. I am sure my 
colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois will rise again, during the next 
two days, to defend the interests of real Canadians and not the 
interests of very rich taxpayers and large corporations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as you may know, I will not be seeking re-election and 
therefore this will be my last opportunity as the Reform finance 
critic to discuss the prebudget hearings report brought down by the 
finance committee. I do so with pleasure because I believe that the 
rosy Liberal coloured interpretation of the history of the last three 
years leading up to this budget consultation needs a bit of 
correction.
<P>
	In 1994 we had a quick budget that was essentially a do nothing 
budget. I give the Minister of Finance some  credit for at that point 
resisting the demand for increased spending. And except for a few 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7228"> 7228 </A></B>
<P>
special categories of spending, he kept everyone in line and it was 
more or less a steady as she goes budget.
<P>
	However, between the 1994 and 1995 budgets I believe having 
read <I>Double Vision</I>, a book I recommend highly to all members of 
Parliament who have lived through this period and to the general 
public, that between that time in 1995 there was a serious 
conversion of the Minister of Finance and his cabinet and caucus. 
What we saw was an intellectual integration of the concept of 
compound interest. I think during that period it became obvious 
that there was no way that this government could grow out of the 
deficit simply by slowing down or even holding constant the 
increase in expenditures. Therefore that was a major achievement.
<P>
	The second thing that happened that was fortuitous in retrospect 
but at the time probably a very agonizing terrible thing to all those 
Liberals who wanted to spend more, because that is how they had 
been brought up, was that the Mexican crisis hit the country. High 
interest rates raced through the world, the Canadian dollar came 
under attack and a series of articles and outside events brought 
home like nothing else would have in the absence of those events 
the seriousness of the crisis facing Canada. Moody's gave a down 
rating of our debt. There were editorials in the Wall Street Journal 
and everywhere else that this country was really in trouble.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	As it turns out, in 1995 the government produced a major 
breakthrough budget. I said so at the time and I say so again. The 
government is to be congratulated. It first initiated a program 
review which was a code word for downsizing the operations of 
government. It could not do anything about the debt and I will talk 
shortly about transfers to others.
<P>
	The day to day operations of the government had grown and 
become bloated in the post-war years. It was decided through the 
program review that the best way to go was not to cut across the 
board but to select certain items that needed to be eliminated and 
others that needed to be trimmed. The ministers were given a lot of 
latitude. They resisted heavily but they finally committed 
themselves to an $11 billion cut in departmental spending. That 
was a 20 per cent cut.
<P>
	It is still beginning to bite. All the layoffs, all the spending 
reductions have not yet taken place but it was a major cutback. In 
the Reform Party's view it should have gone further and in our 
budget we propose to do more of it, mainly by more 
decentralization of functions, the ideological anathema to the 
Liberals.
<P>
	In the 1995 budget provisions were made for downloading to the 
tune of $7 billion. It said to the provinces ``you used to get that 
money from us for welfare, higher education and medicare but in 
the next  few years we are going to cut all of that to the tune of $7 
billion''. Where did all the wonderful figures for the government 
come from that the previous speaker was talking about? It was said 
that the deficit would be almost eliminated by the year 2001. It has 
come from increased tax revenue.
<P>
	About one-quarter of that amount is through 35 small increases 
in different taxes. They were not called tax increases but just 
making the system a little fairer. It hurt like a tax increase, it looked 
like a tax increase, it raised government revenue but it was not 
really a tax increase. There were 35 of those steps.
<P>
	All of that will amount by next year to over $25 billion. Let me 
repeat that this government started with a deficit of about $40 
billion. It tried to eliminate this with a $25 billion increase in 
revenue which it took from the pockets of Canadians. It is also 
taking the $7 billion out of the pockets of Canadians except that it 
has put the burden, the political cost, on the provinces by saying 
that the provinces will get $7 billion less. The only thing the 
government has done where it really hurt was the $11 billion in the 
local bureaucracies, in the local functions of government. If all 
goes well, all that will lead to a balanced budget by the fiscal year 
2000-2001.
<P>
	The 1996 budget essentially carried on with the promises made 
in the preceding budget and it seems to be working all right. 
Interest rates have come down and there is a slightly better than 
expected performance. I congratulate the government again for 
having done what it has done. However, it should have done it 
much faster because what is lying ahead of us within the next year 
or two is still the possibility of a recession. There is a possibility of 
an increase in interest rates.
<P>
	We have been warned by economists all along that economic 
expansions do not last forever.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	I am worried about how the stock market is doing today. That 
indicator of economic well-being tends to forecast change in 
economic activity. One of the big troubles is if we do get such a 
turnaround in the economic activity or interest rates rise or 
both-this has nothing to do with ideology-as the Minister of 
Finance has said again and again, it is simply a matter of arithmetic 
that in fact such events as a slowdown in economic activity and 
higher interest rates could put this government, after all this pain, 
back to where it was when its term started.
<P>
	For the sake of Canadians, not for the sake of the Liberal Party, 
just for the sake of Canadians, I hope none of this will happen. The 
outcome of the policies that the government has already undertaken 
is really quite a dismal record. It could have been better if there had 
been more decisive action more quickly.
<P>
	The debt this government inherited was $500 billion. Next year 
it will be over $600 billion. In some budgets it  was forecasted to be 
$625 billion. This will be $11 billion more in interest costs on just 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7229"> 7229 </A></B>
<P>
the amount of debt that the government has added to the one which 
it inherited.
<P>
	One of the most tragic things is, as I mentioned, that $25 billion 
increase in revenue, partly through increased tax rates but simply 
through economic growth, has resulted in a reduction in average 
family income in Canada of $3,000 per year. People feel like they 
have been squeezed. The average Canadian does not have enough 
money to pay the interest on all the debts that they have. On top of 
that, however, it is not getting better. It is getting worse.
<P>
	That is why they have not increased spending. That is why our 
recovery was export driven. That is why we have been coasting 
along at a very anaemic growth rate, why employment creation has 
been large by the standards of the six European countries that are 
tearing their hair out because they are having such great 
difficulties. The famous Germany, the economic miracle, is stuck 
at unemployment rates over 10 per cent. Its best corporations are 
opening factories everywhere except in Bavaria and places where 
they should be. It is looking at what the problem is and we do not 
want to imitate it. We should look to the Americans.
<P>
	As the House knows, as the result of this we have been just 
coasting along at a very unfortunate rate. Because of the slowness 
and the lack of incisiveness with which the government attacked 
this deficit we saw a large risk premium on our interest rate relative 
to that in the United States and the rest of the world. That risk 
premium has severely reduced investment and of course 
investment is the source of productivity growth and the source of 
higher income.
<P>
	This government's record which was described by looking 
through such rosy coloured spectacles is really nothing very much 
to brag about. This government offers no tax cuts, no relief for all 
the hard working Canadians who are wondering how to make ends 
meet. The only thing the government did was to take money away 
from Canadians to the tune of $25 billion to eliminate the deficit, 
another $7 billion away from Canadians by downloading on the 
provinces.
<P>
	In relation to that $32 billion all it did was spend $11 billion of 
reductions in departmental spending on its own bureaucracy. No 
wonder people are disappointed and worried about the power and 
strength of the bureaucracies in Canada and how individual 
ministers are captured by them. However, they are Liberals and 
they are willing to be captured and do all this good spending.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	One of my greatest disappointments in this document that we are 
discussing today is that the restraint which the Minister of Finance 
has been able to keep on his Liberal spenders now appears to be 
ready to be broken.  This restraint is about to go because we have 
the all-Liberal tradition.
<P>
	During a press conference one after the other, disadvantaged 
group marched up to the microphone and television camera and 
said they needed more money. Sure, these are tragic problems 
besetting the people who come to the government wanting help. 
Reform would love to give them help and we plan to give them help 
through tax cuts, by lowering spending on the local bureaucracy. 
That is how it can and should be done.
<P>
	The tragedy is that allegedly, on the basis of performance in the 
budget being better than had been expected, there now sits maybe 
$1.5 billion. This Liberal government, speaking through the 
finance committee, has said ``let's start spending again''. This is at 
a time when the deficit still adds $100 million a day to the debt that 
the young people sitting around here, the pages in university, will 
have to pay the interest on.
<P>
	The Bloc was talking about how it speaks for this disadvantaged 
group and that disadvantaged group to give more money. I would 
love to be able to do so. However, the Reform Party, and especially 
myself, have made it our task to speak for those who cannot speak 
for themselves, who do not have a vote and therefore do not count 
at all, zilch, negative in the Liberal calculus on what should be the 
policy.
<P>
	Our youth will have to face $50 billion a year in interest costs, 
which are still rising and will be even higher if these Liberals get 
their way and start spending again. They also have another $50 
billion or $60 billion to pay to us in the form of medicare expenses 
and CPP expenses, unfunded liabilities which will require at least 
$50 billion a year.
<P>
	It is a crime what we are doing to our unborn generation and to 
those who cannot yet vote. Yet just when we are about to move 
slowly, surely and with some sanity toward reducing this debt on 
future generations what do we get? We get opportunistic Liberals, 
who cannot look beyond their own selfish noses, proposing again to 
increase spending before the battle is won. We are not even half 
way there yet. The risk of higher interest rates and a recession 
makes this totally and completely irresponsible.
<P>
	Imagine what it will mean when we balance the budget and then 
start spending again. If we do not want a deficit again where is the 
money going to come from? It is going to come from further 
increases in tax revenue from overtaxed Canadians. They will 
suffer another $3,000 reduction in family income as they did in the 
last three years because these Liberals, as they indicated in this 
particular report, are just waiting for the Minister of Finance to 
weaken ever so slightly and give in to one special interest group, 
however worthy its cause, and the flood gates will open.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7230"> 7230 </A></B>
<P>
	There are lists of people from the natives to battered women. 
I could go on and on about the people we heard from in the finance 
committee, all of whom had good causes to come to the federal 
government for more support. But at whose expense would that 
support come? At the expense of the young people I see right here 
in the House, who when they have grown up will find their debt 
burden even higher than it would be otherwise.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	I would now like to turn quickly to two pet projects which I 
believe are worth supporting. They will cost a little bit of money 
and maybe will have to wait another year or two, but I will not be 
here to talk about them. Therefore I would like to put them on 
record right now.
<P>
	The first is the elimination of the luxury tax on jewellery and 
watches. This is an antiquated tax. Hardly anyone today would 
believe that these products are a luxury and should be carrying in a 
very discriminatory fashion another 10 per cent tax on top of all the 
other taxes that are paid. Why pick on those particular products? 
They have created an underground economy and it is totally 
counterproductive. If we could recover the revenue on smuggled 
goods, on underground production and unreported income, the 
government would probably be away ahead. It is a kind of micro 
management which I do not think is justified in this day and age.
<P>
	The second thing I would like to support is the idea of removing 
all restrictions on the tax benefits that accrue from charitable 
donations. A very interesting study has been made of American 
history, the wealth created during the monopolies in the late 19th 
century of the oil barons, railroad barons and the steel barons, the 
Mellons, who had accumulated huge fortunes which have since 
been dissipated. In what way? They have all been given to 
foundations and to universities. The entire accumulated fortunes, 
capital gains, invested dividends, everything, was given to these 
institutions. Today Harvard has a $4 billion capital fund; Yale has 
$2 billion; Stanford, $2 billion or $3 billion.
<P>
	We heard statistics that our universities have tiny little 
endowments. It is believed that the main reason for the difference 
between the two countries is the tax treatment. The Americans 
simply do not tax the accumulated capital gains on the assets are 
given away.
<P>
	I am pleased the chairman of the finance committee supports the 
report that we should also do this in Canada as soon as the budget 
allows. It is not a great revenue loss relative to the huge benefits to 
be achieved.
<P>
	I think I am running out of time soon. I would like to talk about 
the presentations we heard from economist Andrew Sharpe about 
the role of labour market imperfections and barriers to the 
reductions in the unemployment rate. This is a topic I have spoken 
about regularly in the House whenever I had the opportunity. I  will 
dedicate the rest of my professional life at the Fraser Institute after 
the election to pushing and increasing public awareness of this 
problem.
<P>
	On a personal note, Mr. Donald Macdonald, the former finance 
minister and head of the Macdonald commission, was a witness in 
a committee hearing the other day. I first met him about 11 years 
ago, after a luncheon speech. I introduced myself and he said: 
``Your paper on the effect of unemployment insurance on the rate 
of unemployment hung over our commission like a shadow''. Last 
week he reminded me of that meeting.
<P>
	I find it unbelievable that we have so many blinders on that we 
cannot see that when a country just across the border with the same 
macro economic policy produces an unemployment rate of 5 per 
cent, we are stuck at 10 per cent. What a tragedy. I do not want to 
necessarily replicate what is being done in the United States.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	What I think we need in this country is a lengthy, major in-depth 
discussion on the trade-offs. If we tell people to stay in that place, 
that if they are poor and unemployed we will give them a 
guaranteed amount of money every year, they will stay there. It is 
simple economics. We may want to do this as a society. But at least 
we should talk about it and not stay stuck at an unemployment rate 
of 10 per cent.
<P>
	I would like to close by reminding the House that I disagree with 
the presentation of the witness who said that those overly generous 
Canadian welfare and social programs were responsible for only 
about a quarter of the 5 per cent difference between the American 
and Canadian rates.
<P>
	I worked on my Ph.D. at one of the leading left leaning 
universities of the world, Yale. We got our degree by doing a study 
which showed that the market failed. All the professors would say, 
with a few exceptions: ``Right on. Here is your doctorate. You 
found that the market is not working''.
<P>
	Then I spent three years as an apprentice at the University of 
Chicago. I was an assistant professor. There if we found out that the 
market was not working we were told to go back and do more 
research until we found out that it was the government's fault that 
the market was not working.
<P>
	That is the kind of attitude I bring to this debate. That kind of 
attitude will show that the bulk of the difference between the 
unemployment rates in Canada and the United States is due to 
policies which we make with the best of intentions but which have 
these unfortunate, unintended consequences.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to ask the member a 
question.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7231"> 7231 </A></B>
<P>
	I noticed, in reading the committee's report, that it went out of 
its way to quote the member directly on the subject he addressed 
at the end of his speech which dealt with the structural differences 
with respect to unemployment. The report at page 15 quotes the 
hon. member, who is the finance critic for the Reform Party. It 
says that the hon. member stated that structural differences were 
causing higher unemployment in Canada and that these included 
unemployment insurance, minimum wage rates and the degree of 
unionization. Those were the three that were mentioned in the 
report. I do not know whether the member mentioned any others 
during the committee hearings.
<P>
	I want to make sure that I am very clear on his theory. It would 
seem to me from what is in the report and from what I have heard 
that the member is suggesting that we as a nation pursue a policy of 
restricting access to unemployment insurance, restricting 
minimum wages or lowering them so that people are not able to get 
unemployment insurance and have to accept lower minimum 
wages, and restricting people's rights to organize unions and to 
enter into collective bargaining negotiations. He is suggesting that 
if we did all of those things as a country, it would mean we would 
have lower unemployment.
<P>
	Is the member suggesting that as the route to getting increased 
employment in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to that 
excellent summary of the points I made.
<P>
	The member will remember that I was very careful to say, since I 
am now a politician and not an academic, that this is indeed what 
scholars around the world, scholars who are published by the 
OECD are finding. They are finding that there is a trade-off for 
societies, a trade-off on the generosity of programs of the sort he 
mentioned and the unemployment rate.
<P>
	My point is that what this country has to come to grips with is 
however much we would like to fly by flapping our wings, we are 
never going to fly. There are certain realities in this world. In this 
case the reality is that we cannot have it both ways: more generous 
programs than other countries and the same rate of unemployment. 
I do not know if it has ever been explained to the people of Canada 
what the trade off is and what they would choose if they really had 
been given the alternative by the government. We should at least 
start a dialogue.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	I think I know where we will end up but since I believe in 
democracy that would be up to the people. The main thing we have 
to do is start a dialogue on that subject.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all I would like to acknowledge what a privilege it 
has been to serve in the same caucus as the hon. member for 
Capilano-Howe Sound. It has been very illuminating for many of 
us to have an economist of  his world stature participating in the 
debates of the House and speaking honestly about problems.
<P>
	We cannot solve the problems of the country if we do not address 
them honestly. That is what we are trying to do here. We are 
addressing the problems that the nation has. We did not get into a 
$600 billion federal debt by accident. We are in this mess because 
people of good heart and little else took us down this path 
unknowingly. We are not suggesting that they got up in the morning 
and said: ``How are we going to screw future generations of 
Canadians?'' It just happened. Now we have to deal with mess, do 
something right and only straight talk is going to get us there.
<P>
	There is some straight talk but it is not normally found in this 
House. Early in his comments the hon. member for 
Capilano-Howe Sound mentioned a very excellent book which 
should be required reading for all members of Parliament, 
including members opposite of the Liberal Party. That is the book 
``Double Vision'' written by Edward Greenspon and Anthony 
William-Smith about the first three years of the Liberal reign at the 
end of this millennium.
<P>
	It speaks very eloquently of the battle that raged within the 
Liberal Party on whether they were going to finally fess up to the 
fact that our country was and still has the potential to be a financial 
basket case if we do not stay the course.
<P>
	I would like my colleague to amplify on page 276 of that book. I 
remember it very clearly because it was like a lighthouse. It just 
exemplified what has gone on in this Parliament. On page 276 the 
Minister of Finance was defending his budget to the bond traders, 
Salomon Brothers, 400 of them. Their question to him was: ``Why 
should we believe the Liberals have got the forthrightness, the 
ability, to stay the course on the deficit reduction when they have 
never had that strength before, when they have never been able to 
do it. In the face of another election they open their wallets and 
give away future generations of Canadians' money. It is not their 
money. It is future generations' money. They have never had the 
strength to do it before, why should we believe you have the 
strength to do it now?''
<P>
	His response was: ``In his opinion the political competition in 
our country is the Reform Party. The Reform Party is committed to 
getting our financial house in order and the Reform Party will keep 
our feet to the fire''. Would the hon. member for Capilano-Howe 
Sound respond to this?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member very much 
for that softball. Yes, it is correct that the Reform Party should be 
given much more credit than we are being given for having been 
one of the sources that pushed in the crucial months before the 
1995 budget for a much more restrictive budget than the Liberal 
ideology would have produced otherwise.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7232"> 7232 </A></B>
<P>
	At the same time what the hon. member just mentioned makes 
this Liberal report that we are talking about right now such a 
tragedy. That the hard won victory of 1995 turned the corner. It 
meant a shift in the battle but the battle is only half way there. 
This year's deficit is still around $20 billion. It still adds $75 
million a day to the debt clock. The debt clock has slowed down 
somewhat but it is still ticking like a time bomb. Here we have 
the first revolt of the left-wing Liberals who believe it is time to 
start spending again.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	It was defended on the floor of this House and it is something 
which is very scary given the history of this government in this 
country in its inability to resist the siren songs of spending.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Ottawa 
West and I suspect sharing my time with the upcoming question 
period.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I suspect that is a good suggestion. It is almost 2 
p.m. Perhaps we could proceed to Statements by Members. My 
colleague, you will have the floor as soon as we get back.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday hundreds of postal workers came to the Prime 
Minister's door to protest the government's decision to stop 
Canada Post from delivering advertising mail, a move that will 
result in the layoff of 10,000 workers, one of the largest mass 
terminations in recent Canadian history.
<P>
	Today postal workers will be setting up information pickets at 
major postal stations across Canada as part of their campaign to 
save the jobs of 10,000 men and women, most of whom work less 
than 15 hours a week and therefore are not eligible for EI.
<P>
	In the red book the Liberals promised that a Liberal government 
would put jobs and economic growth at the forefront of its 
objectives. Instead, here we have a Liberal government that gave 
absolutely no thought whatsoever to the devastation and hardship 
this cruel and tasteless act will bring to the lives of those workers 
and their families.
<P>

that I, the member for Saint John, was in favour of the HST.

	Heather owns the Thousand Island tax and duty free store at the

allow every full time employee one working day per month with

	In 1972 I was the victim of a drunk driver and was very 
fortunate to survive on that occasion. The driver was 16 years old

paralyzed. I use this example only to point out that drinking and 
driving must be eradicated.

	<B>Mr. Murray Calder (Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe,

Ontario's plan to balance its budget is extremely vulnerable to a 
recession. A 30 per cent personal income tax cut is the largest 
single threat to the objective of a balanced budget. Eighty-eight per 
cent of all extra tax revenues will be required to finance the $5 
billion tax cut.
<P>
	The Reform Party's ``stale start'' says that immediate tax cuts 
will help the economy. In fact, tax cuts will now cause more 
government cutbacks. Just look at the Harris government in 
Ontario. Already having cut billions, it still needs to make another 
$3 billion in program cuts to reach its targets. But Harris has not 
got a clue of what to eliminate next because his so-called plan 
lacked common sense to begin with.

speak of the importance of a national health care program and in 
particular to express concern about the health and well-being of 
Canada's children.
<P>
	Canadians are among the healthiest people in the world. Canada 
was rated first in the world in 1995 and 1996 on the United Nations 
human development index. This index measures a country's 
achievements in life expectancy. This is truly one of the best 
countries in the world in which to live. However, I am concerned 
about the direction our health care system is taking.
<P>
	At a recent conference on Canada's children and their future, the 
Minister of Health expressed concern that too many Canadians are 
falling through the cracks in our system and that many of these are 
children.
<P>
	One of these children comes from my riding. A family from the 
Courtice area currently has their son enrolled in a special needs 
residential program funded by the province of Ontario. The 
province is going to cancel the funding. Ironically, the funding 
could continue if the child was made a ward of the state through the 
Children's Aid Society. Craig and Gloria Brown believe that it 
takes families to raise children, not the state. It is the purpose of the 
state to support its families.
<P>

special needs in order to keep families together.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TRANSFERSTOPROVINCES">TRANSFERS TO PROVINCES</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the report by the finance committee's Liberal majority, 
we learn that, with the limited budgetary flexibility now available 
to it, the federal government could, at the suggestion of its 
members, provide assistance primarily to the disadvantaged and to 
students through measures that will cost it less than $2 billion in 
total.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister or the Minister of Finance. 
Will the Prime Minister, or the Minister of Finance, admit, and 
furthermore, could they inform members of their caucus, that if the 
government has $2 billion to play around with today, it is first and 
foremost because it has cut social transfer payments to the 
provinces by almost $5 billion over two years?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is a committee report. The Minister of Finance will 
table his budget in February.
<P>
	Regarding transfer payments to the province of Quebec, I would 
like to point out that, while some transfer payments from the 
federal government have gone down, equalization payments have 
increased. At the moment the amount being transferred to the 
province of Quebec is about the same as it was when we came to 
office. In the case of Quebec, there has been no change, unlike 
richer provinces perhaps.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance is going to prepare his budget and we 
will see. Usually, he brings it down in February. The Leader of the 
Opposition will have to wait two months, and then he will have his 
answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is because we are used to tricks from the other side. We 
have seen the government in action for three years.
<P>
	Generally, when government members throw out an idea, the 
government is later tempted to use it in making unpopular 
decisions. That is why we are putting it on notice.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister if he could tell these members and the 
House that the measures they proposed in the Liberal report to help 
students and the poor do not represent even half of what his 
government has cut in health, social assistance and higher 
education during its term of office, and that, as a result, it is still a 
long way from undoing the harm it has done to the most vulnerable 
members of society.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
for one thing, when we made cuts, they were much deeper in our 
own case, in order to reduce direct federal government spending.
<P>
	Moreover, it is very clear that, when the time came to make cuts, 
we could not ignore the fact that 20 to 25 per cent of our spending 
was in the form of transfer payments to the provinces. At the same 
time, as the Prime Minister has just said, we did not touch 
equalization payments. Furthermore, I can tell you that 
equalization payments alone amount to $3.9 billion dollars, or 45 
per cent of the total, for Quebec.
<P>
	That being said, when we look at measures to help the most 
disadvantaged members of society, to help children living in 
poverty, to help students, a question comes to mind: Why did the 
Bloc Quebecois vote against all these measures?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance knows very well that the biggest 
cuts were to provincial transfer payments, and that they also dipped 
substantially into the UI fund. This was primarily how the minister 
refilled his coffers. We know this. He cannot deny it. Furthermore, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7237"> 7237 </A></B>
<P>
those living in poverty in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada know it. 
They know it each day that the government has hurt them, that it 
went after them cruelly.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance admit that the best short term 
response to child poverty, family violence and school dropouts 
would be to re-establish the provincial transfer payments for social 
programs that it was too quick to cut, and will he promise to do so 
in his next budget and to inform government members that the path 
they have set out on is a very bad one?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
between 1993-94 and 1998-99, direct government spending will 
decrease by over 12 per cent. As for provincial transfer payments, 
the reduction will be less than 8 per cent.
<P>
	At the same time, it must be pointed out that when provincial 
transfer payments were reduced, the reduction was less than 3 per 
cent of provincial revenues. This is a completely acceptable cost. 
Not only that, but when one looks at the cuts provincial 
governments have made in payments to their municipalities, we 
have cut much less.
<P>
	That having been said, let us look at what was done in the last 
budget. Not only did we set an $11 billion ceiling-not a ceiling, a 
floor-to protect provinces, we included a formula that will see 
transfer payments increase after 1998.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in recent years, the Minister of Finance has tabled budgets 
in which transfers to the provinces for health, education, and 
welfare drop, or will drop, from $30 billion to $25 billion in 
1996-98, in other words cuts of $5 billion over two years.
<P>
	Today, that same government is talking to us about creating 
programs and tax measures in the order of $2 billion to offset, very 
partially, the cuts to the provinces.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance finally admit that the manoeuvring 
he is involved in at this time, this withdrawal from the funding of 
provincial social programs in order to create its own programs has 
but one objective, increasing federal government visibility? This is 
not done in order to help those who are truly in need, the victims, 
for the federal government is the one who made them victims and 
is now coming to their rescue.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as 
regards transfers to the provinces, the key objective is to help the 
most disadvantaged members of our society, those who are in need, 
and to do so in partnership with provincial governments. This is 
why we gave two years notice before making the cuts. This is also 
the reason cuts to the provinces are less than the cuts at our end, 
these cuts represent less than 3 per cent of their  revenues. Yes, we 
have made cuts, but in manageable amounts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when analysing the budget, we must remember that 84 per 
cent of cuts in federal government spending were made to transfer 
payments and subsidies to third parties, individuals or provinces, 
while only 16 per cent of cuts were made to departments or crown 
corporations. These figures come from the minister's own budget.
<P>
	I refer to the Prime Minister, who stated in this House on 
December 13, 1995: ``It is very important we continue to make 
visible transfers-like the heritage minister, the flag minister-so 
that the people-will see that the federal government helps pay for 
the social programs the provincial governments manage''.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance admit that this government is 
interested solely in visibility, that the only thing it is trying to do is 
to improve its own image, by blackening that of the provinces, 
which are forced to make the cuts for it?
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, as regards equalization transfers, Quebec comes out the 
winner. As for subsidies to industry for job creation like those to 
the aeronautical and pharmaceutical industries, Quebec comes out 
the winner.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I think it is very important that we not allow any region of the 
country to attack any other. The member is absolutely right. When 
the federal government transfers money to the provinces it does so 
to protect the basic social programs. If those are visible like child 
care, like the working income supplement and the protection of 
medicare then this government will keep on doing it.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DISTINCTSOCIETY">DISTINCT SOCIETY</A></H3>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
seems that the Liberals just cannot take no for an answer. 
Canadians said no to Meech Lake and to Charlottetown. The 
Canadian people continue to say no to distinct society and the 
special status that it would confer on only one province in this 
country.
<P>
	There are reports that the Quebec provincial government and the 
federal government are working behind the scenes to secure the 
approval of enough provinces to entrench the distinct society 
clause in the Constitution.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister does the federal government endorse the 
constitutional position outlined over the weekend by Quebec 
Liberal leader Daniel Johnson, yes or no?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7238"> 7238 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this House of Commons voted a year ago on distinct 
society.
<P>
	Again we have the Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois 
together. Distinct society is very clear to me and it is something I 
have subscribed to all along. Everybody recognizes that the 
language in Quebec is different but perhaps the member does not 
know that. Quebec also has its own culture. Already in the 
Constitution the civil code of Quebec is the civil law in that 
province but not in the rest of the provinces. This was done in 
Canada in 1867 by the Fathers of Confederation.
<P>
	I know the Reform Party does not want to respect the wishes of 
the Fathers of Confederation who wanted to have a civil code 
which was different for Quebec than for the rest of the country. 
This was among many other distinctions they gave in the 
Constitution.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
nonsense continues on. If this is the case, if the Prime Minister is 
telling us exactly the truth, why in the world did we go through 
Meech Lake? Why in the world did we go through Charlottetown? 
Canadians spoke on those issues and they said no.
<P>
	My question to the Prime Minister is what part of no did he not 
understand?
<P>
	Canadians across the country, inside and outside Quebec, want to 
see a rebalancing of Confederation. They want to see moving 
government responsibility closer to the people. Canadians also 
want to see a strengthening of Canada's federal nature and 
institutions. These are the changes most likely to keep Quebec in 
the federation, not the empty, divisive rhetoric that we have seen 
time and time again.
<P>
	How many times do Canadians have to say no, Canadians across 
the country, not just in these hallowed halls? Why is the Prime 
Minister not recognizing 10 equal provinces in this country?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when the member asks for change is she not aware that 
last Friday the Minister of Human Resources Development was in 
her own province signing an agreement to change the status quo for 
a more improved situation in Canada, that it was the Government 
of Alberta that signed the first labour market accord in Canada last 
Friday?
<P>
	This example shows that this government has the right approach. 
We are changing Canada one program at a time. I know the Reform 
Party does not understand that. The member does not even know 
that the premier and the government of her own province agreed to 
a new formula for manpower in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, 
that is what many of the provinces are calling  for. However, I am 
not sure that changing the Constitution and entrenching distinct 
society rights could be labelled as one program at a time. 
Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward 
Island, Manitoba and Saskatchewan are all moving toward 
entrenching Quebec as a distinct society.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	Last winter in the government's throne speech the Prime 
Minister promised all Canadians, not just politicians or the elite but 
all Canadians, no matter where they live in the country, a say in the 
future of the country.
<P>
	So I ask the Prime Minister this. Will the government assure the 
House and all Canadians that distinct society for Quebec will not be 
entrenched in the Constitution unless it is endorsed by a nationwide 
referendum?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I never said that it would be approved by a nationwide 
referendum. But when I see that the provinces subscribe to what the 
House of Commons voted for last December, they recognize the 
reality of life in Canada; that in Quebec there is the French 
language, the French culture and a different system for citizens in 
law. It is in the Constitution.
<P>
	As I said, in P.E.I. there is a guarantee that whatever the number 
citizens in P.E.I. there will always be four members of Parliament 
and they will always have four Senators. Some might say that is a 
special status for P.E.I. Yes, but it made that deal and we are 
respecting it. We are not saying that privileges have been given to 
P.E.I. because it guaranteed to give the House of Commons four 
good Liberal MPs.

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	In a report the government submitted to the Krever Commission 
last Friday, Judge Krever's approach was qualified as repugnant 
and without foundation. He was also accused of looking for 
scapegoats to explain what happened, instead of focusing on 
making the blood system safer. However, the Krever commission 
was given a mandate to investigate the events and the shortcomings 
in the system which led to thousands of Canadians being infected.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister endorse the statements in the report 
submitted by his government to the effect that Judge Krever's 
attitude is repugnant and that the government is in no way to blame 
for the tainted blood scandal?

<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in the absence of the attorney general let me try to respond to the 
substantive question of the hon. member.
<P>
	I say to the hon. member that the report which was tabled with 
the commission was a report of 474 pages. If the hon. member is 
asking if the government agrees with some inflammatory language 
that may be contained therein, the answer is no.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, could the 
Prime Minister tell us why his lawyers say Judge Krever should 
concentrate on developing a new blood supply system, when no 
one in this government waited for Judge Krever's 
recommendations to start negotiations with a number of provinces 
on setting up a new blood authority?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I think we should be very careful. The fact of the matter is all 
provincial ministers of health have come together for the purposes 
of establishing a new national blood authority. All information has 
been shared with the Krever commission.
<P>
	I want to assure the hon. member that the report she made 
reference to, the 474 page document, does contain some 
inflammatory language. I said in the first response that the 
government, the Minister of Justice and I do not concur with that 
inflammatory language.
<P>
	The commission will have an opportunity later this week to 
examine the authors of the report; not only to examine the tone of 
the 474 page document but also to question the authors of that 
report on its substance.

that its do nothing, do not worry, be happy approach to national 
unity is the very reason why Canada almost broke apart last year.
<P>
	Canadians from coast to coast are looking for a revitalized 
federation. They want to see positive, constructive change. Rather 
than dividing the country with a distinct society, when will the 
government present new concrete proposals to revitalize the 
federation? Where is your plan?
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLellan:</B> We are doing it.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Would you address the Chair in all of 
your questions, my colleague?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think that the hon. member was not in the House when 
we tabled the speech from the throne in February where we gave a 
full plan of changes in Canada. Many of these plans and ideas have 
been implemented so far.
<P>
	For example, we have signed an agreement with the province of 
Alberta on manpower training. We are out of forestry now. We are 
out of mining. We have transferred most of the airports to 
municipalities and are in the process of doing that with some of the 
ports.
<P>
	A lot of the plans that were in the speech from the throne have 
been implemented but of course the hon. member did not know 
that. We are doing it program by program, idea by idea. That is the 
best way.
<P>
	As far as a distinct society is concerned, we voted last December 
and for somebody who wants to keep the country together it was 
noted in Quebec that they voted against it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
obvious from the response of the Prime Minister that there is no 
plan because in there somewhere he talked about airports. I do not 
know what that has to do with the unity of this country.
<P>
	The old vision has not worked. Its defenders continue to create 
divisions on cultural and linguistic lines, pitting one region against 
another and preserving the status quo. Will the Prime Minister 
assure the House that all voters and not just governments will have 
a say on this issue through a national referendum?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have political programs when we have elections. I 
know that the Reform Party will have one. To deny the reality that 
in Canada 25 per cent of the population speaks French is denying a 
reality that it is a source of strength in Canada.
<P>
	They are different in Quebec because the majority of the people 
speak French. They have a French culture and the civil code which 
was given by the Fathers of Confederation in 1867, making them 
different from the rest of the country.
<P>
	Some of the provinces have some special rights when it comes to 
education. For example, last week we voted to change some special 
rights that exist in the Constitution for education in the province of 
Newfoundland. There are some special rights for education in 
Quebec too in the Constitution that were put there by the Fathers of 
Confederation in 1867 as there were at the time of entry into 
Confederation in the late fifties of Newfoundland.

consulted Canadians right across the country. He came to the 
conclusion that the Canada Post Corporation should first 
concentrate on its primary role, which is to provide the best 
possible mail services to all Canadians.
<P>
	He also found that Canadians from all over the country do not 
want the corporation to deliver unaddressed advertising mail. He 
agrees with the persistent allegations of unfair competition made 
against Canada Post in this regard. After reviewing Mr. 
Radwanski's report, the government decided to ask Canada Post to 
stop delivering unaddressed advertising mail, and we will stick to 
our decision.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister forgot to mention that Mr. Radwanski's logic, 
which is now the government's logic, will lead directly to an 
astronomical tariff increase or to a reduction in services that could 
adversely affect postal services in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	Does the minister realize that almost all Canadians living outside 
large centres will not be served by private distributors of 
advertising mail, and that they will no longer benefit from Canada 
Post's own mailout distribution service, Admail?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, this is not true. We 
expect this responsibility to be transferred to the private sector. In 
fact, out of these 9,850 part time employees, 20 per cent have 
already indicated that they are no longer able to deliver these 
mailouts, even if there is still work to be done at Canada Post with 
this advertising mail.

	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Last Friday, the government entered into an historic partnership 
with the province of Alberta. How will the new Canada labour 
market development agreement ensure that unemployed Albertans 
will get effective results based training they need for the real jobs 
in Alberta's labour market?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was indeed an historic 
agreement that was signed last week with the Government of 
Alberta.
<P>
	The Government of Alberta will be able to respond to local 
market conditions to help unemployed people go back to work. The 
accountability framework, which is included in the agreement, 
refers to the number of people who will be returned to work with 
the help of those programs.
<P>
	It is results based. It is results oriented. We will be able to 
measure how much money has been saved on the employment 
insurance account. The Government of Alberta will report every 
year to Parliament because we are responsible to all Canadians for 
how much has been done.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This means that from now on a worker in Alberta, in the 
member's riding for instance, will no longer have to wonder 
whether the program is federal or provincial. A single wicket will 
provide workers with the opportunity to return to work without any 
hassle.

	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister for International Trade has been claiming that the sawmill 
industry is on side and that the industry is happy with the 
Canada-U.S. softwood lumber agreement.
<P>
	However, several Quebec lumber companies are now taking the 
minister to court over the export quotas they have received under 
the agreement. They say the minister bungled the quotas. The 
industry claims the minister missed the boat when he set the 
quotas. It wants the minister to quash the present allocation and 
issue quotas that are more in line with reality. Thousands of jobs 
are being lost across the country because the minister bungled the 
deal.
<P>
	What specific action does the minister plan to take to resolve this 
situation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member 
knows, the Canada-U.S. softwood lumber agreement was not 
arrived at overnight.
<P>
	It was arrived at after the federal government, representing the 
five provinces, impacted the six industry associations. Three 
different sectors in the industry were widely consulted. I 
understand that two companies at the present time are proceeding 
with some legal action.
<P>
	I wish to assure the hon. member that the system the government 
is currently responsible for was one arrived at after an incredible 
amount of consultation. The six industry associations and the five 
provinces impacted still support the deal.
<P>
	I urge the hon. member, if he has more questions, to consult with 
the industry association in his province that supported this deal.

losses.
<P>
	Industry did not negotiate the softwood deal. This government 
did. The minister claims that the industry set the standard for the 
deal. Allow me to set the record straight.
<P>
	The companies agreed to a reduction of 9 per cent of the 1995 
exports of softwood lumber to the U.S., yet the majority of lumber 
producers had their quotas reduced by not 9 per cent, but 30 to 40 
per cent. That is the problem.
<P>
	Lumber companies are now demanding that the government 
cancel the softwood lumber deal. Will the government fight for 
Canadian jobs and cancel the softwood lumber agreement with the 
United States?

<B>(1450 )</B>

	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister

those that it entered into after a great deal of consultation with five 
provincial governments, six industry associations and all of those 
that have been affected.

	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	The port of Trois-Rivières is one of the most cost efficient and 
profitable in Canada. In 1995 alone, shipping activities increased 
by 45 per cent compared to the previous year. And yet, as a result of 
decisions by the federal government, it might lose its national port 
status and, consequently, its international stature.
<P>
	Since the port of Trois-Rivières meets all the criteria to be 
recognized as a Canadian port authority, and since all stakeholders 
agree that it does, could the minister commit now to recognizing 
the role and significance of the port of Trois-Rivières by granting it 
Canadian port authority status?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister mentioned this issue when he was in 
Trois-Rivières a few days ago.
<P>
	The fact is, the member should realize that Bill C-44 has not 
been passed yet. Before changing the whole system, we must wait 
for the new legislation to be in place. Thanks to the committee's 
hard work, the bill is  now back in the House. I hope for a quick 
decision of the House on this bill. Only then will we be able to 
make a decision.
<P>
	There is no problem for Trois-Rivières to wait for the legislation 
to be passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, out of 
respect for what people want, can the minister assure us that, in 
making his evaluation, he will endorse the chamber of commerce, 
the evaluation committee, the Corporation économique de 
développement industriel et commercial and the cities of 
Trois-Rivières, Trois-Rivières Ouest, Grand-Mère and 
Shawinigan-in the Prime Minister's riding-that he will abide by 
the will of the community instead of yielding to a small group who 
is hustling around the Trois-Rivières Liberal Association?
<P>
	Can he assure us that the $12 million reserve accumulated over 
the years by the port of Trois-Rivières will not be siphoned off to 
the Canadian consolidated fund like the reserve of the port of 
Quebec was by the previous Tory government?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I very seldom use my privilege. The member was absent 
on Friday. I spoke with the mayor of Trois-Rivières and on CHLN. 
The member is three days late.

	I said that once the bill is passed, the government will want the

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the reality 
is that subsequently the minister removed $414 million from CBC

getting away with it with impunity.
<P>
<B>(1455 )</B>
<P>

why the CBC removed its funding for Radio Canada International.

	The Canadian International issue shows once again the

measures for Canadian International, the government is completely

<P>
	How can the minister say that he set up a committee on the return 
to regulation in transportation when he has always preached 
deregulation? Are we to understand that the only solution found by 
the government was to set up an inefficiency and mismanagement 
bonus through its selective reduction of taxes applicable in reality 
only to those who intend to stay non cost-effective?

	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr.

have absolutely no plans to re-regulate the industry. We have no 
intention of doing it.

	What I offered to Mr. Buzz Hargrove of the auto workers

report he had given me. I repeated it last week and he rejected it 
again quite bitterly. I then put it in writing and he rejected it again.
<P>
	He has now accepted the offer. My only regret is that if he had 
done so over 10 days ago, millions of dollars of ticket sales would 
have taken place for Canadian. Unfortunately the company did not

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	We know now that unemployment in Canada is stuck at 10 per 
cent. Yet in Saskatchewan with a New Democrat government the 
unemployment rate is the lowest in the country. We know too from 
the government's own studies that unemployment costs the country 
billions and billions of dollars in lost revenues and would 
contribute to addressing the deficit had the problem of 
unemployment been addressed.
<P>
	Knowing that the government of Saskatchewan has developed a 
partnership approach to dealing with the economy which has 
generated an unemployment rate that is the envy of the country, 
when will the Minister of Finance speak to the minister of 
economic diversification and development in Saskatchewan to find 
out how to deal with unemployment?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Talking about 
partnerships, Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member wants to take a look 
at what the government has introduced, whether it is technology 
partnerships by the minister of energy; Team Canada which has 
become one of the most important innovations in international 
trade around the world and is in fact a partnership with the federal 
government, the provincial governments and the private sector; or 
the multitude of youth programs introduced by the minister of 
HRD, he would see before him a government committed to 
partnership. It is the reason the private sector created over 
three-quarters of a million jobs.
<P>
	In terms of Saskatchewan we are delighted to see the tremendous 
number of new jobs created, with retail sales going up as a result of 
the agricultural boom occurring in western Canada. I would

<B><A NAME="7246"> 7246 </A></B>
<P>
report, the government has made good progress in meeting its 
economic and fiscal objectives.  The 1997 budget is the time to stay 
the course and finish the job.
<P>
	When the Liberal Party formed the government in 1993 it had as 
its agenda jobs and growth. Since that time it has made progress, 
although more needs to be done. Yet the record is clear. At the end 
of November nearly 650,000 more Canadians had jobs than when 
we assumed office three years ago. The last year alone saw the 
private sector create almost 223,000 new jobs. That is not yet good 
enough, but when we compare this job growth to the three years 
prior to our coming to power when thousands of jobs were actually 
lost we see that progress is being made.
<P>
	Canada has also achieved economic growth. Since October 1993 
the GDP has significantly expanded. In the third quarter of this year 
real GDP rose 3.3 per cent. Canada is expected to have the 
strongest growth among all G-7 nations next year.
<P>
	These successes have been solid accomplishments. More 
important, the pace at which the economy and employment is 
expanding is and will likely continue to increase. They will do so 
because the government has a specific and well designed strategy 
to support growth and job creation. It is this strategy I should like 
to take a few minutes to speak to.
<P>
	The government's plan addresses both immediate and long term 
job creation needs through five key components. First, it will set 
the appropriate macro economic conditions to keep interest rates 
low and to encourage investment. Second, it will get government 
right by ensuring that government programs and policies contribute 
to a more productive economy. The third part of the strategy is to 
ensure that we create opportunities for Canadian businesses to 
grow by selling in the world economy. Fourth, it will invest in 
growth through strategic investments in new technology, in worker 
skills and in capital projects such as infrastructure. Fifth, it will 
help Canadians to adapt by encouraging them to adjust to the new 
economy, helping small business grow and prosper and reducing 
the regulatory burden on business.
<P>
	That strategy is working because the Minister of Finance and the 
government have understood the importance of appropriate fiscal 
and economic policy and have carried out these policies as well as 
any nation in the industrialized world.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	On our first priority of setting healthy economic fundamentals, 
the accomplishments are significant. Interest rates are at their 
lowest level in 40 years. Inflation is at its lowest sustained level in 
30 years and both factors are leading to increased investment and 
business confidence. In the last quarter alone business investment 
in manufacturing equipment and machinery was up by almost 33 
per cent. This increased confidence leads to increased jobs.
<P>
	On the second priority, we are getting government right. When 
we took office the deficit was $42 billion, almost 6 per cent of 
GDP. In the present budgetary plan, after the two year cycle, it will 
drop to $9 billion, or 1 per cent of GDP. That is an 80 per cent 
decrease. We will have gone from having the second worst record 
on the deficit among the G-7 countries to having the very best. We 
have achieved this success not by emphasizing increased taxation 
rates but by getting government right and by reducing spending.
<P>
	Together our last three budgets have put in place savings which 
will build to $29 billion annually by the fiscal year 1998-99. By 
that time departmental spending will be 21.5 per cent lower than in 
1994 and program spending will have declined by 14 per cent from 
where it was in 1992-93. Most important, the Minister of Finance is 
expected to table a budget with a two year plan which for the first 
time in 30 years will not require the federal government to enter 
into new borrowings. This will free investment for the private 
sector and will lower the economic drain of interest payments to 
foreign debt holders.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, these actions have led to low inflation 
and low interest rates. The records show that in the long run 
countries with sustained low inflation tend to have lower 
unemployment rates.
<P>
	On the third point of creating opportunities through trade, the 
government has again made good progress. The volume of 
Canadian exports has increased by 28 per cent since we assumed 
office. It now makes up 52 per cent of the real value of total 
Canadian production. In September 1996 exports were $201 billion 
and the trade surplus was $28 billion. Most important, it is 
estimated that this improvement in Canada's trade balance has 
created about 275,000 jobs in the last two and a half years.
<P>
	The fourth component of the government's job agenda has been 
to invest in growth and to give Canadian businesses and workers 
the opportunity to succeed in today's economy. This investment 
has taken many forms, including technology initiatives. They are 
initiatives such as the establishment of Technology Partnerships 
Canada, a $250 million fund to lever private investment in the 
strategic high tech sectors of the economy. There is a new 
investment of $50 million in the Business Development Bank of 
Canada. There is the community access program which allows 
rural communities to access the information highway. There are 
many other initiatives such as the industrial research assistance 
program and the sectoral partnership initiative. These initiatives 
are making Canadians more competitive and will lead to future job 
creation.
<P>
	The fifth component of the government's plan in our jobs and 
growth agenda is to help Canadians adapt. Nowhere has this 
initiative been more strongly pursued than in our assistance to 
small businesses. We have  helped increase access to capital by 
expanding the small business loans program from $4 billion to $12 
billion. We have expanded the asset base of the Business 
Development Bank from $3 billion to $15 billion and the Minister 
of Industry has established a community investment plan which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7247"> 7247 </A></B>
<P>
allows communities to match individuals in their areas that have 
investments with the businesses that need that investment in order 
to grow in their communities and to create jobs.
<P>
	We have helped business to access information through the 
development of Strategis, the largest business web site in Canada. 
It provides our businessmen and women, the entrepreneurs who go 
out every day and put it all on the line, with the information they 
need to be successful.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	With a lower tax rate on small business earnings under $200,000 
and the $500,000 lifetime capital gains exemption, it will allow a 
small business person to continue to invest their earnings back into 
the business and ensure that they have some sort of wealth when it 
comes time for them to retire.
<P>
	The government has managed the Canadian economy well. The 
deficit is down substantially, spending is down, social programs 
have been reformed to ensure their sustainability, exports are up, 
new investments in technology and infrastructure are taking place 
to secure our future.
<P>
	In conclusion, the economy is growing. It is real progress. It is 
not enough yet and that is why the government intends to stay the 
course and finish the job.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to follow on the comments of my colleague for Parry 
Sound-Muskoka, on the economic accomplishments of our 
government over the last three years, and talk about how this ways 
and means motion before the House today represents the spirit of 
many of those accomplishments.
<P>
	It is a bill primarily about taxation measures. It demonstrates 
admirably how one can tighten up the tax system, make it fairer, 
but also through the tax system achieve other social goals and goals 
for society.
<P>
	I mentioned fairness. Our government has taken a number of 
measures to make the tax system fairer for Canadians. Many of 
them are contained in this bill. The motion will amend the 
Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the 
Children's Special Allowances Act, the Customs Act, the Old Age 
Security Act. It makes amendments to numerous bills which are 
based on the principle of fairness and achieving a social objective 
as well.
<P>
	Since the draft amendments which are represented in the bill 
were first released in 1995 many helpful comments and 
suggestions from taxpayers have been heard and these are by and 
large incorporated in the bill before us today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	First of all, millions of Canadians are putting time and money 
into non-profit voluntary and charitable organizations. Their efforts 
are indicative of the collective response to urgent human needs, 
particularly in a period of fiscal restraint. To encourage these 
efforts, the percentage of net income to which a tax break for 
charitable donations applies will increase from 20 to 50. It will be 
100 per cent in the case of testamentary gifts.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The legislation will also provide extra support for the education 
of our young people by increasing the limit on the transfer of 
education and tuition credits. To assist parents or spouses helping 
to support the cost of studies, if the student is unable to take full 
advantage of the tax credits related to the cost of their education, 
the ceiling will be lifted so that additional credits can be transferred 
to a spouse, parent or guardian responsible for the costs of the 
education. That increase is 25 per cent, from $4,000 to $5,000.
<P>
	We also have taken a number of measures over time to assure 
Canadians that the system is fair, that if they are paying their fair 
share of taxes, to the greatest extent so is everybody else. We have 
done that in a number of ways.
<P>
	First, it has been a question of tightening up our taxation system, 
closing a number of loopholes. For instance, through a concerted 
effort we have increased overall general compliance with the 
collection of taxes to the tune of $7.7 billion extra taxes collected.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	Special compliance measures in selected areas have led to the 
collection of an additional $500 million in taxes. Accounts 
receivable have been reduced through a number of different 
measures. We have given Revenue Canada a greater ability to 
obtain the information it needs to ensure that taxes are applied 
fairly and that they are being collected.
<P>
	Our mandate has given people some assurance that people are 
paying their fair share. I do not think there is one of us who has not 
heard repeatedly, every time we have had to cut a program or 
reduce spending in one area or another, that we should be closing 
those tax loopholes and taxing the corporations. A number of 
measures have been taken to address those fairness issues that 
bother so many of our constituents.
<P>
	We have tightened the rules on the forgiveness of business debt. 
We have improved the rules preventing the artificial or premature 
recognition of tax losses. We imposed a 12 per cent capital surtax 
for banks and other deposit institutions. We have tightened up to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7248"> 7248 </A></B>
<P>
eliminate abuses in the energy sector while at the same time 
making it a more level playing field for renewable energy  sources 
that can then compete with the more traditional energy sources and 
on a fairer basis.
<P>
	We have introduced tighter rules governing the taxation of 
family trusts. We have addressed the whole issue of assets abroad 
both in individual taxation reporting and in the taxation reporting 
of businesses so that businesses with assets abroad will now have to 
disclose them. Property owners with assets of more than $100,000 
will be required to disclose them. The government will then be 
better able to monitor the collection of taxes from wealthier 
taxpayers.
<P>
	We are planning to stop the practice of moving assets offshore to 
avoid paying taxes. This is an age old abuse of the system which 
Canadians want to see brought to an end.
<P>
	This bill also takes the necessary steps to protect the future of 
our Canada pension plan. Until now, when businesses were in 
receivership payment of the employer's CPP contributions often 
went delinquent once the business had finally declared bankruptcy. 
Remaining assets were divided among the creditors and the CPP 
contributions were left unpaid.
<P>
	The legislation before us today will ensure that CPP and similar 
employer contributions owed to the government will now have 
priority. In this time of fiscal restraint Canadians can no longer 
afford to see the valuable dollars that support their social programs 
slip from the hands of government.
<P>
	Through the taxation system we have done a number of things to 
improve child support and support to low income families. This is a 
massive piece of legislation before the House today. I have been 
able to touch briefly on a few of its provisions but with an emphasis 
on pointing out to Canadians that throughout our three budgets and 
the measures to implement those budgets there has been a 
tremendous effort to assure Canadians that all Canadians are 
paying their fair share, that we are closing those tax loopholes that 
make Canadians suspicious of one another from time to time and 
that we are doing our best to ensure not only that we are spending 
wisely but that we are collecting revenue in a wise and fair manner 
as well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in its 
pre-budget report issued last week, the Liberal majority on the 
Standing Committee on Finance identified six areas that have been 
targeted for action and that were described at length by the 
committee's chairman this morning. These are child poverty, the 
disabled, literacy, students, who are facing ever-mounting costs, 
scientific research, and voluntary and charitable organizations.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	According to the committee chairman, the action the committee 
is looking at would cost the Canadian government approximately 
$2 billion annually. While we are not lacking in compassion for the 
citizen groups identified here, we can see the Liberals sliding back 
into their old ways: as soon as the deficit drops a bit, they talk about 
launching off once again into the mad spiral of public spending.
<P>
	The main point here is that, by slashing provincial transfer 
payments, the Liberals have forced the provinces in turn to make 
drastic cuts to spending on health, education and social assistance.
<P>
	The Liberals are offloading the disagreeable task of balancing 
the budget onto the provinces. And they talk about helping certain 
very specific groups that are already feeling the effects of 
provincial budget cutbacks that, in turn, came about because of 
federal cuts in transfer payments to these very provinces. Talk 
about cynicism.
<P>
	Eighty-four per cent of the reduction in the deficit to date comes 
from cuts to provincial transfer payments, while only 16 per cent 
comes from leaner government administration. We would have 
expected the reverse. Yes, the federal government is offloading its 
deficit onto the backs of the provinces, who must, in turn, cut direct 
services to the public.
<P>
	Let us take a closer look at how the Liberals are trying to lower 
the Canadian deficit.
<P>
	If we assume that the Liberals will be going to the polls after 
bringing down their next budget, and that the Minister of Finance's 
most recent forecasts will not change in the meantime, the Liberals 
will have lowered the deficit by $25 billion during their term of 
office.
<P>
	This $25 billion saving breaks down as follows: budgetary 
revenue will have gone up by $23.1 billion, while program 
spending will have gone down by $14.4 billion, for a net result of 
$37.5 billion. However, during this same period, the money spent 
to service the debt will have increased by $9.5 billion, and the plan 
is to set aside a $3 billion reserve in 1997-98 for contingencies, for 
a total of $12.5 billion, leaving us with a net amount of $25 billion.
<P>
	During the four-year period between 1993-94 and 1997-98, 
revenues will have risen by $23.1 billion, for the following reasons: 
personal income taxes have increased by $15.1 billion; corporate 
taxes by $7.1 billion; GST revenues by $3 billion and 
unemployment insurance contributions by $1.3 billion. On the 
other hand, there will have been a drop of some $3.4 billion in other 
tax and non-tax revenues.
<P>
	Consequently, the increased revenue comes totally from an 
increased tax burden on businesses and individuals, even if the 
Minister of Finance boasts of not having increased personal
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7249"> 7249 </A></B>
<P>
income taxes since he has been minister. Part of this rise in revenue 
can be explained by the upturn in the economy, but you will agree 
that this is a minimal effort, considering how weak our economy is.
<P>
	For example, between the third quarter of 1993 and the second 
quarter of 1996, revenues from personal income tax increased by 
$8.8 billion, or 17.1 per cent, while personal incomes rose by only 
7.4 per cent over that same period. One can, therefore, conclude 
that the fiscal effort being demanded of Canadian taxpayers is still 
higher under the Liberals.
<P>
	During the period from 1993-94 to 1997-98, program 
expenditures will have dropped by $14.4 billion for the following 
reasons: transfers to individuals will have decreased by $600 
million; transfers to other levels of government by $6.8 billion; and 
grants and other transfers by $4.7 billion.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	Consequently, government expenditures account for only $2.3 
billion of the $14.4 billion in total cuts, or as I said before, 16 per 
cent of the whole. Thus, more than 80 per cent of cuts in federal 
expenditures come from transfers and grants to third parties, 
transfers to the provinces in particular. The government has not, 
therefore, tidied up its own backyard; instead, the federal 
government has forced the provinces to tidy up theirs.
<P>
	According to the government's budget plans, under the Liberal 
regime, unemployment insurance benefits will still lag behind 
contributions by approximately $5 billion. The Liberals are taxing 
jobs to the tune of $5 billion annually, to reduce their deficit 
artificially.
<P>
	When the Minister of Finance claims he must build up a reserve 
to prepare for the next recession, we should ask him where this 
reserve is. Where does he keep those $10 billion, $15 billion, even 
$20 billion he brashly took out of the pockets of workers and 
employers? The Minister of Finance is using this surplus to finance 
his deficit. He practically admitted as much in the House on 
October 10, and I quote: ``-that the government return the 
unemployment insurance fund-to the consolidated revenue 
fund''.
<P>
	This means that the government pockets the fund's $5 billion 
surplus to finance its program spending and other expenditures. 
The Minister of Finance did not say he was putting the money from 
the unemployment insurance fund in a separate reserve account but 
in the government's consolidated revenue fund. Consequently, the 
federal government's real deficit is $5 billion more annually than 
the minister claims in his eloquent speeches.
<P>
	Today the unemployment insurance fund has a major surplus, 
mainly due to repeated cuts in the unemployment insurance 
program over the past six years. The present surplus, plus the 
forecast drop in future costs as a result of unemployment insurance 
reform, would give the government a chance to reduce premium 
rates substantially and thus promote job creation in this country.
<P>
	The federal government has not contributed to the 
unemployment insurance fund since 1989, but it goes ahead and 
draws on the surplus as though it were some kind of income tax. It 
is not up to wage earners or their employers to absorb the deficit 
but to all Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	The annual surplus for the next few years is expected to be 
around $5 billion, mostly as a result of new provisions that will 
come into effect as of January 1, 1997 and make it even more 
difficult to qualify for benefits, in addition to reducing the actual 
amount of the benefits themselves.
<P>
	The last recession cost us about $20 billion in unemployment 
insurance. However, the chief actuary, Mr. Bédard, told the 
<I>Financial Post</I> on October 1, 1996, that because of permanent cuts 
in the program, the next recession would not be as costly.
<P>
	At the November 4 hearing of the Standing Committee on 
Finance, the Conseil du patronat du Québec requested a reduction 
of 45 cents in unemployment insurance premiums. The proposed 
reduction of 5 cents was mere window dressing, as far as the 
Conseil du patronat was concerned, and would have practically no 
impact on the economy, according to them.
<P>
	As for monetary policy and its impact on unemployment, our 
position in the Bloc Quebecois is as follows: the Bank of Canada's 
objective for inflation should be a target of between 2 and 4 per 
cent instead of the current target of between 1 and 3 per cent 
approved by the government. We must realize this would be a 
minor adjustment to the present monetary policy and not a 
complete about face from the policy we have now.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	Interest rates create jobs so long as they are not always being 
raised at the drop of a hat to fight the inflation that usually 
accompanies a descending rate of unemployment. Furthermore, the 
lower the range of inflation selected, the greater the likelihood 
interest rates will rise quickly, thereby increasing the risk that the 
monetary policy will negate the efforts to create jobs.
<P>
	Under the current monetary policy, our economy is unable to 
make optimum use of its resources. Zero inflation in Canada means 
less than optimum growth for collective wealth.
<P>
	According to economist Pierre Fortin, a stable inflation rate of 3 
per cent over a relatively long period of time would allow the 
unemployment rate to drop below 7 per cent, leading to the creation 
of some 460,000 jobs more than there were in October 1996. If the 
rate of inflation is pushed lower than 3 per cent, many workers are 
needlessly kept unemployed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7250"> 7250 </A></B>
<P>
	The Bank of Canada should not release its control over inflation, 
but, rather, focus on a target that permits a more tolerable interest 
rate, thus better fulfilling its mandate under the act.
<P>
	The current monetary policy is not appropriate in the Canadian 
context. If the economy is overheating in Toronto, it is not 
necessarily overheating across the country. The Bank of Canada 
should remember that.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois urges the Liberal government to act quickly 
to stimulate job creation. If the economy gets moving again and if 
the increase in employment is accompanied by a rate of inflation of 
more than 2 per cent, the Governor of the Bank of Canada runs the 
risk of plunging the Canadian economy into a recession once again 
by keeping the rate of inflation too low.
<P>
	It is therefore vital to ensure that the monetary policy is in line 
with the financial job creation policies the federal government is 
being asked to establish and the Quebec government is currently 
establishing. Otherwise all efforts in this area will be for naught. 
This is a matter of consistency among the various macroeconomic 
tools at the government's disposal.
<P>
	The central bank openly chose to focus on inflation at the 
expense of everything else. The monetary policy must reflect the 
mandate of the central bank and thus no longer focus exclusively 
on price control.
<P>
	The central bank has a habit of tightening controls on the 
monetary situation when Toronto or Vancouver start to experience 
overheated economies, wreaking havoc with the economies of 
Montreal or the maritimes, which do not evolve at the same speed.
<P>
	For example, the unemployment rate in the United States is 5.2 
per cent, and inflation has held at around 3 per cent for over 2 
years. A number of states, however, have virtually zero 
unemployment-Iowa, with 3.3 per cent; Wisconsin with 3.1 per 
cent; Nebraska with 2.4 per cent-and yet the federal American 
reserve is not resorting to particularly drastic measures.
<P>
	Although the Bank of Canada likes to think it operates 
independently of the government, the Minister of Finance has had 
the power, since 1967, to set general policy on issues such as 
interest rates. If he so wished, the Minister of Finance could decide 
that the Bank of Canada should target a higher rate of inflation than 
what it is currently targeting.
<P>
	The index used to set monetary policy could overestimate 
inflation, because it does not take into account new products on the 
market, improved quality of products, and movement of consumers 
towards low price centres, which Statistics Canada does not 
consider when calculating inflation. This means that when inflation 
is 1 per cent or less, we are perhaps in a period of deflation.
<P>
	In conclusion, we must not forgot that the federal government is 
cutting back on provincial transfer payments and that cuts to 
Quebec will total $636 million in 1996-97 and $1.2 billion in 
1997-98.
<P>
	The impact of the CHST combined with the recurrent effect of 
earlier cuts represents a cumulative $33 billion shortfall that 
Quebec will have absorbed between 1982 and 2000.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	For the year 1996-97 alone, federal transfer payments were $3.3 
billion less than in 1981-82. Since the deficit forecast by the 
Quebec Minister of Finance is $3.275 billion, Quebec would have a 
balanced budget today, were it not for the federal government 
offloading its deficit since the early 1980s. And yet the Liberals 
will have the nerve to go to Quebec voters with such a poor record. 
It is a sorry state of affairs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the comments and the contribution of the hon. member 
to the current debate.
<P>
	The member raised reasonable questions about what our 
inflation rate should be. There has been debate in this country and 
elsewhere, in fact perhaps right around the world about what is the 
proper level of inflation. He says that the Bank of Canada aims at 
an inflation rate of somewhere between 1 per cent and 3 per cent. 
He thinks, and I suppose he is speaking for his party, that the target 
for the inflation rate should be somewhere between 2 per cent and 4 
per cent. I accept that as a strong and legitimate point of view 
because there is a legitimate debate going on among economists as 
to what the inflation rate should be.
<P>
	The main reason I wanted to take to my feet is I cannot overlook 
the fact that the hon. member represents a separatist party, the Bloc 
from Quebec. When he talks about low interest rates producing 
jobs in Canada, I wonder what the inflation rate or interest rates 
would be in an independent Quebec. Chances are that if Quebec 
were to declare its sovereignty or its independence, interest rates 
would go through the roof.
<P>
	I also noticed in his speech the absence of any comment on the 
provincial economy. We know that the unemployment rate in the 
province of Quebec is very high, far above the national rate. The 
hon. member might want to reflect on that fact.
<P>
	I think it is a given among economists and all observers that the 
Quebec economy is in such bad shape because of the separatist 
government in Quebec City. When there is a separatist government 
in Quebec City it shakes the confidence of business people. The 
hon. member and his party should reflect upon these facts and 
perhaps give serious consideration to a big change in their policies.
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for 
his question and comments. I may say that the main reason why I 
did not speak at length about the economy of Quebec is that we 
happen to be in the House of Commons where, as parliamentarians, 
our priority should be to discuss the public finances of the federal 
government.
<P>
	As for their impact on the finances of the Government of 
Quebec, I referred to this a few moments ago, but as far as 
Quebec's public finances as such are concerned, I think this is a 
subject for the Quebec National Assembly.
<P>
	I would also like to say to the hon. member that when he makes 
allusions to political uncertainty, what keeps political and 
economic uncertainty alive, both among the general public and 
among investors is more likely to be the messages sent by 
federalist spokespersons like the hon. member than the situation as 
such.
<P>
	The public and investors are not afraid of a second or a third 
referendum on the political future of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	People are far more afraid of the uncertainty or the messages 
being spread around by people like the hon. member, who wonders 
what might happen in a sovereign Quebec and tries to frighten 
people or scare away international investors. The problem is more 
the kind of talk we are hearing than the fact that a third referendum 
is scheduled to be held in Quebec in three or four years time. I think 
that is the problem.
<P>
	The hon. member also mentioned the governor of the Bank of 
Canada and monetary policy. I want to tell him that as far as I 
know, until Quebec becomes a sovereign state, Canada's monetary 
policy is still determined by the governor of the Bank of Canada.
<P>
	The federal Minister of Finance also has an opinion to give, 
which he does every year and which does, of course, influence the 
governor of the Bank of Canada. What has been very hard on 
Quebecers so far, especially on the people of Montreal, is the 
tendency to keep inflation very low, as soon the economy shows the 
slightest sign of overheating in Toronto or Vancouver, and what we 
have seen in the past 15 or 20 years is that Quebec, and especially 
the Montreal region, is always the first to lose jobs when interest 
rates are raised. As soon as the economy gets up steam again and 
the Bank of Canada lets interest rates go down, Ontario and the 
Toronto region are always the first to benefit.
<P>
	In the end, the Montreal region is always the first to lose jobs and 
always the last to recover them when interest rates are brought 
down again.
<P>
	Actually, I think the hon. member put us on the right track. Once 
again we have seen why Quebec must become sovereign. It is 
because Quebec is not the master of its own monetary policy. As 
long as Quebec is a part  of Canada, it will always be the governor 
of the Bank of Canada, supported by the Minister of Finance of 
Canada, who determines the cost of borrowing. Quebec and 
especially the Montreal region will always be at a disadvantage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened to my colleague with interest. Naturally, he was not able to 
paint the full picture of the government's financial situation, or we 
would have spent the whole night here discussing it, particularly 
since, financially speaking, the economy of this country has a great 
deal wrong with it. Many changes must be made.
<P>
	Moreover, the Bloc Quebecois had, via its members on the 
finance committee, suggested a host of ways to turn the economy 
around. But that is not what my question is about.
<P>
	My point concerns unemployment insurance. My colleague has 
already touched on the question a little. I would, however, like to 
know his opinion, because, with the present unemployment levels, 
which are unacceptable regardless of what the Prime Minister and 
the Minister of Finance have to say, the government has not set 
itself any objective for job creation, despite its campaign promises. 
In addition, the government is presently using the unemployment 
insurance fund surplus, which came out of the workers' pockets, to 
do away with its deficit.
<P>
	I would like to hear my colleague's comments on this lack of 
awareness of unemployment in Canada and of the unemployment 
insurance surplus.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Mr. Speaker, as my colleague from Chicoutimi put 
it, it is most regrettable. The Minister of Finance says that, when 
the Liberals came to office, a little over three years ago, the federal 
deficit was $42 billion and that he lowered it to slightly less than 
$40 billion-$39.7 billion, I think-at the end of the first year of 
his mandate. The objective for the fiscal year ending March 31, 
1996 was $32.7 billion.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	With a supreme effort, the Minister of Finance brought it down 
to $28.4 billion. What we must remember is that with the $5 billion 
annual surplus in the unemployment insurance fund, the 
Government of Canada's real deficit is not $28 billion, but $33 
billion. Last year, it was not $39 billion, but rather $43 billion or 
$44 billion.
<P>
	Without the surplus from the unemployment insurance fund, 
which the minister appropriates to artificially reduce his deficit, the 
federal deficit has hardly moved since the Liberals took office. I 
also agree with my colleague from Chicoutimi that our 
unemployment rate is artificially too high and the money that 
should go to job creation is artificially and improperly being used 
to reduce the deficit, which is in fact much higher.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FIFTHREPORTOFSTANDINGCOMMITTEE">FIFTH REPORT OF STANDING COMMITTEE</A></H4>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
great pleasure to discuss the fifth report of the Standing Committee 
on Finance. I am sharing my time with the hon. member for 
York-Simcoe.
<P>
	I know a lot about the finance committee. I served on the finance 
committee. I congratulate the committee for its work and its very 
fine report. I know the long hours which that committee sits and the 
many witnesses it hears in dealing with this country's economic 
problems.
<P>
	The report talks of a broad range of generalities. It talks about 
our existing trade surplus. This of course is one of the things which 
has driven our economy to success. Within the trade surplus is the 
fact that we are continuing with our historical trading patterns. A 
lot of it is oriented toward automobile trade and the natural 
resource sector.
<P>
	One very important aspect the report talks about is the need for 
more money in research and development. That is something which 
interests me. It is the underpinning of our economy.
<P>
	When we talk about jobs and growth, it is appropriate to think 
not about what is going to happen tomorrow, but rather where we 
would like the economy to be in the year 2010. If we thought of 
ourselves in the year 2010 and looked back to today, we would ask 
ourselves what sort of structures we would put into place to make 
Canada a competitive economic engine in the world marketplace.
<P>
	I congratulate the finance committee for noting the very 
important aspect of research and development. Canada is rated in 
the OECD countries as about 18th in the world in the area of 
research and development spending. That is not good enough. 
Through our budgetary constraints we have cut spending in 
research and development over the last two or three years by $91 
million. For Canada to catch up to the world we have to put more 
energy into our research and development budgets. We have to do 
that effectively and efficiently. We cannot afford to waste our 
valuable resources as we build a new innovative economy.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	The Asian countries are going leaps and bounds ahead of us in a 
lot of ways in this area. As a matter of fact, I just had the advantage 
of coming back from Taiwan where I was invited by the local 
chamber of commerce there to look at its economy. It is an amazing 
success story; from 1948 with a population of 5 million, the size of 
Vancouver Island, to today with 21 million and the eighth largest 
economy in the world. It did it with education, research and 
technology.
<P>
	We have a great country here. It is a huge country full of natural 
resources but I do not think we are using our best natural resources, 
the resources between our ears. That is why I was very pleased to 
see that the finance committee noted the importance of increasing 
our commitment to research and development.
<P>
	In 1993 we had an infrastructure spending program. That was 
very important for the economy and the mood of the people which 
existed back in 1993. The object of that program was to provide 
hope. I think that has done that. Most people in this country realize 
this is a different world and a different economy than we had in 
1993.
<P>
	That infrastructure spending program focused a lot on municipal 
infrastructure, roads, sewers, and so on. Everybody realized with 
the differences in our economic well-being that we are not going to 
be able to put as much money in the infrastructure spending 
program as possibly we once did. Having said that there is the other 
important aspect and that is to refocus that program.
<P>
	I mentioned the infrastructure of the grey matter between our 
ears. I noted one of the very important points in that report was 
increasing funding for infrastructure through science and 
technology. I believe that is really where the growth in employment 
in this country is going to be.
<P>
	Statistics Canada has told us over and over again that those 
companies which use science and technology in their operations 
expand quicker and have a higher payroll, that wages are higher in 
those industries.
<P>
	We very much live in a time of a changing economy where the 
old economy is getting smaller and the newer economy, which is 
the knowledge based economy, is growing. We have to make sure 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7253"> 7253 </A></B>
<P>
that we spend our resources on the right side of that equation. I 
believe the right side of that equation is in science and technology.
<P>
	Speaking of technology, how do we physically do this? We have 
already established the NSERC program and also the national 
centres of excellence. These centres link all our university research 
programs together so that we do not have duplication going on in 
two or three institutions at the same time. They communicate with 
one another and they focus on how to develop new technologies.
<P>
	It is through this type of system that I believe we should be 
underpinning our new infrastructure spending program. In my 
riding I have one of those schools of excellence at Durham College. 
I know it is looking forward to finding ways to enter and excel in 
the area of science and technology but it needs the resources to do 
that. This is where governments come in.
<P>
	Some people will ask why governments are involved in research 
and technology and should not private industry do that. In every 
OECD country their governments are heavily proactive in the area 
of financing science and technology. Why is that? Industry 
invariably has short term goals, profit maximization. Indeed a lot 
of the people I have talked to talk about how much their profits or 
losses are going to be in the next three months. They do not even 
talk about next year anymore. Their focus is very much short term.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	This is where governments can bring in that long term planning 
and thought horizon which will deliver us and our country into the 
year 2010 with a robust and engineered society. We are 
underpinning the importance of science and technology.
<P>
	In our high schools and post-secondary institutions we have to 
spend more time focusing on where we are going as a country 
economically. I have been surprised by the number of secondary 
schools I have gone to. When I talk to the students they are unaware 
of how our economy is changing. I think it is important for 
government to show leadership in this area, to tell our youth this is 
how the economy is changing and that they very much have to be 
part of that.
<P>
	It is very important that we do not just have a hollow comment 
about the importance of this new economy but that we participate 
in the funding of that science and technology to increase the 
knowledge base that exists in this country.
<P>
	Canada has a tremendous background of success in science and 
technology, in telecommunications sectors, bio-medical research 
and agriculture research and engineering. These are all areas where 
Canada has excelled in the past. We have a nucleus for that which 
exists in our country and we have that within our university 
environments.
<P>
	One thing that is important that I believe any new spending 
program on research and development should underpin is a 
filtration system. By that I mean every project that a centre of 
excellence or NSERC looks at should have a filtering system where 
they actually filter out whether a concept is a marketable concept. 
It talks about the commercialization of basic research.
<P>
	These are the things this budget summation is all about. It is 
looking toward the future, not the past, putting useful and 
meaningful employment in the hands of our young people, looking 
to the year 2010 where Canada can be the leader in the world in 
science and technology.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the 
beginning of his remarks, my hon. colleague congratulated the 
members of the Standing Committee on Finance on their work on a 
report he described as excellent. He failed to mention however that 
this was a majority report that ignored to a large extent the official 
opposition members' input.
<P>
	I would like to draw his attention to the title of this report, which 
is ``Finish the Job''. Does finishing the job, as he said, mean less 
money for research and development, an area he seems to like and 
in which Canada has taken a tumble in terms of its ranking among 
OECD nations? Canada now ranks 18th, while it used to do much 
better than that.
<P>
	Does finishing the job mean bleeding the Canadian public 
service? Does it also mean bleeding Canada Post? Does the report's 
title mean bleeding and taking advantage of the unemployed across 
Canada?
<P>
	I would like my hon. colleague to tell us what he would be 
prepared to do to help the unemployed find a way out and live with 
a degree of dignity instead of being forced onto welfare in a few 
weeks. Will the government just keep shovelling its deficit into the 
provinces' backyards, as it has since taking office?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comment. The reality is unemployment is with us and it is at 
exceptionally high levels.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	Let me clarify one thing. As more people find work in this 
country we have a labour participation rate. Over 600,000 people in 
the last three years have found work and more people are stepping 
up to the pedestal saying they want to get into the labour market as 
well. This is partially why the rate is at 10 per cent.
<P>
	The member possibly did not understand all of what I said. I said 
that through research and technology and our educational 
institutions we have to give the people of Canada new skills. A lot 
of that 10 per cent figure has to do with what I would call structural 
unemployment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7254"> 7254 </A></B>
<P>
	The bottom line is the economy has not changed. It is 
unfortunate but true. It is no different than if we had lived at the 
time of the industrial revolution when we changed from the horse 
to the iron horse, the railway. It is the same kind of technology 
which exists today. We can improve that but there is no quick fix. 
There is no quick fix for the unemployment rate. The real long 
term fix will be to underpin the brain power of this nation. I am 
suggesting that is what the report addresses and beyond.
<P>
	Perhaps the member did not see the first part of the title. The first 
part is: ``1997: The Budget and Beyond''. It is the beyond that is 
important. It is the beyond that builds on the technological 
excellence we have always had in this country and tries to include 
all those people who for various reasons are unable to find work, 
long term work or skilled work. We are developing a society of 
skilled and unskilled workers. We have to lower our pool of 
unskilled workers and increase our pool of skilled workers. This is 
what the report has recognized as the pathway to the future.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order. It is my duty, 
pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the 
question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as 
follows: the hon. member for Frontenac, chemical product 
industry.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last year I rose 
in the House to speak in a similar debate. At that time I raised 
concerns regarding the social deficit in this country, in particular 
the issue of child poverty, and urged the finance minister to do 
something for Canadian children in need.
<P>
	I am a member of the Liberal Party child poverty committee. 
Last year this group of Liberal members spoke to the finance 
minister a number of times and also had an opportunity to meet 
with the Prime Minister and other members of cabinet. We asked 
for an increase in the working income supplement.
<P>
	As a group of House of Commons backbenchers and one Liberal 
Senator, the child poverty group worked very hard and in the end 
our efforts were rewarded. The cabinet, the Prime Minister and the 
Minister of Finance listened and the Canadian children benefited.
<P>
	In the 1996 budget the working income supplement was doubled 
for low income families. This change will increase assistance by 
$250 million a year to 700,000 Canadian families.
<P>
	These are not easy times in which to govern. We must recognize 
the challenges facing the Minister of Finance and applaud his 
efforts to stabilize the Canadian economy. He has taken strong 
measures to correct the previous government's mismanagement of 
the public finances. As a result the confidence of the people in the 
national government has increased. We have exceeded our deficit 
reduction targets, interest rates are lower than they have been for 40 
years and almost 700,000 new jobs have been created.
<P>
	We are getting the economic fundamentals right to create an 
environment of opportunity for job creation. Tough decisions have 
been made to get our economic deficit under control and Canadians 
can take comfort in the fact that we are making prudent judgments 
in a balanced and compassionate way.
<P>
	In light of calls by the Tories and the Reform Party advocating 
income tax cuts, it is imperative that we continue to stay the fiscal 
course. In fact, I conducted a recent poll in my riding and results to 
date show overwhelmingly that over three-quarters of the 
respondents do not favour the policies of the Tories and the Reform 
Party on income tax cuts. Until the debt and deficit are under 
control, income tax cuts are fiscally irresponsible and detrimental 
to the public good. One has to look no further than the extreme 
disparities between rich and poor that have resulted in Ontario from 
the tax cut imposed by the Progressive Conservatives under 
Premier Harris.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	The finance minister has spoken about the plight of poor 
children many times in this Chamber. I know he will continue to 
establish initiatives that seek to better the lives of all children in 
Canada. We must continue to reduce the social deficit in this 
country.
<P>
	Today I would like to address the third deficit we face, the 
ecological deficit. Increased awareness of the causes of 
environmental degradation and the impact on human health ensure 
a high national concern for environmental issues.
<P>
	As human beings, we often forget that we are part of nature, that 
we are in nature and that nature is in us. We are, in some ways, 
disconnected to the natural world. In the words of Edward Wilson, 
biological wealth is the basis of our material and cultural wealth. 
Too many forget this inextricable link and place short term 
economic gain ahead of long term ecological disaster.
<P>
	Thomas Berry, an ecotheologian says in his book <I>The Dream of 
Earth</I>, that the earth community is a wilderness community that 
will not be bargained with, nor will it simply be studied, or 
examined or made an object of any kind, nor will it be 
domesticated or trivialized, except when other living species are 
violated so extensively the human itself is imperilled.
<P>
	He goes on to say that if the earth does grow inhospitable toward 
human presence, it is primarily because we have lost our sense of 
courtesy toward the earth and its inhabitants, our sense of gratitude, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7255"> 7255 </A></B>
<P>
our willingness to recognize the sacred character of habitat, our 
capacity for the numinous quality of the earthly reality.
<P>
	We must remember to be grateful for the biological material that 
we use. We must remember to be courteous to the earth community 
as we use its products. We must be ever mindful of the effect of the 
disposal of waste materials back into the earth.
<P>
	Paul Hawken, author of <I>The Ecology of Commerce</I>, states that we 
currently use 40 per cent of the world's biological production. In 40 
years the earth's population will double. If there is no increase the 
rate of consumption, we will use 80 per cent of what is produced. 
Major ecosystem failure happens at 60 to 70 per cent.
<P>
	We pump toxins into the water, the air, the soil. Some substances 
act as endocrine disrupters and affect the endocrine system, 
especially on developing human and non-human fetuses. Scientists 
have yet to determine a tolerable minimum threshold. It appears 
that the timing of exposure has more significance than the dose. As 
a result, endocrine disruptions play havoc with the reproductive 
and neurological systems of the developing fetus.
<P>
	Some forms of endocrine disruptions, like PCB molecules, are 
persistent and can travel with the wind currents to pristine, isolated 
Arctic areas where they biomagnify as they make their way up the 
food chain. Once absorbed in the flesh of higher order animals and 
mammals, they bioaccumulate. PCB ratings in the milk of Inuit 
mothers is significantly higher than mothers who live in the south.
<P>
	I am pleased to say that we have met, and in some cases 
exceeded, our ozone depletion goals. However, we must work 
harder to achieve our climate change commitments.
<P>
	Environmental problems are complex and multifaceted. They 
require the support of many inside and outside of government. It is 
not only the Minister of the Environment that should champion the 
environment. The Minister of Finance can also support the cause of 
a healthier environment. This starts by greening the budget.
<P>
	I would like to congratulate the Minister of Finance on the steps 
he took in the last budget to begin this process. Changes were made 
to the Income Tax Act that allow for tax incentives for donations of 
ecologically sensitive land. This is an excellent model for 
encouraging conservation. As well, the Minister of Finance and the 
Minister of Natural Resources are looking at removing fiscal 
barriers to energy efficiency investments.
<P>
	These are examples of a good start. I commend the Minister of 
Finance on these initiatives. We must work hard to continue to find 
ways to reduce our ecological deficit. Above all, we must 
remember to show courtesy and gratitude for the biological wealth 
that the earth community provides us, for this biological wealth is 
the basis of all our other wealth.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
comment on the speech given by the hon. member. She said that 
she conducted a survey in her riding or had access to a survey that 
talked about the impact of immediate tax cuts at this time. She 
indicated that was part of the Reform and Conservative platforms.
<P>
	In case she is interested, our platform does not state that. If I 
were to answer that survey I would probably be part of the majority 
that says ``immediate tax cuts at this time are not the proper thing 
to do''. First, we have to create a surplus in the budget. At 
minimum we must balance the budget before across the board tax 
cuts. That is what we are recommending.
<P>
	The only selective tax cut in our fresh start platform is that which 
pertains to the UIC fund. It has a huge surplus and the minister has 
room at this point in time-this is after all the prebudget 
consultation period-to listen to those who suggest that it is a 
payroll tax that could be reduced because of the surplus.
<P>
	I want to make sure the member understands our platform. 
Members opposite continually say that we are in favour of 
immediate tax cuts. This is the second time today we have been 
misquoted. A member even said that in a statement today. That 
view is not accurate. I have already explained our policy on that 
issue. I hope the member will remember that in her future 
references to the Reform platform on tax cuts.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Kraft Sloan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am absolutely delighted that 
the member from the third party has seen the light and understands 
the fiscal reality within which the country operates. I totally agree 
that it is terribly irresponsible for anyone to take on measures of tax 
reduction in the light of budgetary constraints and who this would 
really benefit.
<P>
	If this is the Reform Party platform, the so-called fresh 
start-restart perhaps-then the member opposite should inform 
some of his colleagues. When I hear members of his caucus ask 
questions of the Minister of Finance during question period, it 
seems quite obvious that they are demanding these irresponsible 
tax cuts right now. It would be really helpful if the member 
opposite could help inform his colleagues of what their platform is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, with reference to the questions we ask 
the finance minister in question period with respect to helping low 
income families and addressing the issue of child poverty, there is a 
difference of opinion here. Yes, the child supplement can be 
increased, as the member pointed out in her speech. That has been 
recommended and it will help families to the tune of another $250 
million. That is nice and that is good. But that is not enough and it 
does not go far enough.
<P>
	The Reform platform would offer more. But it is not tomorrow, 
not now. It would have to come when the budget is balanced and we 
all have to work toward that. The government could do a lot more 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7256"> 7256 </A></B>
<P>
by making a lot of cuts, which I will talk about in my speech. The 
government could offer the relief, which can be offered at that 
time, to over 1.9 million lower income families across the board. 
That will truly help lower income people. That will truly help to 
eliminate child poverty because it will be leaving the money in the 
hands of those people who need it the most, those who make the 
least. We are still taxing people who make $12,000 a year to the 
tune of $1,200.
<P>
	If we can target it to those families who are in need and increase 
it, that will help. But it does not help across the board. That is the 
direction we are trying to go in with that issue. That may give the 
impression that we are saying immediate tax cuts now. What we are 
saying is let us look at the fiscal policy of the government, rethink 
it and apply it to help the greatest majority of lower income people.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Kraft Sloan:</B> Mr. Speaker, once again I find myself in a 
position of agreement with the member opposite when he says that 
we have a difference of opinion. We certainly do have a difference 
of opinion, especially when it comes to dealing with the issue of 
child poverty.
<P>
	On one hand, the member talks about funding to one segment of 
the population, but on the other hand his party would cut all 
transfers to the provinces for social assistance programs. If that 
does not hurt poor children, I am not sure what does.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	His party also advocates the cutting of all equalization payments 
and things like that to areas that are in tremendous need. I am really 
glad that we have a difference of opinion on this. As a regional, 
western based party, the Reform Party does not understand the need 
for balance and compassion and putting into prospective all parts of 
the country, different classes of society and making sure that 
everyone has a fair opportunity. That is why this Liberal 
government is firmly committed to creating opportunity for all 
people in this country, not certain regions and not certain groups.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
using my full allotted time.
<P>
	The debate is about the report of the government on the 
prebudget consultation process. I am glad to have this opportunity 
to make a contribution to it and to maybe make some suggestions 
for the finance minister's next budget. I did not sit very much this 
past year on the Standing Committee of Finance, but I did in the 
previous two years so I do understand the process and I will make 
some comments about that.
<P>
	This is really about spending, revenues and handling the affairs 
of this great corporation we call Canada. The Government of 
Canada is empowered to do that. Annual  statements come out, as 
do projections from the finance minister. Let us just see where we 
are going. Based on the information given to us by the government, 
let us see if we are in fact asking the right questions, setting the 
right agenda in these prebudget consultations and asking for input 
to solve the right problem.
<P>
	I maintain, and I have argued this before, we are trying to solve 
the wrong problem. The problem we are trying to solve is just a 
subset of the major problem. The subset that the government is 
trying to resolve and in fact was elected on is setting its spending 
deficit at 3 per cent of GDP. That really means telling the people of 
Canada that this government will only spend 3 per cent more of the 
gross domestic product than what it brings in.
<P>
	The people of Canada said: ``Boy, compared to the previous 
government that is a hell of an idea and we are going to let you guys 
go do it''. The Liberals also told us they were going to create jobs, 
jobs, jobs with this $6 billion infrastructure program. Those were 
the two big promises they made.
<P>
	There is no question that the government has made progress on 
its deficit target. It came in here at the year ending 1994 with a 
deficit of 5.9 per cent of the GDP. To the year ending 1996, the 
deficit is at about $28 billion which comes to a little over 3 per cent 
of GDP. Next year it is projected to be even better and the year 
after, although it is in fantasy land, the government estimates that it 
will be right down to almost 0 per cent.
<P>
	I agree that the government has done well on deficit reduction. 
However, the bar is so low and the target so soft it is easy to do. 
Anybody could do it. Anybody who was finance minister could 
have done what this minister did. How did he do it? When he cut 
program spending over the two-year period from year ending 1994 
to year ending 1996, projected out even to year ending 1997, the 
cuts he made go from $120 billion down to $109 billion. That is 
$11 billion in spending cuts. It sounds great. However, $7.5 billion 
of that was downloaded on the provinces for health care, education 
and welfare. That is why I have suggested anybody could do it.
<P>
	We have had members of the government giving speeches about 
how wonderful it is to be helping the infrastructure of the mind 
through the science and technology development fund and how it 
has already spent $9.5 billion on families with children, but 
because it is giving another $250 million how great and wonderful 
it is.
<P>
	The government should take a look at itself and not be so proud 
of having made cuts on the backs of provinces. The excuse today 
given in question period, ``If you are mad at us for downloading, 
look at what those rotten, dirty guys in the provincial governments 
are doing. They are downloading on the municipalities even more 
than we are. If we are bad they are worse''. Both of them are trying 
to justify something that is dumb.

<P>
	Eliminate useless and wasteful spending and stop catering to the 
special interest groups. Every group that comes to the consultation 
process says: ``Do not touch us. Our group is very important. Look 
at all those other people. Cut them. Find it there''. If that was done, 
how would we ever cut? How would we ever balance a budget?
<P>
	Start saying no to wasteful spending. The government does not 
have the guts to do it. It takes the easy way out. It cuts money to the 
provinces and says to the provinces: ``You do it''. That is what the 
finance minister has done. I do not compliment him for that, I 
criticize him for it.
<P>
	The deficit is fine. It is coming down. What has the government 
done in terms of spending over the last three years? In the year 
ending 1994 the government spent $158 billion. The next year the 
government increased overall spending to $160.7 billion. Last year, 
the year ending 1996, it spent $158.9 billion. That is relatively flat 
in spending, yet the government is bragging about tough times and 
cutbacks. Why is that?
<P>
	The government is adding to the big problem. It is increasing the 
debt. The interest cost to service the debt is increasing. Despite 
lower interest rates, it is still a huge megadollar expenditure for the 
government. What does it do about it? It keeps adding to the 
problem, although not as fast as the previous government. It brags 
about it, but it is not solving the problem. Canada is bleeding to 
death. Canada had a huge wound under the Conservatives but it still 
has a huge cut and it is still bleeding severely under the Liberal 
government.
<P>
	The finance minister bragged a couple of months ago that he had 
broken the back of the deficit at $22 billion or $24 billion. That is a 
joke. Only a Liberal could stand and say that he has broken the 
back of the deficit by spending $24 billion more than the 
government brings in. That is not breaking its back, it is adding to 
the problem. It is adding to the suffering. It is adding to the hurt. 
That is what these financial statements show.
<P>
	What should the government be doing in the consultation 
process? It should be asking the experts of the country, the many 
witnesses: What really is our problem? What will really help our 
economy? If we lower our deficit and spend a little bit less, if we 
still spend more than we bring in but not as much as the previous 
government, will that help? Or should we just tackle the debt?
<P>
	The percentage of debt to gross domestic product is the true 
measurement. That is the challenge. That is the bar which the 
government should set. That is how it should be measured. 
Anybody who is in government, provincially or federally, should 
measure it that way. We all know in business that debt and equity 
are correlated  items. The banks look at the debt to equity ratio. It is 
on that basis the banks lend money.
<P>
	If the finance minister had the intestinal fortitude and truly 
understood economics, he would look at the debt as a percentage of 
GDP. What has happened in that category? What does that show 
us?
<P>
	When we came in here the net debt was $514 billion. That was 
the net interest bearing debt. That has now increased to $586 
billion, a $72 billion increase. The debt has gone up by $72 billion. 
Imagine the interest costs on that alone. The deficit has only been 
reduced by $13.4 billion. Half of that has come from cuts to the 
provinces, which have gone from $42 billion to $28 billion.
<P>
	Thanks in large part to low interest rates, higher tax revenues and 
a $5 billion surplus in the UI fund, we have ended up with these 
financial statements. There has been an increase of $25 billion in 
revenue. I would say that $15 billion to $17 billion of that is 
economic growth. Not all of it is growth. About $10 billion is 
attributable to tax increases.
<P>
	When the finance minister says, as he did today in answer to a 
question from a Bloc member: ``We have not increased personal 
income taxes since we have been here'', that is not true. I know I 
cannot use the word that starts with ``l'' and I will not. I will not say 
that he is the ``l'' word, but I will say that he is definitely 
misrepresenting the situation.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	There are two ways to increase income taxes. One is by raising 
the rate and the other is by reducing, eliminating or tinkering with 
the available exemptions and deductions. For instance, there is the 
labour sponsored venture capital funds which he has reduced. All 
those people who participated, their taxes just went up, thank you 
very much. He did a lot with the seniors benefit and seniors 
pensions. He has tinkered around and he has raised personal 
income taxes. Personal income tax revenue has gone up by over $6 
billion and not all of it is just due to a growth in the economy. This 
points out as far as I can surmise by my analysis of these statements 
that the revenue of the government has increased, the spending of 
this government has stayed level at $158 billion to $161 billion and 
its spending cuts basically match its increases.
<P>
	I submit to the hon. members opposite, please question me on 
this when I am done. Are we really solving the problem or are we 
just attacking a subset of the problem? It is a disease but if it grows 
then one will end up getting really sick and then will die. The real 
problem is the debt. The deficit is a subset of that. Yes, we have to 
eliminate the deficit but the Reform Party would do it sooner. We 
would get there quicker and we would offer some tax relief to the 
Canadian public a lot sooner than what these financial statements 
show.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7258"> 7258 </A></B>
<P>
	As further proof and as my last comment on this topic, it is 
important for Canadians to understand that the debt as a 
percentage of GDP has gone up since we have been here. It has 
gone from 71 per cent to 74.2 per cent. It is going in the wrong 
direction. Our problem is increasing.
<P>
	The Liberals, as wonderful as they think they are, as high as they 
are in the polls and who love to rub it in our faces, are not solving 
the problem. In the long run they are going to pay for it because 
they have had a window of opportunity to do something. We have 
been here advising them on how to do it. Even in the book <I>Double 
Vision</I> we are given credit and the finance minister gives us credit 
behind closed doors for encouraging and pushing because we are in 
tune with Canadians and we know what they want.
<P>
	Just as with Canadian Airlines, the Reform Party knew that the 
tax fuels were too high. Our critic recommended a reduction. We 
knew that the flight attendants and the ticket agents wanted to vote 
in support of a pay cut, even though those who were making only 
$20,000 to $30,000 should not take a pay cut, but they were willing 
to because they loved their jobs. We said to let it go to a direct vote 
and they said no but we forced them to. Now who gets the credit? 
They do.
<P>
	Whoever this Angus Reid is, and whatever poll is saying that the 
Liberals are in touch with the people, crap. They are in touch with 
us. They listen to us and they take our suggestions and then they 
take the credit, but that is okay. As long as it is good for all 
Canadians, I am very, very happy.
<P>
	I do not like the budget consultation process if there is not a 
consensus and they only listen to those they want to listen to. I 
accuse the chairman and his committee of selective hearing. In his 
speech this morning the chairman mentioned that he had heard 
evidence that in the United States the income taxes are 30 per cent 
lower than here and the unemployment rate is 5 per cent. Our taxes 
are 30 per cent higher and our unemployment rate is 10 per cent. 
Does that not tell us something? Lower taxes mean more jobs. 
Lower taxes mean lower unemployment. It should be obvious.
<P>
	Then what did the chairman of the finance committee do? He 
went to great lengths and I think he spent more time than he wanted 
to in saying that in Canada our payroll taxes are lower than in the 
United States and it is proof that lower taxes do not necessarily 
work. I do not see the connection. It does not make any sense to me 
at all.
<P>
	It is sad for me to see the government members and especially 
the frontbenchers take credit for the low interest rates and low 
inflation rate in Canada. How sad to try to take credit for something 
that the Liberals criticized when they were on this side of the 
House. I am not saying that they criticized lower interest rates, but 
they criticized the monetary policy of John Crow. I can find in 
<I>Hansard</I> what the Minister of Finance said. He  said it was totally 
wrong. He said it was totally inappropriate. Now the Liberals are 
reaping the benefits of it and are trying to take credit for it by 
saying that the government is responsible for the low interest rates. 
Bull. Bull. It is sad to see someone try to take credit for somebody 
else's hard work and effort, especially when one is hypocritical and 
contradicts oneself.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	It is also sad when we look at the big problem, which is the debt 
and the high interest costs to service that debt. There are all the 
areas where there is still a huge waste in government spending, the 
billions for business program is what I call it. The government will 
not do anything about that. There are regional development 
programs where it could save some money. There is the size and 
waste in the public service and what they could do to solve that. It 
is a shame that even on criminal justice, young offenders, and all 
those areas the government still continues to use nickel and dime 
solutions to thousand dollar problems. That is the sad part.
<P>
	Eventually the economy is going to turn around. My learned 
friend from Capilano-Howe Sound knows and he pointed out that 
the economy is a cycle. We all know that. What goes around comes 
around. It goes up and down. We are going to hit a period of high 
inflation again. We are going to hit a period of high interest rates 
again. Sure as all of us are in this room, before we pass away we 
will see double digit interest rates again. Even though the rates are 
down at 4 and 5 per cent, they are going to come back. Now we 
have the opportunity to do something about it.
<P>
	The Canadian public is ready for cuts, ready to go through the 
pain, but it has to be done quickly. We have to do the surgery and 
then let the patient recover. By continually operating and tinkering 
with all different parts of the body the poor patient feels like he will 
never get better. He feels like Frankenstein. Quite frankly, that is 
how I would analyse this financial policy of the government, 
Frankenstein.
<P>
	Even the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development countries in their annual report did a study of 
Canada. They blamed the high unemployment rate. Nobody over 
there can figure out why we still have double digit unemployment 
with this wonderful package they have offered the Canadian public 
over three years. The reason is high tax rates.
<P>
	We have the highest tax rates going. On tax rates as a percentage 
of GDP, if we look at where Canada is on a chart, all taxes, 
corporate and individual, are about 35 per cent as a percentage of 
GDP. Compare that to those countries at 24 per cent or 30 per cent 
and we will see the unemployment rate. We will see the correlation. 
That is what this government will not listen to or look at.
<P>
	There are also our generous unemployment and welfare benefits. 
How can we have a welfare program which pays somebody just as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7259"> 7259 </A></B>
<P>
much to stay at home, able bodied people who can work, as 
somebody would get by working for minimum wage? It does not 
make sense. Instead of doing something about that, the government 
ignores it.
<P>
	On unionization, I believe in unions. I believe that employees of 
any corporation or any company should have the right to unionize 
and get together and collectively negotiate against an employer, 
public or private. At the same time both public and private 
employer should have the opportunity to replace those workers. 
But no, the government is going to put Bill C-66 through here. It is 
going to screw up, meddle and make it a mess so that nobody 
knows what a replacement worker is and whether or not they 
qualify. It is going to be a joke and this red tape is costing this 
country billions of dollars.
<P>
	Across the board tax cuts are what is needed once we have a 
balanced budget. That will kick start the economy, not the selective 
cuts like five cents off per hundred dollars in UI as the finance 
minister is doing now.
<P>
	The objective of this country's fiscal policy should be a virtuous 
cycle of lower debt servicing cost. Imagine what this country 
would be like if every year instead of our interest costs going from 
$40 billion when we first came here when we were paying $38 
billion to where we are now paying in excess of $48 billion to $50 
billion and it is going to go up even more, that they would be going 
down. The interest costs would be going down, not just the deficit 
but the interest costs. That would be solving the problem. Then I 
would say the finance minister deserves all these credits those 
backbenchers are giving him.
<P>
	We need to generate a surplus. Then we can offer tax relief and 
then we can pay down some of the debt as well. That is how we 
develop, and this phrase was coined by my colleague from 
Capilano-Howe Sound, a virtuous cycle of lower debt service 
costs. That should be the objective of the finance committee. That 
is what I would empower it to do. Find us a way to get interest costs 
to go down. Give us the suggestions on how to do that and then we 
would be solving the problem and not tinkering around with nickel 
and dime solutions for thousand dollar problems.
<P>
	Get the fundamentals right. The finance minister brags about 
how he gets the fundamentals right. He does not have them right. 
He will not give us a target for a balanced budget, just that we will 
get there someday. He does not attack the debt. He is just on the 
deficit. He will not reduce UI like everybody else said in the 
Standing Committee on Finance. I was there for a couple of 
meetings this year and it was the same old story: reduce the UIC. It 
is a killer of jobs. Reduce it not by 5 cents, reduce it by 60 cents, 20 
or 30 per cent. The Reform Party is suggesting that and we are in 
tune with the  Canadian public, but the government will not listen. 
Make it a true insurance policy.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	CPP is going to have to go up. People are worried about that. So 
CPP will be raised, but UIC will not be lowered. There is a $5 
billion surplus in the fund and it is just being used to pay the 
deficit. That is not right. If CPP is going to be increased at all, it has 
to be offset with a decrease in the UIC so that psychologically 
employees and employers know that overall it is not going up, it is 
just being adjusted to account for the needs and the demands of the 
Canadian public.
<P>
	That is was we have to do. That is how we will create jobs in this 
country if we get the fundamentals right. Those are some of the 
fundamentals and some solutions I see the country needs.
<P>
	Is my time up, Mr. Speaker? Will you give me five more 
minutes?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> It is not for the Speaker to 
give the hon. member five more minutes; it is a matter for the 
House. If the House wishes to give the hon. member five more 
minutes, the Speaker as the servant of the House will give it.
<P>
	Is there consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a couple of things to add to the 
issue. I would like to finish with the CPP. It is a very big issue. 
Currently there is $40 billion in the fund which generates $4 billion 
through interest on loans to provincial governments at low 
prevailing interest rates.
<P>
	We have to fix this. The way to fix it, unlike what the 
government is doing by trying to treat everything separately, is to 
look at the economy as a whole. This is a payroll tax just as UIC is 
a payroll tax and so is workers compensation. When there are high 
payroll taxes, it is a job killer. The government should try to look at 
the collective package.
<P>
	One thing that could be done with CPP and has even been 
recommended is to start working with the fund toward a greater 
growth investment fund rather than just a yield of low interest 
rates. Try to get it into a growth fund where possibly we might luck 
out in a couple of years and have anywhere from 15 to 30 per cent 
growth in it. That is what the Reform Party is recommending with 
its super RRSPs. It would be something which would be run by an 
independent fund manager to let the money grow so that we would 
all be guaranteed our pension benefits down the road.
<P>
	We all know who creates jobs. The government's job is to create 
the economic environment, the right environment for the private 
and public sectors to create jobs. There is room for job creation in 
both the public and the private sector, but the public sector thinks, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7260"> 7260 </A></B>
<P>
feels  and acts as if it is the only engine to fuel the economy. Once 
we balance the budget and offer across the board tax relief, not 
selective cuts, the government and the country will benefit from the 
growth in the economy. A lower overhead and lower spending will 
result in lower taxes which will increase disposable incomes and 
thus through greater demand the private sector, along with some 
public sector services, will create the increase in jobs that is 
required.
<P>
	On unemployment and employment, under the section in the 
report that the chairman of the Finance Committee put forward, the 
words were carefully chosen. However carefully they were chosen, 
they could not hide a dismal record of achievement. The growth in 
unemployment barely kept pace with the increase in population, 
natural and through immigration. That is a sad situation. The 
government pins much hope on job creation by lower interest rates. 
That is going to create a whole bunch of jobs. We hope these 
expectations will be met for the sake of the large number of 
Canadians who are seeking work and who are ready to enter the 
labour force. We will need a long and prolonged period of low 
interest rates and a willingness for people to borrow and spend 
more.
<P>
	There is a lack of consumer confidence for big ticket items and 
that is what is keeping the domestic market restrained. There would 
be increased confidence if income growth lowered the relative size 
of the debt they carry.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	This fact makes income raising tax cuts even more important in 
the restoration of genuine prosperity.
<P>
	In this prebudget fiscal plan and this report we see nothing 
encouraging in this account for the Canadian public. What we see 
is the government not even at a balanced budget, saying how it is 
going to spend anything it gets once it approaches.
<P>
	Heaven forbid, if the finance minister ever gets up and tries to 
say this one more time and to hoist this on the Canadian public, that 
once the deficit in this country reaches single digits, $8 billion or 
$9 billion, then we have virtually a balanced budget and a zero 
deficit.
<P>
	He has said this and that is not true. Just because the OECD 
countries have a different formula and by their standards-crap. If 
there is a $9 billion deficit and if that deficit is not borrowed abroad 
but is borrowed domestically from the public service pension fund, 
it is still a liability. It has to be paid back. Those funds have to be 
replaced even though they are borrowed from oneself. Therefore, 
let not the minister say ever, until he is at zero, that he has a 
balanced budget.
<P>
	We need to work toward the debt, to use the debt as a percentage 
of gross domestic product as our solution. Lower taxes like in the 
States are the solution. That is how we will create jobs in this 
country. I appreciate the extra time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as always, I 
listened intently to the member for Calgary Centre. He started his 
speech, which really set the tone of everything he said, with saying 
that Canada is a corporation.
<P>
	Everybody knows that Canada is not a corporation. The 
Government of Canada is not run like a corporation. The bottom 
line is that the Government of Canada is about dealing with 
people's problems.
<P>
	He went on to talk about the so-called downloading. He used the 
word downloading when talking about reducing transfer payments 
to the provinces. As has been said in this House time and time 
again, we reduced those transfers far less than we reduce our own 
spending.
<P>
	The member is inconsistent. He talks about improving the 
efficiencies of government. Why would we not also want the 
provinces to become more efficient? Should we keep the provincial 
government transfer payments intact while reducing our own 
spending? This does not make sense. Everybody knows in this 
country that we have to add the federal government debt plus the 
provincial government debt to get a total quantum of public sector 
debt in this country.
<P>
	It is only reasonable that we reduce provincial government 
transfer payments. The thing is technology has taken over our 
society to such a great degree. What we are asking governments to 
do is the thing that the business sector did maybe 10 years ago. It 
embraced the concept of newer technology to reduce the cost of 
government. That is what we are asking the provinces to do and 
that is what we are asking the federal government to do.
<P>
	I am surprised that the member from the Reform Party, who 
spent such a great deal of time talking about the importance of 
balancing budgets, has not taken that into realization. We want the 
province of Ontario, the province of Quebec and indeed the 
province of Alberta to each take part in the process of reducing 
government spending and making government more affordable to 
people.
<P>
	He went on and on about the ratio of debt to GDP. I dispute some 
of his figures. As I understand, for the 1996-97 fiscal year he is 
right, it is around 75 per cent of the total debt to GDP ratio. But that 
is projected for the next fiscal year to go down to 74 per cent.
<P>
	In spite of his great long dissertation about the importance of 
using debt to GDP ratio, the bottom line is that we have turned the 
corner on that very important figure. I agree with him, we should 
be focusing on how to reduce government debt.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7261"> 7261 </A></B>
<P>
	It seems most of his discussion surrounds why we cannot do 
it tomorrow. We are in a big hurry. The bottom line is the ship 
of state takes a long time to move. I have come to that realization.
<P>
	This government has done the very important things to move 
that ship of state, whatever it is, 10 or 15 degrees from the course it 
was on.
<P>
	Within the first two or three years it does not look like it is much 
different. As the program continues to impact on government 
spending and debt reduction, that becomes greater and greater. That 
is the course that we are on.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	That is what everybody in this country says to us, stay the 
course, keep on that 15 degrees. They do not tell us to go 30 
degrees or 40 degrees one way or 70 degrees back the other way. 
They tell us to stay the course. It is the Reform Party that wants to 
get off course. This all has to do with timing and how we put our 
plan into place.
<P>
	The bottom line is the reduction in interest rates is related to 
fiscal responsibility. The international and domestic financial 
communities have looked at what governments are doing and said 
yes. What is an interest rate but a risk factor: ``I am going to loan 
you <I>x</I> dollars and you are going to pay me back 10 years from now. 
I think you will inflate the economy. You will print money by 
increasing the deficit. Therefore I want a higher risk factor''.
<P>
	In reality that interest rate component has been continually 
reduced in Canada over the past three years. This tells us that not 
only the domestic financial community but also the international 
financial community believe that Canada has its debt and deficit 
situation under control. Take credit for it? Why would we not? We 
have lived under an administration that did just the reverse. It drove 
interest rates through the ceiling. It is very much a check mark, an 
A+ average by the international financial community.
<P>
	I heard this member talk about across the board tax cuts. The 
same member stood in this House about a year ago and talked about 
the flat tax. Remember the flat tax? We were going to take money 
from the middle class and give it to the wealthy. Now he has a 
different formula. I guess by reform he means reforming his own 
party.
<P>
	In the final analysis most federal government spending is to 
people. The member has not been honest. The member has not said 
what people spending he is going to cut to get off that course 
another 10 degrees or 15 degrees. He did not talk about how much 
he is going to cut the old age pension, et cetera.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have not abandoned the dream of a 
simplified tax system that would feature a single or a dual rate. It 
would generate more money than what this current government 
with its complicated, convoluted, complex tax system has in place 
and which is too stubborn to try to change. I have not abandoned 
that but each speech has its time and we have to stick to the topic at 
hand.
<P>
	He does not agree with my statistics about year ending in 1996 or 
1997, that the debt as a percentage of GDP will be 74 per cent or 75 
per cent but that it is going down in 1998 to 74 per cent. Shame. 
That is unacceptable. When this government came in it was 71 per 
cent and it is going to brag about reducing it to 74 per cent? That is 
the hypocrisy and the master of myth at work at its best. We need a 
debt to GDP ratio of under 50 per cent, and the member knows it.
<P>
	There is this business about how they have made way more cuts 
outside of the transfers to provinces. The figures say to me that for 
the year ending 1998, governments do not figure. The total cuts 
will be $18 billion and $7.5 of that will be on the backs of the 
provinces for health care, education and welfare. Shame on the 
Liberal government that would do that when a Reform government 
in those three categories would have cut only $3.5 billion.
<P>
	The member asked why the government should not take credit 
for the decline in interest rates. Because his government is not 
responsible for the low interest rates in this country. It is not sound 
fiscal management for the government to spend $20 billion more 
than it brings in. The first year that we had $15 billion more than 
we brought in, everybody was all upset. So to brag about a $20 
billion deficit is not good enough.
<P>
	The interest rates are low because of the monetary policy of the 
Bank of Canada under John Crow which has been continued under 
the current governor of the Bank of Canada to keep inflation low. It 
is low inflation that allows for the lowering of interest rates. 
Inflation is low when the demand for supplies and services goes 
down. Then the banks have to do something. To encourage people 
to incur debt and borrow more money banks have to lower their 
interest rates because of what is happening in the economy. It is 
kind of a diabolical situation. Banks lower interest rates when 
things are not moving.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	Lower interest rates lead to increased work in housing and 
housing related products and services. Big ticket items should start 
to move now based on lower interest rates. I agree with the hon. 
member on that point, but to take credit for it, no. I still say the 
government is taking credit for something it does not deserve to 
take credit for. Low interest rates are not a function of the 
government's sound fiscal policy. It is not sound to be adding to the 
problem to the tune of $20 billion plus per year.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Are we still 
rotating speakers, or are we now at questions and comments?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Debate has resumed and 
we are again rotating. There was only one question during the 
period for questions and comments, because it was a rather long 
question. We have already used up the 10 minutes allocated to 
questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, is it not the Bloc Quebecois' turn in 
the rotation? The Liberal Party had its turn, and so did the Reform 
Party. I think it is now the Bloc Quebecois' turn.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I must inform the hon. 
member that the rotation was the following: the hon. member for 
La Prairie had 20 minutes; two members from the Liberal Party, 
namely the hon. member for York-Simcoe and the hon. member 
for Durham, had 10 minutes each; finally, the hon. member for 
Calgary Centre had 20 minutes. After that, it is once again the 
Liberals' turn, and that is why I recognized the hon. member for 
Hamilton-Wentworth.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the 
prebudget debate, particularly because today the finance 
committee submitted its fifth annual report of the Standing 
Committee on Finance entitled ``The 1997 Budget and Beyond: 
Finish the Job''.
<P>
	The finance committee went into quite a bit of detail about 
proposals that would increase and encourage charitable giving in 
Canada. This arises from some of the remarks of the finance 
minister during the 1996 budget debate when he suggested that 
government should be getting out of some services and perhaps 
charities should be encouraged to take up where government is 
leaving.
<P>
	The finance committee held hearings, heard from the charitable 
industry and made a number of recommendations to encourage 
charitable giving both by individuals and corporations.
<P>
	We should remember, however, that when individuals or 
corporations give to charity this money does not go into the tax 
coffers in Ottawa. In a sense every time money is given to a charity 
it is money that is not given in taxes to the government to spend. It 
is given to private corporations to spend.
<P>
	In one very real sense I was disappointed by the finance 
committee's report because while endorsing various measures to 
encourage charitable giving it did not mention about encouraging 
the charitable sector to be more accountable.
<P>
	I have an interest in that because two months ago I tabled before 
the finance committee a report I had prepared entitled ``Canada's 
Charities: A Need for Reform''. This was a result of an effort 
entirely on my part in which I examined the financial information 
returns of about 600 charities and compared them to the financial 
statements of individual charities when I could get them.
<P>
	I discovered that for decades and perhaps forever Canada's 
charitable sector had been managed without any reasonable 
measure of government accountability.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	The most elementary things are lacking in the way charges are 
managed. We do not even have a definition that is more recent than 
1601, the time of Shakespeare. That is the definition Revenue 
Canada uses to define what a charitable organization is when it 
comes to giving and to tax deferral.
<P>
	There are no penalties; there are no measures. Even in the 
T-3010 form, the financial reforms I examined, I found all kinds of 
inconsistencies. Charitable organizations were able not to fill out 
the form adequately because there were no penalties in legislation 
other than revocation of charitable status to ensure compliance.
<P>
	Something very big is at stake. It is not just a matter that the 
finance committee proposed encouraging people to give more to 
charities. It is also the fact the charitable industry is a huge sector 
of the economy. As of 1993 there were 73,000 charities in Canada. 
The revenue going in and out of charities accounts for about $86 
billion.
<P>
	I say to the member for Vancouver East that it is equivalent to 
the GDP of British Columbia. She would know the charitable 
industry, which is basically unmanaged by the federal government, 
has an enormous consequence on the economy in general. In fact 
1.6 million Canadians are actually employed by charities.
<P>
	I examined several areas but I will only give a few instances 
because time is short. Revenue Canada rules would require that 
charities spend 80 per cent of their tax receiptable givings on 
charitable activities. There is a huge loophole in this regard. 
Charities get revenue from a variety of other sources, mainly from 
government and including some other charities like the United 
Way. Only a very small percentage of a charity's revenues in 
general come from tax receiptable donations. Most of it comes 
from other sources. Consequently many charities spend 50 per cent 
of their total revenue, 40 per cent of their total revenue, or almost 
none of their total revenue on actual charitable activities. It is a 
huge loophole.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7263"> 7263 </A></B>
<P>
	To become a charity is as simple as filling out a two-sided form, 
putting names on it and sending it in. The difficulty is that 
someone like myself, a member of the public or a member of 
Parliament cannot even examine that charitable application form 
to see who filled it out. The opportunities for abuse are legion. 
It is a very difficult matter.
<P>
	Worst of all, I hate to suggest that Canadians suspect their 
charities. I am afraid they do. There is lack of guarantee that the 
charity one is giving to is managing its affairs competently. A 
difficulty is the Canadian public thinks that because a charity 
obtains registered status the federal government in some way is 
overseeing the charity and making sure it performs in a competent 
and responsible manner. I regret to say that is not necessarily so.
<P>
	I could have wished the finance committee would have at least 
suggested to the Minister of Finance, in encouraging more 
donations to charities, that he demand at the same time increased 
responsibility, increased openness and increased accountability.
<P>
	In the final analysis Canadians are generous. Canadians want to 
give. However they want to be sure that when they give they give to 
organizations that are accountable and that the maximum amount 
of the dollar they give actually gets to the worthy cause. Right now 
there is no such guarantee.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	I made 64 recommendations and would like to highlight the 
main one. In the next budget I would like to see new regulations 
applied to charities such that the information Revenue Canada 
receives from charities is good, reliable information. To make sure 
it is reliable the government will have to apply penalties. Penalties 
will have to be introduced for charities that do not supply accurate 
information.
<P>
	Once the information is received by Revenue Canada and we 
know it is accurate, Revenue Canada should take advantage of the 
electronic age and put that information on the Internet so that any 
individual or corporation considering making a donation to a 
charity can call up the financial information on that charity and 
know it has been vetted by Revenue Canada and is good 
information. They could see for themselves if the charity is wisely 
spending the money it is receiving from the public.
<P>
	That one move would save billions of dollars which could go 
toward the deficit. It would also give Canadians a sense of 
confidence in the charities to which they are donating and would 
increase spending rather than decrease it.
<P>
	I saw in the report of the finance committee that Canadians give 
less to charities than Americans give because in the United States 
the requirement for openness on the part of charities is much more 
rigorous than it is in Canada.
<P>
	Charities are not the only problem. There is also the problem of 
non-profit organizations that are also tax exempt. There are 66,000 
non-profit organizations ranging from Canadian automobile clubs 
to athletic clubs. They have revenues probably in the area of $40 
billion a year. These non-profit organizations are not accountable 
to Revenue Canada. The financial information returns they send in 
are secret. The public has no access to them. By law in the United 
States any person can walk into the office of a non-profit 
organization and demand to see its financial statements. That is not 
the case in this country.
<P>
	I hope the finance minister and the revenue minister, in looking 
to charities to take up part of the slack left by government as it 
abandons certain areas of social services and health services that 
have traditionally been a part of government and in encouraging 
corporations and individuals to give to these charities, will 
remember that the ultimate responsibility is to ensure these 
organizations are as accountable as government departments.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
rising to speak because of my strong concerns regarding new 
problems that are being created by our focused concentration on 
deficit reduction. The Liberal government has done extremely well 
in reducing the deficit, bringing confidence back to our country and 
ensuring at the same time low inflation and low mortgage rates. In 
all, our Liberal government has been the catalyst in re-creating a 
healthy, vibrant and competitive Canadian economy.
<P>
	Low mortgage rates are putting money back into the pockets of 
consumers and are greatly contributing to increased housing starts 
in Canada. However low mortgage rates are an advantage only to 
those who can afford to purchase a house.
<P>
	It was crucial for our Liberal government to follow the path of 
fiscal responsibility, for by staying this course we will have a 
balanced budget for the first time in over 20 years and will be able 
to start reducing the federal debt in the next millennium a mere 
three years from now.
<P>
	During the 1993 federal election the Liberal Party promised that 
if elected as government it would put Canada's fiscal house in 
order. I am proud to stand in the House today as a member of the 
governing party caucus to say that the Liberal government has kept 
its word. Consequently Canada's fiscal situation is the envy of the 
industrialized world.
<P>
	Though the course we took was necessary, it has also resulted in 
hurt for many Canadians across our great country. Hurt has resulted 
in human misery for an increase in the number of Canadians who 
now live in poverty. Hurt has resulted in many Canadians facing 
difficulties in getting out of a cycle of dependency that is both 
demeaning and destructive.

<P>
	Today I would like to talk about poverty. I encourage the 
government to start working toward improving the situation of the 
Canadian underclass which statistics say is increasing in our 
country, and the quality of life of many people who do not just need 
help, but also need a voice.
<P>
	In January 1996 at the Fraser forum, Chris Sarlo defined the 
``Basic Needs Poverty Lines'' as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A person is defined as poor if they can, at best, afford only the basic physical 
necessities of life. These necessities include: an appetizing and nutritionally 
complete diet; apartment rental accommodation with the number of rooms 
appropriate to family size and with the full complement of essential furnishings, 
household supplies and telephone service; clothing which is purchased new, 
appropriate to the season and with replacement rates assuming normal wear and 
laundering; a full range of regular, preventive and emergency health care, including 
personal hygiene, vision, and dental care; and essential transportation linking one's 
shelter to other basic needs. In all cases, the standard of quality of each of the basic 
needs is that which is considered minimally acceptable in Canadian society.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In a country as rich and prosperous as Canada, all Canadian 
people are entitled to at least these minimal basic needs. But if we 
take these needs one by one, we realize how different reality is. 
According to Statistics Canada, my riding of Vancouver East has 
within it the poorest postal code area in all of Canada. In many 
areas in my riding, poverty is rampant and the daily reality of life 
for people is often as follows.
<P>
	An appetizing and nutritional complete diet. A large number of 
children in my riding have one meal a day and this is in school. Due 
to the unsafe nature of many areas of my inner city riding, some 
schools in my constituency have joined together to start the Kidsafe 
program, which exists to feed and protect local children. This 
community initiative, which offers children a safe place to go to 
during school breaks and after school, began after a young child in 
my riding, who had no place to go to after school hours, was 
physically assaulted.
<P>
	A school's responsibility is not to babysit children. Children 
generally are better off at home where their parents are. However, 
in repeated cases across Canada, many children are better off at 
school and away from their homes. For Vancouver's schools that 
offer the Kidsafe program, this service is very costly and 
demanding. However, the schools' principals and staff are to be 
commended for taking such action and helping children survive in 
a safe environment.
<P>
	Apartment rental. Decent housing is extremely important for all 
of us. How can you have a decent life without decent housing? The 
federal government is currently committed to $2 billion a year to 
subsidize 661,000 social housing units across the country. This 
program has provided a large number of people, many of whom are 
children, single mothers, elderly, disabled and people on social 
assistance with a decent and affordable  place to live. Unfortunately 
the government is devolving to the provinces the authority for 
administering this program.
<P>
	Before I entered politics, I was involved in social housing. I 
administered Casa Serena, a senior citizens home that was built by 
the Italian Cultural Centre Society of Vancouver with the support 
of the federal and provincial governments. I was responsible for 
interviewing the people who applied for accommodation and I was 
appalled to learn of the condition of certain housing facilities.
<P>
	Recently I visited the inner city area of Vancouver East and I can 
assure the House the skid row hotels are places not fit for human 
beings. Over 10,000 Vancouverites live in what is said to be the 
most expensive housing in Canada. These rooms are only 80 square 
feet and have just a bed and hotplate and rent for an average of 
$375 a month. Vancouver East offers concrete evidence that the 
government should stay in the social housing field.
<P>
	Clothing which is purchased new. Many of the students of the 
inner city schools in my riding never wear new clothing. They have 
to count on the charity of others and only if they are lucky will they 
have proper clothing to wear.
<P>
	A full range of regular, preventive and emergency health care. 
These benefits are available for all those who are on social 
assistance, but the moment they start working, they lose all these 
benefits. That is one of the reasons the working poor remain poor. 
They are people who work for minimum wages and have to pay for 
all their benefits, including a portion of child care costs, dental and 
drug costs, and in B.C. medical insurance premiums. Essential 
transportation. The same problems encountered with benefits is 
also encountered with transportation. The working poor are not 
earning enough to meet their basic expenses.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	It is time to take these problems into serious consideration. This 
year the United Nations has given Canada a low ranking for its 
record on child poverty and suicide. In June 1996 the UNICEF 
program of nations report was released indicating that Canada has 
the second highest number of poor children among the 18 
industrialized countries. This is unnecessary and I strongly believe 
that the government has a moral obligation to find workable 
solutions to resolve this grave problem.
<P>
	The United States has the largest number of poor children, 
Finland has the fewest. Among our poor children, the majority are 
aboriginal who at times live in abysmal conditions. Among 
aboriginals, poverty is much higher than among other Canadians, 
suicide is seven times more common, infant mortality twice as high 
and  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7265"> 7265 </A></B>
<P>
the high school dropout rate is 50 per cent higher. What a waste of 
human potential.
<P>
	Some of my colleagues and I have been very concerned about the 
children of the working poor. After much work, we were relieved to 
learn that in the last budget the Minister of Finance partially 
addressed the problem by increasing the maximum annual benefit 
from $500 to $750 in July 1997 and to $1,000 in 1998.
<P>
	When fully phased in, this working income supplement will 
provide an additional $250 million annually to an estimated 
700,000 low income working families, one-third of which are 
single parent families. I was also extremely pleased to find in the 
1996-97 budget a whole section devoted to increased support for 
children.
<P>
	The coming budget must continue the trend toward helping the 
working poor and children living in poverty. My ideal budget 
would include increased assistance to those in need through tax 
credits; continuation of benefits for a period of time to those people 
who join the work force at minimum wage; assistance to make 
people with disabilities full participants in Canadian society.
<P>
	Early prevention programs through Health Canada. It is 
important to help children start their life healthy and in a good 
environment. This can partly be accomplished through the 
continuation and expansion of programs like the Community 
Action Plan for Children and Head Start. Both of these programs 
have been very successful in teaching poor families about nutrition 
and helping them curb violence and in empowering many parents 
in their parental role.
<P>
	Finally, a national child care program. I know that at times the 
federal government has to work with the provincial and territorial 
governments to implement programs. The negotiations which are 
currently taking place between governments is heartwarming. 
Hopefully we will be able to work together and alleviate some of 
the problems that touch people in need.
<P>
	After all, in a 1994 Angus Reid poll, 89 per cent of Canadians 
agreed that child poverty was a priority for government and in 
1995, prior to the federal budget, Canadians listed child poverty as 
one of the top three priorities of government. Let me remind the 
House that wherever there is a poor child there is at least a poor 
parent.
<P>
	The recent report presented by the Standing Committee on 
Finance speaks to the concern I express and I would like to thank 
its members on behalf of my constituents.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I do not like to interrupt the hon. member, 
but her time has expired.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened carefully to my colleague's speech. I cannot  let some of 
her remarks pass without comment. It is a pity, because I had the 
impression that my colleague had a heart, and could be moved from 
time to time by child poverty or the situation of single parent 
families.
<P>
	It is clear from her speech that she is prepared to go to great 
lengths in this area in order to do something for the poorest 
members of society. But she has made a colossal error in her 
remarks about social housing. I am sorry, my dear colleague, but 
despite the promises made by the Prime Minister in 1993 during 
the election campaign, and the promises made by the Minister of 
Finance during the same period concerning social housing, nothing 
has as yet been done.
<P>
	They were going to give money to housing co-operatives so they 
could make improvements. But, since 1993, nothing more has been 
heard. There has been nothing. No money has been made available. 
The same thing goes for construction of new social housing.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	Since 1993, this government has not come up with a red cent for 
building new social housing. It is therefore incorrect to tell 
Canadians that this government is trying to do something about the 
problem of social housing. It is true that the budget shows it is 
paying a certain amount for social housing, but this is for existing 
housing. It therefore has responsibilities towards those residents.
<P>
	Now, this responsibility has been transferred to the provinces, 
but minus the tax points or the money that should go with it. The 
result is that now the whole social housing policy in Quebec must 
be reviewed because the federal government is not meeting its 
obligations, even though they were renewed during the election 
campaign. I would therefore ask my colleague across the way 
simply to rectify what she said about social housing.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Terrana: </B>I do not think I need clarify anything. In fact, my 
colleague is right, we are no longer building new housing. 
Naturally, I am not happy about this, but we have had to take 
decisions to get back on track with our deficit and the economic 
situation of the country.
<P>
	The situation my colleague has criticized is very crucial, but I 
would also like to add that, although the government is turning 
responsibility for the administration of housing over to the 
provinces, it is also going to promise to transfer to them the funds 
necessary to pay for housing in which people are already living.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on this motion relating to the fifth report of the 
Standing Committee on Finance.
<P>
	I must acknowledge the honesty of my colleague across the way 
for rectifying the facts in response to the question I asked. She 
corrected herself with respect to social housing, and gave 
Canadians the truth: that this government has done nothing since 
1993 to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7266"> 7266 </A></B>
<P>
build more social housing. She even gave me a scoop, by indicating  
that she was going to strongly debate in caucus the fact that this 
government is transferring to the provinces the equivalent of what 
the entitlement for social housing would be. I congratulate her on 
the aptness of this remark. I will, moreover, carefully reread 
today's <I>Hansard</I> in order to get all of the details of what she said.
<P>
	This motion on the fifth report of the Standing Committee on 
Finance worries me a little, and the title of the report grabs the 
reader's attention right away.
<P>
	The title of the report, ``Finish the Job'', speaks volumes on the 
Liberals' intentions. When one reads this report carefully, one sees 
that they do, indeed, wish to finish the job, the job they are doing 
on the unemployed, by tightening the requirements for receiving 
UI benefits. To me, then, this is not a reassuring title, when one 
knows very well how the Liberals have treated the public since 
their election. We need only think of the blind cuts this government 
has made in order to do away with its deficit, unprecedented cuts in 
areas as important as health, education and social 
assistance-areas I also care about.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	The government's sole purpose is to reduce its deficit by hitting 
on anything that moves, especially the middle class and the 
neediest in our society. Not those who take advantage of tax 
shelters, not the large corporations or the chartered banks. It prefers 
to attack this part of the population first.
<P>
	Personally, I agree with deficit reduction. Of course I do. We 
used to have governments that could not handle their spending 
power. They would spend taxpayers' money as though it were 
going out of style, and today we have to pay the bill. So it is 
absolutely necessary to reduce the deficit.
<P>
	However, I do not agree with the way the government is going 
about this. As usual, the government is coasting. It is not meeting 
all these problems head on. It is trying to avoid them. Its only 
purpose in life is to tell the public that it is reducing the deficit. 
This is like having a healthy bank account but not using it to feed 
your family. It is like going shopping for groceries but not giving 
these groceries to the people who need them.
<P>
	The family is the Canadian public, which believed this 
government, which was elected because it shouted from the roof 
tops a single word: jobs. Instead of saying it just once, it went so far 
in its hypocrisy as to say it three times. Everywhere we look in the 
red book, it says, not once, but three times: jobs, jobs, jobs.
<P>
	According to the latest forecast given by the Minister of Finance, 
the federal deficit will have decreased by $25 billion between 1993 
and 1998. Let us take a look at how the government managed to do 
that. Personal taxes, in the meantime, have increased by $23.1 
billion since 1993. So there is no longer much of a difference. The  
money comes from somewhere. We must not fool ourselves.
<P>
	Obviously, if revenues increase this way, we can certainly lower 
the deficit. However, have this government's expenditures been 
reduced accordingly? They have been reduced by only $14.4 
billion. So the government is misleading the public to no small 
extent when it says it has reduced expenditures and that the savings 
go directly to reduce the deficit. That is not the case.
<P>
	``Finish the job'' simply means that our taxes-direct or 
indirect-will be increased in the next budget. We run the risk of 
once again paying for the government's lack of understanding, as 
the unemployed are already doing.
<P>
	If people were at least finding work, if our young people were at 
least coming out of our educational facilities with the hope of 
finding a job, if parents could at least ensure a modicum of comfort 
for their children, we could say that the economy is moving and we 
would not have the social problems we are facing now. However, 
this is not what is happening.
<P>
	Our young people are leaving their regions in the hope of finding 
work elsewhere. I say, ``in the hope'', because after a while they 
come back empty-handed.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	What we are also seeing is fathers and mothers who must rely on 
social assistance to survive. What is this government doing? It is 
reducing its deficit on the backs of these people.
<P>
	I repeat, we are in agreement with the principle of reducing the 
deficit, but the way in which this government is going about it, 
despite its promises, is hurting the public badly.
<P>
	One approach the Liberal government has taken, and which is 
still the most unacceptable, is to keep dipping into the 
unemployment insurance fund over the last three years. This is 
nothing but a hidden tax on employment.
<P>
	Of course, they tell us that it is not, but let us ask the following 
question: Where does the unemployment insurance fund surplus 
go? We are talking about $5 billion out of the unemployment 
insurance fund that the government uses every year to lower its 
deficit.
<P>
	They keep trying to make us believe in their discourse that the 
government wants to build up a cushion, for use in the event of a 
recession, for example. However, at the rate things are now going, 
the rate it is taking money out of the fund, the cushion it is trying to 
build up is more like a mattress, a great big overstuffed mattress, 
whose purpose is not to provide for the lean years, but to reduce the 
deficit.
<P>
	We have only to look to our riding offices. What is going on is 
very revealing. We in the Bloc Quebecois regularly meet with 
people in employment centres. I do  not know if members across 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7267"> 7267 </A></B>
<P>
the way do the same. At the present time, employment staff in the 
human resources development centres are being given training to 
explain what the new employment insurance program is all about. 
We know that it will come into effect on January 1, 1997. A number 
of questions have been asked on that point, and the responses have 
been evasive enough to prompt newspaper headlines such as 
``Minister of unemployment insurance-to call it what it is-not 
familiar with his own files''.
<P>
	This is a new insurance regime, a word I choose because it 
describes exactly what we are going to see in 1997: the people will 
be put on a weight loss regime, a diet. For a number of our fellow 
citizens, our constituents, this may turn into a starvation diet.
<P>
	What keeps being repeated in the training courses, what the 
employees, the public servants, are being told, is that the new 
``regime'' is based on the money saved in the unemployment 
insurance fund. Is this not scandalous?
<P>
	This means that as much money as possible must be left in the 
unemployment insurance fund. This fund must be fattened up as 
much as possible, instead of being given to those in need of it. The 
eligibility criteria will be raised so high that, eventually, very few 
will be able to benefit from it.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	When you get elected on a platform of ``jobs, jobs, jobs'', you 
can hardly afford to rationalize taking money out of the 
unemployment insurance fund or premiums. Instead of using the 
unemployment insurance fund surplus to absorb his deficit, the 
Minister of Finance should use that money to deal with the 
unemployment problem.
<P>
	They are applying bandaid solutions right and left. Have these 
people on the other side of the House really weighed the pros and 
cons, have they really thought about the whole unemployment 
question?
<P>
	In my region last month, we lost the dubious honour of being the 
unemployment champions of this country. However, on the 
weekend, according to the latest statistics, we won the trophy back, 
with a rate of 15.1 per cent. That was the worst news they got in my 
region last week.
<P>
	According to the <I>Labour Market Bulletin</I> for the second and 
third quarters of this year, many young people are the main victims 
of the deteriorating situation on labour market.
<P>
	Among young people in my riding, the unemployment rate is 20 
per cent. What is the government doing to turn this situation 
around? It offers young people absolutely nothing. The exodus of 
young people will continue. Of course that means that our regional 
unemployment rate  will go down, but the unemployment rate will 
go up in other parts of the country, in the big cities.
<P>
	I can hardly ignore the disaster that struck my region and 
especially my riding last July. In addition to the damage and the 
buildings that were destroyed, the disaster had an impact on jobs as 
well. Businesses had to lay off 3,000 persons temporarily. Of that 
number, many hundreds have yet to go back to their jobs. The 
tourism industry was hit very hard.
<P>
	At this very moment, we may be seeing an increase in jobs in 
certain sectors like the construction industry. And obviously, there 
has also been an increase in retail sales. That is not thanks to the 
government but as a direct result of the disaster. When a family 
loses everything, it has to replace everything it lost. There are 
hundreds of families in that situation.
<P>
	With all these job losses, you would have thought the federal 
government would have set up a special program to provide 
support for these businesses and the tourism industry and for all 
those who lost their jobs at that time.
<P>
	The government provided assistance to non-profit organizations. 
This assistance came almost immediately, I must admit that. In this 
sector, the government was indeed present, but in other areas, 
where jobs were affected most, the only program offered was to 
owners of businesses who could get federal assistance, provided 
they hired people to do exceptional work. Let me explain.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	Pretend you own a convenience store, a restaurant or a grocery 
store. You have to lay off your employees, your capital is gone 
because the business has been closed for six months, and there is an 
offer to fund a job involving unrelated activities. Try asking a 
convenience store owner to hire a dressmaker. Try asking a 
restaurateur to hire a pump operator. It is that crazy.
<P>
	It is therefore this government, the people opposite, that have 
lost touch with reality. People do, however, want to work. They 
want to re-open their businesses. But it has been difficult. We have 
been unable to find a receptive ear. And yet, we have met these 
people at all levels, ministers too. The results are not there.
<P>
	In his next budget, the Minister of Finance will have to 
recognize, for once, that the people have given enough. They pay 
enough income tax. Employers need support to keep creating jobs. 
If the minister sticks to his present course, he will absolutely have 
to find ways to repair the wrongs he has done.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has, through its members sitting on the 
Standing Committee on Finance, submitted a slew of measures this 
government could use. It is up to you first to read them, examine 
them, study them in depth and remedy the state of this country's 
finances.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the member for the Bloc talking about the 
prebudget run-ups. I just want to get a clear understanding what the 
member would say to this question. If there were one thing the 
Government of Canada could do to help the unemployment 
situation in his particular riding and in the province what would 
that one thing be? Would it be to pour millions of dollars into the 
province and into his riding by way of job creation projects, or 
would it be to give the private sector in the province of Quebec and 
in his riding an incentive through the lowering of taxes and the 
lowering of costs of doing business so that the environment of the 
business community would be such that it could flourish and 
prosper, thus creating more jobs? I want to be clear on exactly 
which one he would choose.
<P>
	If the province of Quebec was in fact a separate state or nation, 
would the member ask those running the country to do exactly the 
same thing?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for giving 
me the opportunity to address issues I did not have time to mention 
earlier. I did not have time to elaborate.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois' approach to making changes has been 
known for some time. Those who have been following the Bloc's 
performance in this House over the past three years know that 
suggestions to improve the employment situation were made to the 
government in several reports, but that, in most cases, as usual, the 
government ignored our suggestions.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	In response to my hon. colleague from the Reform Party, 
regarding specifically the unemployment insurance fund, if, 
instead of using the surplus to absorb the national deficit, employer 
and employee premiums were substantially reduced to ensure this 
fund is balanced, our businesses could already make use of that 
money to create new jobs.
<P>
	As for involving a mix of business people in privatizing public 
functions, different schemes could be considered. The Bloc 
Quebecois suggested several. We are of course in favour of making 
every effort to create jobs. What is happening at present with this 
government? They are talking about subsidies left and right, but 
none are actually granted in any area. Businesses go to the business 
development bank, but nothing happens. There are no programs 
specifically designed for these businesses. It is a disaster, any way 
you look at it.
<P>
	For the time being, what is required is perhaps not so much to 
create jobs as it is to strike a balance. All in all, there were not that 
many jobs created over the past three years. Since we have been 
allowed to speak about Quebec, when Quebec will take over 
manpower training-and I think this is the key to job creation-we 
will be able to train people in those areas where jobs are available. 
All too often, it is in high technology areas where productive and 
well paid jobs are created that employment can be found. Quebec 
could easily train people under those circumstances.
<P>
	Even now, if only Quebec were getting its fair share from this 
government, it could create jobs in almost every sector. In research 
and development for example, Quebec's share currently amounts to 
16 or 17 per cent. This is a very productive area.
<P>
	It is the same with defence. Quebec is not getting its fair share in 
that area either. Give us our share, what is rightly ours, then the 
Quebec government will be able to create productive and well-paid 
jobs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wonder if the hon. member would give us his impression 
of the effect of the high levels of taxation, particularly payroll 
taxes, on the economy in Quebec.
<P>
	I am speaking specifically of the underground economy. It is the 
impression of many people that the underground economy is alive, 
well and thriving in areas of high taxation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, the question is twofold.
<P>
	First, there is the Canada social transfer. To be sure, the federal 
government transferred responsibilities in various sectors, 
including health, housing, as I pointed out earlier, and education, 
without also transferring related budgets. There is no doubt that the 
federal government dumped on the provinces, thus forcing the 
Quebec government to review its social programs, so as to balance 
its budget.
<P>
	As the Bloc Quebecois has been telling the government in this 
House, the whole issue of clandestine work must be reviewed.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	Bloc members sitting on the Standing Committee on Finance 
made a number of proposals on this issue. You can rest assured 
that, in Quebec, the same thought process is going on and the 
Government of Quebec has taken steps in certain areas to control 
this problem. I do not think any politician can oppose such 
measures. At some point, we must absolutely give ourselves the 
necessary means to control clandestine work, something which the 
members opposite are not doing. Yet, they have received, on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7269"> 7269 </A></B>
<P>
several occasions, suggestions from  Bloc members sitting on the 
Standing Committee on Finance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
be splitting my time with the member for Beaches-Woodbine.
<P>
	I begin my speech by commending the government for the job it 
has done on getting the deficit down. Regardless of any of our 
views on the actual details of the budget concerning how the money 
should be spent, we could probably all agree that the country is in 
far better financial shape now than it was three years ago.
<P>
	In 1995-96 the government achieved a budget of $28.6 billion. 
By 1996-97 it is estimated that deficit will drop to $24.3 billion and 
go down to $17 billion or better by 1997-98. In 1992 Canada's 
deficit was double the G-7 average at 7.4 per cent of gross domestic 
product. This was a huge burden on our country and I believe we 
were on the verge of financial ruin. By 1996 our deficit had fallen 
to below the G-7 average and by 1997 will the lowest of all G-7 
countries.
<P>
	While there has been a tremendous cost to achieve these results, 
with many people enduring serious cuts, layoffs or whatever, as a 
country we should feel pleased with the results to date. We are 
enjoying lower interest rates, which is good for the economy, good 
for jobs. It is good for the housing market. It is good for consumer 
spending as people have lower costs when they borrow money. It is 
good for things like purchasing cars. These are all important issues 
in driving the economy and helping to create jobs.
<P>
	Jobs were the key issue when this government ran in 1993. 
Unfortunately they remain the key issue to date. Let us look at the 
positive aspects of our record to date. Since 1993 the country has 
created 670,000 net new jobs. Currently Canada and the United 
States have the fastest job growth of any countries in the G-7 but 
unfortunately we all recognize that more needs to be done.
<P>
	An unemployment rate of 10 per cent is very high and we should 
work collectively as a nation to solve it. There are no magic 
answers to the problem of lowering the unemployment rate but we 
must all appreciate that 10 per cent is far too high. It represents a 
drain on our economy of lost productivity. It represents a waste of 
human potential, a waste of human dignity. We must all come 
together and try to find a solution.
<P>
	I will talk specifically for a moment about two of the more minor 
areas in the budget which are unrelated to the broader macro issues 
of deficit, debt, inflation and jobs. First I will talk about 
expenditures in the environment portfolio.
<P>
	Under the current government budget plan we are scheduled to 
spend roughly $480 million on the Department of the Environment 
by 1998-99. That is an  annual figure. I would like to point out to 
the government, as I see there is a cabinet minister here, that the 
defence budget is roughly 20 times higher. I suggest we would be 
hard pressed to find a Canadian who felt that the defence or 
military threat to our country was 20 times greater than the 
environmental threat.
<P>
	When we look at what people are worried about in terms of 
climate change, air pollution and toxic chemicals in their water 
supply, we would be hard pressed to say those are all very serious 
issues but the military threat is 20 times greater. Not one of us 
would believe for a moment that those numbers are in proper 
proportion. If anything, Canadians would probably want us to 
spend 20 times more on preventing pollution and cleaning up the 
environment than we currently spend on defence.
<P>
	The reason we spend so much on defence is probably that 
concerns about the military and defence have about a 5,000 year 
history while concerns about the environment probably have a 50 
year history. I will leave the issue of defence spending and 
environmental spending to talk about another important issue, 
child poverty.
<P>
<B>(1800 )</B>
<P>
	In his budget speech in 1996 the finance minister asked: ``Why 
not decide together that in 10 years hence increasing child poverty 
rates will be a thing of the past?'' The finance minister should do 
just that. He should decide that increasing child poverty rates 
should be a thing of the past. Each year something in this regard 
should be done in the budget. I know we cannot cure the problem in 
one year, but every year we should put forth a new program or new 
expenditure designed to cure the problem of child poverty.
<P>
	Currently Canada's child poverty rate is only exceeded in the 
OECD by the rates of the United States and Australia. The 
consequences are well documented including poor health, rising 
crime and reduced educational achievement. Campaign 2000, as 
stated in its report card, indicates that child poverty rates in Canada 
have risen 46 per cent since 1989. The exact data for 1994 is not yet 
available but it is estimated the problem has not been alleviated 
with the recovery. Cuts to unemployment insurance expenditures 
and provincial welfare rates have likely offset any gain due to the 
improved employment numbers and the increase in the working 
income supplement.
<P>
	I do not want to just criticize the government. It is also important 
to remind ourselves that current government programs including 
GST rebates, working income supplement, the child tax benefit and 
others prevent another 64,000 children from falling into poverty.
<P>
	Let me talk for a minute about the child tax benefit which pays a 
maximum of $1,020 per child to families with net incomes of 
$25,921 or less. Benefits are gradually reduced as income rises and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7270"> 7270 </A></B>
<P>
eliminated for a family with a net income of approximately 
$67,000 annually and one or two children. Neither the benefit rate 
nor the income level for the benefit reduction is fully indexed to 
inflation.
<P>
	I should like to hammer away on this point. Currently the rate for 
the child tax benefit only goes up, if inflation is above 3 per cent, 
by the amount that inflation is greater than 3 per cent. The first 
three percentage points of inflation represent a real cut to the child 
tax benefit.
<P>
	Although this might not seem like a lot of money in any one 
given year, the accumulated inflation year after year can have a 
huge impact. For example, it is estimated that on a $5.2 billion 
program, which is what we currently spend through the child tax 
benefit, almost $600 million in annual expenditure have been 
eroded away since 1993 when the Liberals were elected. That 
represents a $600 million cut to poor and middle class families 
with children. As a starting point the government should say it will 
protect all programs that protect children from erosion by inflation.
<P>
	Perhaps the government wants to know where to get the money 
from. Since tax brackets are not indexed to inflation we actually 
gain revenue simply by inflation. As the incomes of people go up 
by inflation they pay more in GST and income tax. The Minister of 
Finance and the government as a whole should put some of that 
money into protecting programs that affect children from inflation.
<P>
	I appreciate that my recommendation if implemented would not 
solve the issue of child poverty. Issues such as the general level of 
unemployment, literacy and domestic violence are all part of the 
problem. However I firmly believe small steps are important 
particularly when made in combination. Furthermore, small steps 
will pay off politically for all of us. I ask the government to take 
into account what I have said and implement full inflation 
protection for the child tax benefit.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the hon. member's speech. I know that he 
cares about the issue of child poverty. I also know that he supports 
his government's strategy against the deficit.
<P>
	I do not think he mentioned the enormous problem we currently 
have with the unemployment rate, which exceeds 10 per cent in 
Canada and 12 per cent in Quebec, with the cuts made by his 
government to social programs, and with the fact that over 4 
million Canadians live below the poverty level.
<P>
	His government has demanded tremendous sacrifices from the 
most vulnerable in our society, like the unemployed and welfare 
recipients, but not from rich Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	This is in contradiction with the traditional Liberal philosophy, 
which was based on compassion. A former Prime Minister coined 
the phrase ``just society''. Where is the compassion? Where is the 
traditional Liberal ideal of promoting a just society? I do not see 
any compassion in the government's agenda. On the contrary, the 
government is relentless with the unemployed and with welfare 
recipients, who are the poorest members of our society.
<P>
	I would appreciate it if the hon. member could explain the 
contradiction between his stated concerns about children, and his 
government's policy, which in no way reflects his own concerns.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Knutson:</B> Mr. Speaker, the question the hon. member asks 
is a legitimate one in an age when such significant cuts have been 
made. Certainly some of them have fallen on the disadvantaged in 
society.
<P>
	He asks how we can call ourselves Liberals and how we can call 
ourselves caring. Unfortunately the only answer I can give him is 
that oftentimes the decisions we have made represent the lesser of 
various evils. If we had not made decisions to get the deficit down, 
the country would have been in virtual ruin and somebody else 
would have come in and made those decisions for us. The poor and 
the disadvantaged would have paid the highest price from rising 
interest rates and a country in economic ruin.
<P>
	Certainly the economic system does not work well for all 
Canadians. There are far too many Canadians who are not 
participating in the recovery, far too many Canadians who do not 
have jobs and far too many Canadians who are suffering from the 
restructuring. When we take into account all the decisions the 
government has made and look at them as a whole package, I am 
not sure any other decision maker, whether the Tories or any other 
hypothetical government, could have done a better job on the 
whole.
<P>
	We know many people are hurting. All I can say to Canadians is 
that the worst is behind us. We are now enjoying the benefits of 
lower interest rates. The federal government is the major borrower 
in the country and is enjoying the benefits of lower interest rates in 
the cost of borrowing. We should now push the federal government 
to use some of those savings to try to correct the imbalances and 
unfairness in the economy over the last few years.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for some time 
now some we have had some discussion with respect to the 
situation of our economy. Now that we have surpassed the concern 
of the deficit, or at least now that we have reached the targets the 
government has set for itself, interest rates are the lowest we have 
had in decades and inflation is low.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7271"> 7271 </A></B>
<P>
	There is a great deal of discussion in all corners of the country 
about what should be done now with what is perceived to be extra 
moneys available to ease up the pressures of the deficit situation. 
A great deal of what we here is also about tax cuts. I have some 
serious concerns and recommend that the government should not 
take this direction.
<P>
	Tax cuts are not the solution. Lower interest rates have helped to 
save a great deal of money across the economy. Tax cuts in 
themselves tend to help people with the highest incomes and not 
those with the lowest ones. They tend to lower revenues, which 
means at a time of deficit and high debt there must be another way 
to replenish revenues.
<P>
	It has been done in the province of Ontario where user fees are 
being brought in for just about everything. User fees are a 
regressive form of taxation because they hit everybody equally, 
especially those who have low incomes. They hurt people who are 
struggling at the moment. I do not see tax cuts as a solution to the 
situation of today.
<P>
	The government has to look at the whole issue of how to ease up 
funds, what do do with them and in what areas of society to invest. 
It has to look at how to encourage the creation of jobs, assist people 
in difficult situations and invest in the future and the people of the 
country, the best resource we have.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	I would like to look at what I call the social economy. We tend to 
look at social issues as having something to do with charity and 
social programs as opposed to something directly tied to the 
economy. The two are one and the same. I call it the social 
economic policy as opposed to one or the other.
<P>
	The working income supplement was increased for poor families 
in the last budget. I am glad the finance committee recommended a 
further increase. That will put money into the hands of average 
families. These people do not have extra money. They do not use 
the money for holidays. That money is used to survive. It is used to 
buy products in their communities. It assists the economy at the 
same time as it helps families.
<P>
	We need to address the issue of child care very aggressively so 
that affordable quality child care across Canada is accessible. A 
proper child care program allows people to work. Some family 
members are not able to go to work. Some are working and the 
children are being left in situations which are not healthy and 
nurturing. That does not assist in their development. That affects 
their future ability to produce and contribute to our society.
<P>
	There is the whole issue of child poverty. Child poverty is very 
detrimental to the family. The Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development recommended-and the government is 
now committed to  dealing with it-enhanced child benefits which 
puts money into the hands of families that require it. Again that 
assists in the nurturing of the child.
<P>
	It is no secret that a child who is assisted from birth to three 
years of age or six years of age is an investment in society. These 
children will have a greater opportunity to develop normally and 
compete with the best in the world. We need to invest in the future 
of our children. Otherwise we will not be able to compete with the 
rest of the world. That is reality. That is part of our economy. The 
social costs down the road will be that much less.
<P>
	We must guard our health care system. We must ensure that it is 
protected and that it remains a wholly public system. Health care is 
not only an economic issue. If people are worried about whether 
they will be able to protect their health tomorrow it increases their 
stress. The health of people contributes directly to their ability to 
work and to their ability to contribute to society.
<P>
	In addition, the Canadian health care system enhances the ability 
to attract business. The quality of our health care system is one of 
the reasons businesses come to Canada, as well as the quality of life 
and our safe cities. Money spent in social and physical 
infrastructure attracts business to Canada. That is very positive. It 
has to do with the economy; it is not only a social issue.
<P>
	When we invest in literacy, people are able to work. It is very sad 
that there are jobs going begging in the country which people 
cannot fill. Investing in literacy is investing in people: people are 
able to take the jobs which are available and we are able to compete 
with the world. It is an economic issue.
<P>
	Let me touch on the whole issue of work. We need to look at 
work in a different way. We cannot simply talk about employment. 
We have to look at the quality of work. What does that mean?
<P>
	It is time to look at things such as work sharing and possibly a 
four-day work week. Husbands in my constituency have said they 
would love to be able to work four days so that they could share in 
child rearing responsibilities with their wives. It is social, but it is 
part of the economy and helps the employment situation.
<P>
	Any moneys invested in assisting youth in the transition from 
education to employment or in youth training are very important. 
The recent announcements of the government in this regard are 
excellent. It is investing in people.
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	The Donner report to the government stated that it would like to 
see the government implement a 40-hour week, giving people the 
right to refuse overtime. Overtime in this country has become 
enormous. People go home so stressed that it is affecting families. 
When stress becomes chronic, it affects health, production and  the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7272"> 7272 </A></B>
<P>
economy. Again, it is something else that we need to look at. It is 
very important.
<P>
	We need to find a way to bring together the skills of Canadians in 
a national apprenticeship program. We need to negotiate with the 
provinces an agreement for portability of trade. This is something 
that is very critical. We cannot have people who are trained in one 
province that cannot work in another. It is not a social program. It is 
an economic program.
<P>
	Finally, we must begin to recognize that protecting the 
environment does not kill jobs. It creates jobs. We call them brain 
jobs sometimes.
<P>
	We have tremendous ability in technology that we can sell 
abroad and invest in protecting our environment. At the same time 
it is creating jobs. Protecting the environment not only protects the 
future of Canadians and our planet but it also creates jobs.
<P>
	I want to give a bit of an emphasis today on how to approach 
social infrastructure. When we talk about social infrastructure we 
are talking at the same time about economic infrastructure. The two 
are not separate. They are one and the same. They are very 
interlinked. I want to encourage the government to take that 
direction very aggressively in the next budget.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the remarks by my colleague opposite. She spoke of fine 
principles, job sharing and such things.
<P>
	I am prompted to make a few remarks. Some two months ago, 
the government organized a national conference on young people 
in the new economy. With the job crisis faced by young people, the 
government panicked and wondered what could be done. So it 
invited young people from across Canada-from Vancouver to 
Newfoundland-in order to siphon off their ideas.
<P>
	What was the outcome? Each speaker at the conference had a 
key role in the community. What was the outcome? A sort of 
consensus. I know, because I led a workshop. What appeared to 
come out was that employment problems, both social and 
economic, are regional. I know that in English Canada, when they 
talk of regions, they mean the Rockies and the Prairies. In Quebec, 
when we talk of regions, we mean the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean 
or Abitibi regions, where economic and social realities differ.
<P>
	My question therefore for my colleague opposite is as follows. 
Does she not think that decentralization of powers and funds would 
lead to more activity? My perception of this great Canadian 
Parliament is that we are trying to study a national problem and 
find a national solution. Most of the time, however, we know that 
problems vary from one region to the next, because the realities are 
different.
<P>
	So, would it not be better to involve the regions more and 
decentralize power in order to have solutions to the real regional 
problems?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Minna:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member tends to generalize 
when he talks about decentralization. It depends on exactly what 
we are talking about.
<P>
	If the hon. member is referring to my comments with respect to 
training and education as well as trades and portability, there is no 
question that the needs of the country, because of its vastness and 
regional differences, are different from region to region and 
sometimes within the regions of a province.
<P>
	That does not negate the fact that at the same time the economy 
is national, that we sell ourselves around the world, that we try to 
export the talents that compete around the world. We have broken 
down trade barriers with everybody but ourselves.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	One of the strongest comments I heard continuously throughout 
the human resources committee hearings two years ago was that 
people wanted to see some semblance of principles and objectives 
in the area of trade as well as portability. People wanted to be able 
to move across this land and be able to use their skills regardless of 
whether they are working in Montreal or Vancouver.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
real pleasure to speak to the prebudget debate.
<P>
	I begin by acknowledging the chair of the finance committee 
who has always been extremely fair. He was fair again and did a 
good job of conducting things, speaking from a logistical point of 
view. Again, he has always been more than fair to members of the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	Unfortunately I cannot say very many good things about the 
government members' report on the prebudget hearings. Frankly, I 
think there are a lot of problems with it.
<P>
	I just complimented the member on how he ran the hearings, but 
it was fairly obvious to me and my colleagues that many witnesses 
had the big problems with the whole process surrounding the 
prebudget hearings. People who travelled on either leg of the 
prebudget hearings will acknowledge that we had to cancel all 
kinds of sessions this time round simply because witnesses did not 
show up. Apparently there was some confusion but also people did 
not see the value of appearing before the finance committee once 
again.
<P>
	In fact, there is no question in my mind, if people ever knew they 
no longer know why we are having prebudget hearings. My 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7273"> 7273 </A></B>
<P>
experience has been that a lot of people came and put forward 
issues that had absolutely no chance of being accepted by the 
government. It is acknowledged in the government's report that 
many  social groups advocated all kinds of ideas that simply were 
not on.
<P>
	It is incumbent on the government, if it is going to invite people 
to come and speak before it and spend hours putting together a 
presentation, that it says outright that there is no chance that those 
types of ideas are going to be accepted. In other words, there were 
no clear parameters for the debate. It is even acknowledged in the 
document. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If anything, the success of the Government's approach has intensified the debate 
and transformed it. Advocates of spending cuts now argue that even deeper cuts can 
be and should be made to create room to reduce taxes on the deficit. On the other 
side of the spectrum, the advocates of higher taxes on corporations and ``the rich'' to 
finance deficit reduction now argue more vigorously for this approach and for the 
restoration of spending programs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Committee has preferred to avoid these extremes, supporting instead the 
approaches that are working and which are supported by the broad mainstream of 
opinion as demonstrated in its hearings.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There is a quote from Jordan B. Grant, chairperson, Bank of 
Canada for Canadians Coalition. It states: ``You have savings of 
about $4 billion. Our immediate suggestion is that in this budget 
you put the $4 billion back into the economy''.
<P>
	Obviously Mr. Grant, whom I certainly do not agree with, was 
invited to the hearing, took some time to put forward a report and 
then has it dismissed out of hand. It should have been very clear 
early on that the government had a particular vision and then asked 
people to debate it. That is not what happened. People spent 
countless hours putting together reports and then they were 
completely ignored.
<P>
	Meanwhile, we had all kinds of other people who should have 
been invited before the committee and simply were not. I speak of 
the C.D. Howe Institute, a well known and very reputable 
organization that comments on all kinds of economic matters, that 
was not invited. Neither was the Fraser Institute invited, one of the 
most prominent institutes with respect to economic matters in the 
country. The Atlantic Institute was not invited. It just delivered a 
report on the effect of the $185 billion in subsidies of various kinds 
to Atlantic Canada. That report had a very high profile in the media 
but strangely it was not invited to appear before the finance 
committee.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	The Canadian Taxpayers Federation attempted to appear. There 
was a little bit of a mix-up with respect to it appearing and its 
delegation said it would put it off for a little while. The people at 
finance said: ``That was fine, put it off until next week when we 
return from our trip and perhaps you can come then''. As it turned 
out that was the end of the hearings and its delegation never had a 
chance to come forward. The Canadian Taxpayers  Federation, that 
speaks for about 83,000 people in the country, never had a chance 
to appear before the committee and bring forward its members' 
views.
<P>
	Do not take my word for it. I want to quote from the Alberta 
Chamber of Commerce ``Policy News and Views'' dated 
November 25, 1996. Chamber president Cheryl Knebel states: ``We 
were extremely disappointed by the way this year's consultation 
process was organized. We came prepared to speak to budget 
specific issues like program spending, the deficit-debt, 
interprovincial trade barriers and regulatory overlap''.
<P>
	Ms. Knebel continued: ``There is an expectation within the 
business community that when the government asks for advice on 
the budget process it is prepared to seriously consider views 
pertaining to the issue''. She paid me a personal compliment which 
is nice, but is it is not the point. She goes on to say: ``He pressed to 
refocus the debate on the need to eliminate the federal deficit and 
reduce the debt as a fundamental means of addressing every other 
issue in government but there was just no support''.
<P>
	Obviously the whole thing is way off track. If you do not have 
goal any answer is equally good. People can say whatever they 
want. If there is no clear vision it does not matter what people say 
because the government has not laid down the parameters. It has 
not told the people what it wants. It is pretty difficult to get input 
when people do not know what the input is on.
<P>
	Clearly the process is flawed. People were not coming out. The 
media was not very interested this time round. This should be 
exposed for the sham that it really has become even though initially 
perhaps the intentions were good.
<P>
	I want to mention a couple of things about the report. I 
mentioned a minute ago that the government members on the 
committee had written in their report that the committee has 
preferred to avoid extremes. I am talking here on the one hand 
about spending reductions and tax cuts, and on the other hand about 
increasing spending. It supported instead the approaches that are 
working and which are supported by the broad mainstream of 
opinion as demonstrated in its hearings.
<P>
	The government claims that these are working. Canadians are 
not working. If these approaches are working so well, why are 
Canadians not working? Unemployment stands at 10 per cent. We 
saw this in the Friday unemployment numbers. The premise rather 
obviously does not bear scrutiny.
<P>
	If these approaches are working, why has the government's 
record on child poverty been so poor? It has gone to great lengths in 
the document to talk about the need to address child poverty. On 
the other hand it says its approaches are working. It is fairly clear 
they are not. By the government's own numbers we know that  
child poverty has actually become far worse under the Liberal 
government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7274"> 7274 </A></B>
<P>
	In 1989 a motion was moved in this place which said there are 
one million children living in poverty and that poverty should be 
eliminated by the year 2000. Today the number is 1.3 million. It is 
worse by one-third. I do not understand how the government can 
say that these so-called extremes, like cutting taxes, is somehow 
out to lunch. Looking at the empirical evidence, the government's 
approaches have not worked and we have to start casting around for 
some new ideas. That is exactly what the Reform Party has tried to 
do and we offered that in our minority report. I see my time is up.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member will have 12 minutes 
left if he so wishes the next time the matter comes before the 
House.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CHEMICALPRODUCTINDUSTRY">CHEMICAL PRODUCT INDUSTRY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
week I questioned the Minister of Agriculture about the Pest 
Management Regulatory Agency, or PMRA. This agency is being 
created from services in three departments: Health, Agriculture and 
Environment.
<P>
	The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, or his colleague at 
Health Canada, wants to recover 60 per cent of the costs from the 
sales of pesticides. Our American neighbours only recover 15 per 
cent of the costs, which means that Canadian companies will move 
to the United States to develop their products in that country or that 
farmers will buy their chemicals directly in the United States, 
because they will cheaper there, probably much cheaper. With such 
a cost recovery level, the price of herbicides, insecticides and 
fungicides is going to increase dramatically.
<P>
	Let us now look at the services provided by the PMRA. Il will 
test product safety and also product effectiveness. Companies 
already test the effectiveness of their products, but the government 
wants to redo the testing. The results must show an 80 per cent 
effectiveness over two crop seasons. This type of test was not 
carried out before, but the government now claims that it will 
improve public safety. Does it mean that the public is not safe at the 
present time?
<P>
	Farmers believe that it is up to the market to determine whether a 
given product is effective or not.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	If a product is known to be ineffective, it will be quickly 
eliminated from that market because of a lack of consumers. The 
PMRA also wants to reassess every two to five years all the 
products that it has already certified and not only those that require 
certification. Thus, the PMRA will do costly audits that are not 
really necessary. Producers never asked for such measures and 
these will entail major costs for the agency.
<P>
	Moreover, this 60 per cent cost recovery will be difficult to apply 
to industries that develop low volume consumers' products. 
Consequently, my estimation is that between 21 and 30 per cent of 
products used in pest management will no longer be available to 
agricultural producers if the PMRA goes ahead as expected with its 
cost recovery policy, that is, 60 per cent of the costs.
<P>
	I just outlined very briefly the most important elements of the 
PMRA issue, particularly as it pertains to cost recovery. Thus, in 
light of all the available data, the PMRA will function less quickly 
than its American counterpart. It will cost more, will be less 
efficient, will perform more audits than necessary and there will be 
less products available on the market. Thus, there may be job losses 
and our producers will be less competitive.
<P>
	For the sake of fairness for agricultural producers in Canada and 
Quebec, I challenge the government, particularly the ministers of 
health, environment and agriculture, to review the way the agency 
recovers costs associated with the certification of pest control 
products.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government made the commitment 
to reform the pest management regulatory system to make it more 
responsive to stakeholder needs while at the same time protecting 
the health and environment of Canadians. We are doing so.
<P>
	The fact that cost recovery would be used to implement the 
reformed program was agreed to by the industry and farmers as 
long ago as 1990.
<P>
	I want to inform the member that although the United States 
system appears to cost less, this is quite frankly not the case. All 
states, except Alaska, charge fees on top of the federal fees 
charged.
<P>
	California alone for example recovers about $27 million based 
on $1.2 billion in pesticide sales. In contrast, the PMRA plans to 
charge $15.3 million for $1.4 billion in pesticide sales. That is 
almost half as much or put differently, there is $1 for every $93 of 
sales in Canada as opposed to $1 for every $44.50 worth of sales in 
California.
<P>
	The member will be pleased to know that the cost of the 
reformed pest management regulatory system in Canada is very 
competitive with the costs of other countries such as the United 
States and Britain. The Canadian cost per registered product is 15 
per cent less than in the United States and 30 per cent less than in 
the United Kingdom.
<P>
	The member should be aware of the own use import program. 
This program allows farmers to import products for their own use 
when they consider the registered products on the Canadian market 
to be uncompetitively priced by manufacturers.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7276"> 7276 </A></B>
<P>
	We are putting in place an efficient regulatory system to serve 
the needs of all Canadians wherever they reside in Canada.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion to adjourn the House is now 
deemed to have been accepted. Accordingly, the House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.05 p.m.)
