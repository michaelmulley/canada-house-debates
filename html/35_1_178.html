	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to present to Parliament the fourth annual 
statement on public security. I have just tabled in the House the 
1994 Public Report and Program Outlook of the Canadian 
Security Intelligence Service.
<P>
	This year, for the first time, the CSIS public report provides 
both a review of the current security environment and a 
projection of CSIS resource requirements in future years.
<P>
	As well, in the program outlook section of the public report, 
the service gives detailed breakdowns of both budget and 
personnel levels in this and future years. This is a continuation 
of the government's commitment to accountability and 
openness in the security sector.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	1994 was marked by a number of events involving CSIS. The 
allegations made last summer regarding the service's 
connection with the Heritage Front were investigated extremely 
carefully. In spite of the stir caused by all these events, CSIS 
continued to operate and adapt to a changing world.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	1994 also marked the 10th anniversary of the creation of 
CSIS, our civilian security agency. What a change we now see 
from those early days of 1984 when the Warsaw Pact alliance, 
under the leadership of the Soviet Union, was one of the 
dominant factors in world affairs.
<P>
	In 1984 we were in the middle of an era of east-west relations 
where the focus of security services such as ours was aimed at 
the counterintelligence aspects of protecting national security. 
It could be said that 10 years ago when CSIS came into being it 
was a simpler world. We thought we knew where most of the 
threats came from and therefore targeted our resources 
accordingly.
<P>
	Today we face a very different situation from 10 years ago 
with the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact following the 
collapse of the Berlin wall in 1989 and the end of the 
intelligence struggles of the cold war. We know and are very 
much aware that today's threats come as much from groups and 
individuals as they do from sovereign states. Today's threats are 
targeted as much against economic targets as they once were 
against military objectives. Today's threats involve 
organizations which do not recognize international boundaries 
or jurisdictions.
<P>
	We have also seen the emergence of new national security 
threats, including weapons proliferation and an increase in 
transnational organized crime. Along with the evolution of some 
of the mainstream global linkages such as those in business, 
information and technology, security issues as well have 
become truly global in nature. Just last week we were witness to 
a shocking act of terrorism on the subway lines of Tokyo. These 
senseless acts have a chilling effect on public confidence. They 
bring home immediately and graphically the concerns we all 
have about the continued proliferation of nuclear, chemical and 
biological weapons.
<P>
	Canadians have had to deal with terrorists and acts of 
terrorism. We must continue to do our part to monitor and 
combat international terrorist organizations in order that tragic 
incidents do not repeat themselves.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11100"> 11100 </A></B>
<P>
	CSIS works hard to contribute to the international fight 
against terrorism through its domestic security investigations 
as well as through liaison with foreign counterparts, by working 
closely with domestic police services at all levels and through 
effective consultation and information sharing with other 
government departments.
<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	CSIS helps to prevent terrorists from either entering Canada 
or from using our country as a recruiting or a training ground for 
illegal activities. Coupled with this international co-operation 
is a concerted effort, through the CSIS counter-terrorism 
program, to prevent foreign conflicts from taking root in our 
communities.
<P>
	In order to accomplish this CSIS undertakes a broad range of 
activities such as investigating attempts by terrorist 
organizations to raise moneys in Canada to support terrorist acts 
in other lands, to manipulate members of immigrant 
communities in Canada or establish safe havens for those who 
have committed acts of terrorism in their homelands.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is ironic that the very characteristics of this country that 
give us this quality of life we enjoy in Canada and endear it to 
honest citizens are also the ones that attract terrorists looking to 
escape international justice.
<P>
	International terrorism has become such a serious concern 
that discussions at the highest level will continue. I expect this is 
an issue the Prime Minister will raise at the G-7 summit he will 
be chairing in Halifax in June.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Although serious political violence is most frequently 
manifested in the international arena, it can also find its roots 
within our nation's borders. The Heritage Front affair brought 
home for many Canadians the fact that terrorism has a 
psychological component as well as a physically violent one. It 
brought home the fact that extremist organizations such as the 
Heritage Front operate both in our major cities and in our rural 
communities.
<P>
	It gave Canadians a rare glimpse of how our security service 
investigates the kinds of political extremism that can pose a 
threat to our national security. The Heritage Front affair also 
gave Canadians an insight into the checks and balances which 
were built into the CSIS act.
<P>
	The allegations surrounding the service's involvement with 
the Heritage Front triggered an immediate investigation by the 
Security Intelligence Review Committee, just as the legislation 
intended. This test of the review mechanisms in the CSIS act 
reaffirmed the importance of these mechanisms and confirmed 
that they are generally working well.
<P>
	SIRC conducted a thorough and timely investigation of the 
allegations and presented a report which found that the white 
supremacist movement ``was and is a threat to the security of 
Canada'', that CSIS acted properly in  its dealings with the 
Heritage Front, and that the allegations made against CSIS were 
without foundation.
<P>
	As members of the House know, the service is expressly 
prohibited from investigating lawful advocacy, protest or 
dissent. However, it is mandated to investigate politically 
motivated acts of violence. I am sure that all members of the 
House will agree that racism, neo-Nazism and white 
supremacism have no place in Canadian society and certainly do 
not belong in Canada.
<P>
	The accountability cycle does not end with special reports of 
the Security Intelligence Review Committee. It is important to 
note that in response to the variety of allegations which 
accompanied the Heritage Front affair, the inspector general of 
CSIS prepared a report dealing with the handling of national 
security documents in the office of my predecessor and is also 
preparing a report on the handling of human sources by the 
service. As well, SIRC performs ongoing work in the 
preparation of its annual report, which I as Solicitor General 
tabled in both Houses of Parliament in the fall of this year.
<P>
	Operational accountability is one thing, but in these times of 
restraint and program review there is a need for fiscal 
accountability as well. Last year, for the first time, CSIS' actual 
salary, capital and operating costs were released by me in what I 
referred to at the time as a three-line budget. I should point out 
that this is a major departure from the traditional one-line 
budget that is released by most western intelligence services.
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	This year, in conformity with the changes this government has 
implemented in order to provide members with more 
meaningful financial information, I am pleased to report that the 
CSIS 1994 public report and program outlook provides more 
information than ever before about the service's resource and 
personnel levels. I want to compliment the service on being one 
of the first government departments or agencies to publicly 
release their program outlook documents.
<P>
	Upon examination of the program outlook, and I conclude my 
statement with some comments about this, members will find 
that CSIS is being fiscally responsible and is a full partner in the 
government-wide program review exercise.
<P>
	It will be noted that the service's resource levels will decrease 
from $206.8 million in the 1994-95 fiscal year to a projected 
$159 million in 1997-98. As well, the personnel levels will drop 
from a peak of 2,760 under the previous government to roughly 
2,000 by 1997-98.
<P>
	This means that the service will have to continue to respond to 
Canadian security needs in a manner consistent with the 
government's fiscal targets. I want hon. members to know that I 
have been assured by the director of CSIS that the situation is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11101"> 11101 </A></B>
<P>
manageable and will not compromise Canada's national 
security.
<P>
	I look forward to the comments of opposition colleagues. I 
hope they will agree that the global security intelligence 
environment is a volatile and unpredictable one. I trust they will 
understand that the basic nature of threats to national security 
have changed with the times and that this government and its 
security service are adapting to those changes.
<P>
	I hope members opposite and Canadians as a whole will 
recognize the need in these rapidly changing times for the 
continuance of a domestic security service. We must be prepared 
to deal with threats to our national security. To do otherwise 
would be irresponsible and could lead to the undermining of our 
cherished freedoms and values.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
By passing the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act in 
1984, Parliament established an organization responsible for 
ensuring the security of Canada and its citizens, while at the 
same time providing mechanisms, in the legislation, to fully 
protect the rights and freedoms of Canadian citizens.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I believe those goals are being met by CSIS. I am confident 
they will continue to be met in the future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
of all, I wish to thank the Solicitor General of Canada for 
sending me the notes for the statement he gave today on national 
security.
<P>
	We must keep in mind that, in his 1992 response to the first 
statement on national security, the Liberal member for 
Scarborough West pointed out that then Solicitor General Doug 
Lewis had hardly said anything in his statement, only assuring 
the Canadian public that CSIS was not doing anything illegal. To 
support his statement, the former Solicitor General quoted the 
reports from the Security Intelligence Review Committee or 
SIRC.
<P>
	However, we now know that CSIS acted, if not illegally, at 
least in a highly questionable manner in its dealings with the 
Heritage Front and the Reform Party while the Solicitor General 
was preparing his first statement on national security.
<P>
	As in previous statements, the solicitor general announced 
today that the review mechanism provided under the law was 
tested by the Heritage Front affair. The solicitor general proudly 
said that SIRC concluded that the allegations made against CSIS 
were without foundation.
<P>
	In fact, the statements on national security are silent on this 
and sound pretty much the same year after year. We in the Bloc 
Quebecois-and probably the members from the Reform Party 
and even some Liberal members as well-suspect that today's 
statement by the Solicitor General ignores whole aspects of 
CSIS activities.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	Does CSIS engage in legal or illegal activities? No one 
knows, not even the Solicitor General. According to the 
inspector general for CSIS, the annual reports submitted by that 
service to the Solicitor General do not provide an accurate 
picture of its activities. Consequently, it is nearly impossible to 
think that the Solicitor General can hide from us information 
which may not have been transmitted to him regarding the real 
activities of CSIS, whether these are successful or not.
<P>
	Let me remind you, Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member for 
Berthier-Montcalm pointed out last year, in reply to the third 
statement on national security, that SIRC members are all 
supporters of the Conservative, Liberal or New Democrat party. 
Neither the official opposition, nor the Reform Party is 
represented on the Security Intelligence Review Committee. 
The five members of that committee are not ordinary citizens. If 
you look at the lists of contributors to the federal parties since 
1990, you will see that SIRC members contributed a total of 
about $34,000.
<P>
	The member associated with the NDP distinguishes himself 
from the others by contributing an average of less than $200 per 
year to his party, which may be an indication that the NDP must 
is in poor shape. The Conservative and Liberal SIRC members 
contribute an average of over $2,000 per year to their respective 
political party. The official opposition is asking that current 
SIRC members be replaced, so that this monitoring committee 
can better represent the Quebec and Canadian population, and 
also better reflect the 35th Parliament, as it was shaped by 
Canadians in the October 1993 federal election.
<P>
	The Solicitor General's statement on national security is 
silent on the activities of the Communications Security 
Establishment. Yet, all those involved feel that the CSE, which 
receives its instructions directly from Privy Council, in other 
words the Prime Minister's office, poses a serious threat to the 
freedom of all Quebecers and Canadians. The CSE can easily 
intercept any telephone conversation in Canada, whether these 
communications are transmitted through satellite or the 
microwave toll network. This means that the CSE can intercept 
virtually any long distance or international phone call placed in 
Canada.
<P>
	I may recall what the Deputy Prime Minister said last year in 
response to questions from official opposition members about 
allegations made by a former CSE employee. The former 
employee accused the CSE of spying on Canadian citizens, and 
most Canadian espionage experts confirmed this, but the Deputy 
Prime Minister always gave the same answer, and I quote: ``The 
CSE has no mandate to spy on Canadians''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11102"> 11102 </A></B>
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister never said that the CSE does not 
spy on Canadians. She simply said that the CSE had no mandate 
to do so. The Prime Minister said that the CSE no longer spies 
on Canadians, which implies that the CSE did at one time. 
However, the Prime Minister never repeated what he said 
inadvertently.
<P>
	What do we know about the apparently unwarranted and 
perhaps even unlawful activities of the CSE? Almost nothing, 
except for a few articles by reporters and a book by a former CSE 
spy. No details in the Estimates. Although the most obscure 
council subsidized to the tune of one million dollars provides 
detailed information on its operations, we know nothing about 
the CSE and its activities. Should we simply forget about the 
individual rights protected under the Quebec and Canadian 
charters of human rights, when the CSE is manifestly engaged in 
electronic eavesdropping?
<P>
	The annual statement by the Solicitor General does not even 
mention the CSE.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	I hope that the government, considering the adoption of 
Motion M-38 presented in this House which proposes concerns 
monitoring the CSE through an outside civilian authority, with 
the requirement to report to Parliament, will table as soon as 
possible a bill providing for an external mechanism to monitor 
the Communications Security Establishment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to have this opportunity to 
respond to the Solicitor General's statement on national 
security.
<P>
	The minister is quite right when he states that we are facing a 
very different world than we did 11 years ago when CSIS was 
created. Although Canada was generally considered to be a 
peripheral player in the world of espionage, our proximity to the 
United States made this country a base of operations for hostile 
intelligence services operating against the Americans.
<P>
	The traditional targets of the Warsaw pact nations have 
disappeared and some of our old adversaries are now our 
friends. At the same time, we see a different relationship with 
some of our old allies.
<P>
	Recently the French and Americans quietly expelled some of 
each other's diplomats for activities that were inconsistent with 
their duties. I understand this is the diplomatic way of saying 
these people were kicked out of each other's country for spying.
<P>
	Imagine if the French and Americans, two countries which 
have had cordial relationships going back to the American 
revolution, start spying on each other. Is anyone safe in today's 
environment? We used to be able to rely on our NATO allies to 
put up a common front against the communist bloc. How times 
have changed.
<P>
	Today, the country that is viewed as the greatest threat to 
Canadian sovereignty is none other than our NATO ally, Spain. 
As Canadian and Spanish vessels play out a game of high seas 
brinkmanship off the Grand Banks, Canada is seeking 
diplomatic support among other countries, including Russia. I 
only hope during this confrontation that all Canada's 
intelligence agencies are providing our government with the 
best possible information and analysis that is available.
<P>
	I agree with the minister that there is a need for Canada to 
have a security intelligence capability. The Reform Party 
supports the use of such agencies, as long as they are 
accountable to citizens of Canada.
<P>
	Canada's intelligence services are faced with a rapidly 
changing political environment. How well they are able to adapt 
to it may become evident in the weeks ahead. Let us hope they 
pass the test.
<P>
	Turning our attention to the world of counter-terrorism, the 
minister points to the recent nerve gas attack on the Tokyo 
subway lines as an example. It is interesting that he used this 
example to justify our continued vigilance against terrorist 
attacks. Last year it was the bombing of the World Trade Centre 
in New York. Both these incidents were high profile attacks on 
innocent civilians and both appeared to have involved intricate 
conspiracies. Yet these two attacks had two very different 
groups behind them.
<P>
	The attack on the World Trade Centre appears to have been the 
work of a fundamentalist Islamic group carrying on with its 
traditional battle against what it perceives as American 
imperialism. This incident can probably be viewed as a 
traditional terrorist attack.
<P>
	The nerve gas attack in Tokyo is very different. Here the group 
that is suspected of being behind the terrorist action is a 
religious cult. It is not a group previously thought to be a 
terrorist organization, but rather an eccentric religious cult.
<P>
	We have several religious cults in Canada. Are they capable of 
terrorist activities? Who knows? Does CSIS? Would CSIS be 
monitoring this doomsday cult if it was in Canada? When does 
an eccentric cult go from being a relatively harmless religious 
sect to being a threat to the security of the nation?
<P>
	If an intelligence agency is to be useful, its interest in the 
group has to occur before the attack, not after. The question 
remains: Could CSIS have monitored a similar religious cult in 
Canada and prevented a nerve gas attack in Canada? It likely 
could have done it if the group was an extreme right wing group 
like the Heritage Front.
<P>
	The best known example of Canada's domestic 
counter-terrorism has received a great deal of attention this past 
year. Canadians have had a rare glimpse inside a CSIS 
operation. However a glimpse is all that CSIS, SIRC and the 
Solicitor General seem prepared to give Canadians. The 
minister ad-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11103"> 11103 </A></B>
<P>
dressed the Heritage Front affair to some extent in his speech 
and unfortunately seems convinced that CSIS has acted in an 
exemplary  manner. I will provide the House with a different 
interpretation.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	I have no argument with CSIS monitoring the activities of the 
Heritage Front or similar groups. The manner in which CSIS 
used its human source, Grant Bristow, in relation to Heritage 
Front activities that targeted the Reform Party caused my 
colleagues and me a great deal of concern.
<P>
	CSIS appears to have no problem with one of its sources 
playing an active role in the Heritage Front plan to discredit the 
Reform Party. SIRC appeared to have no problem with this. 
From what the minister has stated, he appears to have no 
problem with this either.
<P>
	I wonder if the Solicitor General would be so understanding if 
the CSIS source had been operating within the Liberal Party 
instead.
<P>
	As the Solicitor General is aware, the subcommittee has been 
meeting with SIRC over the past couple of months in camera 
reviewing its report on the Heritage Front affair. I am confident 
that when our committee goes public once again a very different 
picture of CSIS investigations will appear.
<P>
	One thing the Solicitor General will have to address or 
perhaps readdress is the issue of CSIS sources involving 
themselves in legitimate political parties.
<P>
	The ministerial directives issued in October 1989 by the then 
Solicitor General, the Hon. Pierre Blais, appeared to have been 
ignored. Then we have the issue of CSIS providing reports to the 
government of the day about rival political parties. Is it right 
that CSIS should be providing information to the party in power 
about another political party when it refuses to inform that 
second party? I do not think so.
<P>
	We must not forget the alleged investigation or, as the 
government would prefer, the non-investigation of the leader of 
the Reform Party by CSIS. The SIRC report mentions that in late 
1989 and early 1990, CSIS conducted an investigation into 
completely unsubstantiated accusations about campaign 
funding. The report says the subject of this investigation was 
Lnu Fnu, unknown contributors to the leader of the Reform 
Party's electoral campaign.
<P>
	After a little prodding SIRC later reported that a mistake had 
been made, that during the three-month period the investigation 
actually was on the leader of the Reform Party, but that this was 
just a clerical error.
<P>
	The Solicitor General has continued to try to portray this as a 
clerical error. The cold, hard reality is that on October 17, 1989 
CSIS began a TARC level one investigation on the leader of the 
Reform Party and it ran for three months. Two months after the 
conclusion of this investigation which CSIS knew it could not 
possibly justify, it changed the name on the file to this mythical 
contributor and CSIS, SIRC and the Solicitor General want us to 
believe there is nothing wrong with this.
<P>
	If a domestic security intelligence service is to exist in a 
democracy it must have the support of the people. The Solicitor 
General asks for the support of the opposition parties in 
acknowledging the need for a domestic security intelligence 
service. I ask the minister in return does he expect our party to 
give him any support when there are so many unanswered 
questions about the service's conduct in the Heritage Front 
affair?
<P>
	The Reform Party is not prepared to give either the minister or 
CSIS a blank cheque. The Solicitor General will have to provide 
us with answers to a lot of questions. He should look carefully at 
the reports issued by the previous inspector general about the 
completeness of information that directors of CSIS have been 
providing to the minister.
<P>
	While I can accept the notion that Canada's security 
intelligence apparatus must operate behind a veil of secrecy, this 
does not mean it can hide its mistakes behind this veil as well. 
All government agencies must be held accountable to the 
Canadian people. This is especially true for organizations like 
CSIS and CSE.
<P>
	If the minister wants our support, it is available. Do not expect 
us to buy into something sight unseen.

Parliament act to provide a wider interpretation of the Charter of

	The House resumed from March 27 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-68, an act respecting firearms and other 
weapons, be read the second time and referred to a committee; 
and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rex Crawford (Kent, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to take part in the debate on Bill C-68, a comprehensive package 
of legislative reforms respecting firearms. It amends the 
Criminal Code, the Customs Tariff Act, the Import Export 
Permits Act, the National Defence Act, the Young Offenders 
Act, related regulations and Lord only knows what else.
<P>
	I also want to congratulate the whip and the Minister of 
Justice for enabling me to put my views on the record. It is a 
good sign that members of the government with a different view 
can join the debate.
<P>
	I want to put my perspective, my point of view and my bias on 
the table. I am a gun owner and have been for over 50 years. I 
bought my first gun when I was between eight and nine. I am a 
gun collector and have been for over 30 years.
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
	I have been a hunter most of my life, since the days when my 
father first taught me to shoot a gun on the farm. I am a past 
president of the Dover Rod and Gun Club. I have been involved 
with the local group in the Ontario Federation of Anglers and 
Hunters for over 35 years. I was raised in rural southwestern 
Ontario so guns are a part of my background and a part of life for 
my neighbours and I.
<P>
	We are the many thousands of legitimate law-abiding safety 
conscience and honest citizens. I and other gun owners applaud 
two of the four principal aspects of Bill C-68. I totally support 
the first one on criminal sanctions. It is well known that Canada 
already has some of the toughest gun laws in the world. The 
justice system does not enforce the laws we already have on the 
books.
<P>
	In the bill the criminal misuse of firearms will result in 
mandatory four-year minimum sentences for the following 
offences committed while in possession of a firearm. They are 
attempted murder, manslaughter, criminal negligence causing 
death, robbery, kidnapping, hostage taking, sexual assault with a 
weapon, aggravated sexual assault, extortion and discharge of a 
firearm with intent to cause harm. Upon conviction the offender 
will be prohibited for life from possessing a restricted or banned 
firearm. I feel this should go one step further and should include 
any firearm.
<P>
	Stronger sentences are something that all Canadians favour. 
They are something gun groups have been pushing for years. In 
fact they asked for a minimum of five years. I am pleased the 
Minister of Justice is tackling that aspect of the issue.
<P>
	The second principal section of the bill I fully support deals 
with smuggling and illegal importation. New Criminal Code 
offences will be added to deal with illegal trafficking in 
firearms. That could be the reason the government will be laying 
off 45,000 civil servants, so they will be able to work at the 
border between Canada and the United States.
<P>
	Unfortunately I just heard this morning that another 15 per 
cent of customs officers will be laid off. I am well aware of the 
offices in Sarnia and in Sombra. They have been cut back. If they 
were to check every car for guns that came across the border 
from Michigan, they would have a lineup from Flint, Michigan, 
to London, Ontario, which is approximately 100 miles.
<P>
	At the present time we do not have staff and we do not have the 
money. Yet somehow we will put more people to work. This is 
great, though, if it is at the border.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11106"> 11106 </A></B>
<P>
	The third section of the bill deals with handguns and military 
assault weapons. Some of these weapons should be banned or 
restricted unless the collector can prove their merit. Originally 
in the November 30, 1994 statement in the House by the 
minister all handguns were to be prohibited. I am glad he has 
changed his tune on that one.
<P>
	Bill C-68 now provides that individuals who possessed 
certain handguns on or before February 14, 1995 will be able to 
buy and sell among themselves. Owners of the handguns will be 
able to use them for the purpose for which they were originally 
obtained, whether for target shooting or collecting.
<P>
	I was shocked to discover my handguns are registered for 
protection. There is no classification for protection. Do I now 
lose my collection of handguns?
<P>
	Before I deal with the fourth section of the bill, that of 
national registration, I take the opportunity to outline to hon. 
members exactly what the process is to acquire a legal handgun 
for target shooting. I personally taught FAC safety courses so I 
know how demanding and rigorous they are. Over 16 steps have 
to be taken before people are able to obtain handguns and have 
them in their homes. I will not go into the steps as others have 
covered them.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Some members of the House sincerely believe that guns of 
any size, shape or form are evil objects that must be banned, 
thrown away or kept in a museum. Certain tragic incidents serve 
to remind us of the criminal misuse of guns. The people who 
commit such crimes should be punished to the full extent of the 
law; we should throw away the key.
<P>
	With respect to registration some have made the statement in 
the House that cars are registered and have asked: Why not 
guns? We are comparing apples with oranges. It is the same as 
the lady in California who drove down a sidewalk killing 19 and 
maiming two dozen people. The car was registered. Should any 
further models of the car be removed from production?
<P>
	There will be hundreds of registrations. From where will we 
get the money? We are over $550 billion in debt. Estimates have 
been given from a low of $80 million to a high of $350 million. I 
believe it will cost $350 million. Associates of mine, 10 of them, 
own over 1,000 guns. If we average them across Canada there 
must be at least 21 million handguns and long rifles. 
Registration will not stop anyone from using a gun to kill.
<P>
	The minister stated that in rural areas there have been quite a 
few suicides committed with guns. Who is to blame? I blame the 
government. I know of several suicides which occurred when 
interest rates rose to over 24 per cent and young families could 
not compete. They were losing their farms. The government 
does not mention how many hanged themselves or how many 
gassed themselves, but we lost many young Canadians  during 
those troubling times of the late seventies and early eighties. I 
cannot blame guns for that.
<P>
	There were several polls taken in my riding by myself and 
others. Most of my constituents know where I stand on matters. 
When I was campaigning in 1988 I only made two promises: that 
I work hard for my constituents and that I would bring their 
views to Ottawa and support them. I am here to represent my 
riding. If the majority of my constituents were in favour of a 
national registration system I would act accordingly, but 
surveys show that they are not in favour. One survey was at 87 
per cent, one at 96 per cent, and another at 91 per cent asking that 
I not support Bill C-68.
<P>
	Along with my own personal sincerely held views, I will be 
voting against the piece of legislation. I should like to take a 
minute to quote a letter:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I wish to take this opportunity to thank you for all your help in the past. 
Whenever I have come to you with a problem or concern you were always there to 
offer support and assistance. Although we believe that you have been, and 
continue to be, the best candidate to represent this area, I can not in all good 
conscience support your party in the next election.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I have received hundreds of letters.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-68 deals with firearms and certain other weapons. As we all 
have seen here in the House, support for this bill is not 
unanimous. And we all know that in our ridings, certain groups 
have voiced their support for or their dissatisfaction with the 
bill.
<P>
	Please allow me to put this debate into the current context as I 
see it. Two groups are making representations. One of them is in 
favour of the bill, which aims, among other things, to control 
firearms; the other is opposed to the bill.
<P>
	The group in favour of the bill says that it wants to reduce the 
number of deaths involving firearms. We know that some of 
these deaths are accidental, some are the result of family 
disputes, some are suicides or of, course, some occur during the 
perpetration of other criminal acts.
<P>
	The supporters of firearm controls also support a public 
awareness campaign on the use of firearms and are looking to 
this legislation to provide stricter controls through licences to 
possess weapons, the registration of weapons, the prohibition of 
military and paramilitary weapons, the control of ammunition 
sales and strict restrictions on the use of handguns.
<P>
	Those who oppose the bill believe that the legislation should 
above all target criminals. The group claims that the current 
legislation already sufficiently controls the possession and use 
of firearms for hunting, target practice and collection purposes 
and disputes the claim that the current legislation is not being 
applied. Lastly, this group opposes additional legislative mea-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11107"> 11107 </A></B>
<P>
sures  because it claims that they would pointlessly tax honest 
citizens without actually reducing crime.
<P>
	The bill before us intends to meet the following needs: clamp 
down on smuggling, prohibit the possession of certain firearms 
and restrict the possession of others, institute mandatory 
registration of all firearms and set a certain number of rules 
regarding the purchase, possession, storage, sale, exchange, 
loan, transfer and, naturally, the use of firearms.
<P>
	Which criteria should we use to evaluate this bill? In my 
opinion, there are three. The bill's first aim is to reduce the 
number of lives lost and injuries inflicted because of the use of 
firearms. I presume that everyone would agree that legitimate, 
controlled and careful use of weapons would reduce the risk of 
death or injury. Lastly, I believe that no legislation will ever be 
able to prevent an act of insanity, but that legislation can and 
should increase the probability that the consequences of such an 
act would be less serious.
<P>
	I am concerned about several aspects of the bill before us.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	First of all, I think that the proposed measures against crime 
and smuggling could be made more effective. I also question the 
impact on collectors, competitors and hunters, as well as the 
usability of the registration system. I understand that it involves 
entering into a computer the specifics of all firearms owned 
across the country, but does this registry and the information it 
contains make the system easy to use? Will this registry really 
produce the promised results and, if so, at what cost and is there 
an easier way to achieve the same results?
<P>
	I am not questioning the goals that have been set but the 
advisability of the means used to reach them. I, however, have 
serious reservations about the authority to search without a 
mandate, which is provided under this bill. Sections 98 through 
101 create new powers to carry out inspections anywhere, even 
in residential premises provided that the inspector-not the 
police officer but the inspector-obtains either the occupant's 
consent or a warrant.
<P>
	Under the regulations currently in effect, these powers only 
apply to businesses. The decision to extend their application to 
residential premises will arouse-and is already 
arousing-controversy and may, if this bill becomes law, be 
challenged under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
Clause 101, among others, would require police officers to 
obtain either the occupant's consent or a mandate before 
entering a residential premises. As we know, a justice of the 
peace could sign a warrant for the same purposes and reasons as 
the cases covered under clause 99 regarding inspections, but 
only if entry has been refused or if there are reasonable grounds 
for believing that entry will be refused.
<P>
	In general, although I agree with the bill's goal of reducing 
violence, I am not certain that the bill as it now reads adequately 
serves this goal while respecting the other rights and freedoms 
of citizens. That is why I encourage the various groups and 
individuals to make their views known to the Committee on 
Justice, which will soon hear evidence on this bill. I hope that 
this evidence will help all members of this House, especially 
government members, to improve this bill so that it achieves our 
goals and makes firearms handling safer for people in Quebec 
and Canada, as we all generally hope for.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is difficult to speak on this matter when you come 
from Saskatchewan. In that province the provincial government 
is opposed to the proposed legislation. The opposition parties 
are opposed to it and there is a vocal element that does not seem 
to quit in opposition to the legislation. However, it is important 
to look at and dissect the legislation and examine the different 
aspects of what is being proposed.
<P>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	Over the past year the Minister of Justice has travelled the 
country and talked to different groups and individuals. In effect 
he has been consulting with people as to the proposals 
individuals want or do not want in the legislation.
<P>
	Whenever one comes down with such legislation, few are 
generally happy even though the legislation is generally good 
legislation. The problem which arises is that emotions take over. 
Then neither side wants in any way to give in on any of the 
aspects, to discuss the matter and to determine whether society 
as a whole would benefit from such legislation.
<P>
	The problem the minister has had is to come up with a 
balanced approach. This approach would help to ensure the 
safety of Canadians and would crack down on the criminal 
misuse of firearms. At the same time it would respect the needs 
of hunters and farmers and would respect the rights of legitimate 
gun owners.
<P>
	Quite often one has to be pigeon-holed as to whether one 
supports the legislation or one is against the legislation. There 
are good aspects of this legislation. The parts of the legislation 
calling for increased penalties for use of firearms in the 
commission of offences obviously is very good. It is long 
overdue and certainly will now be in effect. Hopefully the 
provinces will enforce these provisions and not treat them the 
way they have in the past by dealing these penalties away.
<P>
	Those aspects are commendable. One then has to look at the 
other aspects. What about the initiative for controlling the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11108"> 11108 </A></B>
<P>
illegal importation or smuggling of guns into this country? 
There it appears everyone is in agreement. That aspect is good.
<P>
	However, one has to look at that aspect practically. How do we 
control such a provision? Such a provision cannot be effectively 
dealt with without registration. Without registration such an 
aspect cannot be dealt with whatsoever. It appears a phobia has 
taken over with respect to registration, that this is a restriction 
on legitimate gun owners.
<P>
	I own a gun. How the filling out of a page, signing it and 
sending it in to the appropriate authorities is going to restrict me 
in any way with that gun is a matter I do not understand to this 
day. There is absolutely no restriction on legitimate gun owners.
<P>
	We have to deal with the question of registration and what its 
possible benefits are. Sure, we have many legitimate gun 
owners. There are people, the criminal element, who use guns 
and obviously do not register them after they have stolen them 
or come to have them in some other way.
<P>
	We have to make sure the legitimate gun owners show some 
responsibility. Being a legitimate gun owner means storing guns 
properly, which matter has been often overlooked in this 
country. Storage is crucial in keeping guns out of the hands of 
the criminal element which has used this as a source of getting 
guns. There are break-ins to homes where guns are not properly 
stored. Guns are stolen from homes of legitimate gun owners 
who do not properly store them.
<P>
	They have to pay a price for that. That price is an offence if 
they do not properly store their guns. If they do not properly 
store their guns, they will be charged. That matter has been in 
effect for many years, but has not been properly enforced or the 
mechanism has not been in place. With registration there will be 
more responsibility on the part of the gun owners.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	As the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police put it, the 
registration of firearms will help control smuggling, gun theft 
and the misuse of legal firearms. It continued to explain what is 
meant by this.
<P>
	The association indicated that with respect to smuggling, 
guns do not have to be smuggled into this country; they can be 
brought in legitimately. Any member in this House who has a 
proper certificate can bring a dozen guns into the country.
<P>
	Under the current system, the type of guns, the number of 
guns, and the serial numbers of the guns are not tracked when 
they come into Canada. A recent report indicated that customs 
officers are more focused on the value of the gun shipments than 
on any other aspect.
<P>
	Once these guns are in the country, we do not know what 
happens to them. We lose complete track of them as to whether 
they get into the hands of illegitimate gun owners, et cetera. 
That matter will be taken care of if registration comes about.
<P>
	Registration will leave a paper trail. The guns will be traced 
back to the source to determine how they got into illegitimate 
hands, if they have transferred to such hands, once they have 
come into the country.
<P>
	Not always but generally, guns that are stolen have not been 
properly stored. Registration will promote safe storage which 
will reduce gun theft as well as reduce suicides and accidents.
<P>
	One may say, how will it reduce suicides? Safe storage 
generally prevents the gun from getting into the hands of a 
person who is in a temporary state of depression. Again, as the 
chiefs of police so eloquently put it in their report on this matter, 
suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.
<P>
	A person with a problem becomes depressed and if there is 
easy access to a gun, deals with the problem on the spur of the 
moment. If access to the storage container is just a little more 
difficult, especially for young people, and if they do not have 
access to the ammunition, a temporary problem may pass and 
the permanent solution will not occur.
<P>
	Certainly that is an important factor. If we can save some lives 
from suicides, that would be an important factor for us. That 
aspect and the suicides in this country are matters we have to 
look at very closely. It is important to prevent the senseless loss 
of young people's lives, those people who have been unable to 
deal with temporary situations and have immediately dealt with 
them by ending their own lives with a gun.
<P>
	Of course, there is the question of collectors. No one believes 
that collectors should be disarmed of their gun collections. That 
matter can be dealt with in committee. No one indicates that 
firearms safety is not an important factor.
<P>
	What we have to understand is that registration will in no way 
whatsoever cause any restrictions on legitimate gun owners. The 
filing of the certificate once in a lifetime for a gun is not a 
restriction but it is certainly a help to the authorities in enforcing 
the laws. It is not a restriction whatsoever on anyone in society. 
The question really is, what is the problem?

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with pleasure that I rise today to address this House 
and the people of Canada in support of the motion put forth by 
my hon. colleague from Yorkton-Melville.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	This motion suggests that firearms control and crime control 
be addressed separately by dividing Bill C-68 in two. By 
making the two issues of lawful possession of firearms and their 
use for criminal purposes separate, this amendment could help 
introduce nuance and sophistication in this debate on firearms 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11109"> 11109 </A></B>
<P>
use. It seems to me that this would enable us to break the current 
stalemate over Bill C-68.
<P>
	Our proposal is to address separately the administrative 
issues relating to the acquisition, storage and transportation of 
firearms and those legal issues relating to the Criminal Code and 
what to do when offences are committed with firearms. This 
way, the principles of the right to have free disposal of one's 
private property and the right to public security could be debated 
and legislated in a more consistent way. It appears that this 
approach would enable us to deal with the problem of firearms 
use for criminal purposes without criminalizing at the same time 
law-abiding owners who only use their firearms for recreational 
purposes.
<P>
	As it stands, Bill C-68, if adopted, would be a failure in every 
regard. Many legal loopholes remaining unplugged, offenders 
would continue to avoid sentences commensurate with the 
seriousness of their crimes. The deterrent effect of the sentence 
must have an impact on individuals. It has no impact on an 
object such as a firearm.
<P>
	Among the legal loopholes that remain in Bill C-68 is the 
provision for lesser charges than those for violent criminal 
offences. In addition, it would still be possible to plea bargain 
for lesser charges. Finally, this bill does not address the problem 
of minimum sentencing even in cases where it is recognized that 
a violent crime was committed with a firearm. Such 
inconsistencies in the Criminal Code and its enforcement by the 
judicial system are not dealt with in Bill C-68.
<P>
	In other words, this bill would offer no guarantee against an 
eventual outbreak of sensational crimes such as those 
committed by Denis Lortie at the Quebec National Assembly in 
1984, by Marc Lépine at l'École polytechnique in 1989 and by 
Valéry Fabrikant at Concordia University in 1992. Of course, 
you will argue that there really cannot be any guarantee and this 
is a realistic way of minimizing risks. However, when you 
consider the fact that this legal system allowed Lortie to serve a 
minimum sentence and Fabrikant to own handguns in spite of 
the warnings of Concordia lawyers, you quickly realize that 
there is something very wrong with the Criminal Code, both in 
terms of its concepts and its enforcement.
<P>
	Making the necessary amendments to the Criminal Code, 
which would include decriminalizing the storage and carrying 
of firearms, as well as providing strong deterrents and stiff 
sentences when firearms are used for violent purposes, might 
help reconcile the various interests expressed by Canadians. The 
Liberal government could preserve its integrity by fulfilling its 
promise to improve safety at home and on the street, thus 
allowing Canadians to heave a sigh of relief. The opposition, at 
least the Reform Party, would be prepared to co-operate.
<P>
	I want to correct some outrageous claims made on December 
6, regarding the existence of a correlation between domestic 
violence and the availability of firearms.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	I fully agree that violence against women and children has its 
roots in the existence of a sociological and historical power 
relationship. However, I totally disagree with claims to the 
effect that the availability of firearms is a direct and primary 
cause of that type of violence. Firearms are only used as the 
ultimate means of violence; in most cases, victims of violence 
suffer physical or emotional abuse long before their tormentor 
decides to use a firearm.
<P>
	I share my party's position as regards extending the 
monitoring system to include compulsory registration for 
everyone as well as possible confiscation of firearms. It is 
obvious to me that the arguments of the Reform Party against 
such a system are more numerous and better documented than 
those submitted by the Minister of the Justice to support his 
proposal.
<P>
	The minister cannot provide evidence confirming the 
existence of a link between firearms control and crime control. 
In fact, buying, carrying and storing firearms are already 
extensively regulated activities. In spite of the stringent existing 
legislation on the traffic of legal firearms, criminals manage to 
obtain such firearms by relying on other sources such as 
smuggling, the black market, etc.
<P>
	In the absence of any study on the effectiveness of the present 
system, we think it appropriate to adopt the recommendation 
made by the auditor general in 1993 that such a study be carried 
out before consideration is given to extending the regulation of 
firearms at an exorbitant cost of several hundreds of millions of 
dollars. It would make no sense at all to implement other 
regulations, when we still do not know the merits and 
shortcomings of our present system.
<P>
	There is no direct relationship between the control of firearms 
and the control of criminal activity. When we compare the 
situation in Washington, D.C. to that in Switzerland, it is 
difficult to argue otherwise. In Washington, where the 
possession and sale of firearms is prohibited, the homicide rate 
is 81.6 per 100,000 inhabitants. Conversely, in Switzerland, 
where the possession of firearms is almost universal, the 
homicide rate is 1.1 per 100,000 inhabitants.
<P>
	An examination of these statistics leads to the inescapable 
conclusion that a complex assortment of factors-social, 
economic, cultural, political, psychological, symbolic and so 
on-is at work in how individuals and societies approach 
firearms on the one hand and crime on the other. Trying to 
establish a direct link between the control of firearms and the 
control of criminal activity is too simplistic.

	In proposing that Bill C-68 be split into two separate parts, 
my colleague for Yorkton-Melville and the Reform Party are 
making a constructive suggestion that might satisfy all 
Canadians. Helpful criticism and practical solutions have been 
offered in the House by a number of Reformers. I hope that this 
Parliament will have the wisdom and good faith to give serious 
consideration to this motion and to make a commitment to act 
accordingly.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak on Bill C-68 which 
proposes to make changes to Canada's gun control system.
<P>
	I support the efforts of the government in Bill C-68 to impose 
stricter border controls on smuggling, stiffer penalties for 
illegal importation and trafficking of firearms and tougher 
measures on criminals who use guns. I support raising of the age 
to buy ammunition. I fear, however, that the government is 
targeting law-abiding gun owners while trying to get at the 
criminal use of guns. That is why its approach is misguided and 
will not work.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	Canada already has one of the toughest gun control laws in the 
world. It has barely begun to take effect and the government is 
imposing another layer of controls that will do absolutely 
nothing to cut down on crime or improve public safety. Under 
the existing gun law, applicants must obtain a firearms 
acquisition certificate, often referred to as an FAC for which 
they must take a gun course, undergo a police check and wait 28 
days.
<P>
	All handguns are considered restricted weapons. Owners 
must have an ownership permit and register them. Most handgun 
permits are issued to certified gun collectors, sports club 
members or those taking part in shooting competitions.
<P>
	The private ownership of most military assault weapons is 
already banned or restricted.
<P>
	If you want to hunt you must take a mandatory hunting course, 
which also covers firearm handling and safety. The current law 
also includes stringent storage and transportation regulations. It 
is an offence to breach the regulations.
<P>
	This law, although it passed on December 5, 1991, came into 
force in stages. This means that some very major measures did 
not come into effect until very recently. One of those measures 
was the firearms safety education training course needed for an 
FAC.
<P>
	Because many measures in Bill C-17 took effect just recently, 
it is too early to tell what impact they will have. Therefore, it 
follows that it is too early to add other controls such as a 
registration and licensing system which will demand even more 
resources and time to implement.
<P>
	I fear that the government is moving too quickly and in the 
wrong direction with a national registration system. As a result, 
it is law-abiding Canadians who will end up paying from their 
pocketbooks and in their freedoms.
<P>
	Criminals do not register guns. If you intend to commit a 
crime, you are not going to take your gun in and register it the 
day before you shoot someone. We cannot emphasize this point 
enough. They use stolen weapons or firearms which have not 
been properly registered. To assume that registration will 
somehow prevent or even reduce most forms of violent crimes is 
flawed. Creating a registration regime for firearms which are 
rarely used in crimes seems like a plan designed by bureaucrats 
for bureaucrats.
<P>
	The onus is on the Minister of Justice to prove that a national 
registration system will be cost effective and increase public 
safety. He has not done that.
<P>
	There is a disagreement at this time about the number of 
unregistered firearms in Canada as well as the ultimate cost of 
universal registration. Our understanding is that registration 
could cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Neither law-abiding 
firearm owners nor other taxpayers deserve to be burdened with 
an expensive system the minister cannot prove will cut down on 
crime or improve public safety.
<P>
	Taxpayers could be paying for this boondoggle for decades to 
come. If there was any real prospect that the additional 
registration procedure would make a significant impact on 
violent crime, there would be reason to support such a plan. 
However, there is no convincing proof of that.
<P>
	At a time when other levels of government are looking for 
ways to cut costs, it is absurd that the federal government is 
setting up a whole new bureaucracy on an expensive project 
whose value is highly questionable.
<P>
	The government should not be punishing law-abiding gun 
owners when criminals with illegal guns are the real problem. I 
know about law-abiding gun owners because I have brothers 
who are hunters. My father was a hunter and I always wanted to 
be one, but they would not trust me with a gun so I could not go 
with them.
<P>
	It is for these reasons that I back the notion that universal 
registration and licensing be considered separately from 
criminal sanctions and border control. I also believe the 
government should spend more of its energy educating 
Canadians about current gun laws instead of trying to impose 
more controls on law-abiding citizens.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11111"> 11111 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	There is evidence that despite some very good material on 
current gun laws most Canadians lack a basic understanding of 
the measures already in place. Before adding to the law it is 
essential to find out if education programs are working. If they 
are not, let us fix them. Because many people are not aware of 
the control and limits on private firearm ownership, many do not 
distinguish between the legal firearm owner and user and the 
criminal who uses guns.
<P>
	It has been argued that the lack of public awareness about the 
existing law extends to gun owners and law enforcement 
officials. This prevents the law from being applied properly. It 
also may prevent those directly involved in or aware of 
dangerous situations from informing the police and preventing 
tragedies.
<P>
	The federal and provincial governments need to sponsor an 
effective public education program to inform Canadians of all 
aspects of current gun control laws. They should at least wait to 
see if current laws are working before imposing what may be 
unnecessary limits on Canadians. Public safety balanced with 
the rights of legitimate law-abiding gun owners should be the 
guiding principle for any changes.
<P>
	The minister should also remember that for many Canadians, 
especially aboriginal peoples and those living in the north, 
firearm use is a part of their tradition and culture and may be 
necessary for survival. For others such as farmers, hunters and 
sportsmen, firearm expertise is a part of the job or a legitimate 
hobby.
<P>
	The new bill also prohibits gun collectors from leaving their 
guns to members of their families after death. A number of gun 
collectors have come to me very concerned about this. I cannot 
believe the minister understands any of this when he called-as 
he did at the Canadian Club-lawful, responsible gun owners 
who disagree with parts of his bill an American style gun lobby. 
Comments like this show he is not recognizing, let alone 
understanding, the reality of many Canadians.
<P>
	I believe in public safety. I believe in the kind of public safety 
brought about by effective laws that protect the victims and 
punish the criminals. I am not convinced the measures in this 
bill will do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to talk about Bill C-68, the 
firearms legislation.
<P>
	As a representative from rural Ontario I have some concerns 
about the legislation which I intend to address in a minute. I 
want to express both my support and the support of my 
constituents for the minister's objective to curb violence in our 
society. That is the intent of the legislation and I fully share that. 
My constituents share that. It is a worthwhile objective. The 
debate on Bill C-68 is about the best method to curb violence in 
our society.
<P>
	I support a number of the things the minister has proposed. I 
support increased criminal sanctions for the illegal use of a 
firearm. On average right now it is about 16 months for 
committing those 10 designated offences. Under this legislation 
it would be four years, an increase of 300 per cent in the 
sentence.
<P>
	I agree with the sanctions individuals will have to absorb if 
they are caught smuggling firearms. I agree with his direction to 
provincial attorneys if they have evidence not to bargain away a 
firearms offence, go to court and find the individual guilty.
<P>
	I agree with an enterprise crime for the smuggling of firearms. 
If someone is caught doing it, the assets they have gained can be 
seized by the crown and used for further criminal control. I 
agree with increased border controls, recognizing that we will 
not be able to stop every vehicle that crosses the border. If we are 
able to reduce it by 20 per cent or 30 per cent, it is better than not 
doing anything. I agree with his interdiction activities.
<P>
	I was very pleased to hear that the minister agreed there are 
legitimate uses of firearms. He agreed that hunting is a valid 
pastime. He agreed that target shooting is a valid sport. He 
agreed that collectors have a right to collect.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	He talked about the needs for pest control and the needs of 
trappers. I agree with that. I agree with his statement of the 
economic impact hunting has on areas like mine. Every fall 
thousands of people travel to Parry Sound-Muskoka to 
participate in hunting. They have a significant economic impact 
on my area.
<P>
	I hope the committee studying the bill looks at ways of having 
that support better enshrined in the legislation because it is an 
important concept which should be in the legislation.
<P>
	I do not agree with the comments by some of my colleagues 
opposite regarding self-defence. I agree fully with the minister 
that police officers and military officers should carry firearms 
for self-defence. I do not agree with arming civilians for the 
sole purpose of self-defence against criminals. We are not the 
United States. We do not settle our arguments at the end of a gun 
barrel. That does mean there are not legitimate uses like 
hunting, target shooting and gun collecting. We have to make the 
distinction between the two.
<P>
	I have some concerns regarding some of the proposals, 
particularly related to registration. The minister has suggested 
we are going to spend $85 million to register firearms. I want to 
be clear that is the best way to control violence.
<P>
	The minister said registration will not stop a criminal from 
using an illegal weapon. He indicated it will not stop somebody 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11112"> 11112 </A></B>
<P>
intent on killing himself. It probably will not stop somebody 
intent on committing violence against somebody else.
<P>
	I need the committee to demonstrate in its hearings exactly 
what the link is between universal registration and curbing 
violence. I want the committee to look at models from other 
countries to see how it has worked. I want it to come forward 
with statistical data showing that direct link between 
registration and the curbing of violence.
<P>
	I want the committee to listen closely to witnesses, both pro 
and con, so we can understand how this works, registration and 
controlled violence. I want the committee to talk to the people 
who will have to enforce this legislation, the police officers on 
the street who will actually have to enforce this, handgun clubs 
which will be a big part of the enforcement, legal firearms 
owners about how this will work.
<P>
	The committee has to compare the $85 million expenditure 
with some other options. Would $85 million spent on more 
policing be a better way of curbing violence? Would $85 million 
spent on breaking the cycle of poverty in our inner cities be a 
better way of curbing violence? Would $85 million spent on 
education for spousal abuse and protection of battered 
individuals be a better way?
<P>
	In its report I want to hear that any system it eventually 
suggests will be effective. It must demonstrate that directly. It 
has to be efficient, not creating a large bureaucracy and not 
setting up ongoing and escalating costs. It has to be a secure 
system. I want it to tell me it will not be costly to individual 
firearms owners. Most important, I want it to demonstrate it is 
not the first step along the road toward prohibiting all firearms.
<P>
	I support the minister in his objective of controlling violence. 
I support his sanctions against criminals. I support trying to stop 
smuggling. I want to see the benefits of registration clearly 
demonstrated by the committee.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to speak to Bill C-68, 
the gun control bill introduced by the Minister of Justice. The 
purpose of the bill is to tighten controls on firearms, which may 
be seen as a response to the unfortunate incident that took place 
at the Polytechnique more than five years ago. According to the 
polls, a majority of the public is in favour of tighter gun 
controls.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	In fact, for many years nearly 80 per cent of Canadians and 91 
per cent of Quebecers have been asking the government to take 
action in this respect. The public wants access to, and 
acquisition of, firearms to be made more difficult. It wants 
assault weapons to be strictly for military use, it wants handguns 
to be prohibited and it wants stricter controls on the sale of 
firearms.
<P>
	The bill is a partial response to these concerns, and the 
minister will establish a national firearms registration system. 
According to the information we received from the minister, the 
new system is supposed to be the foundation of the gun control 
program. It will be administered by the RCMP, in co-operation 
with the provinces and territories. The system will be used to 
fight the criminal use of firearms by issuing prohibition orders, 
taking action against smuggling, monitoring compliance with 
safety regulations and helping the police to trace stolen 
weapons.
<P>
	The minister tells us the system should pay for itself. It will 
cost an estimated $85 million to implement this measure. In 
December, the minister said that the cost would be amortized 
over five years. In February, he said seven, and that the system 
would generate revenue. I am sorry, but I doubt the system will 
pay for itself. We do not know how much it will cost the 
provinces to co-operate with the federal government, and what 
will be the cost to the general public, both nationally and 
provincially, of sharing the responsibility with the federal 
government, and how much taxpayers will have to contribute to 
make this system an effective one.
<P>
	The minister also said that holders of firearms acquisition 
certificates will not have to spend a single penny to get their new 
licence to own a firearm, and I suppose they do not mind. 
Current firearms owners only have to pay a renewal fee of $60 
five years from now. In some cases, I heard at my office that this 
might be a problem for people who practise target shooting. This 
area is not quite clear to me. Meanwhile, in accordance with the 
new federal creed, the provinces are being asked to help 
implement a system without knowing what the cost will be.
<P>
	A memo from the office of the Minister of Justice, dated 
January 19, said that the government hoped, but could not 
confirm, that current owners of firearms would not be charged a 
fee for a licence to own a firearm. So it is not quite clear whether 
firearms owners who have already paid will have to pay again.
<P>
	The same memo goes on to say that once again, the fee 
schedule will be progressive, in that fees will increase over time 
to encourage the public to register their firearms as soon as 
possible. This is all very praiseworthy, but when we see how 
taxes are going up, the public probably has every right to say: 
``First we will be able to register free of charge but pretty soon 
we will be paying enormous amounts to be able to own a 
firearm''.
<P>
	``Once again, we hope the cost will not be too high during the 
first year'', said the minister. In short, the method for financing 
the system is somewhat obscure, there is some question as to the 
final outcome.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11113"> 11113 </A></B>
<P>
	Another point to be made is that certain weapons will remain 
in circulation. Despite the bill, 13,000 military type automatic 
weapons, including over 4,000 AK-47s will remain in 
circulation due to the system of vested interests. I might be 
tempted to indulge in a little black humour here and say that 
it is really too bad that the unemployed do not own such 
weapons, then they could keep at least one vested interest.
<P>
	Coroner Anne-Marie David held hearings in Montreal in 
November and made certain recommendations. She called for 
simpler and more consistent storage regulations, easier to 
understand.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	She also wanted the regulations amended to force those 
selling weapons to keep them locked or inoperative. She called 
for a specific regulation governing shipments of weapons stored 
and transported by an importer. She asked that weapons be 
confiscated in the case of a second unsafe storage, display or 
transportation offence. She called for a vast information 
campaign to increase public awareness, a request echoed by a 
number of associations of firearms users.
<P>
	None of these measures is contained in the current bill. 
Representatives of the Quebec police force and the Association 
of Police Chiefs told Dr. David that the existing regulations are 
so complex they require police experts to interpret them. How 
are ordinary citizens going to figure them out?
<P>
	Between 1926 and 1992, 64 per cent of the homicides in 
Canada were committed with weapons other than firearms. 
Between 1988 and 1991, 95 per cent of violent crimes did not 
involve the use of firearms, but, rather, kitchen knives, force or 
dangerous instruments. In 1991, 0.3 per cent of violent crimes or 
murders were committed with firearms. For 1991, statistics 
indicate that 67 per cent of violent crimes were repeat offences.
<P>
	Two rights oppose each other in this bill: the right to the 
enjoyment of safety in life and the right to privacy and to own a 
firearm.
<P>
	Like many hon. members, I have received a lot of 
information. This information has come from the person 
responsible for this issue, but also from people keenly interested 
in the matter in my riding. From this information, I would like to 
share two interesting points with the hon. members, if I may.
<P>
	The first is that criminal acts and domestic accidents do not 
involve weapons that are legally purchased and registered, but 
invariably weapons obtained illegally on the black market, no 
matter the calibre and barrel length. I note that the present bill 
contains no provision in this regard.
<P>
	The second is that the minister would be well advised to 
prohibit certain weapons and accessories: certain pistols, for 
example, are no longer made of tempered steel but of a 
composite material combining plastic and carbon, and can pass 
almost undetected through metal  detectors. Airports are 
beginning to give this serious thought. There are also laser 
sights and infrared telescopic sights of use only to hired killers. 
My information indicates further that these items are not used 
for legitimate target practice and are more dangerous than the 
old .25 and .32 calibre handguns and guns with a barrel length of 
less than 105 millimetres.
<P>
	I therefore believe it is important to proceed with this bill. 
People want firearms controlled. But they have to be controlled 
in a way that users living peacefully in the country, for example, 
who want to take a walk on their property, regardless of the time 
of day, and perhaps take a shot at a partridge, are not harassed by 
a system that tries to control things but that fails to get to the 
heart of the problem.
<P>
	I therefore invite everyone, whether they agree or disagree, to 
express their viewpoint to the committee to further enlighten 
those who will have to decide on this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this morning I want to make a few remarks 
about Bill C-68. First I must comment on the fact that the whole 
debate has been derailed. Its basic values have been destroyed 
by much of the rhetoric that has been going on around it.
<P>
	Across the province of Ontario there have been major gun 
rallies sponsored by the Reform Party of Canada. In some cases 
it has been more interested in selling memberships in that party 
than in improving constructively the laws of the nation. That is a 
fact of life.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	Dr. Sobrian from the Omemee area near Peterborough visited 
my constituency a short time ago. It was at exactly the same time 
as we were having a church service and the laying of the colours 
for the airborne regiment. He appeared before a gun rally at a 
high school in Pembroke and was using my name all over the 
place.
<P>
	I do not consider myself to be part of a gun lobby. I consider 
myself to be a parliamentarian who is trying to put something 
constructive into the legislation. Dr. Sobrian would be well 
advised by his cohorts to stay home in Omemee. He does more 
harm when he leaves Omemee and goes into the countryside 
than he would if he stayed at home. I have no hesitation in saying 
that to him because I do not get scared off by such people. We 
have to keep our feet on the ground around here.
<P>
	My decision will be based on my own judgment, not on a lot of 
hype and cursing and swearing by people who would appear to 
be leaders when in fact they are feeding their egos and spreading 
misinformation with their rhetoric.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11114"> 11114 </A></B>
<P>
	The impact of the legislation on the average Canadian has 
to be considered. One has to ask whether making some people 
pay for the justice system for all is fair and just. There are 
people paying for the education system who do not use it. They 
are paying for it the same as everyone else. Why should not 
Canadian people as a whole pay, if it is to serve the justice of 
the country and their safety? Instead we are targeting many 
people who are innocent and law-abiding Canadians. If the 
system is to benefit all, why should not all of us contribute? 
I have no problem in that regard, and I do not own a gun.
<P>
	Training program costs have been mentioned as a great 
inhibitor. The costs for training courses are considerable. People 
are complaining to me about the red tape they have to go 
through. Many police officers whom I have been talking with 
have not taken the training, yet they will be faced with it. There 
are major problems in administration out there.
<P>
	They talk about a coalition of forces. That is not the point. The 
point is providing good legislation with common sense logic, 
fairness and justice built into the system. Decisions based on 
emotions will not stand up over time, but decisions based on 
justice, fairness and common sense will stand the test of time.
<P>
	A lot of the problems, the real hype and the gearing up of 
emotions started with incidents such as the murder at the Just 
Desserts restaurant in Toronto. In Montreal and in the Quebec 
legislature such incidents were quickly linked to all guns in 
general. That was wrong. It should be targeted to certain 
weapons and not to people who are capable of handling weapons 
safely.
<P>
	It is unfair to attribute the problem we are facing today in part 
to everyday honest people. The ferociousness of the debate does 
not make for constructive solutions. I have heard some very 
outlandish speeches in the House and more outside it.
<P>
	Guns increase violence is the saying, but what about countries 
where there are guns in nearly every home and there is no 
violence?
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	I quote from a very good speech delivered by the hon. member 
for Cochrane-Superior two weeks ago yesterday:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A number of inquiries conducted in various countries have shown there is no 
connection between the percentage of crimes involving firearms and the degree 
of regulation of firearms in that country. In countries with a very low rate of 
violent crimes or homicide like Japan or Switzerland, the presence or absence of 
firearms is irrelevant. However making young people socially responsible, 
giving them a good education and warning them against criminal behaviour, is a 
major factor in producing low crime rates.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If we look at Switzerland, by its nature over many years it has 
been a fully armed nation as far as its citizenry is concerned yet 
has one of the lowest crime rates in the world.
<P>
	It is a culture. It is the enforcement of law. It is the values we 
put into society. It is the way we train people generation after 
generation. That will improve the legal system and the courts by 
taking away plea bargaining in such cases.
<P>
	The justice minister has made a good start in the legislation. 
Let us make the justice system work and not have people on the 
streets who should not be there, not have innocent people 
become victims of law and become criminals by virtue of it. 
Because of lack of information or indeed a lack of memory, if 
someone forgets to do something, according the act as it is 
written now he would be charged under the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Nobody would argue about the need for anti-smuggling 
legislation. It is motherhood. It is necessity. Everyone in 
Canada, gun owners and non-gun owners alike, would support 
restrictions against smuggling. On the possession of stolen 
weapons outdoor sportsmen's clubs would support restrictions 
on that. They enforce laws within their own clubs, their own 
bylaws or their own regulations. They have very severe rules in 
that regard.
<P>
	Export-import laws are great. They prevent the inflow or 
outflow of illegal arms. We have a 4,000-mile boundary to 
handle and it is very difficult to control border problems. With a 
4,000-mile border we will have a challenge on our hands with 
the export-import laws. However it must be done and I give the 
minister credit for bringing forward that part.
<P>
	No one should be in illegal possession of a firearm. There is a 
charge in that regard. We should get rid of plea bargaining and 
the minister has done part of it.
<P>
	There is absolutely no sympathy out there for illegal 
trafficking of firearms, not by sportsmen or anyone else. They 
know if people with firearms get into trouble it will impact on 
them. The message is immediately spread on radio stations, TV 
stations and newspapers. It is very easy to start the hype that 
everything is wrong in society when certain things should be 
corrected.
<P>
	The minimum sentence of four years for a list of 10 crimes is a 
good start. The court system, plea bargaining and the justice 
system must generally be upgraded and enforced. It is supported 
by the general public. There will be no pity on anyone who 
allows the system to deteriorate in any way. Canadians want the 
sentence to fit the crime.
<P>
	This is my fourth time around on gun legislation. None of 
them has been easy. None of them has been very productive in 
the sense of the rhetoric used. We keep coming forward with 
legislation. As time goes on we must pass legislation to deal 
with the times. We are going through difficult times but let us 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11115"> 11115 </A></B>
<P>
remember that the good things in this bill can be supported by 
almost every  Canadian. However, there are matters in it that 
affect the average Canadian. These must be corrected. There are 
things in this bill that affect estates. I want to see some of those 
corrected in committee.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	I have voted over 2,000 times in the House of Commons and 
on only one occasion have I voted against the government. If 
further changes are not made to this legislation, I am afraid I am 
going to have to see the second time that I will vote against my 
own government. That does not sit well with me personally 
because I am a loyalist and a constructive worker trying to get 
things done. I do not want to vote against this bill, but if I must, I 
will. My constituents are not part of the problem with their 
hunting and their sports clubs that operate throughout the area.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
respect the comments of the preceding speaker. I suggest to him 
that he seriously consider what we are debating today, which is 
an amendment by the Reform Party to split the bill into the parts 
that he and I agree are workable and necessary.
<P>
	I also refer to the comments of my Reform colleague from 
Nanaimo-Cowichan. He spoke about the amendment to split 
the bill as being a practical solution.
<P>
	For the benefit of the justice minister and his staff, I would 
like to set my speech around some things that have been in the 
public domain that his staff should have brought to his attention. 
However, I assume they have not, otherwise he too would be 
inclined to split the bill.
<P>
	I would like to identify the real problem. Referring to 
documents that are in the public domain, I would like to read 
briefly from one. It is an article referring to Project Gun Runner 
in the Kingston <I>Whig-Standard Companion</I> of April 9, 1994 and 
I read in part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A total of 86 charges were laid during Gun Runner, which ended last April. Of 
the 17 guns the team bought on the black market, one came from a break-in. The 
rest were smuggled into Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is one out of 17. It goes on:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Of the 243 other firearms that participating police forces seized during the 
operation, the vast majority came into the country illegally from the United 
States.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``The project certainly opened our eyes to the fact that stolen guns from 
B&amp;Es aren't the problem. Smuggled guns are the area of concern,'' says 
Detective Sergeant Wayne Moore of the Hamilton-Wentworth police criminal 
intelligence unit.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Gun Runner helped open a lot of people's eyes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is unfortunate that many of the eyes belonging to the 
backbenchers and the Liberals were not opened by this 
information. Perhaps they should review it.
<P>
	Metro Toronto firearms expert, Detective Paul Mullin says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It's a lucrative business-On the streets of Hamilton and Toronto a handgun is 
going to sell for $300 to $500.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And when it comes to smuggling, handguns are an easily concealed 
commodity.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Let's face it, 10 handguns don't add up to a carton of cigarettes in size. And at 
$500 apiece, that is $5,000 to be made.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Further on in the same article it describes how they are getting 
into the country. You name it: trains, planes, boats, trucks and 
cars. Last year Canada Customs seized 1,681 guns at border 
crossings with the U.S., an increase of 124 over the previous 
year. But 98 per cent of those firearms were seized from 
American tourists who were simply not aware of Canadian gun 
laws.
<P>
	There are a lot of areas and ways and means of getting into 
Canada without coming through customs. ``There are lakes and 
backroads and rivers and unmanned locations,'' says a director 
of intelligence services with Revenue Canada and Customs.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And when a smuggler comes across he is usually carrying more than one or 
two guns.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>He's going to be come back with a quantity-10, 15, 20 guns. He's going to 
make the run worth his while because he's going to get into as much trouble for 
one gun as he is for 20.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Davis .380-calibre sold to a licensee for $70 may be sold to a first-level 
street dealer for $90. The dealer then sells it to a Canadian importer for maybe 
$120 and then the importer or his mule will drive it across the border and sell it 
for $500.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	This article clearly delineates the fantastic profits that can be 
made.
<P>
	Again, for the benefit of the justice minister and his 
researchers, they might want to take a look at a January 7 article 
in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I>, headlined ``Illegal guns pour in from 
U.S.'', detailing a number of illegal importations. I will cite two 
here:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Toronto, September 13, 1993. Three Armenian jewel thieves enter a 
downtown jewellery wholesaler, pistol-whip the owner with a 9-mm Sigarms 
and escape with $90,000 in merchandise. Where did the gun come from? From 
Vermonter Wayne D. Reed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Vancouver, October 15, 1993. Five men, three of whom are jailbreakers, steal 
$500,000 worth of jewellery from a Birks store. They are armed with a 9-mm 
Cobray Mach II with the serial numbers drilled out, a .25-calibre Sundance and 
a 9-mm Glock pistol. Where did the guns come from?-Wayne D. Reed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Wayne D. Reed, 49, lives with his wife and four children in a 
lower-middle-class housing development in north Burlington.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The article continues:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>From this modest home Reed has fed since 1991 an ever-expanding hunger 
for guns in Canada's criminal underworld. According to his own estimates 
given to <I>The Gazette</I>, he has sold about 900 firearms, mostly high-powered 
pistols, to Mohawk Indians who smuggled them over the border into Quebec 
and resold them to criminals across Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11116"> 11116 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The same routes developed for cigarette and booze smuggling-river 
crossings at Akwesasne on the St. Lawrence  River, and Walpole Island on the St. 
Claire River north of Detroit-are now being used for the more lethal commodity, 
firearms.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Further on in the article it states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With a U.S. federal dealer's licence, Reed can legally buy and sell any firearm 
except machine guns. He waits for the orders to pile up so he can get a cut rate 
from the wholesaler by buying in quantity.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Criminals place their orders through various Mohawk gun dealers who in turn 
place the orders with Reed or dealers like him. The Mohawks fill out U.S. federal 
firearms transaction forms (referred to as ``yellow sheets'') with false names 
taken from the Vermont phone books.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We have seen from Project Gun Runner and other 
documentation that the problem is one of illegal importation or 
smuggling. The fundamental problem here, although it does 
occasionally relate to guns that are stolen from private owners, 
is illegal guns.
<P>
	What is the response? As the revenue critic I was very 
interested to read the fact sheet put out by Revenue Canada on 
the government's firearms control initiative. It reads in part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>New firearms control measures. November 30, 1994. An expanded 
commercial permit system. All commercial import, export and in-transit 
shipments of firearms will require a permit in advance issued by the Solicitor 
General, with the approval of Foreign Affairs;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I think that Mr. Reed will shake in his boots.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Revenue Canada will verify that every firearms shipment, import and export, 
is accompanied by an approval permit.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I am sure that the criminals that are bringing them in illegally 
will be concerned about this.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A National Firearms Registration System. Under this system, which will be 
implemented by January 1, 1998:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>all firearms entering, leaving and moving through Canada will have to be 
registered in the National Firearms Registry;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Again, I am sure that Mr. Reed will be complying with that, 
along with the rest of the people who are smuggling guns into 
Canada.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Firearms Control Enhancements: Summer, 1994</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Enhanced verification of the accuracy and integrity of documentation 
accompanying shipment of firearms;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Implementation of a more rigorous inspection program at all land border 
crossings-100 per cent of firearms shipments are now examined;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	That certainly gives me a lot of confidence that all of Mr. 
Reed's firearms are now going to be examined. Perhaps he might 
not care. What does this have to do with the problem? 
Absolutely nothing.
<P>
	The enforcement activities contained in the bill are bogus in 
light of the fact that the government is bringing down penalties 
in Bill C-68 while at the same time it is loosening restrictions in 
a bill that was just passed through the House, Bill C-42.
<P>
	These restrictions are supposed to help when there is domestic 
violence and in the illegal use of weapons. I have in my hand a 
document from the provincial court judiciary, provincial court 
of British Columbia where it explains that the act that was just 
passed will be changing assault with a weapon or causing bodily 
harm from an indictable offence to one that could be treated in a 
summary fashion in court.
<P>
	How serious is the government about gaining control? We 
know that the Saskatoon police officers are not in favour of this. 
We know that there is presently a meeting of the Canadian Police 
Association and its members may or may not be in favour of 
this. We know that Saskatchewan will not be enforcing this.
<P>
	I conclude by drawing to the attention of the House something 
I raised with the justice minister last Tuesday with a question.
<P>
	The environmental extremist, Paul Watson, who allegedly 
was attacked by concerned residents in the Magdalen Islands 
was widely reported as saying that he held off his alleged 
assailants by using a stun gun and his fists.
<P>
	I asked the justice minister this. Stun guns are prohibited 
weapons under section 90(1) of the Criminal Code. Mr. Watson 
admits to having this prohibited weapon in his possession. 
Would the minister confirm if the gun was confiscated, if Mr. 
Watson was charged for having an illegal weapon in his 
possession. If he was not charged, why not?
<P>
	In part, the justice minister answered: ``I commend the 
member on his knowledge of the Criminal Code but I also 
remind him that enforcement of such provisions is entirely a 
matter for the provincial authorities to which I invite his 
attention''.
<P>
	I asked, if that is the case, are we going to have two sets of 
laws, one for people outside of Saskatchewan and one in or is 
this whole thing bogus?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased today to have the 
opportunity to speak to Bill C-68, an act respecting firearms and 
other weapons.
<P>
	The issue of gun control has generated a tremendous amount 
of controversy over the last year. I have heard from many of my 
constituents expressing concerns on both sides of the debate. I 
would like to commend the Minister of Justice for introducing a 
bill that took into consideration the concerns of gun owners 
while at the same time acting to improve public safety.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11117"> 11117 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe there is broad public support for the bill. I know 
it has responded to the concerns of my constituents by 
delivering stiffer penalties for the criminal use and smuggling 
of firearms.
<P>
	At the same time, the bill provides a context in which legal 
gun owners can pursue their interest in a manner that is 
consistent with public safety. The creation of a national 
registration system is an essential part of the legislation. 
Registration of all firearms will improve public safety and help 
police fight the criminal misuse of firearms.
<P>
	I understand that the registration of firearms is one of the 
most controversial aspects of the bill.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	Opponents of the bill have charged registration will cost the 
government in excess of $1 billion. This is not true. To set up 
this system will cost $85 million spread over seven years. This 
will be recovered over time from the fees charged to gun owners.
<P>
	Opponents of the bill have charged registration will not 
reduce the criminal use of firearms because criminals do not 
register their guns. They charge registration will not improve 
public safety. The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police 
agrees with the Minister of Justice that the registration of 
firearms will help control smuggling, gun theft and the misuse 
of legal firearms.
<P>
	Registration will make it more difficult for criminals to 
acquire illegal firearms by helping police trace and eliminate 
sources of firearms entering the underground market. 
Registration will help ensure legal gun owners are held 
accountable for their firearms and do not sell them illegally or 
give them to individuals without appropriate authorization.
<P>
	Registration will promote safe storage which will reduce gun 
theft as well as reducing suicides and accidents. Police and 
women's groups both support the bill because registration will 
assist the police in removing guns from volatile domestic 
situations. The bill will help the police in enforcing the 
estimated 13,000 prohibition orders issued every year, to 
remove guns from volatile domestic situations and from 
individuals considered to be a risk to society.
<P>
	I will vote in favour of the bill because the registration of 
firearms will save lives. It is critical to controlling the illegal 
gun trade, to prosecuting offenders, to promoting safe storage 
and to removing guns from the hands of dangerous individuals.
<P>
	Many opponents of the bill have told the government to deal 
with crime control, not gun control. The bill deals harshly with 
the criminal misuse of firearms. I am pleased to see the bill 
includes minimum sentences for violent offences using 
firearms, a lifetime ban on owning handguns and stiff penalties 
for illegally importing and trafficking firearms.
<P>
	I have listened to the concerns of legal gun owners in my 
riding. I am pleased to see the bill has also taken their concerns 
into consideration. To avoid undue financial hardship on the 
owners whose guns will be prohibited, the new legislation 
allows them to buy and sell to individuals owning firearms in the 
same category. This measure addresses one of the very 
legitimate concerns of gun owners.
<P>
	Our government is working on many fronts to reduce crime 
and improve public safety. Strengthening gun control is only 
one part of the government's strategy on crime prevention. We 
must also address the social roots of crime including poverty, 
illiteracy and family violence.
<P>
	Gun ownership is not a right, it is a privilege. It is subject to 
regulation by government because firearms can be dangerous. It 
is in the best interest of society to have some degree of 
regulation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Thank you, Mr. 
Speaker, for recognizing me at this time. The firearms bill 
introduced by the Minister of Justice is motivated by the best of 
intentions. I am sure.
<P>
	Who in this House is for violence? Who does not want control 
to be exercised over violence? I do not think anyone in this place 
or in the general public does. Polls show that 100 per cent of the 
population is against violence, and already 73 per cent of the 
population says it wants stricter firearms control.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	In this regard, the views of my party are no different from 
those expressed by the public at large. It is just that, sometimes, 
debates such as this one lend themselves to extremes that need to 
be moderated. When I hear certain members opposite tell us that 
73 per cent of the population is for the proposed firearms control 
measures, I cannot help but wonder if all these people who are 
for the control measures are aware of what implementing such a 
system entails and how much it will cost.
<P>
	A study conducted by a British Columbia university professor 
indicates that there are between three and seven million firearms 
in circulation and, if all of these weapons now had to be 
registered, it would cost the Canadians taxpayers, the public 
purse, or the hunters at the very least $500 million. That is half a 
billion dollars.
<P>
	Of course, these figures are just thrown at us. Can they be 
checked? It would be rather difficult. On the other hand, if we 
look up in the auditor general's 1993 report how much the 
present registration system or firearms acquisition certificate 
system has cost to operate-these figures are now available- 
we can see that an inefficient and counterproductive system 
costs at the very least $50 million.
<P>
	I did not pressure in any way the Auditor General of Canada to 
say that the current system fell short of our requirements. There 
is therefore reason to believe that the proposed system may well 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11118"> 11118 </A></B>
<P>
have a starting cost of  $500 million. In the current economic 
context, I wonder if clear information regarding the costs 
involved would have made a difference in how the public 
answered the poll.
<P>
	Needless to say, this kind of bill leaves the door wide open to 
sheer demagogy. It has been said that even if this bill saved only 
one life in Canada, it would deserve our support. I say this with 
all due respect for the opinion of my colleagues across the way 
who made that claim, including the hon. member for Ottawa 
West, who spoke to this bill yesterday, the hon. member for 
Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis and the hon. member for Nickel 
Belt.
<P>
	Of course, I would try to contribute to the $500 million 
needed to save a life. However, if we invested this amount in 
public awareness, in the fight against spousal abuse-if that is 
really the purpose of this bill-, I would not think it is too much. 
I am convinced that investing $500 in one of these areas could 
certainly save more than one life, at least two, as I am sure you 
will agree, Mr. Speaker. This bill would then be 100 per cent 
cost-effective in relation to the position of my friends across the 
way.
<P>
	There is another aspect to this bill. In this regard, I tend to side 
with my friends here who say that this bill should be split in two. 
First of all, by giving the federal government the opportunity to 
create new crimes as it sees fit, this bill will-in Quebec and, I 
assume, in all Canadian provinces-encroach on areas of 
provincial jurisdiction, namely civil rights and freedoms as well 
as the sport of hunting.
<P>
	In this regard, I am very reluctant to give my support, unless it 
is conclusively demonstrated that the bill cannot fail to achieve 
the goals established. As you know, hunting generates regional 
revenues of $300 million a year in Quebec at a specific time of 
year.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	This is a windfall for most Quebec regions: the Eastern 
Townships, the Upper Laurentians, the Abitibi-Témiscamingue 
area, the Lac Saint-Jean region, the North Shore, the Gaspé 
Peninsula, you name it. In these regions, some small 
communities live off sport and recreational activities such as 
hunting in the fall and fishing in the spring and summer. They 
could lose all of that. I am not saying that I oppose this bill, but I 
wonder about its consequences, which may not be obvious at 
this stage.
<P>
	However, I do think this is a prime example of federal 
interference in a field of provincial jurisdiction. The Quebec 
environment minister also had reservations about this 
legislation. Sure, the initial intent is laudable and everyone 
supports such a measure, the Bloc perhaps more than any other 
party. However, given the current economic context, we have to 
be careful before adding an extra $500 million to the deficit. Let 
us not forget that our deficit is the sum total of 20 years of good 
intentions in Quebec. It is thanks to all those who meant well and  
tabled various pieces of legislation if we are now struggling with 
this uncontrolled and uncontrollable deficit.
<P>
	As regards this aspect, I hope that those who support this 
legislation, as well as those who oppose it, will come to present 
their respective views to a parliamentary committee. There is 
another aspect of this bill which concerns me. I said earlier that 
we should make sure that the goals sought are indeed reached. In 
addition to being able to afford all this, we should have some 
assurances that these objectives are reasonably attainable. 
When we consider the opportunities for smuggling, in his study 
Professor Mauser said he is not at all sure that smuggling will be 
stopped.
<P>
	In fact, the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police 
expressed some reservations in this respect. The Reform Party's 
brilliant representative said earlier that a single shipment of 
guns can generate incredible profits, as much as 400 or 500 per 
cent. That is quite a lot. We had a terrible time trying to stop 
cigarette smuggling last year. We never succeeded, so that the 
federal government finally abdicated its responsibility and 
reduced taxes, although it needed these to pay for its current 
operations. It is no secret that the government raises revenue 
through taxes. Since the government realized it could not stop 
cigarette smuggling otherwise, it preferred to forgo revenues 
that were legally acceptable and warranted.
<P>
	So will it be the same in the case of firearms? Will the 
government abdicate its responsibility, will they still shoot at 
government helicopters about to land on a reserve straddling the 
border between Canada and the United States, the message 
being: ``Get out of here, this is our business''. At least, that is 
what happened with cigarettes. I would appreciate some 
certainty in this respect, some assurances that smuggling is a 
thing of the past.
<P>
	You know, we have another problem with imports not 
necessarily connected with smuggling. Recently, I was working 
on the Customs Act and the notorious procedure I mentioned 
here in the House during Question Period, the so-called low 
value shipment, a term used in the customs sector. For instance, 
a truck comes in from the United States, a bonded carrier with a 
shipment of merchandise, and they do spot checks. They look at 
the manifest, they look at the list and they say: Okay, Mickey 
Mouse watches, straw hats, whatever. They do a spot check. 
They take items at random from the truck and check whether 
these items correspond with what is on the manifest.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11119"> 11119 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	Customs officers told me that in nine cases out of ten, if not 
ten out of ten, they might be carrying a handgun or a firearm that 
is not only restricted but prohibited in Canada. In nine cases out 
of ten this would go unnoticed.
<P>
	So that is why I have a number of questions about this bill. I 
am not saying I am against the bill but I am not saying I support 
it either. I think we should all discuss this. That is why we are 
debating the bill here in the House, so that in the end, we can 
make an informed decision.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Wells (South Shore, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak on Bill C-68, an act 
respecting firearms and other weapons. I particularly wanted to 
speak on this legislation because of the great deal of concern it 
has caused both myself and my constituents.
<P>
	This legislation is an important part of the Liberal 
government's broad strategy on crime prevention. It should 
work in concert with previously introduced pieces of legislation 
relating to sentencing reform, corrections and parole reform, the 
Young Offenders Act and the consultation document on the 
National Crime Prevention Council.
<P>
	I agree with the overall intent of this legislation as well as the 
three principles that motivated this government to introduce Bill 
C-68. At the same time I believe it is incumbent upon all 
members of this House to recognize that there are two sides 
which must be heard. We must recognize the sincerity with 
which both sides bring their views to the table.
<P>
	I have constituents in my South Shore riding who are in favour 
of the government measures and I certainly have constituents 
who are opposed. For this reason, I have formed a riding 
committee which will meet with me on a regular basis to review 
the legislation in detail. This committee will be reporting to the 
Minister of Justice and to the Standing Committee on Justice 
and Legal Affairs on areas of concern with a view to offering 
suggestions for improvements.
<P>
	I expect that people on both sides of this issue would agree 
with the three principles as previously outlined by the Minister 
of Justice in this House. In essence these principles are: one, that 
Canadians do not want to live in a country where people feel 
they want or need to possess a firearm for their protection; two, 
that if we are to retain our safe and peaceful character as a 
country, those who use a firearm in the commission of a crime 
will be severely punished; and three, as a government and as a 
country, we must acknowledge and respect the legitimate use of 
firearms by law-abiding Canadian citizens.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice and this government have 
acknowledged throughout this debate their respect and 
consideration for the traditions of hunting, both for sustenance 
and for sport, as well as the use of firearms  for farming, 
ranching and other legitimate activities. It is not the intention of 
this government with this legislation to interfere with these 
rights. As well, we wish to go on record as acknowledging that 
these rights will continue to exist into the future.
<P>
	I would like at this time to comment on the various 
components on the firearms control package as outlined in the 
legislation.
<P>
	I believe that increased penalties will act as a deterrent to the 
criminal use of firearms. A mandatory four-year jail term for 
the use of a firearm in the commission of a serious crime, in 
addition to charges for the offence in which the gun was used, is 
deemed by those concerned with law and order to be much more 
acceptable than the status quo.
<P>
	The present law is often criticized as being inadequately 
enforced with charges too often dropped as part of a plea bargain 
or otherwise not pursued. This problem is addressed by this 
legislation.
<P>
	In relation to the aforementioned, I fully support any change 
that will see young offenders who commit firearms offences 
being treated in the same manner as adults. The criminal 
penalties as outlined in the legislation will also limit access to 
firearms for felons, including young offenders.
<P>
	Prohibition orders on the possession of restricted and 
non-restricted firearms for those convicted of serious violent 
crimes will range from 10 years to life. People convicted of 
stalking or drug related charges will be subject to prohibition 
orders.
<P>
	Not only does this make good common sense, but it is a crime 
prevention measure that will go a long way toward restoring 
public confidence in the justice system. It is clear that the 
intention of this legislation is to offer more protection to the 
law-abiding citizen.
<P>
	Bill C-68 includes border control measures which are 
directed at curtailing smuggling activities and tightening up 
importation regulations. In addition, the bill adds a number of 
new offences arising from the trade in illegal firearms or other 
weapons. The overall penalty provisions will put these offences 
among the most serious class of crimes in the Criminal Code.
<P>
	The most contentious part of this legislation is the registration 
provision which will apply to all guns, regular, restricted, and 
prohibited. Many of my constituents have raised concerns or 
worries about the registration requirement. They are concerned 
about the cost, both to themselves as individuals and to the 
country at large. They have concerns that the system will be 
cumbersome. They have concerns that registration will lead to 
the eventual confiscation of their firearms. They are concerned 
that the registration system will not be secure and that others, 
including criminals, could gain access to the information.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	They have asked me how registration will address the issue of 
crime in our communities. They have asked if the $85 million or 
more would not be better spent on social programs, thereby 
attacking the causes of crime.
<P>
	They are concerned that they will become criminals by not 
registering their guns. They are also concerned about and wish 
to have addressed further the question of compensation to the 
owners of handguns that are being banned.
<P>
	These are legitimate concerns. We owe it to Canadians to 
address these concerns item by item. I do not believe we have 
really done this, but I hope in the weeks and months ahead we 
are able to ensure that our communities are better informed on 
these issues. I know I will be reviewing all of them with the 
committee in my riding and bringing them forward for 
consideration.
<P>
	I would like to take a minute now to explain my understanding 
of some of these issues.
<P>
	The first issue is on the matter of cost. The Minister of Justice 
has been quite clear and emphatic that the cost to gun owners in 
the first year is expected to be zero, or at the very most, a 
nominal amount in the range of $10. For this fee the gun owner 
can register up to 10 guns with no further registration being 
required during his lifetime. I am convinced that the 
government has no hidden agenda to eventually confiscate guns.
<P>
	It is also important to explain that when formulating this 
legislation the government listened to the law enforcement 
community. The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police has 
long requested and encouraged the adoption of universal 
registration. The chiefs of police cited a number of reasons for 
this and explained how it would help them in the fight against 
crime. The following are the reasons stated by the police 
association:
<P>
	Tracking guns that are imported to Canada and then sold is 
critical to controlling abuse. It will be easier to prosecute 
individuals for possession of illegal and stolen weapons because 
the police will be able to distinguish between legal gun owners 
and illegal gun owners.
<P>
	The police say that registration will assist in high risk 
situations. The police say that registration will assist in taking 
preventative action against domestic violence by allowing them 
to remove firearms from a volatile situation. They say 
registration is essential for the enforcement of the estimated 
13,000 prohibition orders issued each year.
<P>
	Members of the strategic weapons and tactical units of many 
forces feel that more information about the presence of firearms 
is critical. In most cases, guns which are stolen were improperly 
stored. The police say registration will promote safe storage 
which will in turn reduce gun theft as well as reduce suicides and 
accidents.
<P>
	These reasons need to be explored in more detail.
<P>
	One facet of this legislation I am particularly opposed to is the 
use of orders in council to add weapons to the existing 
prohibited weapons list. I support banning weapons that have no 
legitimate purpose. I see no reason for people to own assault 
weapons, handguns with no legitimate purpose, compact or 
single-hand crossbows, but I object to the process whereby this 
has been accomplished.
<P>
	I was particularly pleased to see that the Minister of Justice 
has asked the standing committee to consider a number of issues 
that have been raised since the firearms control action plan was 
first introduced.
<P>
	My office has received a number of representations from 
persons concerned with being able to leave their relics and 
heirlooms as part of their estate. I should also make it clear that 
there is nothing in the legislation that would prevent an 
individual from passing on their long arms upon death. I have 
also received a number of letters from constituents who feel 
their weapons have been wrongly prohibited. These concerns 
are ones the minister is going to have addressed by the standing 
committee and I appreciate that.
<P>
	Upon reviewing the legislation, I am of the belief that its 
intent is to control crime and promote public safety while 
respecting the needs of legitimate gun owners. This legislation 
acknowledges that there are legitimate reasons for people to 
own firearms and that firearms are essential tools for many 
Canadians. This legislation does not set out to inconvenience 
these individuals.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to reiterate that the Minister of Justice 
has stated that Canadians will have their opportunity to make 
their views known when the legislation is reviewed by the 
standing committee. I trust that the concerns of my constituents 
will be addressed and that answers to their legitimate concerns 
will be provided.
<P>
	I also wish to state that I support the objective of the 
legislation. Its objective is to reduce violent crime in our 
country, an objective which I think all of my constituents would 
support.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise and speak in support of the Reform Party's 
motion to split Bill C-68 into two bills.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice said this bill is about the kind of 
Canada we want. I and the Reform Party can certainly agree with 
that statement. He also said that the overwhelming majority of 
Canadians support his position. I take exception with this 
statement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11121"> 11121 </A></B>
<P>
	Certainly if the question was asked whether they were in 
favour of gun control, any reasonable, fair-minded, clear 
thinking Canadian would say yes. The fraud being perpetrated 
on Canadians is that pollsters have been paid to ask the wrong 
question, and ask they have over and over again. The minister 
must not get away with this misconception, pushing his agenda 
and serving the interests of the minority and the elitists.
<P>
	Though the answer from the majority regarding firearms 
control is yes, it is not yes to more firearms control, but rather a 
firearms control that respects without question the rights and 
freedoms of law-abiding citizens. I must repeat that statement: 
a firearms control that respects the right of life, liberty and 
security of person and that respects the inherent right of every 
citizen to own and enjoy property and that respects the rule of 
common law.
<P>
	Canada's required firearms law must be in a form that is 
simple, economically attainable, and derived from common 
sense. Canada's required laws dealing with criminals must also 
be simple, economically attainable and derived from common 
sense. I mention both firearms laws and laws dealing with 
criminals separately, because that is exactly what they should 
be, separate.
<P>
	An owner of any object, be it a knife, a rock, a club, a gun or 
even a pillow is not a criminal until he or she violates the rights 
and freedoms of another person with that object. The object now 
becomes a weapon which then is bound to the criminal act and 
dealt with by criminal law.
<P>
	Now that we have separated firearms and criminals, it would 
be easy to ask Canadians a fair question. They would 
undoubtedly say no to more firearms control and yes to more 
criminal control.
<P>
	As we can see, the single politically correct question that 
should be asked of all Canadians regarding the Criminal Code is 
if citizens had a choice in methods used to curtail crime, which 
would they favour: control of law-abiding citizens or control of 
the criminal? I am sure that 100 per cent of the citizens would 
vote for the second choice.
<P>
	A democratic government would act upon the will of the 
people unless, of course, that government lacked the will or the 
ability to deal effectively with criminals and crime and tried to 
create a false impression of dealing with the problem by further 
regulating law-abiding citizens. That is exactly the fraud which 
is being perpetrated on Canadians by the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	The minister says this bill is about the type of society that 
Liberals want in our country. He says that Liberals believe only 
police officers and armed forces should have the right to possess 
arms. He apparently means but does not include criminals in the 
category of those allowed to possess firearms or this 
government would be taking some very specific action, which I 
will come back to later on.
<P>
	If this bill is leading us to the kind of society the minister 
wants, that society must be one in which governments fear 
law-abiding citizens. It is one where governments seize 
privately owned property without compensation. It is a country 
where instead of dealing swiftly and decisively with criminal 
activity, the government and law enforcement authorities turn 
their heads and pretend they do not know what is going on.
<P>
	I fully agree that a kinder, gentler society is a highly desirable 
goal. However, I see no evidence of success on the part of those 
promoting that concept. Instead, I see a constantly rising 
confrontational crime rate, the result of a criminal justice 
system repeatedly basing action on theories that turn out to be 
wrong. As the risk factor rises, the public is moving toward 
self-protection, whether it is legal or not.
<P>
	Prohibition is not a method of control; it is a method of losing 
any control over the situation. It is a lawyer's theory that just 
does not work. Most lawyers regard it as an axiom that reducing 
the number of weapons in society will reduce weapons crime. In 
all of our research we have found nothing whatsoever to support 
that idea. The evidence strongly indicates that the successful 
disarming of the community simply turns control of the 
neighbourhood over to the biggest, meanest thugs in the 
neighbourhood.
<P>
	I will leave members with the conclusion of Chief Inspector 
Colin Greenwood of the West Yorkshire Constabulary in 
Britain, a country long known for strict gun control. He has done 
a comprehensive study on firearms control methods and their 
actual as opposed to theoretical effects in many countries. I 
quote his findings:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At first glance, it may seem odd or even perverse to suggest that statutory 
control on private ownership of firearms is irrelevant to the problem of armed 
crime; yet that is precisely what the evidence shows. Armed crime and violent 
crime generally are products of ethnic and social factors unrelated to the 
availability of a type of weapon.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The number of firearms required to satisfy the crime market is small, and 
these are supplied no matter what controls are instituted. Controls had serious 
effects on legitimate users of firearms, but there is no case, either in the history 
of this country or in the experience of other countries in which controls can be 
shown to have restricted the flow of weapons to criminals, or in any way reduce 
crime.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	He was right. The latest British Home Office statistics for 
England and Wales show violent crime has doubled every 10 
years since 1946. Britain's recreational firearms industry has 
been destroyed.
<P>
	Many honest shooters now keep their firearms in Belgium to 
avoid the next wave of confiscation. Has gun control worked? 
No, it has not worked. British firearm crime rates are at an all 
time high and continue to rise. What else could one expect?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11122"> 11122 </A></B>
<P>
	Firearms are easy to smuggle, police are easy to avoid while 
committing a violent crime and their government guarantees 
that the victim will have no effective way to protect himself 
or his family. Any criminal who has a firearm can totally 
dominate any victim situation.
<P>
	Our Minister of Justice said on several occasions that no 
Canadian has any need of firearms for self-protection. If that is 
so, why does he and the Prime Minister regularly dip into the 
public purse to cover the expense of armed bodyguards to 
protect their own sacred skins? Are their skins any more sacred 
than those of other Canadians?
<P>
	I must expose one other area of fraudulent injustice arising 
from this legislation, the whole matter of how this legislation 
will apply to Canada's aboriginal peoples.
<P>
	When I raised this question in a departmental briefing I was 
chastized for suggesting there was perhaps racial inequity in the 
application of the legislation. My constituency has a large 
aboriginal population and both aboriginal people and 
non-aboriginal people have a right to know how this law will be 
applied.
<P>
	The minister stated in the House this law must apply to all 
Canadians but will be enforced with cultural sensitivity on 
Indian lands. Indian chiefs and even aboriginal MLAs tell me 
this law will not apply to the Indian people and would be a 
violation of treaty rights or that it would not apply because 
Canadian law does not apply on sovereign Indian lands.
<P>
	I hope this is not the view of the Minister of Justice because 
every Canadian must be equal under the law. To do otherwise 
would promote racism and non-compliance with the law.
<P>
	The minister under section 110 of the Firearms Act has the 
authority to decide which persons do or do not need firearms. I 
am told the minister agreed under section 112(1) to exempt 
aboriginal people by order in council and that the issue need 
never come before Parliament.
<P>
	I hope this is incorrect because it would be a recipe for 
disaster. If this is not true, when will the government do 
something about the illegally stored arms on the reserves along 
the U.S. border and do something to stop the illegal smuggling 
that everyone knows exists?
<P>
	How will the minister apply the law in the self-governing 
Indian lands in Yukon where legislation passed in the House 
recently removes jurisdiction for firearms from the federal 
government?
<P>
	There is no reasonable justification for treating aboriginal 
people any different under this legislation than anyone else. 
Firearms are no more a part of aboriginal culture than 
non-aboriginal culture. Firearms, after all, arrived in this 
country with the Europeans.
<P>
	If this law is bad for aboriginal people, this law is bad for all 
people. We are convinced the major predictable effect of 
enacting this legislation, so poorly researched, so badly 
designed, so basically silly, is an increase in the  number of 
Canadian voters killed, injured and robbed in the years to come. 
We reject this legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am the only veteran of Gettysburg to speak to this bill 
today in the House or at any time.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	I fought on the fields of Gettysburg a few years ago. It was the 
125th anniversary of that civil war battle. I am a civil war 
re-enactor, a black powder enthusiast. I go to these events 
dressed up. Members should see me in my butternut tunic with 
my haversack, my canteen and my 1863 Enfield musket as I 
march and counter march.
<P>
	I was in a Hollywood movie, ``Gettysburg''. Members will 
notice that in Pickett's charge there are 6,000 Confederate 
soldiers coming toward the camera. If members examine these 
soldiers very carefully they will see in the first wave on the left 
flank, eight over from the standard bearer, they will recognize 
me.
<P>
	I support the bill very much. Although my only association 
with firearms is a hobby that does not involve bullets, I do very 
strongly feel the legislation is warranted, not for many of the 
reasons that have been presented in the House, but primarily 
because it addresses the fundamental issue of keeping Canada 
the way it is and avoiding the type of gun related violence that 
exists in the United States.
<P>
	I refer to the restrictions this law will put on the possession of 
handguns for personal protection. Current law provides that a 
Canadian is to have a handgun only for the purposes of 
collecting, sport or as a result of their employment. We in 
Canada have no provision for having handguns for personal 
protection. However, statistics have shown that a larger number 
of handguns have been acquired apparently to be kept at home in 
bureau drawers on the offhand chance of a break and enter when 
the person might be able to use this handgun.
<P>
	This is what is wrong in the United States. It is because 
handguns are in many private homes that when criminals enter 
to commit what are essentially petty crimes they fear for their 
lives and consequently go in armed. This legislation will do a lot 
to get the guns out of the hands of irresponsible gun owners.
<P>
	I can speak for many gun owners in my riding, legitimate 
sportsmen, collectors and hunters. These people are the first to 
say guns should not be kept with the idea of defending one's 
television set by shooting some kid entering a home.
<P>
	All other things aside, the bill will not stop criminals from 
using firearms but it will get firearms out of circulation when 
they are acquired for purposes that are not considered 
responsible and legitimate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11123"> 11123 </A></B>
<P>
	It really is a pleasure to take part in the debate. I have listened 
very carefully to the members of the opposition and also to 
members of my own party who have felt very passionately that 
there are inadequacies in the legislation, that it penalizes 
responsible gun owners. There have been six or eight months 
of debate in the House, in caucus and out in the communities. 
I applaud the Minister of Justice, for he has consistently gone 
around the country and listened.
<P>
	I invite my opposition colleagues to take satisfaction in 
knowing there have been improvements in the legislation since 
it came in the form of proposals. The bill now before us 
represents an enormous step in dialogue between a government 
initiating bills and individuals in the community through their 
MPs trying to make legislation that meets its target of restricting 
the spread of guns for illegitimate purposes and at the same time 
does not penalize those who wish to have firearms for legitimate 
reasons.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	I thank the Minister of Justice because he has set an example. 
He has shown Parliament works. Legitimate gun owners who 
had genuine concerns, a lot of them based on misrepresentation, 
have been heard. The bill before us is not perfect. We have to 
polish it and perfect it. It is a product of genuine debate. We 
should all be proud of that.
<P>
	I do not want to go over all the aspects of the bill already 
covered. I would like to react to three points that I am interested 
in specifically. Quite a few people on both sides of the House, 
my own colleagues included, have spoken against registration of 
long guns.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice had consultation with the experts, the 
RCMP and the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police. If they 
advised the minister that registration is worthwhile in order to 
control the illegitimate circulation of guns and the theft of guns, 
I have to accept the word of these experts.
<P>
	Most Canadians would agree that we have the best police 
forces. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police is one of the best 
national police forces anywhere. If the Minister of Justice 
chooses to listen to those experts and chooses to spend the $80 
million or so on registration, I have to accept that he is going on 
the best advice.
<P>
	It is not a debate about registration, although I appreciate the 
passion with which it is debated in the House. I do not have the 
expertise to challenge the recommendation of the RCMP or the 
Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police.
<P>
	There is another aspect of the bill that I am worried about. My 
colleague from Saskatoon-Dundurn raised the issue that the 
bill seems to give police rather sweeping powers of searching 
private premises, getting a warrant to search private premises 
for compliance or non-compliance with respect to the bill.
<P>
	Any legislation before the House that would interfere with 
fundamental liberties I would oppose. I know the Minister of 
Justice is aware of this. It will be carefully examined. When the 
legislation goes to the parliamentary committee it will be 
determined whether this is a danger. I am sure that if this clause 
in the bill is a genuine problem it will be altered accordingly.
<P>
	I would like to see something else changed in the bill. It would 
silence a lot of the legitimate concern among gun owners I have 
talked to. Many gun collectors are afraid the provisions for 
describing restricted handguns are too sweeping and might 
capture weapons that are genuinely antique.
<P>
	One amendment in committee that would help the bill 
enormously is if we put a simple date and say for example that 
pre-1913 firearms can be considered antique. Then we allow 
certain guns to be regarded as intrinsically valuable and exempt 
as well so that we would not unnecessarily penalize those who 
have genuinely valuable collections and would like to pass them 
on to their heirs.
<P>
	With a few relatively easy adjustments after the 
parliamentary committee the legislation can come back to the 
House and be a law capable of satisfying 95 per cent of 
Canadians, gun owners or not.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the constituents of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt to speak to the justice 
minister's gun registry bill.
<P>
	I cannot call the bill firearms control legislation because the 
crime control aspects of the bill are hidden behind legislative 
measures which the Liberal government promised to anti-gun 
groups in its pre-election platform. This is unfortunate.
<P>
	Notwithstanding the political shenanigans the justice 
minister and his party have chosen to pin on the bill, I think all 
Canadians including everyone on this side of the House and 
anti-gun groups would like to have the opportunity to discuss 
real crime control measures. As a result of the Reform motion to 
split the bill we may have the opportunity.
<P>
	I make no mistake in describing the Liberal government's 
firearms legislation as simply amounting to a gun registry. I 
reinforce the term gun registry. The crime control aspects of the 
bill are hidden behind the gun registry being created by the 
minister.
<P>
	Canadians including anti-gun groups, Liberal party 
supporters and others will be sorrily disappointed if the 
minister's legislative proposals are enacted. My constituents 
have not been fooled for one minute with respect to the matter. It 
is obvious to everyone that some special interest groups are 
emotionally out of control with regard to the issue of gun 
control. Because of that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11124"> 11124 </A></B>
<P>
an all-out debate on the subject of crime control in the House is 
being prevented by the government.
<P>
	The bill is solely aimed at punishing law-abiding legitimate 
owners of firearms in Canada. These law-abiding citizens are 
more concerned than anyone with the safe usage and storage of 
firearms. Of all people they should not be the target of the 
legislation.
<P>
	All Canadians want crime to be reduced on the streets, in our 
cities and in our towns. Canadians want to be able to feel that the 
authorities are able to control crime.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice stated in the House that it was 
estimated some 375,000 guns were smuggled into the country 
and about 3,800 weapons were lost or stolen within our borders. 
The justice minister introduced legislation which concentrated 
on the 3,800 weapons loose in society.
<P>
	What about the 375,000 smuggled weapons? As far as I can 
see the minister's actions are twofold. First, his actions are 
directed at punishing legitimate owners of firearms, appeasing a 
special interest group. Second, as some kind of afterthought his 
actions may do something about the real problem, the 375,000 
weapons smuggled into the country. This is preposterous. 
Anti-gun groups are not amused. Neither are sporting groups, 
hunting clubs, target shooters or Olympic sports spectators. The 
grassroots of Canada is not amused.
<P>
	There is no reason the government cannot attempt to control 
smuggled weapons without slapping the faces of law-abiding 
citizens. My constituents therefore stand in favour of splitting 
the bill.
<P>
	Recently I conducted a household survey in my riding and 78 
per cent of my constituents said that they did not want all guns 
including shotguns and rifles registered. Seventy-eight per cent 
of my constituents said that they did not want short barrelled 
pistols banned. Most important, 92 per cent of my constituents 
want tougher mandatory sentences for criminals who use guns.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	To date I have presented 43 petitions in the House containing 
over 3,000 signatures of constituents who oppose further 
legislation for firearms acquisition and possession. They call on 
Parliament to provide strict guidelines and mandatory sentences 
for the use or the possession of a firearm in the commission of a 
violent crime.
<P>
	People do not have to look far for an example. They can turn 
to their local newspapers for examples of how the criminal 
justice system is letting the public down. For instance, I turn to 
the Penticton Herald that had an article entitled ``Slap on the 
wrists no deterrent''.
<P>
	The article was about a man convicted of a weapons offence 
involving a restricted weapon. He was convicted, given a slap on 
the wrist, a $440 fine and a year's probation. Canadians must be 
asking themselves, if the courts do not do their part in placing a 
deterrent on this kind of offence, what good is it to demand that 
hunters and sportsmen register their shotguns and long arms.
<P>
	As members of the House we ought to be doing all we can to 
protect our borders from those who seek to bring crime to our 
otherwise free and peaceful nation. We ought to make it very 
clear to the international criminal community, as well as our 
own criminal community, that Canada will put behind bars 
anyone who attempts to bring weapons into the country. We 
must ensure that is well known beyond our borders and that the 
maximum punishment for those bringing weapons into the 
country will be applied.
<P>
	Not only anti-gun groups but all Canadians want smuggling 
stopped. I might add that all Canadians want the full force of our 
laws and maximum punishment delivered to persons using 
firearms in the commission of an offence.
<P>
	While the citizens of the nation have the privilege of owning 
firearms, we must make it perfectly clear that we do not and will 
not tolerate abuse of the privilege. We must adopt a zero 
tolerance policy on criminals in the country.
<P>
	Society has been living with handgun registration for over 60 
years. Because of the difficulty our citizens face in terms of 
obtaining an FAC, we do not take lightly abuse of firearms laws. 
Virtually every constituent, firearm owner or member of an 
anti-gun group that contacted me during the debate of this issue 
has left me with one thought above all: punish the criminals who 
use firearms. Firearm owners, law-abiding citizens and 
anti-gun groups are sick and tired of legislators going after the 
wrong guy when dealing with the problems associated with 
firearms in society.
<P>
	Together all groups and all Canadians ask the minister not to 
follow the precedent set by former ministers of justice. He 
should do us all a favour and split the bill. Let us do some work 
in the House on crime control. Canadians will continue to read 
in the newspaper and see on television the mayhem, the 
bloodshed, the heartache and the horrors lethal weapons in the 
hands of criminals are causing on our streets. We will continue 
to see and hear of such criminals walking away from their deeds 
in that our courts refuse to deal out maximum penalties for 
crimes committed with a firearm because of plea bargaining and 
other reasons.
<P>
	In other words, by splitting the bill in half we would be 
allowed to deal with the two issues: first, crime control and, 
second, a gun registry. All sides of the House would be able to 
work on crime control first and most importantly. Surely the 
Minister of Justice would have us believe that he is so well 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11125"> 11125 </A></B>
<P>
intended he can accommodate  the desire of this side of the 
House and Canadians who recognize that crime control is the 
most important issue.
<P>
	Any right thinking Canadian knows that with some 375,000 
weapons being smuggled into the nation, the criminal use of 
firearms will continue. The criminal use of firearms does not 
exist because of hunters, sportsmen, gun collectors and 
law-abiding citizens. The criminal use is by criminals.
<P>

<P>
	In closing, the constituents of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt would support the bill being 
split in two. By doing so we could deal with crime control and 
then the gun registry. We could salvage some good sections in 
terms of protecting our borders from international criminals. We 
could try to protect law-abiding Canadians at the same time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let us start by calling what we have before us today 
what it really is. We have before us a motion. It is not to split the 
bill. That is utter and sheer nonsense. The motion asks that the 
House decline to give second reading to Bill C-68.
<P>
	The effect of adopting such a motion is not to split the bill, no 
matter what words are in the motion. Any member who says that 
the effect of adopting such a motion is to split the bill either does 
not know the rules of the House at all or knows better and refuses 
to say so, not to put it too unkindly.
<P>
	Citation 559 of Beauchesne, just in case the member across 
does not know how it works, is entitled: ``Types of Motions''. It 
refers to different types of motions. The motion introduced by 
the member is known as a dilatory motion. In that motion is a 
reasoned amendment. We decline to give second reading to a 
bill. Perhaps the reason he wants to decline giving second 
reading is that he would prefer to have the bill split two ways, 
three ways or ten ways. It does not matter, because any member 
voting in favour of the motion would be voting to kill the bill.
<P>
	The hon. member and other hon. members have sent letters to 
my constituents and other constituents across Canada asking 
them to tell us to support the motion, the effect of which would 
be to split the bill. Let me say kindly that it is not true. There is 
no such effect. It would kill the bill.
<P>
	I am a rural Canadian. I live in the riding of 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell. I was born on a farm. Yes, guns 
were around my home. That does not mean, as some members 
are trying to portray, that rural Canadians want to have guns that 
are not registered and that they have a right to do so, or that 
urban Canadians want rural Canadians to be deprived of all 
firearms. Both concepts are wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Should your father have registered his gun?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> My father died when I was four years old, in 
answer to the question being asked about my father.
<P>
	Perhaps I could get back to the topic at hand; it would be more 
appropriate. There were guns in my home. Guns were not 
registered 40 years ago. Motorcycle drivers did not wear 
helmets 40 years ago. Cars did not have seatbelts and there was 
no such thing as a freeway in Ottawa. The concept that may 
escape some members across the way is that we have evolved. 
Things have changed. Hopefully we are here to make life better 
for all our constituents. That is what the Minister of Justice is 
trying to do.
<P>
	Perhaps not all initiatives proposed by everyone with regard 
to gun control have been perfect. Perfection is not here, but we 
have a good bill before us that will go to committee. It will be a 
better bill when it comes out of committee because there are 
members of the House who will do a job for Canadians by trying 
to make the bill better.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And what do we want? First, we want legislation that provides 
stricter punitive measures for those who use weapons illegally. 
Second, we want to put a stop to arms smuggling or limit it as 
much as possible.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	Third, and there are perhaps other elements I could 
enumerate, we also want to register firearms so we know who 
has them and how many they have. Is this such a strange concept 
in civilized society? After all, I register my car.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I do not have a dog now but when I did I had to register it. 
Some people are telling me if we register our firearms that 
automatically means it is the first step toward confiscation. No 
one ever attempted to confiscate my dog. It was registered. To 
pretend, as some hon. members have, that this is the first step 
toward confiscation is not right.
<P>
	Some of those people saying that will someday have to justify 
what they are doing before their constituents. An hon. member 
sent me what he called his test as to whether we should support 
gun control. In the hon. member's test was a questionnaire. In 
the questionnaire of the member from the Reform Party it said: 
``Do you think members should vote according to the majority 
of their constituents?''
<P>
	If that were the only test applied to the bill-not that it should 
always be the strict and only test any member should be 
governed by-to the hon. members across, this debate would 
have been long over. That is not the only test. The members 
across should not pretend it is either, because they are wrong.
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A few days ago, there was an attempt at a sort of ambush in 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A group calling itself-I use the term loosely-the 
responsible firearms owners of Stormont-Dundas and 
Glengarry sent a poster inviting people to a meeting. Do you 
know what the poster said, Mr. Speaker? I think you do for 
obvious reasons. The poster said: ``Attention all firearms 
owners. This is the last chance to save your firearm'', in 
reference to a meeting at which they asked me to be present 
along with an hon. member from the Reform Party.
<P>
	They sent that kind of information out trying to excite people 
to make them as angry as possible so they would show up with 
anger in mind, not justice. People would go to that meeting 
thinking it was the last chance to save their firearms. Then they 
organized this debate with a neutral chairman who just happened 
to own the local gun shop. When I discovered the local gun shop 
owner was the chairman of the meeting I objected. I said it was 
wrong. They said they would change the chairman for a better 
one.
<P>
	They changed the chairman for a local optometrist. When the 
name became familiar, my staff discovered in our file that he 
had sent me one of those little cards in which he bragged he 
owned 20 guns and if I or my party dared to propose any stricter 
gun control he would work to defeat me, work to defeat my party 
and that those who supported further gun control would never 
remember and that he would never forget. That was the neutral 
chairman they had appointed for the meeting. He was the second 
neutral chairman because the first was not neutral enough.
<P>
	Having done that they decided on the format of the debate in 
which they had an educational presentation by the gun group 
which lasted 20 minutes. It was followed by a presentation by 
the provincial member for the riding who said he did not like the 
bill. That was followed by a member of the Reform Party who 
spoke 15 minutes against the bill. To even it up, on the other side 
they had me speaking for the bill for 15 minutes. That was a fair 
debate? It was an ambush. Mr. Speaker, you know what I am 
talking about.
<P>
	Then they tried to get coverage for this event and those people 
would claim they represented the majority of my constituents.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	No, Mr. Speaker. And I am ready to debate with anyone in my 
riding, with equal time for both sides. I am ready to do so. I am 
ready to prove that the hon. Minister of Justice has put a good 
bill before us, and that this bill will be improved by a 
parliamentary committee made up of members from both sides 
of the House, people who know what they are doing.
<P>
	Whether they come from the Reform Party, the Bloc 
Quebecois or even from here in the minister's party, people will 
work and will work well on this committee, and we will have a 
better bill as the result. But we are not going to make any 
progress so long as people continue to try to dupe others in the 
way I have described. There is nothing to be gained by listening 
to those who claim that voting for the motion tabled in the House 
today by the hon. member for Yorkton-Melville means voting 
to split the bill into two distinct parts.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Nothing is further from the truth. A vote for the motion today 
is not a vote to split the bill. It is a vote to decline second reading 
to the bill. It is a vote to kill the bill. I will not vote to kill the 
bill. It is a good bill. I will work to improve it. We have a good 
piece of legislation and we will make better laws for the citizens 
of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
seems they are starting to feel a little heat on the other side from 
some of their constituents.
<P>
	I would like to add my voice to the chorus we are hearing from 
this side of the House. The Reform Party is opposed to Bill C-68 
because it makes criminals out of ordinary citizens who are 
responsible gun owners. We would like to separate the criminal 
use of firearms from the ownership, transportation and storage 
of firearms in the bill.
<P>
	We heard the chief government whip give us all of the legal 
procedural reasons why this cannot be done. People in Canada 
are sick and tired of the Toronto big city lawyers trying to define 
what can be done. The minister knows we can separate the bill if 
he has the will to do it. He is not willing to do it. He is trying to 
give us an omnibus bill incorporating two things, the protection 
of Canadian citizens and registration. They are not linked.
<P>
	We say strengthen and enforce the law dealing with criminals 
who use guns to commit crimes. That is a reasonable alternative, 
but leave responsible gun owners alone.
<P>
	This bill will place unnecessary restrictions on us. It will limit 
our freedom. It will waste our time and it will put a dent in our 
pocket books. I do not care what the minister says. It will be 
significantly higher than what he estimates.
<P>
	In my riding of Peace River the lawyers who write the laws 
concerning firearms are known as those out of touch eggheads 
from Toronto. I live in a northern riding. These are fancy 
lawmakers who have no idea what it is like to live and work in 
the north. These are lawyers who have never had to worry about 
bears or wolves killing their livestock. Come up north with me 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11127"> 11127 </A></B>
<P>
and maybe I can paint a picture of what it is like. I encourage the 
minister to do that.
<P>
	Several years ago a rancher in my riding saw a black bear 
approaching his young child playing outside. Being a crack shot, 
he grabbed his rifle and pumped two shells into the animal. He 
assumed the bear was not coming over to make a polite 
introduction. Had this incident occurred today the child 
probably would be dead.
<P>
	Talk about saving one life, is it worth it?
<P>
	With the law as written today the rancher first would have to 
go from one room to get the gun and into another room to get the 
ammunition. He would not have had time to get that bear before 
it got his child.
<P>
	Many people in my riding voted against the Conservatives 
because they hated Kim Campbell's Bill C-17. Now they are 
finding out this government is even worse. Maybe there is a 
lesson there to be learned.
<P>
	How will one store ammunition in another room if one lives in 
a one room cabin? Who lives in a one room cabin? Trappers and 
outfitters do. They have lots of them on their trap lines. That is 
what Kim Campbell's law demanded. Hunters and trapping 
guides who depend on their guns for a living do not have fancy 
multiroom houses. They have one room cabins. They would 
have to store their ammunition in one room and their guns in a 
separate one. They would have to build a separate cabin to store 
their ammunition. How ludicrous this gets.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	If a person is moving around their property to fix fences, as 
ranchers do in some parts of northern and western Canada, does 
it make any sense to unload the firearm, put the ammunition 
under the seat and get back into the truck? It does not. Bear 
stories are not as frequent as they used to be but there are still 
parts of the country where bears are a menace to livestock. We 
still have the occasional tragic incident. I encourage the 
minister to listen.
<P>
	Six years ago two tree planters were replanting some cut 
blocks in a reforestation project in my riding. They were 
unarmed and they were charged by a large black bear. One 
managed to climb a tree high enough to get out of trouble. The 
other tree planter was not as lucky. He was killed. Five years ago 
an unarmed timber cruiser had the misfortune of running into a 
grizzly. He did not live to tell his story. If we talk about one life 
being saved, those are a couple of examples.
<P>
	Let us talk about a different kind of hardship, money. In most 
rural areas people cannot afford to register their firearms even if 
it did make any sense. When we start telling a young couple with 
little children struggling to make ends meet who have already 
lost a cow to a wolf or a bear and some calves to other 
misfortunes that they must shell out $300 to $400 to register 
their firearms, we have to wonder from where that money is 
going to come. It will come straight from the mouths of their 
children.
<P>
	Please do not tell me that it is only going to cost $10 or so to 
register a firearm. To properly register anything we need an 
inspection. I believe the minister knows this. When we are 
talking about inspecting distinguishing features such as serial 
numbers and calibre we are going to run into costs.
<P>
	The minister knows that up to 20 per cent of long guns do not 
have proper identification at the moment. Is the government 
planning to run a deficit in this area as well? The cost of 
registering handguns is approximately $75. It is difficult to 
understand how the registration of rifles and shotguns is going 
to be any cheaper. The government estimates the total cost of 
registration at around $85 million. It will probably be a lot 
closer to $500 million, almost six times as much; seven million 
long guns multiplied by $75. Members can work out the math.
<P>
	We have had a handgun registry for some 60 years. Has it 
reduced the incidence of store robbery or domestic violence? 
No, it has not. It has probably increased. How will long gun 
registration improve that balance? If there were any solid proof 
that domestic violence would be reduced as a result of more gun 
control, in rural areas this law would be easier to swallow. There 
is no such proof.
<P>
	The real red herring here, the one I resent the most, is when 
the minister talks about how it will reduce suicides. This is the 
worst case scenario I have ever heard of. My nephew committed 
suicide. It was the most tragic thing that ever happened in our 
family. Did he use a gun to do it? No, he did not. When people 
are in that state of mind they will use whatever they find 
necessary to get the job done. Whether a gun was there, 
whatever was there to get the job done, that is what he used. That 
is the worst possible case the minister put forward.
<P>
	In situations of domestic violence it is much the same. A 
distressed person will use whatever is handy. They will use their 
fists, they will use knives, they will use egg beaters or any item 
they happen to find. Suggesting these items should be registered 
is as ludicrous as registering rifles and shotguns.
<P>
	If there were any solid proof that murders would be reduced 
by requiring registration, tougher gun laws would be more 
palatable. Again, there is no such proof. A retired RCMP 
sergeant wrote recently that in his 27 years with the RCMP he 
was directly involved in investigating 14 murders and attempted 
murders. In only three of those were firearms used. The murders 
involved fire, axes, fists, two-by-fours, strangulation and 
kitchen knives. Registering the few firearms used would not 
have prevented most of those crimes from occurring.
<P>
	Our fancy lawmakers say that cars are registered, so why not 
rifles and shotguns. Has car registration reduced the carnage on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11128"> 11128 </A></B>
<P>
our highways, prevented cars from being stolen or used in the 
commission of crimes? Obviously not.
<P>
	Most of the people in my riding use their guns only 
occasionally. This is very important. These guns have been 
handed down from grandfather to father to son. Most people, 
including myself, use their guns very infrequently. It really 
bothers people that they will have to go through this whole 
process when it is not going to be effective.
<P>
	Mark my words, it is not going to be effective in reducing 
crime. There will be a big cost involved and it will be a big 
inconvenience. These are peaceful, law-abiding citizens who do 
not like to have their freedom limited without a good reason. If it 
could be demonstrated that there is going to be a reduction in the 
criminal use of firearms, that would be a different matter.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	Many have guns which are heirlooms having been passed 
from father to son and so on. Putting all the rules and regulations 
in place to limit the use of these through registration does not 
make any sense. The government will be forcing people to break 
the law in many cases. Many people in my riding have said they 
are not going to register their guns.
<P>
	I urge the government to reconsider this ill-conceived bill. 
Punish the criminal use of guns and do not make criminals out of 
peaceful, law-abiding citizens.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak today in support of the justice 
minister's bill on gun control.
<P>
	I speak as a member who was in the last Parliament which on 
two occasions dealt with firearms legislation. At that time there 
was a large body of support for the initiative in principle. The 
process of finally adopting it did bring about some minor 
modifications which most people in Parliament believed 
improved the bill.
<P>
	In any event, I want to be clearly on record as supporting the 
justice minister's initiative in principle. I am committed to 
working with other colleagues in the House to improve the bill 
where possible and to reframe it so that at the end of the day we 
have the best possible mix of statute, regulation and 
administration for the benefit of the public as a whole and gun 
owners as a group.
<P>
	Before I go further into my remarks, I want to make two quick 
points.
<P>
	The government and I hope, the House have reached a point 
where we are prepared to say that in relation to firearms, 
everything is in. We are not going to have a statute that covers 
just some firearms and not others. Everything is going to be 
recognized as being part of the system or however we choose to 
deal with this. All firearms are seen to be part of the system.
<P>
	Some members opposite and I believe some members on the 
government benches are very sensitive to the issue of this statute 
criminalizing individuals who but for this statute would not be 
criminals. In saying that, we are referring to people who own 
firearms now who might fail, either advertently or 
inadvertently, to fulfil a provision in the new act and thereby 
would be subject to criminal sanction.
<P>
	At first blush, I am sympathetic to that position. Thousands of 
Canadians do not spend very much time worrying about criminal 
law because they are law-abiding citizens. By passing this 
statute we will impose upon them a standard where for a certain 
period of time they are going to have to think about it. They are 
going to have to do something or not do something, comply or 
not comply. It is going to bring them belly up to provisions in 
this statute which create criminal sanction.
<P>
	I am sensitive to that but I want to point out there are already 
provisions in the Criminal Code where otherwise law-abiding 
citizens who own firearms are subject to criminal sanction. In 
existing law, if an otherwise legal owner of a firearm breaks a 
provision of the code dealing with regulation of restricted or 
prohibited firearms, or improper use of other non-prohibited, 
non-restricted firearms, they are subject to criminal sanction.
<P>
	I make those two points. Everything is in. I am sensitive to the 
issue of criminalization, but I am not so sure there is not a way to 
do it which is rational, fair, just, and in compliance with the 
charter and common sense.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	With those two things out of the way I want to address three or 
four segments of the bill.
<P>
	First and perhaps most important is the issue of registration. 
This bill would impose on Canadians an obligation to register 
every firearm. There may be the odd exception here or there, but 
generally everything is in. Every firearm is going to be 
registered. If it does not have a serial number, it will have to 
have some markings or characteristics by which it can be 
identified.
<P>
	The concept of registration has been thought out rationally. I 
do not think it was a political initiative. No one is trying to pull 
the wool over anybody's eyes. Rational individuals, including 
the justice minister, have decided that registration will produce 
certain benefits for Canadians. It will not get rid of disease and it 
will not balance the budget. There are many things it will not do. 
However, registration will have a positive effect in the 
enforcement of prohibition orders.
<P>
	Most rational people will understand that, if they are 
cognizant of what happens when the police are asked to deal 
with the allegation of an illegal firearm at a residence. It is all 
too easy for those who occupy the residence to say: ``That is not 
my firearm; it is her firearm,'' or ``it is my kid's; it belongs to 
my 19-year old''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11129"> 11129 </A></B>
<P>
	If there is a functioning registration system, ultimately the 
owner of that firearm will be registered. There will not be much 
doubt about who the owner is. Maybe it is the kid; maybe it 
is the spouse. In any event the uncertainty will not be there and 
enforcement will be enhanced.
<P>
	Second, those who deal with the trafficking of firearms 
believe, although I do not have any statistical evidence, that it 
will assist in combating smuggling. The fact that domestically 
owned firearms are registered and in the system allows for the 
ability to then identify firearms which are not in the system. The 
good guns are separated from the illegal guns. That will help 
authorities in dealing with smuggling. Otherwise they often do 
not know whether it is a smuggled gun. They just do not know 
the derivation of the firearm.
<P>
	Third, the obligation to register will increase the propensity 
of the gun owner to comply with the existing legislation. He or 
she will see themselves as part of the registered gun owning 
public with a commensurate obligation to take care of their 
firearm properly.
<P>
	At the moment a lot of orphaned firearms are sitting in 
basements and attics. All of us know where they are. They are in 
a little box up in the rafters, or on top of the furnace. In so many 
houses across this country that is where these little orphaned 
guns are.
<P>
	Registration is required so that the people who know the guns 
are there will pull them out. They will get rid of them. They will 
give them away or turn them in. They will disable them, or 
whatever they are going to do. At the end of the day, the guns 
will be registered. They will know they have an obligation to 
make sure the firearm is safely stored and that it is not an 
orphan.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	I think the same thing happens with motor vehicles, aircraft, 
and other things that we register. In any event, I do not know if 
that is going to happen for sure. In a rational way I can see the 
linkage. I am prepared to take the risk of imposing obligations 
on the gun owning public.
<P>
	Last but not least, it is obvious that a firearm with a serial 
number and a registered owner is much easier to trace than a 
firearm with a serial number and no registered owner. That is 
simple logic.
<P>
	I accept that registration is going to have some positive 
benefits and to be sure, there are costs. As colleagues have 
pointed out, there could be huge costs. As I read them, the costs 
will be more than manageable. The costs are bearable by the gun 
owning public. We can find an efficient and effective way to use 
new technology to do it.
<P>
	I accept that there is a grandfather clause which will be to the 
benefit of many gun owning Canadians. I note that the House of 
Commons steering committee of the justice committee was 
meeting this morning to make plans to deal with the initiatives 
of the public in dealing  with this. Many MPs will take part in 
that process to try to make the bill better.
<P>
	I believe that my riding of Scarborough-Rouge River has 
Canada's only handgun manufacturer. That manufacturer does 
about $25 million worth of business a year. Ninety-nine per cent 
of the product is exported into markets all over the world.
<P>
	The firearm has been purchased by the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation hostage release team. It is a quality firearm. We 
have quality firearms here in this country. We make them here. I 
am going to do everything in my power to make sure that this bill 
and the regulations do not impair the ability of my constituent 
business to continue to do $25 million worth of business in 
Toronto and Montreal which is a significant export.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on Reform's 
amendment to Bill C-68 put forward by my colleague, the 
member for Yorkton-Melville.
<P>
	This amendment proposes to split Bill C-68 into two separate 
bills, one dealing with the criminal aspects of the bill and the 
other dealing with firearms regulations. These are two entirely 
separate and unrelated items. It makes sense that these two 
issues be separated and dealt with as two separate bills for 
expediency, simplicity and fairness.
<P>
	Canadians want the opportunity to examine and debate the 
firearms sections of this bill openly and thoroughly. Canadians 
also want to see the crime control sections implemented as soon 
as possible.
<P>
	Most Canadians will agree with increased crime control 
provisions but have difficulty with proposals to increase 
restrictions and control over firearms ownership. There has been 
a great deal of public discontent over proposed firearms 
restrictions which means that this bill is going to be subject to 
intense public scrutiny.
<P>
	Our proposed amendment to split the bill allows the crime 
control provisions to go ahead without delay while the debate on 
gun control regulation continues. I strongly support this motion 
because it is practical. It allows government to push forward 
crime control provisions. At the same time it allows reasonable 
debate and consideration of the controversial proposals 
regarding gun registration and confiscation.
<P>
	Although Canadians would prefer to see more crime control 
than is contained in this bill, the provisions included are clearly 
required and should go forward without delay to be reviewed in 
committee. For example, sections of this bill that I agree with 
call for stiffer sentences and these items should be imposed as 
soon as possible. Canadians have been waiting too long for 
mandatory sentencing of criminals who commit crimes using a 
firearm. This bill proposes mandatory sentencing with terms 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11130"> 11130 </A></B>
<P>
ranging from a minimum of one year to a maximum of 14 years 
to be served consecutively with other sentences.
<P>
	This bill also contains initiatives to toughen gun smuggling 
penalties and mandatory jail sentences of at least four years for 
the criminal misuse of firearms. I wholeheartedly agree with 
these proposals. However, we must not forget that sentences for 
the criminal misuse of firearms have been on the books for 
years, yet remain largely unused. Reformers have been pushing 
for enforcement of these laws and I am pleased to see some of 
our efforts realized in the bill. However, the bill still falls short 
of expectation, as mandatory sentences for criminal neglect 
causing death, manslaughter, attempted murder, sexual assault 
with a weapon, robbery, kidnapping and other violent crimes 
still need to be addressed.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	Despite sections in the bill that strengthen the punishment of 
criminals, there are still many concerns with gun registration 
proposals which must be dealt with separately. An independent 
examination of gun proposals should not hold back efforts to 
address and strengthen criminal sentencing. That is one of the 
fundamental reasons we proposed splitting the bill.
<P>
	Canadians are concerned that gun registration will be 
cumbersome, expensive and, most important, will have 
absolutely no impact on crime prevention. The justice minister 
proposes to squeeze taxpayers out of more than $500 million but 
cannot provide a shred of evidence that this expenditure will 
help control crime.
<P>
	Gun owners are simply not comfortable with proposals to 
sentence law-abiding citizens that fail to register their firearms 
to prison terms of up to 10 years. These proposals are overly 
severe and when compared with other laws are inconsistent and 
do not fit the principle that punishment should fit the crime. 
There appears to be a complete lack of logic and an absence of 
justice when the bill proposes to make prison sentences for 
non-violent gun owners as severe as those for convicted 
murderers. It is nonsense.
<P>
	I support the increase in penalties for violent offenders. 
However, I cannot support such a ludicrous and unjust sentence 
as contained in section 92 of the bill. How can the minister 
justify sentences of up to 10 years for failing to register a gun 
when there is no evidence that registering guns will reduce 
crime?
<P>
	The bill would have much more support if the government 
could provide Canadians with some evidence showing results. 
However, all evidence from New Zealand and Australia shows 
that registration will not have the desired effect of reducing 
crime. Both countries tried gun registration but have since 
abandoned the idea because it was expensive and did nothing to 
prevent or reduce crime.
<P>
	Not only are these proposed laws flawed, they are 
ill-conceived because they cannot be enforced. Police are 
already overworked and understaffed. Our prisons are full and 
are operating at 115 per cent of capacity. It costs over $47,000 a 
year to house a prisoner. Why is the justice minister on a crusade 
to put law-abiding gun owners behind bars? Talk about a 
misguided sense of justice.
<P>
	Government simply cannot enforce these laws without 
spending millions of dollars on more police, parole officers and 
prisons, and the cost of enforcement will be of no benefit to 
Canadians.
<P>
	Current storage and transportation regulations should not be 
punishable under provisions of the Criminal Code. It is nuts. 
The logic and rationale of this section clearly have to be 
reworked. The minister has openly stated that he believes the 
only citizens who should be able to carry guns are those in the 
army and the police. This bill aims to fulfil that goal by 
penalizing legal gun owners with registration and confiscation.
<P>
	Bill C-68 clearly confuses two principles: crime control and 
gun control. These two issues must be separated in order that 
they can be dealt with clearly and logically. Gun registration 
affects law-abiding gun owners, not criminals. Criminals, on 
the other hand, must understand that severe penalties are or will 
be in place should they decide to defy Canadian law. The focus 
of the bill should be on the criminal element, not on punishing 
legitimate gun owners.
<P>
	In good conscience, I cannot support ineffective legislation 
which has as its only measurable function a drain on the public 
purse. Bill C-68 places members in the unenviable position of 
having to choose between voting against ridiculous and wasteful 
proposals such as gun registration or voting for proposals to 
strengthen laws against criminals. As members of Parliament 
we must ensure that the laws we pass are fair and just and that 
they punish the criminal use of firearms, not legitimate gun 
owners.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	Canadians are demanding to live in a safe and just 
environment, one that protects the rights and safety of 
law-abiding citizens and punishes criminals. This is the vision 
of Canada that I will support in legislation. The bill as a whole 
does not support that vision. I will support a bill dealing with 
Criminal Code amendments but not one that includes such 
expensive and redundant measures as those contained in the gun 
registration proposals.
<P>
	I would like to have an opportunity to vote for the Criminal 
Code amendments but I simply cannot support the wasteful 
expenditures contained in the registration proposals. These 
measures are not a cost effective way of improving public 
safety. I will vote against the bill if gun registration is included.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11131"> 11131 </A></B>
<P>
	Few bills are perfect. Clearly it is difficult to draft a bill that 
will meet the needs and concerns of all Canadians. Let's get 
real. As the bill now stands, as one comprehensive, 
all-encompassing bill, members of Parliament will be forced 
to vote against the entire bill because they disagree with the 
expensive and unworkable gun registration section.
<P>
	The division of intent in Bill C-68 is obvious. The proposed 
amendment put forward by my colleague to cut the bill into two 
sections, one dealing with Criminal Code amendments and 
another dealing with gun registration, makes good sense. Crime 
control provisions need to be pushed forward right away. 
However gun control proposals require serious and careful 
examination.
<P>
	Considerations of both cost effectiveness and crime control 
effectiveness need to be primary considerations. These must be 
clearly established with solid evidence to back up proposals.
<P>
	In conclusion, if the government is seriously committed to 
meeting the needs of Canadians, then it will support the 
amendment. If on the other hand it is determined to ram the bill 
through as presently drafted against the will of many Canadians, 
then it will simply pay the price for not listening, the same price 
the Conservatives paid after the last election. Only time will tell 
if the Liberals are listening to Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, 
NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad to have the opportunity to make a 
few brief remarks regarding the government's proposals on gun 
control. I would like to separate my remarks. I have substantive 
concerns about the legislation and I would like to indicate why it 
is worthwhile to support the amendment to split the bill into two. 
Also I have some concerns from the public at large.
<P>
	I would like to congratulate those legitimate gun owners 
across the country who have been seriously concerned with 
these proposals and for the way that they presented cogent 
arguments. There has been very little hysteria or exhibitions of 
frustration on their part, although they would have been more 
than justified in doing so.
<P>
	What we are talking about is a respect for different points of 
view. People have different ways of life. They do different 
things for their livelihood, recreation and hobbies. Gun owners 
deserve to have the tolerance of those who do not share their 
views and their activities. This unfortunately is not the case with 
regard to the government's proposals.
<P>
	I would like to mention some concerns about public attitudes. 
In spite of indications that there is overwhelming support for 
more gun control proposals, the only poll that really has asked 
Canadians whether or not they think the bill will make any 
difference took place in Saskatchewan.
<P>
	Of the people canvassed in Saskatchewan, 50 per cent were 
women and 50 per cent were men. Fifty per cent owned guns and 
50 per cent did not. Eighty-six per cent indicated that expanding 
the registration of firearms will not decrease crime.
<P>
	Of those who supported registration, almost 50 per cent 
thought it would not reduce crime. Seventy-five per cent of 
those polled thought there should be an evaluation of the current 
gun control laws before further changes are made. Surely this is 
a perfectly legitimate and justifiable concern.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	Canadians were asked at the turn of the year whether they 
thought their perceptions about the increase in violent crime was 
caused by the absence of stronger gun control laws. Only 5 per 
cent thought increases in violent crimes were caused by 
insufficient gun control regulations. When that was broken 
down by region, 10 per cent of Quebecers thought it was a result 
of inadequate gun control legislation, in the west only 1 per cent 
thought it was as a result of inadequate gun control legislation.
<P>
	Canadians have recognized that these proposals will not 
work, they will not reduce crime and they will not reduce 
violence in the home, but will just constitute a tax on legitimate 
gun owners.
<P>
	It is often said that the police are in favour of these gun 
control proposals. Again I have some numbers from 
Saskatchewan. Of the Saskatoon police force, 98.5 per cent is 
opposed to these recommendations, 94.5 per cent of the Prince 
Albert police force and 100 per cent of some of the smaller cities 
in Saskatchewan are opposed. Therefore, there is no support 
either among rank and file police officers, those who actually 
have to deal with the question of guns in people's homes and 
who have to risk their lives every day.
<P>
	The last point I would like to make is that aboriginal peoples 
have clearly indicated that these proposals are an infringement 
on their treaty rights to hunt. It is unfair and inappropriate to 
attack aboriginal peoples and their way of life as the government 
is doing.
<P>
	I have some substantive points. For years Canadians have 
been asking for more crime control but the minister is not 
responding to the demand. He has missed the boat on that issue 
and instead is hitting responsible, law-abiding gun owners with 
yet another round of tighter and tougher gun control restrictions.
<P>
	Those parts of the bill that are tough on the criminal use of 
firearms are supportable. We need to be tough on the smuggling 
of illegal weapons and the use of guns in serious offences. We 
<P>

<B><A NAME="11132"> 11132 </A></B>
<P>
can all support those recommendations. However, concerning 
registration and the way in which Bill C-17 works, we still do 
not yet have a full analysis of the effectiveness of the last gun 
control regulations. I am sure we should have that before we 
move on.
<P>
	Even the Auditor General has called for a thorough evaluation 
of existing gun control programs before any additional changes 
are made. He says that Canada's gun control program is 
controversial and complex. An evaluation of the program is 
essential to give the Canadian public and members of 
Parliament the assurance that its objectives are being met.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member will have the floor 
immediately after question period when we resume debate.
<P>
	It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 30(5) we will now 
proceed to statements by members.

	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
March 27 the Federation of Canadian Municipalities announced 
the establishment of a 20 per cent club of Canadian 
municipalities taking action on climate change. The 
announcement took place in Berlin just prior to the conference 
of the parties to the framework convention on climate change.
<P>
	Canadian cities have emerged as leaders in responding to the 
challenge of climate change. As founding members of the 20 per 
cent club, they have all committed to significantly reducing 
emissions of the gases that cause climate change by amounts in 
the order of 20 per cent.
<P>
	In Berlin they will challenge other municipalities around the 
world to follow the Canadian example and join them in efforts to 
combat climate change.
<P>
	In addition to the global benefits that can result from 
municipal actions, each member of the 20 per cent club is 
realizing significant economic benefit from increased energy 
efficiency and improved health for its citizens through 
reductions in local air pollution.
<P>
	In joining together, members agree to share information, 
monitor progress and celebrate results on actions which they are 
taking.
<P>
	Founding members of the 20 per cent club include the cities of 
Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Edmonton, Regina-

and Immigration: No more talk about readiness to accept 
immigrants. Instead, we impose on them a new tax to reduce the 
federal deficit even though they have yet to step foot in the 
country. Worse yet, we are asking refugees who arrived less than 
a year ago, or who are still outside the country, to absorb 
Canada's debt.
<P>
	How can we believe that the minister is acting in good faith 
when even the United States and Australia impose no settlement 
fees on refugees?
<P>
	How can we exact settlement fees from refugees when they 
were forced to leave their countries and when Canada has 
recognized their right to settle here? The minister's attitude is

Speaker, this 35th Parliament has an enormous responsibility to 
get Canada's economic, democratic, constitutional and criminal 
justice policies in order. The clock is ticking on all fronts.
<P>
	This is why many Canadians were upset with the recent 
political manoeuvring by which the House was delayed in 
passing back to work legislation on the rail strike.
<P>
	Farmers lost sales, mines laid off workers, manufacturing 
plants shut down and our export customers were again forced to 
look to other countries for supplies.
<P>
	Labour management disputes must be settled through an 
improved collective bargaining process. Canadians were 
disappointed that the Liberal government defeated Reform's 
final offer selection private members' bill and yet the very next 
day ran into the political squalls of the Bloc and the NDP.

	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
red book the Liberal government made a commitment to 
reducing carbon dioxide levels in Canada by 20 per cent by the 
year 2005. In December of last year the government took a big 
step toward meeting this target by introducing the national 
biomass ethanol program which has encouraged large scale 
production of ethanol.
<P>
	The ethanol task force was encouraged by this commitment 
and is now focusing its efforts on promoting new renewable 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11133"> 11133 </A></B>
<P>
fuels such as diesel fuel made from vegetable oil. Biodiesel has 
already established a large market in Germany and France. The 
Canadian mining industry has shown interest in using the fuel 
underground due to a lack of harmful emissions.
<P>
	Biodiesel also holds the advantage of being 100 per cent 
biodegradable. If it spills, costly environmental cleanups are 
unnecessary.
<P>
	I hope the government will respond to renewable diesel fuel 
with the same enthusiasm it did with ethanol.

Contemplacion, a Filipino nanny, rejecting a plea from Amnesty 
International and others for a judicial review.
<P>
	Why was the international community not outraged? Where 
was the United Nations, which just last year discussed the plight 
of immigrant workers?
<P>
	Had this nanny been a woman of power and wealth, would she 
have met her tragic fate? Wrongful convictions are known to 
have happened. Canada had Donald Marshall, David Milgaard 
and Guy-Paul Morin in recent times. Time gave these victims of 
injustice a chance to prove their innocence, a chance denied to 
Ms. Contemplacion.

Need I remind the House that the Supreme Court decision on the 
Daviault case was heavily criticized, given that intoxication was 
used as a line of defence against a charge of sexual assault or 
assault.
<P>
	The minister claims that his bill will ensure that all people 
who commit violent crimes in a state of extreme inebriation will 
be considered criminally responsible for their behaviour. 
Regardless of the minister's bill, a sexual aggressor whose 
victim succumbed to his attack is still free to use extreme 
drunkenness as a line of defence.

<P>
	No more studies. It is time for the federal government to make 
a real commitment to the health of Canadian women by actively

of the self-scrutiny part of every birthday, and represents a 
continuation of the rich tradition of superior films with which 
the National Film Board has been involved. This film has 
already won prizes at major festivals in Canada, the U.S. and

``conservation is our main issue'', cried Emma Bonino, 
spokesperson for the European Union. However, the activities of 
the Spanish fishermen off the nose and tail of the Grand Banks 
give the lie to that statement.
<P>
	While the world community works toward a treaty in high 
seas fishing, the Spanish continue to pillage fish stocks. While 
tens of thousands of Atlantic Canadian ground fishermen can no 
longer earn their living from the sea, the few remaining 
groundfish stocks are being overfished by foreigners. We cannot 
simply stand by and watch this happen. We first and foremost 
have an obligation to defend the interests of our people and our 
marine environment.
<P>
	The European community's own report in 1992 condemned 
the Spanish for violating fishing regulations. We must have 
effective international agreements, one providing for legitimate 
international inspection, one providing for legitimate 
international enforcement and one dealing with our real 
conservation concerns.
<P>
	I commend the minister for his efforts to achieve such an 
agreement. At the same time I encourage him to stand firm in 
protecting Canada's interests in this dispute. He can do so 
confident that Canadians stand with him.

Quebecers will not be ready either in September 1995 or next

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, despite an apparent lull in Bujumbura, tensions 
between the Tutsi and Hutu tribes remain very high following 
massacres that claimed more than 500 victims. More than 
20,000 people have fled to Zaire from Burundi. The president of 
Burundi admitted this was the beginning of genocide, and 
meanwhile, our Minister of Foreign Affairs is so optimistic he 
seems indifferent to what is happening.
<P>
	Could the Prime Minister indicate what measures were 
considered last night at a meeting of the UN Security Council to 
put a stop to the violence in Burundi?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada 
is very concerned with what is going on in Burundi. We do not 
want to see a repeat of what happened in Rwanda.
<P>
	Last week the secretary of state appeared before the 
parliamentary standing committee on foreign affairs. We spent 
three hours debating how we could help people in Burundi so as 
not to repeat the atrocities of Rwanda.
<P>
	The Secretary of State for Latin America and Africa was in 
Burundi from February 15 to February 17 at a conference. 
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we are talking about incipient genocide. We have 
just seen a terrible example of this in a neighbouring country, 
Rwanda, and the Prime Minister has nothing to say about this. 
My question was directed to him, since he is responsible for the 
government and is ultimately responsible for determining 
foreign policy.
<P>
	I want to ask him whether, instead of hiding behind a junior 
minister, he, as leader of the government, the Prime Minister of 
Canada, the man who has the responsibility, will finally realize 
and admit that the only way-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> They will first have to calm down, Mr. 
Speaker. Then I will go on.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask the Leader of the Opposition to put 
his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I want to ask the leader of the government, assuming there is 
one, whether he will finally realize and admit that the only way 
to avoid a repeat of the terrible blood bath in Rwanda is to send a 
UN ceasefire monitoring group to Burundi as soon as possible?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think it is unconscionable that when I ask a member 
who is a parliamentary secretary, who has more experience in 
this House than the Leader of the Opposition and is very well 
informed-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> -and who took the trouble 
to prepare for Question Period, when I ask him to give 
information on behalf of the government, I think members 
should respect these people who are parliamentary secretaries 
and have certain responsibilities. They have information on the 
issue at hand.
<P>
	In Burundi, as in the case of the country next door, Canada has 
always made a point of staying, whatever the circumstances. 
When all other countries had left Rwanda, only Canada stayed 
behind. We have always maintained a visible and occasionally 
unique presence, in the circumstances. In Burundi, we are now 
trying to avoid the worst. I think the information the House was 
given by the parliamentary secretary was very properly 
expressed and accurately described the government's position.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, instead of trying to hide his failure to act under 
soothing assurances, I want to ask the Prime Minister whether or 
not he would agree Canada must show leadership by putting 
pressure on the UN to send a ceasefire monitoring group to 
Burundi which, I may remind him, is a member country of the 
Francophonie?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last week, I had a chance to discuss this kind of 
problem and the Francophonie with the Secretary General of the 
Francophonie.
<P>
	We discussed the possibility for the Francophonie to get more 
involved in political problems, for instance in Rwanda and 
Burundi, more or less like we used the Commonwealth to try and 
find a solution to the problems in South Africa. We want the 
countries of the Francophonie to be able to intervene in 
circumstances like these, and I am entirely satisfied with the 
way the Minister of Foreign Affairs is handling this matter.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
debate between Canada and the European Union at the 
Conference on the Law of the Sea under way in New York City 
shows the extent of the disagreement between the parties despite 
the rift emerging within the European Union. Indeed, apparently 
realizing the importance of Canada's complaints, a number of 
countries, notably the United Kingdom, refuse to impose 
sanctions.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister report on the progress of the ongoing 
negotiations between Canada and the European Union and tell 
us whether or not talks will continue with European Union 
Fisheries Commissioner Bonino, who has just been recalled to 
Europe?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are still negotiating with the European Community 
on this issue. We have clearly indicated to the European 
Community that our intention was to develop a fisheries 
protection plan for this area. Our goal is to protect the 
environment and we will press our point.
<P>
	We want to protect fish stocks for future generations. That is 
what is a stake and I think that progress has been made in the 
negotiations. We are urging the European Community to make 
sure that all vessels comply with international laws and refrain 
from harvesting fish that should not be harvested. Once an 
agreement has been reached on this subject, I am sure the 
problem will disappear.
<P>
	I should tell the House that, when I spoke with Mr. Santer, the 
President of the European Commission, who took the initiative 
of phoning me yesterday, we talked about the need to give top 
priority to settling the conservation problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, can 
the Prime Minister confirm that, while favouring of course a 
negotiated settlement with the European Union, Canada will 
stand firmly by its position and take whatever measures are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11137"> 11137 </A></B>
<P>
necessary to enforce the fishing moratorium on the Grand 
Banks?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have taken rather dramatic measures so far, but our 
goal is to find a solution through negotiation and preserve the 
species on the Grand Banks.
<P>
	I think that our policy meets the support of all Canadians and 
we intend to pursue our efforts until we have the assurance that 
these fish stocks will be preserved for future generations.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the removal of Anne-Marie Doyle as a commissioner 
on the Somali inquiry because of her connections with Bob 
Fowler, the former deputy minister of defence and a key figure 
in the inquiry, raises some disturbing questions.
<P>
	Her appointment and removal is just another in a long list of 
events that suggest the minister of defence simply does not 
know what is going on in his department. He was kept in the dark 
about the third airborne video. He was not briefed about high 
level reports on morale and now this.
<P>
	If the Somalia inquiry commissioners were investigated and 
chosen for their knowledge and their impartiality, as he said, 
how could he have possibly been unaware of the connection 
between Ms. Doyle and Bob Fowler? Everyone else seemed to 
know about it.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find 
the line of questioning of the hon. leader of the third party to be 
most disturbing.
<P>
	Ms. Doyle has agreed to withdraw her name as one of the 
commissioners. She is a person of great talent, ability and 
knowledge of government. She would have served with great 
distinction in that commission. However there have been 
questions of perception as to whether or not she would be 
impartial because of her friendship with the former deputy 
minister.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	She decided, although she felt she could discharge her duties 
as the government expected she would be able to do, that it 
would be better for her to withdraw at this point in time.
<P>
	As to the events that led up to the selection of the 
commissioners, there was much discussion about the suitability 
of those appropriate. The degree and the longevity of the 
friendship with the former deputy minister and his wife were not 
fully explored. If that is a cause for concern on the part of hon. 
members of the House, I apologize for not having had the 
information in my possession before we made the decision to 
select those people.
<P>
	A replacement will be chosen soon. I suggest we let the 
commission get on with its job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadians will be wondering whether this was just a 
bungle for which an apology is sufficient or whether there is 
something more to it and whether it was planned.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence announced his intention to 
hold an inquiry in November. Bob Fowler did not leave his post 
as deputy minister until January. Before he left did Mr. Fowler 
play any role in the drafting of the terms of reference of the 
inquiry? Did he recommend any names of commissioners to the 
government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this line 
of inquisitorial questions is absolutely anathema to the 
Canadian parliamentary system.
<P>
	We have seen members of that party adopt the most scurrilous 
of congressional American tactics in dragging the names of 
public servants through the mud in this country and we will not 
tolerate that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are simply doing our job. The minister would do a 
better service to the House by answering the question.
<P>
	Surely the minister will acknowledge that any appearance of 
partiality or connection with the people the Somalia inquiry is 
investigating undermines the whole purpose of the inquiry.
<P>
	Could the minister categorically state that Bob Fowler, the 
former deputy minister of defence, had nothing to do with 
framing the terms of reference of the inquiry and played no role 
whatsoever in proposing the name of Anne-Marie Doyle as a 
possible panel member?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I made a 
number of inquiries on the suitability of certain individuals for 
the inquiry. I consulted with some of my cabinet colleagues.
<P>
	The name of Anne-Marie Doyle had come to my attention as 
someone who had served with great distinction at the OECD. It 
was I who put her name forward. I certainly feel that she was a 
good choice.
<P>
	With respect to the terms of reference of the inquiry, the terms 
of reference were made public last week. I worked on the terms 
of reference personally with the Judge Advocate General, an 
individual appointed by the Prime Minister of Canada, directly 
responsible not to the chief of defence staff, not to the deputy 
minister, but to the minister who stands responsible in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11138"> 11138 </A></B>
<P>
House. I take responsibility for the terms of reference and stand 
by them.
<P>
	If the hon. member finds something wrong with the terms of 
reference, if he has accusations to make, let him have the guts to 
make the accusations.

my question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	The United Nations Protection Force in the former Yugoslavia 
is facing increasing provocation in Bosnia. This situation has 
led to Serbian artillery fire against four Muslim security zones 
placed under the protection of UNPROFOR, namely Sarajevo, 
Bihac, Tuzla and Gorazde.
<P>
	Can the minister give us an update on the situation in Bosnia, 
given that the temporary truce, which was violated, will expire 
in May, and can he also tell us about the upcoming renewal of the 
mandate for Canadian peacekeepers?
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
we are very concerned about the current situation in the former 
Yugoslavia. We discussed the issue of personnel rotation in 
Bosnia and in Croatia. A final decision has not been made with 
regard to the next two to three months. I believe that the Prime 
Minister will consult the other party leaders regarding the 
possibility of holding a debate, perhaps tomorrow evening. 
Following that, we will maka a decision on our commitment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a supplementary.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us about the recent meeting of the 
contact group in London, and can he also tell us if Canada still 
opposes new air strikes by NATO forces, as suggested by the 
new general in charge of UNPROFOR?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have 
not changed our position on the use of NATO air power. It can be 
used in certain circumstances under the supervision of the 
United Nations.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, we have been one of the strongest 
proponents of the dual key mechanism whereby the actual use of 
that air power is under the auspices of the United Nations, the 
special representative, Mr. Akashi, in the former Yugoslavia. 
Nothing has changed to alter our views on the use of NATO air 
power.

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Somalia 
inquiry was to look into the possibility that a high level 
cover-up occurred in DND, yet the Prime Minister's office 
approved the appointment of one of Fowler's oldest friends to 
the inquiry and strongly defended Mr. Fowler's record in 
question period.
<P>
	Since the Prime Minister's actions have prematurely judged 
Mr. Fowler's role in the Somalia affair, does he not believe he 
has compromised the integrity of the entire inquiry?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the inquiry involves a lot of people. I am not the type of 
person who finds someone guilty until there is proof.
<P>
	I know Mr. Fowler and a lot of people in the Department of 
National Defence and the armed forces who have been involved 
in this problem. I am not presuming anybody has done anything 
wrong until the inquiry is over.
<P>
	As far as Mr. Fowler is concerned, I have known him a long 
time. He has been an excellent public servant. He has rendered 
great service in many departments. He was the deputy minister 
of defence. He will testify like anyone else. I am not about to 
cast doubt on the character of any person who works very 
faithfully for the Government of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad that 
the government has finally bowed to pressure and has arranged 
for Ms. Doyle to resign from the Somalia inquiry, but the 
question still remains. I cannot believe that inquiries were not 
made on this sort of person. Why can the defence minister not 
anticipate these problems until they blow up in his face? Has the 
minister lost control of his entire department?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister has answered those questions. 
Ambassador Doyle was very well known in the public service. It 
is very difficult for a minister to presume that somebody knows 
somebody else in the department if they do not know them 
personally. Hundreds of thousands of people work in the 
government. Even in my own office it is very difficult to know if 
someone knows someone else.
<P>
	When this came to light, an investigation was undertaken with 
the other members of the commission to determine whether she 
was qualified. There was consultation as to whether it was an 
impediment. We sought advice from outside and everyone said 
there was no impediment. However, Ms. Doyle decided for the 
<P>

Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	Last week, in a residential neighbourhood in Montreal, a 
bomb exploded in front of a building belonging to a motorcycle 
gang. That bombing, which could have injured local residents, 
was yet another episode in the gang war which has been going on 
for several months in the Montreal region and which is related to 
control of the drug trade.
<P>
<B>(1435 ) </B>
<P>
	Since the conflicts between various trafficking groups are

to include specific anti-gang provisions?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the federal government 
has received and is considering suggestions made by the 
Montreal police as well as other police forces with respect to 
amendments to the Criminal Code to outlaw the membership in 
criminal organizations.
<P>
	I want to point out to the hon. member we are considering 
those suggestions and I am doing so with the Solicitor General's 
ministry and the RCMP. We are examining the difficult question 
of how such an organization can be defined and how 
membership in such an organization could be determined.
<P>
	In the meantime, I want to emphasize in response to the 
question that the criminal activities engaged in by these groups 
are already proscribed by the Criminal Code, including 
conspiracy to commit such criminal acts.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in addition to obtaining a definition of a gang or a 
criminal organization from Justice officials or the police, will 
the minister, who seems more bent on conducting studies than 
taking action, pledge to amend the Criminal Code, so as to 
include specific and concrete measures to deal with these gangs?

has a formula of words which he would care to bring forward for 
our consideration, we would be happy to receive it.
<P>
	The challenge is to identify the nature of the group that is to be 
covered by such a provision, the characteristics the group would 
have and the method of objectively determining membership.

it without infringing upon legitimate organizations. If the

question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	It has been widely reported that the minister's own officials 
had prepared an extensive analysis of the Pearson airport 
transaction prior to its cancellation. It clearly established that 
the selection process was fair and transparent. It ruled out any 
role of patronage and indicated that the deal was much better in 
terms of returns to the government than anything the 
government's own advisers said could be expected.
<P>

1993 exists, that he read it and that he passed it on to Mr. Nixon 
for his review?
<P>

Stephen Leacock working at Transport Canada.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> I can say that the report in question, which was 
dated November 4, and an earlier report had been prepared prior 
to my becoming the Minister of Transport. I want to indicate to 
the hon. member that nowhere in that report did it indicate that 
the deal was one that should be supported by the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, can the 
Minister of Transport confirm that he read the Nixon report? If 
he did, did he advise the Prime Minister that it contradicted 
entirely the advice and analysis of the government's own 
officials and an outside adviser?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a rather pathetic sight to see Reform Party 
members who talk of trying to save money for the Canadian 
taxpayer and who are very concerned about getting the facts 
bring up a matter like this. Not only did I read the report but I 
also read the Nixon report.
<P>
	What the hon. member might be better off doing is checking 
with the staff at Transport Canada, including the deputy minister 
and assistant deputy minister, who were not privy to writing the 
report. Not only that, they were sent home because the

like the kind of advice it was getting from senior public servants

regarding its operations, although it is his ministerial duty to be 
fully informed of the activities of Canada's secret service?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, Ms. Menke's report concerns a period prior to my 
becoming minister. It concerns 1992 and 1993. I must also add 
that its annual report is not the only method CSIS uses to inform 
its minister. It reports orally and in writing to the minister and 
does not depend solely on annual reports. I am currently 
reviewing Ms. Menke's recommendations and will do my best to 
improve the situation, which dates back to a period before the 
government came to office.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
since we now know that CSIS deliberately kept information 
from the solicitor general, how do we know the solicitor general 
is answering our questions fully on CSIS activities, given that he 
himself has been kept in the dark?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I repeat what I said before to the hon. member.
<P>
	The annual report of CSIS to the Solicitor General is not the 
only means by which the Solicitor General is informed about the 
activities of CSIS. In between the annual reports, the Solicitor 
General gets many oral and written reports and briefings as time 
goes on. This material may or may not be reflected in the annual 
report. This is just one of many ongoing means of informing the 
minister.
<P>
	My hon. friend should not have hesitated to say that the 
certificate of the inspector general dealing with the 1992-93 
annual report to the minister actually concluded: ``I have 
concluded that overall, the 1992-93 annual report provides a

	Would the Prime Minister inform this House if he was aware 
of the internal analysis which suggested the Pearson deal was a 
good economic deal for Canadians, that the selection process 
was fair and transparent, and that cancellation of the deal could 
cost the taxpayers between $500 million and $2 billion?
<P>
<B>(1445 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Reform Party member who asked the first question 
inquired whether I had read the report. I indicated that I had. It 
seems the transport critic for Reform has not read it.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	Two options were put forward in the document to which the 
hon. member refers. Let me tell you what the two options are, 
Mr. Speaker, so the hon. member will be aware of them.
<P>
	One option was to cancel the deal. That was the option in the 
document. The second was to renegotiate the deal. Nowhere in 
the document did anybody recommend that the deal that was 
struck days before the election by a lame duck government 
should be maintained.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a copy of the document which contradicts what 
the minister says.
<P>
	My supplementary question is for the Prime Minister. 
Allegations of a Liberal cover-up in the Pearson deal are being 
made in the nation's media as well as in the House. At the same 
time, more and more documentation supporting these 
accusations keeps surfacing.
<P>
	When is the Prime Minister going to hold an inquiry into the 
whole sordid affair, not an inquiry by a Liberal dominated 
Standing Committee on Transport or a Senate inquiry by the 
Tory dominated other place but a real, impartial public judicial 
inquiry, the kind the Minister of Transport threatened the Senate 
with in October?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a court case is now under way. The other place will 
determine whether it wishes to pursue the matter.
<P>
	I would have thought the hon. member and most responsible 
members in the House of Commons would understand the 
biggest threat that exists at Pearson today is the fact that we 
could have 10,000 to 15,000 people working at Pearson. We 
could be building the kind of facility that the travelling public 
deserve if only people would act in a responsible way.
<P>
	At this time in our history when the budget has been brought 
in, with all the efforts being made by Canadians from coast to 
coast to get our fiscal House in order, the hon. member and 
others are prepared for political purposes, and for political 
purposes only, to put the Canadian taxpayer at risk for $445 
million.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury 
Board.
<P>
	According to Treasury Board's latest statistics, anglophones 
in Quebec are five times better served by the federal public 
service than francophones in Canada in general. In fact, to serve 
an anglophone minority of 9.2 per cent in Quebec, the federal 
government staffs 52.4 per cent of its jobs with bilinguals. If the 
federal government used the same ratio in Ontario, it would 
have to staff 10,000 bilingual positions instead of 3,000.
<P>
	How can the President of the Treasury Board justify this 
lopsided application of federal standards for service in the other 
official language?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we quite clearly-as the commissioner of official 
languages has also indicated-want to ensure that people can get 
service in the official language of their choice in this country.
<P>
	Obviously a high level of service exists now. The 
commissioner indicated that in 90 per cent or more cases, people 
can get the service they want when they want it. It is not perfect. 
More work still needs to be done. Certainly the government is 
committed to help make a reality the choice of Canadians to 
have federal government services in the language of their 
choice.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the official statistics would lead us to believe that 
the only well served minority in Canada is the one in Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
given the unequal service provided to francophones and 
anglophones in this country by the federal government, will the 
President of the Treasury Board commit himself in front of this 
House to ensuring that the planned staff cuts of 45,000 do not 
erode even more the quality of service provided to francophones 
outside Quebec?

	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board

country people are not being served in the official language of 
their choice. People can get and should be getting services in 
either French or English throughout Canada. It may need 
improvement in some areas but there is still a very substantial,

<P>

developments in the former Yugoslavia in the last few months, 
not the least of which is President Tudjman's belief that 
UNPROFOR should leave Croatia.
<P>
	This matter was resolved some weeks ago and there have been 
discussions about a new kind of force in Croatia. The role of 
Canada and other nations in that force is something for 
discussion.
<P>
	We have been preparing the two battalions of the Royal 22nd

Monday. However, a final decision on the actual deployment is 
yet to be taken.
<P>
	The government House leader may be talking with the

difficult subject.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are glad to hear there have been discussions with 
other parties but there have been no discussions between the 
government and the opposition on whether they should go

<P>
	The minister now says perhaps a debate tomorrow. The

<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence

the hon. member is technically correct in the sense that the

whereby we do not continue, those troops would stay in place for 
a certain period of time until replacements could be found. 
However, we believe that we have the flexibility to discharge

this is the day that the minister of immigration can show us what

	The minister only needs to follow the advice of his own 
officials and use existing legislation to immediately deport 
Laotian gang enforcer, Boujan Inthavong, and overrule the

<P>
	This thug Inthavong helped beat a young 17-year-old to 
death. He was ordered deported, appealed his deportation and 
got a refugee decision in 50 minutes.
<P>
	Will the minister today tell me what his decision is on Boujan 
Inthavong? Will he declare this thug a danger to the public and 
use existing laws to deport him today?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and

question some time ago.
<P>
	I told him then and I repeat again today that our officials have 
served him notice that they will be recommending action 
according to section 53 as a result of that. The individual has a 
certain length of time to respond. Until that time has elapsed the 
recommendation cannot be made to the minister.
<P>
	As I told the member then and I tell him today, when the 
recommendation comes to my desk I know fully what to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is a reason why I ask these questions. In case the minister 
is not aware, the deadline is today, March 28. That is why I am 
asking the question.
<P>
	All we are trying to do is help the police forces clean up our 
streets of thugs like this.
<P>
	If the minister orders this thug deported to Laos can he 
actually get him out to Laos? My understanding is that Laos is 
going to say to us: ``Sorry, we don't want this thug''. How is the 
minister going to get him out of the country?
<P>

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-68, an act respecting firearms and other weapons, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Resuming debate with 
the hon. member for Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing who has four 
minutes remaining.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, 
NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, as I was saying before the break, the 
Auditor General of Canada advised the government to evaluate 
the present gun control program before moving on to any 
additional provisions. I quoted from the auditor general's 
statement.
<P>
	It is also interesting to note that the Wade report indicated that 
police officers across the country have said that present gun 
control regulations are ``a nearly impenetrable maze''.
<P>
	Instead of the federal government taking the time to see if 
Canada's gun laws are working, and they are already among the 
most stringent in the world, it has preferred to go after 
law-abiding people with more laws, more restrictions and more 
costs. If passed the legislation will result in law-abiding 
citizens having their legally acquired personal property subject 
to unprecedented scrutiny and red tape, again unmatched 
anywhere else in the world.
<P>
	Law-abiding citizens will face criminal records unless they 
succumb to the legislation that will do nothing, as we all know, 
to reduce crime but will cost millions of dollars and will be very 
complex and cumbersome to administer. It appears members 
opposite simply do not trust people who legally own and 
responsibly use guns. The western provinces have taken the lead 
in ensuring that the government is aware of the widespread 
opposition across western provinces to the legislation which, as 
I say, simply will not work.
<P>
	It is easy to support proposals that deal with the criminal use 
of firearms which is, after all, surely what gun control should be 
about. Proposing to clamp down on the smuggling of illegal 
weapons can be supported as can proposing stiffer penalties for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11145"> 11145 </A></B>
<P>
the criminal use of firearms. We should be dealing with crime as 
those  provisions do and with crime prevention. We should be 
putting the millions of dollars the proposal will cost toward 
fighting crime in the streets.
<P>
	A couple of specific provisions are worthy of note. In 
particular let us be reminded that all provinces and the country 
at large are facing extreme difficulties with regard to finance. 
Instead of tying up enormous police resources in a bureaucratic 
registration system, police officers should be on the streets 
dealing with crime in our communities.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	I should like to close on the following two points. One is the 
quite remarkable arbitrary powers provided in the legislation to 
the Minister of Justice in section 109. The Minister of Justice 
clearly is of the view that provincial attorneys general will not 
uphold the law with regard to any legislation that is passed.
<P>
	That is quite a remarkable reaction when we know that every 
attorney general has the legal responsibility and will carry out 
the law as implemented. The arbitrary extreme powers awarded 
to the federal minister in the legislation are completely 
unacceptable and should not be countenanced.
<P>
	I point to one provision that raises the absurdity of the 
legislation. Clause 35 will make it easier for an American hunter 
to hunt on Canadian publicly owned land for 60 days than it will 
for a Canadian to do so. Surely it is absurd and surely it points to 
some of the major problems contained in the legislation.
<P>
	I wish the minister would evaluate, as the auditor general and 
as the western ministers of justice have asked him to do, the 
proposals to see whether or not they are working effectively. If 
they are not working effectively and if indeed we could reduce 
crime and violence in the home by something similar, we could 
support it. However at the moment there is no evidence to 
suggest that and I am happy to support the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to debate the amendment to split 
Bill C-68 respecting the Firearms Act.
<P>
	As debate progresses on the bill the level of emotional 
rhetoric increases. We heard from members of the House 
interests of all kinds represented here. Feminist groups and their 
representatives in the House have somehow managed to find a 
correlation between long gun ownership and violence against 
women.
<P>
	We have heard from people who claim there is a correlation 
between the number of guns in the country and the levels of 
criminal activity, even though they are unable to show us 
numbers to back up the implicit assertion.
<P>
	We have heard from anti-gun purists. The parliamentary 
secretary to the minister of immigration told us that when she 
walks into a gun club she says: ``Gentlemen, I am your worst 
nightmare''. Most disturbing is that the Minister of Justice 
thinks only armies and police ought to be able to own guns.
<P>
	Those interests deserve to be represented as do all interests in 
the House. However, we achieve nothing by clouding Bill C-68 
in rhetoric arguing that guns are inherently evil and must be 
done away with or rhetoric presuming that violence against 
women is somehow related to whether or not Canadians need to 
get a licence for their duck hunting shotguns.
<P>
	I do not doubt the intention of people who say this type of stuff 
may be good. However their logic is trivial and is intended to 
cloud an issue that deserves careful, rational consideration 
because of enormous costs that would be involved in 
implementing Bill C-68, the implications of the legislation for 
gun owners and the mandate the bill would give to police to 
monitor people who legally own guns. The police can barely 
handle the complaint load they have without being downloaded 
additional duties to follow up on registration.
<P>
	There are two intentions buried in the bill. One is crime 
control and the other is control of guns. They are two very 
different intentions. It is a profound mistake to confuse the two 
issues as Bill C-68 does.
<P>
	As I previously said, some members of the House seem intent 
on confusing the two issues. They would have us believe control 
of crime and control of guns are hopelessly intertwined. That is 
irrational. It ignores not only empirical data but common sense.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	In Canada we have a crime problem. No one would disagree 
with that. We also have gun control laws that are among the most 
restrictive in the world. The following question begs to be 
asked: How can it be that we have extremely restrictive gun 
control laws and a crime control problem at the same time? The 
answer is there is literally no correlation whatsoever in the 
developed world between gun control laws of a country and its 
crime rate.
<P>
	The auditor general's report clearly gave direction to the 
government to review all gun control laws that presently exist 
and the government refused to do anything about it. I ask why.
<P>
	There may be a correlation between the number of crimes 
committed with guns and gun control laws. It is not what the 
proponents of Bill C-68 are trying to convince us of. They are 
trying to convince us that if we legislate burdensome 
registration on the owners of hunting guns we will see a 
reduction in the crime rate. That is absolute nonsense.

<P>
	If Bill C-68 passes, which the government seems intent on, 
the Reform Party will be monitoring the crime rate daily, that 
is if the crime rate is reported accurately. There is some 
question whether it is consistent.
<P>
	If there is no drop in the crime rate-I doubt very much if any 
will occur-the Reform Party will remind Canadians of the 
intrusion into their personal property rights the government has 
undertaken. We will remind the Canadian people it was all for 
nought, just another means to draw dollars out of their pockets.
<P>
	The only purpose served by this needless and authoritarian 
expansion of government power and the application of the 
outdated ideology which still animates the party across the aisle 
seems to be more restriction or more involvement into the 
affairs of the average individual.
<P>
	Like most reasonable and responsible Canadians, the Reform 
Party understands there is a social good to be derived from 
controlling access to and ownership of weapons in Canada. That 
is only reasonable. However, we think the restrictions have gone 
far enough and need go no further.
<P>
	Even further than Bill C-68 are the sentences imposed for 
using firearms in the commission of a crime. We would like to 
see more emphasis in this area. Members on the other side of the 
House possibly disagree that the way to control criminal activity 
is to control criminals. Can the members on the other side of the 
House possibly disagree that controlling the perpetrators of 
crime is far more important than controlling the tools a 
perpetrator uses to commit a crime?
<P>
	Bill C-68 flies in the face of common sense logic. The 
government is flying in the face of logic. The government is 
attempting to foist on Canadians a radical ideology of 
government intervention veiled in the garb of crime control, 
obscured by rhetoric that appeals to the common desire to 
control criminals.
<P>
	There are two very different intents underlying Bill C-68. 
One to control criminal use of guns; the other to control and 
restrict the ownership of guns. One is a criminal office; the other 
is not. One is an offence which the government and our party 
want to see made a more serious offence. The other is a 
legitimate activity-the ownership of property-the 
government wants to slowly, if inevitably, do away with. That is 
unacceptable. It is a power grab by the government. It is an 
infringement upon individual liberties.
<P>
	The government wants Canadians to pay a very high price in 
freedom despite being unable to show there would be any 
reciprocal payoff in social benefits. What kind of deal is that? 
What kind of government is that?
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	As a former police officer who served on the Calgary police 
department for 22 years I can say with no hesitation whatsoever 
that this bill, if passed without the amended split we are arguing 
for and for which I seek  support of the members of the House, 
would have unexpected consequences for most of my colleagues 
in the House, including the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	Realistically, mixing the criminal and the regulatory 
enforcement would have the effect not only of allowing for 
criminal prosecution of people or even farmers who neglect to 
register a legal or useful tool, but would also give police officers 
the right and even the obligation to search out owners of 
unregistered or poorly stored guns. That obligation on the part 
of the police would not differentiate between those people who 
use guns to commit crime and those who collect weapons or hunt 
with them.
<P>
	As a former police officer and someone who has given his 
entire working life to law enforcement and who is very much 
committed to reasonable gun control measures, I can say the 
consequences of bringing things like gun storage and 
registration into the Criminal Code will have unexpected and 
frightening consequences.
<P>
	It would not assist any police officer to register every weapon 
and have that so-called list when the record in other 
jurisdictions of non-compliance is very clear. People would not 
comply with the law in that respect, given the track record of 
Australia and New Zealand as examples.
<P>
	I urge my fellow members of the House to come clean with the 
Canadian people. I urge them to allow full access to debate on 
the bill. There are some serious flaws in it. The bill must be split 
and I urge all colleagues in the House, on the Liberal and 
opposition sides, to support the amendment to split Bill C-68. 
To keep it in its present state is not forthright.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
opportunity to debate Bill C-68, an act to restrict firearms and 
other weapons.
<P>
	I congratulate the hon. Minister of Justice for making good on 
the government's promise to fight crime with tough but fair 
firearms legislation. The minister is to be congratulated because 
Bill C-68 is the product of an open dialogue between ordinary 
Canadians, police officials, people working in the justice 
system, sharp shooters, legitimate gun collectors and the justice 
minister.
<P>
	Last November when the government originally announced 
the action plan on firearms control a number of people expressed 
concern about certain conditions of ownership, including the 
sale, trade and exchange of particular firearms among legitimate 
owners and collectors. The minister listened to these concerns, 
demonstrated his flexibility and changed his action plan so that 
legitimate gun owners are treated fairly under Bill C-68.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11147"> 11147 </A></B>
<P>
	Overall, I do not think anyone in the House or any 
law-abiding Canadian would dispute the minister's efforts to 
crack down on the criminal misuse of firearms. All law-abiding 
Canadians welcome harsh penalties for the violent misuse of 
firearms.
<P>
	In keeping with the Liberal promise of safer homes and safer 
streets, Bill C-68 will impose mandatory prison sentences and a 
lifetime prohibition from gun ownership for anyone using a 
firearm in the commission of a murder, attempted murder, 
robbery, kidnapping, sexual assault and five other criminal 
offences.
<P>
	Critics of the current gun control legislation brought in under 
former Conservative Justice Minister Kim Campbell say that 
some of the previous legislation is not proving very effective in 
court. This is true. That is why we need Bill C-68, to win court 
cases and to justly punish criminal behaviour.
<P>
	For example, statistics from the justice department show that 
two thirds of weapon charges were dismissed, stayed or 
withdrawn due to plea bargaining or problems with presenting 
evidence in court. To overcome this legal wrangling, Bill C-68 
will put in place tough measures to ensure swift and sure 
punishment.
<P>
	Let us turn to the traffic of illegal weapons across our borders.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
Last year the federal government took organised crime head on 
and successfully quashed the illegal trade of cigarettes. The 
same must be done to halt the illegal trafficking of firearms 
across Canadian borders. Bill C-68 will impose stern penalties 
against gun smugglers, including the immediate seizure of 
vehicles, boats and aeroplanes used in the trafficking of 
contraband. New import and export controls will provide a 
greater degree of protection to legitimate Canadian commercial 
interests. Cheap imitations of so-called Saturday night specials 
which have a propensity to misfire and cause injury will be less 
common and not as easy for criminals to access. Consequently, 
all Canadians will benefit.
<P>
	All told, it seems the main objection to Bill C-68 is the 
proposed registration system. It does not matter how many times 
the minister has said registration does not mean confiscation. 
The purpose of registration is to limit access to firearms, to 
promote their safe use and storage and to control their 
movement. Careless ownership does cost lives. For example, the 
gun that killed Constable Todd Bayliss in June of 1994 was 
stolen from an Etobicoke widow. The gun was left lying on a 
shelf in her closet and was easy prey for the thief who stole it.
<P>
	While there are many responsible gun owners who follow safe 
storage rules, far too many do not. The registration system will 
require all gun owners to be responsible. I do not think any 
legitimate gun owner worth his or her salt would disagree with 
safety measures which would prevent children from having 
accidents with carelessly stored firearms or from keeping 
loaded weapons out of the hands of criminals on a smash and  
dash, break and enter. The registration system coupled with 
increased border controls will make it far more difficult for 
criminals to access prohibited weapons.
<P>
	The cost of the system, estimated at $85 million, will be 
entirely recovered through user fees. This is consistent with 
principles laid out by the federal government's recent budget. 
These fees are a small price to pay for public safety. The 
Minister of Justice does not, as some assert, have a hidden 
agenda to make gun ownership prohibitively expensive. The 
registration fees applied to the ownership of motor vehicles does 
not prohibit millions of Canadians from driving cars. There is 
nothing which would indicate that gun registration would be 
more expensive than any other registration system. In short, we 
need the co-operation of legitimate gun owners to ensure public 
safety for all Canadians.
<P>
	I am curious about the position on gun control taken by my 
hon. colleagues in the Reform Party. Strangely enough, an 
October 1994 Reform Party resolution echoed support for the 
federal government's initiative. I quote from the Reform Party 
resolution under social issues: ``If elected, a Reform 
government will introduce legislation by which the criminal 
misuse of firearms will be severely punished and the right of 
law-abiding citizens to own and use firearms will be 
protected''.
<P>
	That sounds like it is Bill C-68 promised in the Reform 
platform. What happened since then? Did the gun lobbyists get 
to Reformers? Are they that weak kneed that they gave into the 
gun lobbyists? They should stick to their platform as promised. 
That is why they were elected. Under this legislation only 
criminals will be prevented from owning a gun and the rights of 
law-abiding citizens will be protected. Perhaps the leader of the 
Reform Party might clarify things for us. If he would state his 
precise position on gun control instead of making vague 
statements we might know exactly where Reform stands on the 
issue.
<P>
	The residents of Parkdale-High Park strongly support the 
government. I did a poll two years ago in my riding on tougher 
controls on firearms and 67 per cent said they want and support 
stronger firearms control. In my town hall meetings today, two 
years later, that percentage would probably jump up to 80 per 
cent or 90 per cent. Instead of a weakening position, it is a 
stronger position for Bill C-68. I hope we can count on all 
members of the House to protect Canadians by supporting Bill 
C-68.
<P>
	Not long ago the President of the United States spoke to a joint 
sitting of the Senate and the House of Commons in the Chamber. 
He congratulated Canada because we recognize the legitimate 
use and ownership of firearms as opposed to the criminals 
owning them and the guns getting into the wrong hands. The 
President of the United States is complimenting our country on 
our way of doing things.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11148"> 11148 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	We can take a lesson from that. Let us not go the U.S. route. 
Let us go the Canadian route. Let us do it the Canadian way. The 
Reform Party wants to go the U.S. way. If we go that way, I am 
afraid the crime rate will grow and the cities, especially the 
inner cities, will be more violent.
<P>
	That is not what we want for Canada. We want safe 
communities and safe streets. It has to begin in the families, in 
the schools, in the municipal and provincial governments, and 
here in the federal government where we must bring in 
legislation which is good for all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak on this bill today.
<P>
	I strongly support the initiative to split the bill. Splitting the 
bill would allow us to deal separately with the proposed changes 
to the Criminal Code and the proposed changes to firearms 
restrictions such as registration.
<P>
	The issue of gun control stirs great emotion in the hearts of so 
many of us. This demonstrates to me a pressing need for 
Parliament to allow free votes on this matter. I am sure there are 
more than a few Liberal backbenchers who agree with me on this 
point.
<P>
	My constituents, as far as I have ascertained, are struggling 
with all of the arguments and appear split on the issue. I 
recognize there are good arguments to be made for both 
positions. However, today I will address, as we are meant to do 
at second reading, the intent of the legislation.
<P>
	Remember, the Liberals consider this bill to be a substantial 
component of their so-called safe streets package. I am going to 
address three safe streets issues that this bill, in my view, fails to 
address: guns in the commission of violence against women; 
guns used in suicides; and guns used by gangs.
<P>
	As parliamentarians we face difficult issues. As a member of 
the Reform caucus I acknowledge that I have the freedom to 
follow the wishes of my constituents on issues such as these. I 
believe that for too long now the voices of average Canadians 
have not been heard. In fact, they have been completely ignored.
<P>
	I believe it is my job to represent the constituents of Calgary 
Southeast in this Chamber. I strive in everything I do to bring 
their views to Ottawa. Members of Parliament have many 
opportunities to listen to their constituents. Letters, phone calls, 
faxes, newsletters and Internet are all wonderful vehicles to 
highlight constituents' concerns. In turn, I have made every 
effort to bring the issues of the day to the constituents.
<P>
	On the matter of gun control specifically, I ran a survey in the 
late summer of 1994 in my householder. Slightly more than 400 
people responded to the more than 51,000 mailed. This in my 
view does not represent any kind of a credible sample. I am 
therefore undertaking  another effort on the same issue using a 
new voter technology incorporating the convergence of 
telephone and computer.
<P>
	I expect a much higher rate of response and my vote will be 
dependent upon the consensus view as expressed by the 
constituents of Calgary Southeast. No amount of pressure from 
lobby groups will interfere with this democratic and populist 
process. Of the hundreds of letters, faxes and phone calls that I 
receive, most come from a well orchestrated lobby outside my 
riding. Rest assured, and I want to be unequivocally clear here, 
my objective is to achieve consensus with only the residents of 
Calgary Southeast.
<P>
	According to the minister, this piece of legislation is meant to 
make our streets safer for Canadians. Unfortunately, the 
measures in this bill do not address some relevant concerns. We 
in the Reform Party will support any initiatives that address the 
rights of victims and will also address the issue of public safety.
<P>
	I previously asked a question of the Minister of Justice about 
this legislation. I am concerned that it does very little to address 
the root causes of crime, especially those of violence against 
women.
<P>
	I remind the House that the Liberals introduced gun controls 
in 1977. The Tories imposed more controls in 1990. We have had 
gun registration in Canada since 1934. Despite all of these 
controls and restrictions accompanied by haphazard 
enforcement, rates of spousal homicides have remained 
constant for the last 29 years.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	Clearly the problems of domestic violence are not caused by 
unregistered guns. How can the minister suggest as he has that 
registering a gun will keep someone from using it to kill their 
spouse? In fact he has yet to put forward an acceptable and 
reasoned argument to support that suggestion.
<P>
	Domestic violence is a serious problem which needs to be 
remedied, but gun controls will do nothing to address this 
problem. Less than half of all spousal homicides are committed 
with guns whether they are registered or not.
<P>
	The National Crime Prevention Council is studying violence 
against women and children. The heritage ministry is studying 
violence in broadcasting. The health ministry is studying 
violence against women and children. Domestic violence has 
been studied for over 20 years. It has been studied to death and 
there has been no action. Why is the Minister of Justice focusing 
on guns instead of looking at measures to address the root causes 
of violence in our society?
<P>
	Violence against women is a sordid reality and not a fantasy 
confined to the pages of a tabloid newspaper or a pornographic 
magazine. The history of violence against women is like 
Pandora's box that opens and reveals the ugliest side of the 
human condition. We would expect by now that complacency 
would be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11149"> 11149 </A></B>
<P>
shattered in the details  of horror and abuse that so many women 
have lived to tell, and what of those who have died?
<P>
	It was inexcusable for the justice minister who professes to 
champion women to artfully dodge my questions posed in this 
House. We do not need the minister's platitudes nor his citing of 
statistics to tell us that we have a problem of domestic violence 
in this country. What specific plans does this government have 
to get at the root causes of violence against women?
<P>
	Until gender roles are eliminated, until the family no longer 
serves that convenient arena for male violence, until wife 
beating is no longer a logical extension of male domination, and 
until our justice system demonstrates its capacity for justice, we 
do not have a blueprint for change. Intellectual and political 
anguish have become meaningless. Violence against women 
exists. We have endured enough. These gun control measures do 
little or nothing to address it.
<P>
	The measures in Bill C-68 simply fail to go far enough. What 
we need are measures which will deal effectively with the 
criminal use of firearms. Unfortunately, the legislation provides 
only minimum sentences of four years for the commission of 
any of 10 specific violent offences with a firearm. The 
legislation does not require that these sentences be consecutive 
to other sentences. This leaves open the possibility that such 
sentences could be concurrent.
<P>
	The Canadian public is no longer satisfied with the judiciary 
giving out concurrent sentences, especially for violent crimes 
committed with a firearm. It is time that individuals who 
commit crimes and multiple criminal infractions with guns paid 
for their mistakes to the full extent of the law.
<P>
	In response to a question on March 23, the Minister of Justice 
suggested that his gun control bill would address the use of 
firearms in suicides. These sentiments are carefully crafted and 
indeed noble, yet there are no provisions within this bill which 
will reduce the use of firearms in suicides. In fact, short of 
banning all firearms, I can think of no gun control measures 
which will curb this phenomenon.
<P>
	Since the gun controls introduced in 1978, the suicide figures 
for Canada have remained fairly stable. So too have the number 
of suicides committed with firearms. Suicide is a tragic 
consequence of current societal dysfunction and particularly so 
for our native communities where the problem is 
proportionately greater. Banning guns is not the solution. 
Statistically, guns are not often used in a suicide attempt. In 
1992 only 1.3 per cent of the suicides were committed with 
guns.
<P>
	More important, people who attempt a suicide need help. 
They need to know there are many in this country who are 
working to ensure personal autonomy, socially and 
economically. Greater economic opportunities will encourage 
this objective. Giving people a new start is all that some will 
need.
<P>
	Let us not be foolish in our approach. We will not solve the 
problem of suicides by banning and restricting guns.
<P>
	Another issue which this bill fails to address is the growing 
problem of gang crime. The proposals will do nothing to prevent 
the commission of crimes by gangs. This is an increasingly 
frightening problem in our urban centres. We cannot continue to 
address the problem after the fact. We treat the wounded or bury 
the dead, sometimes lay charges and even convict. Would it not 
be more effective to implement those measures which would 
prevent the commission of these senseless acts of violence?
<P>
	The Reform Party has consistently argued for more vigorous 
sentences for crimes committed with a firearm. We have 
recommended the elimination of firearms charge plea 
bargaining. If the charges are consistently thrown out, why 
would criminals worry about using a firearm? We support 
attacking the healthy gun smuggling trade. We have already 
discussed substantially increasing the penalties for the use of 
firearms in crime. We should start an overhaul of our prison 
system.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	Finally, what the bill fails to address and what the government 
fails to realize is that we need to come to terms with what drives 
people to violence.
<P>
	In conclusion, I wish to remind the House that this bill deals 
with at least two substantively different matters. It deals with 
registration of firearms as well as their criminal use and 
distribution.
<P>
	I would also like to reiterate that I will consult with my 
constituents and will make every effort to reflect their wishes on 
this bill in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
government's commitment to tougher gun control has been the 
subject of some controversy. I wish to explain in some detail the 
position I have taken on this issue after talking with numerous 
gun owners, attending many meetings with gun enthusiasts, and 
giving this matter lengthy and serious consideration.
<P>
	The debate on gun control ranges from those who would ban 
all guns, with which I disagree, to those who feel they have the 
right to bear firearms unrestricted and unregulated, anytime and 
anywhere, with which I also disagree. Gun ownership is a 
privilege and carries with it certain requirements and 
responsibilities which can and must be regulated. Most gun 
owners would acknowledge this. The argument then becomes 
one of degree.
<P>
	It is fair to say that gun owners and gun control advocates can 
agree on some of the desired results: reduced crime, reduced 
accidental death, and reduced suicide. The passionate disagree-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11150"> 11150 </A></B>
<P>
ment seems to stem from the methods being used to achieve the 
desired results.
<P>
	Police across the country have been crying out for tough gun 
controls to help fight crime and protect the lives of their fellow 
officers. Victims of crime, health professionals, mayors from 
across Canada and many other groups have demanded tougher 
gun controls.
<P>
	An average of 1,400 Canadians die each year in gun related 
murders, suicides and accidents. Many others are seriously 
injured. Of the 732 homicides committed in Canada in 1992, 34 
per cent or 246 people were killed in accidents committed with a 
firearm. Suicides account for 77 per cent of the 1,119 firearms 
deaths in Canada in 1991. A recent survey showed that guns 
were used in 40 per cent of murders of women by their spouses. 
Many deaths are by depressed youth acting impulsively with a 
weapon easily had and in their home.
<P>
	How can anyone ignore this situation? How can any 
government ignore this situation? In many of the cases, 
impulsiveness was a factor. Ready access to a firearm allowed a 
dispute to escalate to a murder, or a depression to a suicide. In 
some of these cases, firearms presented a permanent solution to 
a temporary problem. Many of these lives would have been 
saved if the gun had not been readily available.
<P>
	There are few who disagree with three of the principal aspects 
of the gun control legislation: criminal sanctions, smuggling or 
illegal importation, and assault weapons.
<P>
	The most controversial aspect of this gun control issue is 
unquestionably a new computerized national registration 
system for all firearms and firearms owners in Canada. The 
government asserts that universal registration of firearms is a 
cornerstone of our strategy to target criminals, tighten border 
controls and enhance public safety.
<P>
	Opponents of gun control argue that registration will not 
reduce crime. I ascribe to the opinion of the president of the 
Association of Chiefs of Police who states that without 
information about who owns guns, there is no effective gun 
control. A cost effective registration system will help control 
smuggling, gun theft and misuse of firearms in many important 
ways, some of which are as follows.
<P>
	The illegal gun trade is a serious problem. Presently, firearms 
are not registered when they are imported into the country. The 
type numbers and serial number of each gun are not recorded. A 
recent newspaper article underlined the fact that guns imported 
legally can be sold illegally. Unless illegal firearms can be 
distinguished from legal registered firearms, it is impossible to 
curb the smuggling problem. Registration will help stem the 
theft, diversion and smuggling of firearms from legal 
shipments.
<P>
	Registration will also help in the enforcement of court 
ordered firearms prohibition orders. It is estimated that 13,000 
prohibition orders are made every year to take away firearms 
from individuals considered a danger to society. Unless the 
police know what firearms are registered in the names of those 
persons, they are limited to searching the premises, or to hoping 
that all firearms will be surrendered voluntarily. This is not 
sufficient.
<P>
	The inquest into the suicide of Jonathon Yeo, who is believed 
to have murdered Nina de Villiers while out on bail for another 
violent offence, recommended the registration of firearms.
<P>
	When the police prepare to intervene in a dispute, a 
registration system will determine if firearms are present, the 
type and numbers. Inspector Park whom I may quote from the 
Niagara Regional Police in my riding of Erie said: ``The more 
information about what you are facing, the better you can deal 
with it''.
<P>
	While police officers always presume that a suspect is armed, 
they often discover more than they bargained for. In one 
example given by police, what looked like a .22 calibre rifle 
turned out instead to be a more lethal Lee-Enfield. The firearm 
was loaded with military ammunition that was capable of 
penetrating the bulletproof vest of a police officer.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	Firearms registration will ensure that people are held 
responsible for their guns. The current firearms acquisition 
certificate allows individuals to buy as many rifles and shotguns 
as they wish over a five-year period and these guns cannot be 
tracked to the original owner. Registration will help ensure that 
gun owners do not sell their firearms illegally or give them to 
individuals without proper authorization.
<P>
	Registration will also encourage the safe storage of guns. 
Canadians have heard enough accounts involving children and 
guns to know that some gun owners should take more care in 
storing their weapons. More than 3,000 firearms are reported 
stolen every year. They are falling into the hands of criminals.
<P>
	Studies have shown that many firearms used to commit 
crimes were originally acquired lawfully, in many cases stolen 
from their original owners because they were stored improperly. 
The semi-automatic pistol that was used to kill Constable Todd 
Bayliss was stolen from a widow who had inherited the second 
world war relic when her husband died. The gun was left lying 
on the shelf in her clothes closet as it had for years. The gun was 
stolen and Constable Bayliss is dead.
<P>
	Registration will further assist the police in high risk 
situations. Despite the emphasis on the criminal element, most 
murders involve people who know each other. Almost 40 per 
cent of women killed by their husbands are shot mostly with 
legally owned firearms. Spousal violence generally surfaces 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11151"> 11151 </A></B>
<P>
gradually and the police are often aware of the problem before a 
life is threatened.  Gun registration will allow for preventive 
actions such as temporary removal of the firearm from the 
premises.
<P>
	Registration will also help in the enforcement of the law in 
prosecution of offenders. One can appreciate that it is difficult 
to prosecute someone for possession of a stolen weapon if the 
identity of the lawful owner cannot be ascertained.
<P>
	Gun owners feel that registration of every shotgun and rifle 
would place a heavy and expensive bureaucratic burden on 
law-abiding gun owners. In fact the registration system is 
hardly onerous. The proposed registration system for firearms 
will replace existing FACs and other permits with new 
possession certificates and registration cards. It will simplify 
the system.
<P>
	The registration system has two components. A possession 
certificate will begin in 1996 to register the gun owner and to 
acquire new firearms in the future. The registration card will 
begin in 1998 to register individual firearms. Possession 
certificates will be similar to drivers' licences, are valid for five 
years and can be renewed simply by filling out a form. 
Registration cards for firearms are a once in a lifetime exercise 
with no renewal required.
<P>
	For example, someone already owning long guns will only 
have to register their firearms once for as long as they own them. 
The process is expected to have a minimal charge estimated at 
approximately $10 for up to 10 guns. It will be as simple as 
licking a stamp and mailing a form. A registration card or 
possession certificate will enable people to buy ammunition and 
hunt or target shoot the same way they have been doing for 
years.
<P>
	The costs of registration to the gun owner are as comparable 
or less than that of other registration systems we are involved 
with such as cars, boats, drivers' licences, et cetera. On balance 
there are some who will consider registration a hassle, but it is a 
minor one when set against the benefits referred to earlier.
<P>
	There are no further restrictions on ammunition save and 
except that one must be 18 years old to purchase ammunition 
and it must be stored properly. Restricting ammunition sales to 
those 18 and over makes sense. Young people under 18 cannot 
legally buy cigarettes now. Why should bullets be any less 
restricted? It will ensure that if a youth wants ammunition at 
least an adult will be in the know and able to ask questions or 
provide supervision if it is deemed necessary.
<P>
	Gun owners make a good point that the vast majority of them 
are responsible law-abiding citizens. This is true. Although the 
gun laws may make small time criminals think twice, gun 
registration will not deter professional criminals or drug 
dealers. This is also true. Unfortunately there cannot be one law 
for the crooks and another for honest citizens. There must be one 
law applicable to everyone.
<P>
	Some opponents to gun control feel it is a threat to democracy, 
an infringement of their right to bear arms, a right I suggest they 
never truly had in the sense in which it is uttered. Despite 
popular belief it is a right American citizens do not have with 
their constitution granting only the right to bear arms for the 
purpose of army and militia.
<P>
	Canadians have a country founded on the principles of peace, 
order and good government. Gun control fits this expression. 
There is nothing undemocratic about ensuring that ours is a safe 
and peaceful country.
<P>
	Registering guns does not remove the right to exercise one's 
privilege to own or use them, but it does make it easier to ensure 
they are owned and used responsibly. It does make it easier to 
remove the privilege when it is abused.
<P>
	Opponents often tell me that responsible gun owners are being 
penalized when criminals are not. All gun owners are 
responsible until they do something wrong. Marc Lépine had no 
criminal involvement until he massacred 14 women at 
Montreal's l'École Polytechnique with his Ruger Mini-14.
<P>
	Moreover it is difficult to imagine how a responsible gun 
owner could object to a law designed to ensure that others are 
also responsible. What do Canadians think of responsible gun 
owners who are now vowing to ignore the law and refuse to 
register? Is that responsible? Is that law abiding? Hefty fine for 
such action is a poor alternative to the small gun registration fee.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Suggestions that gun registration is a prelude to confiscation 
by a Hitlerain government are unfounded. There is no evidence 
to support fears that someday somewhere the federal 
government will seize all firearms.
<P>
	If the gun lobby would look at the legislation objectively and 
responsibly it too would support the bill. I encourage it to do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
my pleasure to rise in the House today to speak to the motion of 
my Reform colleague to split Bill C-68 into two logical and 
rational bills that separately cover the two different topics 
included in Bill C-68.
<P>
	It may well be that tough action on the criminal element will 
eliminate the extremely costly, not to mention intrusive and 
unproven registration aspect.
<P>
	It is obvious to all in the House that the crime control 
measures included in Bill C-68 are long overdue. Canadians 
have been calling on the government to get tough on smuggling 
for a year and a half now. The stiffer sentences prescribed in the 
bill will act as a deterrent to those who consider smuggling an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11152"> 11152 </A></B>
<P>
occupation, but only if the government actually starts enforcing 
the law everywhere along our borders.
<P>
	The mandatory minimum sentencing requirements are also 
crime control measures that Canadians have been demanding for 
a long time. They have repeatedly asked the government to 
crack down on violent offenders. Unfortunately the provision 
will directly affect only a small portion of weapons related 
crimes.
<P>
	According to the Centre for Justice Statistics over 94 per cent 
of victims killed or injured in a robbery were harmed by 
weapons other than firearms. The minimum sentencing 
provision should be extended to the use of any weapon in the 
commission of an offence.
<P>
	On the other hand the bill contains measures that will force 
citizens to register all their firearms. This issue must be 
considered separately from the crime control measures in Bill 
C-68. Gun control is not related to crime control and has no 
place in crime control legislation.
<P>
	The justice minister may believe that future restrictions on 
law-abiding gun owners will somehow reduce crime. However 
he has completely failed to explain to the House what crimes 
will be reduced and how gun registry will accomplish it. All 
available research indicates exactly the opposite. Tighter 
restrictions on law-abiding citizens will only encourage the 
criminal element. After all, criminals will not register their 
guns.
<P>
	The Auditor General pointed out that the current gun 
registration system has never been properly evaluated. Why 
would the justice minister forge ahead with his expanded 
registration system plans when we do not even know what good 
the current system is?
<P>
	How many crimes has the current system prevented? What 
use has the current system been? Until these questions have been 
responsibly answered there is absolutely no reason we should 
consider spending more money on gun control. No one would be 
against additional gun controls if they could be proven cost 
effective in their ability to save lives and reduce crime.
<P>
	The minister has made a great many inconsistent statements 
in the debate over registration, confusing not only the public 
affected but even members of his own caucus.
<P>
	We hear the statement that people register their cars so why 
should they not register their guns. Does this seem like a 
reasonable comparison? I think not. We do not ask people to 
prove they need a car to get a licence. We do not introduce 
policies to grandfather the ownership of automobiles or ban the 
sale of replica cars. Unlike an applicant for an hour-long driving 
test, a firearm owner must go through a three-month safety 
process including an extensive police background check. There 
is no comparison.
<P>
	As we know the licensing of cars is mainly a revenue 
gathering tactic. It does little to prevent 100,000 car thefts 
annually or over 3,000 traffic deaths. Gun registration will do 
nothing to prevent theft or death either. It is another bureaucracy 
creating, tax collecting excuse for the state to intrude further 
into the lives of private Canadians. If the justice minister thinks 
otherwise then let us see the evidence he has to back up his 
claims that registration will save lives.
<P>
	A second inconsistency is found in the sentencing provisions 
of the bill. The crime control provisions call for mandatory 
four-year sentences for certain violent crimes. Reformers 
support the measure. However the bill will make failure to 
comply with the registration requirements a criminal offence 
with sentences of up to 10 years in prison.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	Given these facts it is conceivable that a rapist who used a gun 
could receive a four-year sentence, while on the other hand a 
farmer who has an old shotgun out in the barn which is used 
occasionally for pest control may find himself serving ten years 
for failing to register a little used farm implement. The state has 
no business in the bedrooms of the nation. I suggest the 
government has no business in the barnyards of the nation either.
<P>
	The minister's proposal for registration was followed by 
many statements about how the rates of suicide and accidental 
death will fall. The justice minister thinks he knows what is best 
for us. He even said he was doing this regardless of what others 
thought because it was right.
<P>
	It is my duty to point out to the minister that Canadians who 
fear the dangers of firearms have always had a choice. Each 
Canadian already has it within his or her own power not to own 
firearms, not to keep them at home, and never have anything to 
do with them if he or she so choose. However, for those 
Canadian homes, about half of them, where citizens feel 
comfortable with their guns, their kitchen knives, their cleaning 
solvents and many other dangerous items they may have around, 
why does the justice minister think he should dictate what 
Canadians may have or do? It is time for governments to have 
more faith in the common sense of the common people.
<P>
	Another key indication that the gun registration section of the 
bill is a poorly thought out Liberal attempt at problem solving is 
its obvious intrusion into areas of provincial jurisdiction. Here 
again we find a reason for the bill to be split. The crime control 
measures are clearly Criminal Code issues that must be dealt 
with by the federal government. The gun control measures 
intrude deeply into provincial jurisdiction in the areas of 
property rights, taxation and education.
<P>
	It seems as though the Liberals have not learned their lesson 
yet. It was just last month that they started to cut federal 
spending for provincial social programs they had no business 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11153"> 11153 </A></B>
<P>
being in. Now a whole new social program,  gun registration, is 
being introduced in another area of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Under our Constitution the provinces are guaranteed the right 
to deal with property issues. Guns, cars, houses, land and money 
are all examples of private property. This is one reason the 
federal government is not in the business of registering 
automobiles. It has not right to. It should not assume it has any 
right to register any of the other private properties of Canadians 
either.
<P>
	The second area of intrusion is in education. Currently 
firearms training courses are run by the provinces. The new 
legislation forces a federally designed course on all provinces. It 
is yet another example of federal intrusion in an area of 
provincial constitutional jurisdiction.
<P>
	Because enforcement of any of the registration provisions 
will have to be investigated and prosecuted by the provinces, the 
administrative costs of the legislation will have to be borne by 
the provinces.
<P>
	In closing, why not first place the emphasis on the criminal 
use of firearms? Once the get tough policy on smuggling and the 
violent use of firearms has been employed, the need to spend 
hundreds of thousands of taxpayers dollars and harass 
law-abiding gun owners may well be eliminated. Why not give 
it a chance? I would encourage all members to do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to take the opportunity to comment on Bill C-68 
respecting the Firearms Act on behalf of the constituents of 
Bruce-Grey.
<P>
	Bruce-Grey is one of Canada's most blessed ridings with an 
abundance of clean air, pure water and excellent people. It is 
located in the beautiful Bruce Peninsula in southwestern 
Ontario. My riding has one of Canada's first underwater 
national parks.
<P>
	The traditions of the people are very strong. I also have two 
native reserves in my riding, Saugeen and Cape Croker. I am 
pleased that the minister is going to take into account the 
traditional way of life of the native community.
<P>
	Hunting still plays a very important economic role in my 
region for the service industries, outfitters and guides. Tourism 
is a major industry in my riding. Almost every farmer and many 
rural residents own firearms, not only for hunting or sport but 
also for the protection of their livestock from predators.
<P>
	I have held several meetings with organizations in my riding 
such as hunting and shooting clubs and numerous meetings with 
individuals regarding Bill C-68. The greater majority of my 
constituents applaud the minister and support the call for stiffer 
penalties for the use of firearms in the commission of crime and 
for stiffer penalties for illegally importing and trafficking in 
firearms, as well as stricter border controls on firearms.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	My constituents have two major concerns, the first dealing 
with the prohibition of the 105 millimetre or 4.14 inch barrel 
length handgun. I am pleased the minister has requested the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs determine 
which handguns in the prohibited class can be exempted due to 
their use in recognized shooting competitions. I feel the 
standing committee can resolve the issue and make 
recommendations to accommodate the legitimate user.
<P>
	The other major concern of my constituents is the universal 
registration system for legal hunting rifles and shotguns. In all 
my meetings and discussions this portion of Bill C-68 elicits the 
most serious concerns and the strongest objection. Many of my 
constituents believe this system will make criminals out of 
innocent law-abiding citizens who do not register their legal 
rifles or shotguns or who are unable to do so.
<P>
	These citizens are responsible, respectful people who enjoy 
hunting as a sport. They value their rifles and shotguns and take 
great care to secure them. As I said earlier, most of the rural 
residents do have a rifle or a shotgun. It is a necessity and 
legitimate tool of their everyday working and recreational lives. 
They are law-abiding citizens.
<P>
	I do not wish to reiterate everything previous speakers said on 
this portion of the bill except to say that I feel the bill can be 
improved by removing from the Criminal Code the penalties 
under section 91 for non-registration. My constituents prefer 
that we have no registration of rifles and shotguns. That would 
be my preference also. However, if the standing committee 
determines registration is a necessity I hope it recommends the 
penalty for non-registration be removed from the Criminal 
Code under section 91.
<P>
	This simple amendment would take nothing away from the 
strength of the bill. It would ensure that law-abiding Canadians 
are not recorded as having a criminal record due to an omission 
or oversight. This amendment would dispel much of the concern 
of my constituents.
<P>
	An umbrella groups representing hunting and shooting clubs 
has requested an opportunity to appear before the standing 
committee. It will be bringing forward its positions. It is 
important that our legislation will achieve the goals for which it 
is intended, to make our communities and streets safe for our 
families and for all Canadians. There are many positive sections 
in Bill C-68 that will accomplish this.
<P>
	I ask that the standing committee take into account my 
comments particularly about removing from the Criminal Code 
penalties in section 91 for non-registration.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11154"> 11154 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, there are some aspects of Bill C-68 which 
have some potential for support, although not many.
<P>
	The main unsupportable area is registration of rifles and 
shotguns. There are a number of reasons this is absolutely 
unsupportable. The previous member spoke of the possibility of 
the standing committee determining the need for this. The 
citizens of Canada determine these needs.
<P>
	One of the objections to registration is the cost versus the 
alleged benefits. The cost is reported by the Minister of Justice 
as being in the neighbourhood of $85 million. I am polling my 
constituents on this and in order not to be misleading I am using 
that figure. That figure is a fabrication by the Minister of Justice 
and the Justice Department. The reality is it will cost not 
less-this is done through different methods-than $500 
million. The cost could run as high as $1 billion or beyond.
<P>
	The rationale for this is if we take the current known cost of 
registering a handgun and apply it to the low number the 
Minister of Justice estimates for rifles and shotguns, it comes to 
almost half a million dollars. There are probably far more 
firearms out there than the minister is letting on.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	Another issue raised by many owners of firearms, sports 
enthusiasts and competitive shooters is future confiscation. The 
minute this is raised we start getting the minister and many of 
the members opposite suggesting it is paranoia on the part of 
firearms owners.
<P>
	It is not paranoia if there is justification for it based on past 
practice. There is past practice. Bill C-17 introduced by the 
previous government took away many firearms that law-abiding 
citizens purchased legally and essentially said. That 
government said: ``Sorry, we changed our mind. Those are now 
illegal. Turn them over. No compensation''.
<P>
	This proposed bill also bans certain firearms legally 
purchased by Canadians and the Liberals are saying: ``Sorry, we 
changed our mind''. There is validity in the fears these people 
have. In the future we could be faced with confiscation of all 
semi-automatic rifles and shotguns. There are things like the 
Beretta 12-gauge, very expensive, very popular for skeet and 
trap shooting. There are semi-automatic hunting rifles. They are 
very legitimate firearms, functionally identical to many of the 
firearms banned. Then we could be looking at high calibre rifles 
as well with the rationale that a 30.06 is good enough, one does 
not need anything else.
<P>
	Then we have the security risk aspect. We have already had 
cases in which criminals have been able to get into RCMP 
computer files and find out who has weapons and where they 
keep them. The last thing people who own firearms want to do is 
provide a more complete list for criminals to access.
<P>
	Then we have the proposed banning under the current 
legislation of .25 and .32 calibre firearms and those with barrel 
lengths under 4.14 inches. At least we have the minister's new 
version of banning.
<P>
	This suggests these calibres were innocuous to start with and 
should never have been banned. First he was going to ban them 
and grandfather them. One could not use them. One could not 
sell them or trade them. Then he backed down and said: ``These 
weapons are okay. You can use them. You can sell them to 
somebody who already has a firearm in that category. You can 
take them to the range. You can do everything with them you did 
before''. If that is true, why is there the ban in the first place? 
There is a lot out there to make people suspicious.
<P>
	What we are doing with this legislation is making criminals of 
law-abiding citizens. We are bringing out new regulations 
harder to comply with and then we are saying: ``If you break 
these regulations, you will be a criminal''. What about the real 
criminals?
<P>
	We should be looking at the areas of the bill that can perhaps 
be strengthened to really mean something. That is why we are 
suggesting the splitting of the bill, so we can work with the 
things that have some potential of doing some good in society.
<P>
	The registration of rifles and shotguns is not going to prevent 
one single criminal misuse of a firearm. Crooks do not rob banks 
with 30.06 hunting rifles. As far as any question of an argument 
or a fight that breaks out at a party or whatever, the victim will 
feel very comfortable knowing they were shot with a registered 
rifle instead of an unregistered one. That argument does not 
carry.
<P>
	We need to look at penalties for those who criminally misuse 
firearms. We are talking about sentencing, the length of the 
sentence, the concept of plea bargaining and consecutive 
sentences.
<P>
	The current legislation proposed does not have any teeth in it 
because it matters not what kind of sentence comes out if most 
of those are plea bargained away and also if they are served 
concurrently with the other main sentence. There is absolutely 
no teeth to that.
<P>
	We need lengthy sentences for criminal misuse of firearms, 
for using a firearm in the commission of a crime. We need to 
remove the possibility of plea bargaining from sentences and 
they need to be served consecutively, not concurrently. We also 
need to deal with smuggling strongly. We need to make strong 
examples of people who smuggle firearms or people who use 
firearms for any criminal activity.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11155"> 11155 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	The bottom line is this legislation should deal with the 
criminal misuse of firearms, not the use by legitimate, 
law-abiding citizens. Let us not make them criminals as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a privilege today to speak on Bill C-68. 
One of the goals of any civic minded parliamentarian and law 
maker is to produce laws and regulations which make our 
country a safer place while respecting the rights and privileges 
of its citizenship to engage in peaceful, law-abiding activity.
<P>
	Never would we in this party uphold the right of anyone to 
engage in activities which would cause harm to innocent 
civilians. That is why we fully support bills which address 
criminal behaviour and activity. Bill C-68 deals with part III of 
the Criminal Code, often referred to as gun control laws.
<P>
	One can see when looking at this bill that there are two 
distinct parts to it, one that will almost universally be applauded 
by people in the House, the other that will be very divisive and 
by and large by the majority of people in our caucus will be 
opposed. It will be opposed for very clear thinking, logical and 
civic minded reasons.
<P>
	Let us ask ourselves some fundamental questions. Are all 
guns and their uses criminal? The answer is no. Therefore it is up 
to us to figure out and deal with what is criminal and what is not.
<P>
	God bless us in Canada that we do not have the gun culture of 
the United States. Our culture is personified by tough gun 
control laws that force people who wish to acquire a firearm to 
jump through some very complicated and multiple hoops in 
order to acquire a firearms acquisition certificate. These hoops 
include waiting periods, personal checks, taking a course and 
strict storage requirements to which there is absolutely no 
parallel in the United States. That is just to get a rifle.
<P>
	If a person wishes to acquire a handgun, the rules are even 
more stringent. They require a trigger lock for the handgun and 
they force the person to be a member of a gun club; rules and 
regulations we heartily support.
<P>
	It is a delusion that we can acquire a weapon, stick it 
underneath our pillow and use it whenever we wish. Perhaps that 
is what occurs south of the border, but thankfully it does not 
occur here. Our situation bears absolutely no resemblance to 
that of the United States. The failure to pass half of this bill will 
never remotely bring us close in any way, shape or form to what 
occurs south of the border.
<P>
	Furthermore, there is absolutely no desire whatsoever, 
especially among legitimate gun owners, to be anything like the 
United States where guns of all kinds are widely available to 
anyone who wishes to possess one. This is an environment I 
abhor as does as any other law-abiding citizen. The responsible 
environment in Canada is the  one that legitimate gun owners 
happily find themselves in.
<P>
	Let us look at the criminal use of firearms which should really 
be the end point of any thoughtful gun control regulations. 
Between 1961 and 1990, 63 per cent of all homicides were 
committed by an object other than a firearm. The object of 
choice was a knife. Illegal handguns, which would not be 
addressed by the registration aspect of this bill, were 
responsible for 13 per cent of the homicides. Legally owned 
handguns were used in less than 1 per cent of the cases. Last 
year, of the 720-odd homicides in Canada, five were committed 
with illegally owned handguns.
<P>
	Criminals using firearms to commit offences are not legal gun 
owners but rather those who acquire firearms through different 
measures.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	Criminals do not go to the police department and say: 
``Constable, I have this illegal weapon that I would like to 
register'', or ``I would like to acquire a firearms acquisition 
certificate''. These people cannot get an FAC through the 
current regulations. Rather they get their weapons illegally 
through smuggling across the border from the United States or 
from those people who have acquired guns in that manner.
<P>
	Therefore, the Reform Party supports completely the justice 
minister's endeavours to increase penalties for smuggling, theft 
and for using a firearm in committing a criminal offence with a 
four-year minimum sentence.
<P>
	As an aside, I would strongly recommend to the Minister of 
Justice that with this sentence goes certain stipulations. First, 
that there be no plea bargaining whatsoever. Second, that parole 
be not applied to this aspect of sentencing and that the sentences 
run consecutively not concurrently.
<P>
	If the government does this, it will send a strong message to 
those individuals who are committing offences with firearms. 
Currently most weapon offences are plea bargained away in 
order to get an expeditious conviction on another offence, such 
as a break and enter, which ensures that there is virtually no 
penalty whatsoever to the criminal who chooses to maliciously 
pick up a firearm and commit an offence. He or she knows no 
effective penalty is going to be applied to them. Thus, we 
completely support direct measures to address the criminal use 
of firearms.
<P>
	We do not support punitive actions taken against legal gun 
owners. These individuals jump through hoops to get firearms 
acquisition certificates, take courses, join clubs, et cetera, and 
have proven not to be the element in our society that commits 
criminal offences. As I have proven before, these are not the 
individuals who do this.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11156"> 11156 </A></B>
<P>
	Some people have said that having a firearms acquisition 
certificate, increasing the penalties that we already have and 
having gun registration in particular, is somehow going to 
decrease the rate of suicide. The fact of the matter is that 
between the time that strict gun control measures were brought 
in to the time before that, the rate of suicide per capita has not 
changed. Furthermore, the number of individuals who use 
firearms in committing an offence has not changed at all.
<P>
	Another aspect that is very fundamental to this case and 
perhaps one of the most potent reasons why not to vote in favour 
of gun registration is the cost. People have not given this enough 
thought. The cost is anywhere between $80 million and $500 
million, as has been claimed, and will be passed on to the 
consumer to some extent. However, not all of it will. That leaves 
the ultimate payer in all of this, the taxpayer, who is already 
taxed to death.
<P>
	This means that money is going to be pulled away from other 
functional aspects of the justice department. I cannot emphasize 
this enough. We are going to be taking money away from police 
officers which should have gone for training and equipment. 
Police officers are already hamstrung because of lack of 
finances in part. Think about it. The government is cutting the 
effective arm of our justice system, the arm that protects us, to 
do what? To invest in something that has proven not to work.
<P>
	We are going to see fewer arrests for those committing 
offences such as rape, murder, attempted murder, assault and 
break and enter. All of this is going to decrease the power of the 
police forces to deal with this. Is this an effective use of the 
taxpayers' money? I think not.
<P>
	We will not support any measure that has proven not to 
decrease the rate of crime, as has been proven in Australia. It 
enacted gun registration and it has proven to be a failure. The 
police forces there are asking the politicians to revoke it.
<P>
	Furthermore, contrary to what is being said here by members 
of the government, these measures are not supported by the rank 
and file police officers. That is very important to recognize. Of 
all people, those who are in the field should know best.
<P>
	In closing, we support the bill. We support that it will be 
divided into two sections. The part that we support is the 
effective measures to reduce crime. The part that we do not 
support is the aspect of gun registration and the punitive actions 
against law-abiding gun owners.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to participate in debate on a 
Reform amendment to split Bill C-68 and thus bring the real 
issue of safety and security of Canadians into focus.
<P>
	The amendment presents the Minister of Justice with a real 
opportunity to protect Canadians and prosecute and punish those 
who break the law.
<P>
	As the bill is currently structured, the legitimate issues 
concerning firearms control are clouded and confused. This 
obfuscation was no doubt conceived, cultivated and foisted on 
the minister by select individuals of the Coalition for Gun 
Control and some stealthy, arrogant, policy counsels within 
justice. Like a rock these beacons of virtue and public service 
are telling Canadians what is good for them. If these same 
people are so concerned for the welfare and safety of Canadians 
and fairness in laws, then any rational thinking bureaucrat 
would have seen this major deficiency in handiwork.
<P>
	Anyone can see that splitting the bill will focus the wrath 
where it should be, at those individuals who use firearms in the 
commission of crimes and who continue to make our streets 
unsafe for law-abiding citizens.
<P>
	As Bill C-68 is currently constituted we are being asked to 
deal with two separate issues. Let us try to remove some of the 
emotion from the debate. Let us deal with the issues in chewable 
chunks. If the minister believes so firmly in firearms 
registration, then let him stand up and debate his notion of 
fairness. If he is so concerned with criminal justice let him stand 
up and debate his notion of fairness. Let the issues stand on their 
own merits and not on stealth.
<P>
	Recently the Minister of Justice during a speech in Montreal 
was quoted as saying: ``More than anything else Bill C-68 is 
about the kind of country we want to live in, the kind of society 
we want as Canadians''. He went on: ``We are willing to have it 
out right now. Let's decide who is running this country. There's 
no room for an American style gun lobby in this country''.
<P>
	I want to tell the justice minister that Canadians run the 
country and there is room in this nation for all kinds of people 
representing many points of view. Comments about gun control 
like the ones he made in Montreal are intolerant. Debate is 
dissent according to the minister. What is he afraid of? If he 
really wants, as he said, to have it out, then level the playing 
field. If he feels he has such support, deal with the legislation in 
Bill C-68 upfront, each issue at a time without the rhetoric.
<P>
	Let us take a look at some of the statistics and at the real issue. 
Last year roughly 3,800 firearms were either lost or stolen by 
those who lawfully own them in Canada. Some of these would 
have been from police and from the military. During that same 
period 375,000 firearms were smuggled into Canada. That is one 
hundred times as many.
<P>
	The onus and emphasis of the minister's legislation is 
registration which impacts on lawful citizens. Why does he not 
beef up security at our borders and crack down on the gun 
smugglers and runners?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11157"> 11157 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister says he wants to take this issue on. He thinks 
establishing a national registry at likely cost estimates upwards 
of $500 million to implement is taking the issue on. Tying up 
police resources in software programs and registration 
verification is really getting tough on crime. The criminals are 
shaking in their boots. One does not have to go two miles from 
Parliament Hill as recently as last Thursday when three 
parolees shot it out with police, wounding two officers because 
of better fire power. I am sure those three, who will be out on 
release shortly because of our revolving door justice system, 
will be the first to run out and register their illegal guns. If 
anyone is playing politics with emotions, it is not the Reform 
Party on this issue.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	The minister conveniently uses the Canadian Association of 
Police Chiefs to make and carry his message on gun control. 
This is the same organization that receives federal funding and 
which has never done any polling of its members. How weak.
<P>
	I can make a case for the other side based on my conversations 
with real police officers who are fighting crime. It is backed up 
by letters and calls. I even received one petition from Sault Ste. 
Marie with 5,000 signatures, demanding that their point of view 
be heard. These are responsible, law-abiding citizens who may 
not meet the minister's social standards and are thus dismissed 
as not worthy of a point of view.
<P>
	The whole issue of registration is a red herring in my books. 
New Zealand has had universal registration and is abandoning it 
with the blessing of the police because it is time consuming, 
expensive and is not accomplishing anything.
<P>
	Australia is considering abandoning its universal registration 
with the blessing of police. Police in Australia estimate that only 
one firearm in four is registered due to non-compliance. 
Criminals for sure do not register their firearms. For heaven's 
sake, they do not even register their cars.
<P>
	The shootout in west end Ottawa last Thursday night involved 
a stolen getaway vehicle. The answer to all this is Bill C-68, an 
issue the minister says he wants to take on.
<P>
	A national firearms registry does not meet the views of the 
majority of Canadians who are seeking less government, less 
intrusion into their lives, and reducing the cost of government.
<P>
	The legislation and the minister's bill will impose a 10-year 
jail term for failure to register firearms and includes the right to 
search and seize without a warrant. This is the minister's view of 
how Canadian should be governed, by a police state. After 
everything is said and done, the criminals will be running the 
justice system.
<P>
	Bill C-68 is a complicated, convoluted attempt to shift the 
focus of the real debate. If it is left in its current form we will fail 
to tackle the real issue, which of course is crime control. This is 
bad law. The justice department argues that registration will 
make gun owners more accountable.
<P>
	As a firearms owner, I already store my firearms according to 
the rules, as do the majority of gun owners. I can tell the minister 
that no registration system will force gun smugglers, gun 
runners and criminals to be more accountable. It is misguided 
and focused on the wrong premise.
<P>
	This is the easy thing to do and the way one would expect a 
bureaucrat to deal with an issue. In their perfect, self-contained 
world, any gun owner is a criminal. We are all lumped in the 
same category. It is convenient, easy but dead wrong. This is bad 
law.
<P>
	I therefore support the motion to split Bill C-68 and get down 
to the business of solving crime.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
want to begin by congratulating my colleague for 
Yorkton-Melville for introducing this amendment.
<P>
	The universal registration of firearms is one of the most 
controversial and ineffective sections of Bill C-68. The 
amendment separates gun control from crime control. It allows 
the crime control portions of the bill to be dealt with separately 
and expeditiously.
<P>
	For the last year members of the Reform Party have been 
telling the government that Canada has a crime problem, not a 
gun problem. It is a difference it has so far refused to recognize. 
The government persevered and introduced Bill C-68 which is 
seriously flawed.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	The minister claims his intention is to crack down on the 
criminal use of firearms. Certainly that is an area I would 
support him in. In fact, all he has done so far is to take aim at the 
easiest available target: the legitimate owners of guns. He really 
means that gun control lies at the heart of the Liberal Party's 
effort to derail the nationwide surge in interest in tougher and 
more effective criminal justice.
<P>
	Public safety must be the overriding goal of any government. 
Punishment of crime should come before all other objectives. 
The Reform Party believes the target should be the criminal use 
of firearms, not the law-abiding gun owners.
<P>
	Passage of this amendment would allow Parliament to get on 
with dealing with the crime problem. There is no connection 
between the legitimate gun owner who owns a firearm for 
hunting, target shooting, or for the protection of his family or his 
animals from preying wildlife and the criminal who obtains a 
firearm illegally for the purpose of committing a crime. There is 
no correlation between the two at all.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11158"> 11158 </A></B>
<P>
	As my friend pointed out, last Thursday in Ottawa a few 
miles west of this Chamber there was an armed robbery. Not 
only were two of the participants in this botched hold-up on 
parole, but they also had a history of armed robbery 
convictions. That is what they had been jailed for on their last 
convictions. One of them was even prohibited from owning a 
firearm for life.
<P>
	How would gun registration have made any difference 
whatsoever in this case? Would it have saved the two Ottawa 
police officers from the gunshot wounds they suffered? Not 
likely. Let us face facts here. No amount of gun control 
regulation would have stopped this trio from obtaining the guns 
they needed to carry out their robbery or any other robbery they 
might plan.
<P>
	The real problem here is the criminal misuse of firearms. 
Those convicted must be severely punished. The separation of 
this bill into two parts would accomplish that goal.
<P>
	More crimes are committed in this country with knives than 
guns, but no one is suggesting we register our kitchen knives, at 
least not yet. This government is more interested in proceeding 
with the mandatory registration of firearms than it is with 
solving our crime problem. Mandatory gun registration is not 
just a tax on law-abiding gun owners, but one that will cost all 
Canadians millions of dollars to implement.
<P>
	The minister's supporters, the anti-gun lobbyists, claim that 
firearms registration is justified because we register our cars 
and our dogs. The truth is that these registrations exist primarily 
as a form of taxation.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice estimates universal registration will 
cost $85 million. If you will pardon the expression, I think that 
is a rather conservative estimate. Experts at Simon Fraser 
University put the cost somewhere between $400 million and 
$500 million.
<P>
	Here we have a Liberal government using parliamentary time 
to debate gun control when we will be paying some $50 billion 
in interest this year. This government has its priorities 
completely mixed up. So much for an assault on the deficit. This 
is merely another assault on the wallets of Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	In addition, mandatory registration will turn police officers 
into bureaucrats. The Minister of Finance announced in the 
February budget that thousands of public service jobs will be 
eliminated and he is going to shrink the bureaucracy. Someone 
should tell the Minister of Finance that his colleague, the 
Minister of Justice, is creating a whole new bureaucracy. Once 
the minister turns police officers into bureaucrats, they will be 
so bogged down with paperwork and chasing otherwise 
legitimate gun owners that they will not have time for regular 
law enforcement duties.
<P>
	We have asked the minister repeatedly for evidence proving 
that a national gun registry will save lives. So far he has been 
unable to give us that information and has been successfully 
ducking the issue. We know the reason  he cannot give those. He 
simply cannot. He does not have a shred of evidence to provide 
to us.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has taken on gun control purely as a 
personal crusade. Somehow he has managed to confuse crime 
control with gun control. Now legitimate gun owners are afraid 
that this minister is so blinded by his personal agenda that he 
will stop at nothing until he reaches his ultimate goal: the 
complete confiscation of all firearms in Canada, maybe with the 
exception of law authorities and military. We have heard this 
minister and other members of the government state that they 
would like to see a society in which only police officers and the 
military have weapons. The only way that can come about is 
through confiscation.
<P>
	The minister hopes that by making firearms ownership so 
complicated and expensive that Canadians will give them up. 
More than likely, it will put more guns into the underground 
market, not less and ultimately, more guns into the hands of 
criminals.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice hopes that all this attention on gun 
control will divert attention away from the roots of our crime 
problem. After all, the Liberal Party policy on crime is that it 
somehow is society's fault. He often drags out polls to support 
his stand.
<P>
	If he is really interested in the polls and what people think, he 
should look at the Simon Fraser University opinion survey. It 
showed that Canadians knew little about gun control laws and 
that their support for firearms registration weakened as they 
became more knowledgeable about this issue.
<P>
	The reason people voice support for gun control when 
questioned by pollsters is that they think or hope that 
registration of firearms will somehow improve public safety and 
reduce violence. Most Canadians do not know that handgun 
registration has been in effect in Canada since 1934, 61 years. 
There is no record to show that a single crime has been 
prevented as a result of this registration.
<P>
	Most Canadians do not know that experiments in firearms 
registration were expensive failures in Australia and New 
Zealand. As my friend has pointed out, they are now being given 
up in those countries.
<P>
	Most Canadians do not know that in 1993 the auditor general 
reported to Parliament that the previous government had no 
statistical basis for implementing the last round of gun control 
regulations.
<P>
	Most Canadians are unaware of the findings of project gun 
runner which was undertaken by the Ontario government. 
Project gun runner found that 86 per cent of all handguns used in 
the commission of crimes were smuggled into Canada. Does the 
minister really believe that the new owners of these smuggled 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11159"> 11159 </A></B>
<P>
weapons will register them? Surely, he is not that naive. I do not 
believe he is.
<P>
	Reformers are not opposed to the government's plan to crack 
down on smuggling. That is why we believe the only solution is 
to split this bill so that crime control and gun control can be dealt 
with separately.
<P>
	It is too bad the Minister of Justice cannot see that his 
determined efforts to reduce crime are so far off base. He started 
down this road and he is too proud to admit he is lost. He is 
afraid that if he turns back he will be seen as abandoning his 
principles.
<P>
	The minister should thank his colleague from 
Yorkton-Melville for bringing forth this amendment. The 
member has done him a big favour. He has given the minister an 
avenue to save face. If he takes it, he can preserve his standing in 
the next leadership race.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak in opposition to 
the amendment which has been tabled by the member for 
Yorkton-Melville and to speak strongly in support of the 
principle of Bill C-68.
<P>
	This is one of the most important pieces of legislation to come 
before this House. In saying so, I want to take this opportunity to 
make very clear that this legislation is the product of the 
dedication, the commitment, the integrity and the energy of 
many men and women across this country.
<P>
	I am proud of the history of my own party in speaking out for 
strong and effective gun control. One of my former colleagues in 
the House, Stuart Leggatt, the former member of Parliament for 
New Westminster-Burnaby, was one of those who originally 
participated in the debate on gun control legislation in 1976 and 
1977. He spoke very eloquently about the importance of 
effective gun control.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	I took the opportunity to review those debates and to look at 
some of the newspaper coverage of the debates at the time. It 
was eerily familiar. One headline was: ``West up in arms over 
government's gun control proposals''. In 1976, a group calling 
itself the Firearms and Responsible Ownership coalition 
distributed a commentary suggesting that the purpose of the 
government's bill was to ultimately stop any and all legitimate 
use of firearms in Canada. It went on to suggest that gun control 
legislation was a threat to sportsmen. That was in 1976 and we 
are hearing the same kind of unfounded allegations today.
<P>
	It was my colleagues, Ian Waddell, the member of Parliament 
for Port Moody-Coquitlam, and Dawn Black, the member for 
New Westminister-Burnaby, who in the last Parliament spoke 
out very strongly for tough and effective gun control legislation. 
They called for a stronger Bill C-17, a strengthening of the bill 
that was brought in by Kim Campbell.
<P>
	Our platform in the last federal election was unequivocal. It 
stated: ``New Democrats have consistently argued for more 
effective gun control. We support the most recent legislation and 
have fought hard against efforts in the House of Commons to 
weaken it. We continue to promote an even stronger, more 
effective law. In particular, we want a national firearms registry 
system which would provide law enforcement agencies with a 
list of each firearm in circulation and its serial number. This 
would facilitate the tracking of all weapons stolen or used in 
crimes''. I am pleased and honoured to stand in my place in the 
House of Commons today to reiterate that commitment to strong 
and effective gun control legislation.
<P>
	I would also like to pay tribute to the Coalition for Gun 
Control. It has done such an outstanding job in helping to make 
Canadians aware of these issues. I particularly pay tribute to 
Wendy Cukier and Heidi Rathjen, the executive director.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Heidi Rathjen had the good fortunate to survive the massacre 
that left 14 dead at l'École Polytechnique on December 6, 1989. 
I would also like to pay tribute to Mrs. Suzanne Edward, whose 
daughter was among the victims of the December 6, 1989, 
massacre.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, I would like to pay a special word of tribute to the 
member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce who has so tirelessly 
advocated strong and effective gun control legislation over the 
years. I have seconded a number of private members' bills that 
he has tabled and he has seconded a number of mine.
<P>
	It is not often that I take the opportunity to commend a 
minister of this government. I see the Minister of Justice in the 
House today and I know he has made a genuine effort to respond 
to the concerns of Canadians. He has travelled extensively 
across the country and has listened to hunters, gun collectors 
and others in all provinces and territories, including my own 
province of British Columbia. I want to take this opportunity to 
commend the minister for his efforts to genuinely understand, 
listen to and respond to legitimate concerns of those in the field 
of gun control and for the leadership he is demonstrating in 
moving forward on this very important legislation.
<P>
	I listened with interest to the previous speaker from the 
Reform Party who asked the question: Where is the evidence to 
back up the call for registration? I have a very interesting quote 
from the first Reform Party member of Parliament to sit in the 
House of Commons. The member for Beaver River spoke in this 
House on November 6, 1991. What she said on the question of 
firearm registration was very interesting.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11160"> 11160 </A></B>
<P>
	She said: ``I would draw the member's attention to the 
Canadian Police Association and some of the recommendations 
they brought forward. They said that over 90 per cent of all 
respondents believe that guns of all kinds should be 
registered''. The Reform Party member for Beaver River went 
on to say: ``I agree with that and I think every Canadian would 
agree with that as well''. Let me just say that I agree with the 
member for Beaver River when she spoke in November 1991. 
I can only ask why it is that her colleagues have not listened 
to the very thoughtful analysis of the member for Beaver River 
as well.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	The previous speaker for the Reform Party asked where the 
evidence is. I will cite a statistic to the Reform Party member 
who asked the question and left the House. In Britain in 1993-94 
there were a total of 55 firearms deaths. That is in a country with 
a population of 60 million. In Canada there were over 1,400 
deaths caused by legally owned firearms.
<P>
	What more do those who ask for evidence need? We will save 
lives. We will reduce the level of crime. That alone is grounds 
for rejecting this amendment and moving ahead on this very 
important legislation.
<P>
	Recently the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police issued 
a very comprehensive memorandum on the issue of registration 
because that is the issue. No one is questioning the importance 
of getting tougher on smuggling. No one is questioning the 
importance of tougher criminal sanctions. That is clear.
<P>
	Some concerns have been raised about the potential impact of 
lengthy mandatory minimum sentences on prison populations 
and I share some of those concerns. The real issue and the 
purpose of the amendment is registration.
<P>
	What do the chiefs of police have to say about registration? 
They say without information about who owns guns there is no 
effective gun control. Tracking guns that are imported into 
Canada and then sold is critical to controlling abuse. They point 
out registration will help promote safe storage which will reduce 
gun theft as well as suicides and accidents.
<P>
	I have seen this in my own constituency. There was the case of 
a young man 18 years old who was at a party with a group of 
friends. He took out his father's gun and tragically was involved 
in a fatal shooting. A police officer from the Burnaby RCMP 
said it is a typical case of firearms not being secured the way 
they should and firearms not being handled the way they should, 
a life gone for nothing. How many other lives will we lose before 
we recognize this madness must come to an end?
<P>
	I am proud that we do not have the American psychology of 
the right to bear arms. We do not have the pressures of the 
National Rifle Association intimidating elected representatives. 
We have seen powerful attempts to lobby.
<P>
	One of the factors I am proud of that distinguishes Canada 
from the United States is we are prepared to say we do not 
believe in that culture of unrestricted gun ownership. This bill 
will help to preserve and to strengthen that commitment.
<P>
	We will save lives with this bill. There is no doubt about that. 
Police, women's groups and others have made it very clear they 
want to see strong and effective registration. They want us to 
remove firearms from volatile situations. Those situations 
include circumstances in which there may be a suicide, in which 
there may be a homicide.
<P>
	We want to make sure there are not undue costs of 
registration, that the system is not unduly burdensome. We want 
to put more resources into dealing with violence against women. 
The leader of my party has spoken out very eloquently on the 
importance of that.
<P>
	We want to see more resources for enforcement at the border. 
The government is cutting back on public service. I am 
concerned that we not cut back on resources that will help us to 
fight smuggling. We want to do more in terms of prevention. I 
am deeply troubled by the cuts in the budget in social programs.
<P>
	I am proud to stand in the House to oppose the amendment, to 
support the principle of this legislation. I believe in doing so that 
I am maintaining a long and honourable tradition of New 
Democrats who have spoken out for strong and effective gun 
control, for safer communities and for saving lives. I am very 
proud to continue in that tradition.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It is my duty, pursuant 
to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to 
be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway-Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police; the hon. member for North Island-Powell 
River-Indian affairs.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to speak to the motion proposed by my 
colleague from Yorkton-Melville. The intent and the effect of 
this motion are very clear, to split the bill into two parts. One 
part would contain the Criminal Code amendments dealing with 
the criminal use of firearms while the second would contain all 
the regulations governing the ownership of a firearm, including 
such things as storage, transportation requirements, training 
courses, minor permits, et cetera.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	The bill as it stands addresses two facets of firearm 
possession. One facet is directed toward those who possess 
firearms legally and the other is directed toward those who 
possess firearms illegally.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11161"> 11161 </A></B>
<P>
	The Minister of Justice through the bill is requiring all 
persons who legally possess a firearm to register their firearm 
and that this will reduce the number of persons who possess 
a firearm illegally. The first response to this is how will this 
approach achieve that?
<P>
	Before pursuing that, let us look at the approach to solving the 
problem. The problem we have is the illegal possession of 
firearms and the misuse of these firearms. The approach of the 
bill is to impede or to put up barriers to the legal possession of 
firearms, which will supposedly reduce illegal possession of 
firearms; in other words, punish the law-abiding citizens to get 
at the law breakers.
<P>
	Gun control measures aimed at reducing crime and the 
registration of firearms are two separate issues. If the purpose of 
Bill C-68 is to reduce crime, why does it include the registration 
of all firearms? Should it not be plainly demonstrated 
beforehand how registration prevents and reduces crime?
<P>
	This is what Reform members have been asking the Minister 
of Justice and so far they have failed to get a clear, concise, 
satisfactory answer. Establishing how these two components are 
linked has not been forthcoming.
<P>
	On February 16 the Minister of Justice opened the debate on 
Bill C-68 and spent much of his speech dealing with 
registration. One of the minister's arguments was to reduce the 
number of firearms smuggled into Canada. The minister stated 
we should reduce the number of firearms smuggled into the 
country. It is a laudable goal and one which the Reform Party 
supports. Then the minister went on to state this would be 
achieved through registration. He said the registration of all 
firearms will enable us to do a better job at the borders.
<P>
	The minister added on February 16:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We will never stop the smuggling of firearms entirely. There are 130 million 
border crossings a year. We cannot stop every vehicle and check every trunk and 
glove compartment. But we can do a better job than we have done in the past and 
registration will enable us to do it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	How does registering a gun allow them to work better at the 
border? If cars are not stopped in the first place, how will they 
know if the gun is there?
<P>
	Perhaps members opposite will grasp why Reform members 
are so frustrated with the bill and the minister's rationale. We 
can divide the minister's arguments with regard to smuggling 
into three statements: one, the registration of firearms will 
enable us to do a better job at the borders; two, it is hard to stop 
the smuggling of firearms entirely because of the volume at 
border crossings; three, we can do a better job and registration 
will help us. It sounds like a circle to me.
<P>
	That seems to be the argument on how registration will reduce 
smuggling. That argument utterly fails to answer the question of 
how the registration of firearms in Canada will reduce 
smuggling. I can see how more border inspections and more 
border guards will reduce smuggling, but I fail to see how 
registration will work in  this regard. It is incumbent upon the 
minister and the government to provide clear answers to these 
genuine questions.
<P>
	One reason firearm owners oppose registration is they see it 
as a step toward confiscation. While the Minister of Justice has 
tried to allay that concern, prominent colleagues in his own 
party seem to favour that view. In the debate on March 13 the 
Secretary of State for Multiculturalism and the Status of Women 
said the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In 1987 the English writer Martin Amis wrote: ``Bullets cannot be recalled. 
They cannot be uninvented. But they can be taken out of the gun''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	The speaker went on to say: ``I would add that the safest way 
is to take away the guns''. This certainly sounds like 
confiscation to me.
<P>
	I would like to comment on the politics of this issue and this 
bill. They have become very interesting because of the reaction 
of the Liberal and NDP caucuses. Members of the government 
who support the bill like portraying this as a right-left 
ideological debate or a debate between the people of Canada and 
the gun lobby.
<P>
	The justice minister on February 16 said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We have an opportunity for Parliament to make a statement about the kind of 
Canada that we want for ourselves and for our children, about the efforts we are 
prepared to make to ensure the peaceful and civilized nation that we have and 
enjoy and to demonstrate just who is in control of firearms in Canada. Is it the 
gun lobby or is it the people of the country?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This type of talk is simply presumptuous.
<P>
	At a town hall meeting I held in Surrey in March most people 
wanted to talk about the government's proposed gun legislation. 
They were overwhelmingly in favour of tougher criminal 
penalties for criminal misuse of firearms but they were opposed 
to the registration of their firearms, seeing it as expensive, 
intrusive and impractical. These people were not members of 
gun lobbies. They were individual citizens who are hunters, 
collectors or target shooters.
<P>
	One person I remember quite well was a Delta police officer 
who talked at some length about how the proposed registration 
would be totally ineffective at reducing crime. Citizens such as 
these are the ones opposing the registration aspects of Bill C-68. 
The sooner this is realized by the government the better.
<P>
	If opposition to the bill is just the gun lobby, why are members 
of the minister's own caucus having trouble with the 
legislation? Why are eight of the nine members of the New 
Democratic Party supposedly opposed to the legislation? To 
think that all of these members of the NDP and Liberal caucuses 
have been coerced by gun lobbyists is phenomenal.

	I would like to finish with the following quote that expresses 
my sentiments also:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My constituents have been asking all along that the bill be divided into two 
parts: legislation that directly affects law-abiding gun owners and legislation 
that affects the criminal use of firearms.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That was a quote from the March 13 <I>Hansard</I>. The person who 
said those words was not another Reform member, nor was it 
some member of the nefarious gun lobby, but the Liberal 
member for Cochrane-Superior.
<P>
	I read the motion that has been put forward. To that member 
and to other reasonable Liberals, the member for 
Yorkton-Melville has provided members with the 
opportunity-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to speak to Bill C-68 and also 
to the amendment proposed by the hon. member for 
Yorkton-Melville.
<P>
	I am pleased to join my Reform colleagues in calling for Bill 
C-68 to be split into two bills, one dealing with crime and the 
other with gun control. These two issues are both important but 
are not connected.
<P>
	Crime control deals with the issue of public safety while gun 
control deals with the issues of red tape, bureaucratic burden, 
additional taxation and, from some extremists, Liberal social 
engineering.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	There is no evidence anywhere to suggest criminal activity 
and legal gun ownership are connected. Many studies have been 
done that clearly demonstrate that no such link exists.
<P>
	No doubt there is a real crime problem in Canada. The 
politicians know it. Canadian citizens know it. Everyone knows 
it. Naturally the government wants to be seen as doing 
something about it. We on the Reform benches would rather the 
government take real steps to deter crime than opt for the quick 
fix, look good attack on legal gun owners. It may create a lot of 
activity that gives the impression of real action, but it will have 
no real impact on the rates of crime and violent crime in Canada.
<P>
	One study on the relationship between guns and crime was 
recently done by Professor Gary Mauser of Simon Fraser 
University. Professor Mauser's report entitled ``Gun Control is 
not Crime Control'' has been published by the Fraser Institute 
and contains some very interesting facts.
<P>
	Professor Mauser looked at homicide rates in countries 
around the world and compared them with gun control laws to 
see if there was a correlation between the two. There was none. 
The professor pointed out that no government anywhere in the 
world could claim to have reduced crime through gun control. 
Firearms have been banned altogether in Jamaica, Hong Kong, 
New York City and Washington D.C. without leading to a 
decrease in homicide rates. Those places have some of the 
highest crime rates in the world.
<P>
	To highlight some of his findings I think all members would 
be interested to know some of the comparisons found in the 
study. As Canada is a wealthy industrialized democracy, I will 
limit my comparison to other nations that fit roughly into the 
same category, namely the United States, France, Switzerland 
and Japan.
<P>
	Both France and the U.S.A. have higher homicide rates than 
Canada. In the United States gun control is more relaxed than 
here, but in France it is somewhat more controlled. Switzerland 
has very liberal gun laws. Private gun ownership is encouraged. 
Not only is the homicide rate in Switzerland lower than in 
Canada, but it is also lower than in Japan where gun ownership is 
prohibited entirely. The murder rate is higher in a country that 
prohibits guns than in one that promotes their responsible use.
<P>
	An even more telling comparison is the case in Great Britain. 
Faced with a growing crime rate in the 1980s the British 
government introduced extremely restrictive gun controls in 
1988. In the five years that followed, the crime rate in Britain 
rose at precisely the same rate as before gun control laws were 
imposed.
<P>
	There is a very important message for the government. I hope 
it is listening. Gun control will have no effect on the crime rate. 
According to Professor Mauser:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The federal government's current proposals for stricter gun controls would, 
if introduced, not only fail to reduce crime but would vastly increase the size of 
the federal bureaucracy.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He went on to say that while legitimate gun owners pose no 
threat to society, ``the violent offender poses a significant threat 
to public safety and greater efforts must be focused here. It is a 
truism that laws only apply to the law abiding''.
<P>
	How true it is that more gun control laws will only punish 
those responsible Canadians who are already following the 
current laws. The tragedy is that an otherwise good crime bill is 
being ruined by the inclusion of gun control measures that will 
not reduce violent crime, suicides or firearm accidents. If they 
did I would be the first to support them. All these measures will 
do is punish responsible gun owners and have a serious impact 
on the industry they support.
<P>

<P>
	I want to talk about the economic impact of Bill C-68. The 
economic value of all hunting, target shooting and gun 
collecting in Canada is estimated to be $1.2 billion per year and 
growing. In my province of Saskatchewan the provincial 
government is currently engaged in a study of how much 
economic activity will disappear from the province if the 
legislation goes through without amendment. The province 
raises over $8 million annually from the sale of hunting and 
fishing licences. Some of the revenue will be lost or at least 
greatly reduced if owning and operating a firearm becomes too 
expensive or too bureaucratic to be worth it.
<P>
	American hunting groups are already saying that many 
hunters will not come to Canada if the gun control is in place. 
The loss of tourism dollars will be devastating to many parts of 
Saskatchewan including the area of Kindersley in my 
constituency.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Kingston and the Islands does not 
particularly care about the economy of Saskatchewan but I am 
very concerned because it is the economy in my province that 
puts bread on the table, provides a future for young people and 
gives them some reason for optimism. I am really disappointed 
the government is trying to impose legislation on my province 
that will harm the economy.
<P>
	The number of businesses attached to the hunting and tourism 
industry is tremendous. Has the government considered how 
many hunting lodges and outfitters will be forced to close? What 
about all the stores that sell hunting clothing and equipment and 
the sale of offload vehicles and RVs? We are talking big 
business. It is not a trivial matter.
<P>
	Members across the way seem to think it is a trivial matter. 
They mock the legal business practices of the people of 
Saskatchewan who are benefiting from the tourism and hunting 
industry as it now exists. They do not seem to care that it will be 
squelched with the introduction and passage of Bill C-68.
<P>
	It is not only the small business men and women who will 
suffer from the collapse of the hunting and fishing industry. 
Many local charities run food concessions at gun shows. It is not 
uncommon for a church group to raise $3,000 or $4,000 for 
charitable works from a single weekend show.
<P>
	When farmers retire and auction off their equipment many put 
a rifle or two in the auction because it brings more people out to 
the sale. Many in my constituency have expressed the concern 
that losing this activity will drive down the money they raise for 
their retirement.
<P>
	Many outfitters to whom I have spoken from all across 
Saskatchewan say that business in their stores and at gun shows 
has dropped by 40 per cent in anticipation of the bill passing. 
There is a 40 per cent loss in business because they understand 
the government is fixated with passing Bill C-68. They are 
expecting it to get much worse once the full impact of the bill is 
felt.
<P>
	The Government of Saskatchewan estimates that for each 
white tail deer licence it issues to non-Canadian residents, 
$3,000 in related spending is added to the provincial economy. 
In 1993-94, 2,850 deer licences were issued to non-Canadians. 
If the American hunters boycott Canada, $8.5 million in direct 
spending alone will be lost from our economy.
<P>
	As long as the herd is properly managed, this is a renewable 
resource that could continue to provide enjoyment for 
Canadians and our guests as well as contribute to our economy. 
White tail deer hunting is very important in my riding at the 
moment as the new world record buck was recently shot by a 
constituent of mine from Biggar.
<P>
	Myles Hanson broke an 80-year old record previously held by 
an American from Nebraska. Because of this new world record, 
potential for increased tourism revenue exists for the local 
hunting industry, potential that is put in risk by this type of 
legislation.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that we cannot have more time to debate the 
bill. I will close by saying that Bill C-68 should be split into two 
bills, one dealing with the crime control that all Canadians want 
and the other dealing with the gun control wanted by the 
Liberals and other elites.
<P>
	It has been demonstrated time and time again that gun control 
and crime control are separate issues. We should treat them 
separately in the House. The economic impact of the bill will 
devastate the tourism industry in Saskatchewan. I call on all 
members, particularly those from Saskatchewan, to support 
splitting the bill. It would be a shame to lose a good crime bill 
because of some ill thought gun control idea.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to speak in favour of the 
amendment proposed by my colleague, the hon. member for 
Yorkton-Melville.
<P>
	I have heard a lot of debate on the issue. I have heard a lot of 
statistics. We sometimes wonder what is being done with all the 
information. In Manitoba we register cars. There is insurance on 
them. If I am not a responsible driver pretty soon it costs me a lot 
more to drive the vehicle.
<P>
	I heard that gun owners were very irresponsible, that there 
were many accidents in the home, that guns had to be locked up, 
and that something had to be done to prevent these things. I 
thought: Why not go to insurance companies to find out how 
they look at the issue? I want to read some statistics from 
Ontario and Manitoba. Maybe hon. members can put the figures 
together and match them against what has been said.

<P>
	The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters offers a public 
liability to its members included in the membership fee. They 
get the umbrella coverage through Royal Insurance. The 
insurance premium is extremely cheap. It works out to about $3 
or $4 per member per year. It provides $2 million for public 
liability. That is pretty cheap public liability insurance. The 
Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters does not offer life 
insurance as part of its membership.
<P>
	The Manitoba Wildlife Federation includes a $5,000 
insurance on death or dismemberment at no extra cost. That is 
very cheap insurance for a very dangerous occupation, I would 
say. The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters does not 
offer it because it is no more difficult to get a personal life 
insurance package if one is a hunter than if one is not. 
Apparently a life insurance company will ask questions to 
determine if one is involved in high risk activity. It will ask if 
one sky dives or scuba dives but will not ask if one is a hunter.
<P>
	Insurance people work on a profit margin. If terrible accidents 
were costing a lot in compensation or insurance, they would 
have increased premiums. In Ontario in the late 1950s there 
were about 40 to 50 hunting accidents per year. Now there are 
less than five per year because of the extra emphasis on hunter 
safety training courses provided by gun clubs and by hunting 
organizations. It a pretty efficient education.
<P>
	According to the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters 
there is no question regarding gun ownership on home insurance 
policies. The Manitoba Wildlife Federation reports basically the 
same. It provides a $2 million third party supplementary 
liability policy with membership. It is meant to be 
supplementary and the homeowners policy would kick in first. 
The wildlife federation policy would cover the next $2 million. 
If there were no homeowners policy the wildlife federation 
policy would become the primary policy.
<P>
	The Manitoba Wildlife Federation gets its insurance through 
Bolls and McMartin Insurance in Winnipeg. My assistant spoke 
with Bolls and McMartin Insurance this morning. There are no 
extra premiums for firearm owners on its homeowners policy. It 
is not a question they ask potential customers. Whether or not 
the person wanting insurance owns a firearm is not an issue. The 
number of firearm related accidents is so small that it is not of 
concern to the insurance companies. Why is it such a concern to 
Liberals?
<P>
	Its homeowners policy is quite comprehensive and provides 
public liability for hunting accidents in the same way that it 
would provide for a chimney crumbling and damaging a 
neighbour's house or for a shingle blowing off the roof and 
hitting the postman. That about says how dangerous it is when it 
comes to gun ownership.
<P>
	Prudential Insurance Company in Ottawa offers a home 
insurance policy that provides a $1 million liability. It covers a 
wide range of circumstances: accidents with a gun in the home 
or during hunting, someone slipping on a step or someone being 
hit by a brick falling off a chimney. They are all under one 
category. It does not ask specific questions regarding firearm 
ownership. It asks for the total value of goods in the home and 
guns are usually under the category of sporting goods.
<P>
	When a home is broken into and the thieves want guns, they 
will also steal the guns that are stored and locked up. It is a 
matter of the criminal looking for whatever he needs. It is not 
the guns that are causing all the problems.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	I would like to inform the House that there have been hunters 
in my family for five or six generations. My grandfather, whom I 
knew well, was an avid hunter, my father, myself and my 
youngest son. We have never had a hunting accident or a gun 
related accident. I have had the experience of my youngest son 
almost being killed by an attacker in a parking lot in the city. In 
one generation I have had that experience where five 
generations of hunting have never given me that experience.
<P>
	Have these criminals been apprehended? No. It is impossible 
to catch them. Why? I would like to read a story and perhaps 
hon. members across the way will find out what our problem is. 
This is a Canadian Press story from Winnipeg of January 23:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The bodies of Rhonda, 22, and Roy Lavoie, 30, were found Friday in a van 
parked in a farmer's garage north of Gimli, Man. Police said they died of carbon 
monoxide poisoning.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Roy Lavoie had been charged on at least two separate occasions and released 
on bail both times.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``I don't know why Roy got out the second time,'' (a friend said) as a police 
chaplain helped family members break the news of the murder-suicide to the 
couple's sons, age 2, 3 and 6.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>He was allowed to go free on bail after being charged with assaulting and

	She had to promise she would not release this to anyone.
<P>
	There are laws to protect us from criminals but they are not 
being enforced. Until such time as we as members of Parliament 
make the police enforce these laws any gun registering will do 
nothing to deter crime.
<P>
	It is evident to anyone who has ever had anything to do with 
criminal activity that it is not the gun or the club or the stone or 
whatever it is that he is using, it is the man using the weapon.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11165"> 11165 </A></B>
<P>
	If we want to do something, let us go after the criminal. Let 
us divide the bill. We support the section dealing with the 
sentencing of criminals. I fully support the amendment of my 
colleague to divide the bill and I hope the rest of the House will 
too.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to support the amendment 
introduced by my hon. colleague, the member for 
Yorkton-Melville.
<P>
	The amendment is to divide Bill C-68 into two parts: the first 
part dealing with the criminal use of firearms and stricter 
penalties to punish crime; and the second part to force 
law-abiding citizens to go through a very complicated, a very 
structured and a very costly procedure to register all their 
firearms. This is in addition to handguns, which are already 
registered and have had to be registered for over 60 years.
<P>
	We support the division of the bill. Most Canadians want the 
criminal use of firearms to be dealt with swiftly and 
energetically. We need to make the criminal use of firearms, the 
violation of the safety and the rights of law-abiding citizens, a 
high risk activity. Criminals should think long and hard and 
should pay a very high price for violating the rights of citizens, 
for harming them and for interfering with their safety. We all 
agree on that. We wish the government would get on with it.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	What we do not agree with is this time-honoured, political 
ploy of marrying a very important and very desirable public 
policy objective with a very problematic, very unpopular and 
very indefensible objective. That is so often the case in 
legislation where two different matters are put together in a bill. 
Legislators are forced to swallow some unpalatable parts of the 
legislation in order to get the desirable ones.
<P>
	My colleague has given the House the opportunity to get what 
we need, which is better law enforcement and better punishment 
of criminal activity. It would deal in a more rational and sensible 
way with some of these proposals to get tough with law-abiding 
citizens and to interfere with their freedoms and their right to 
live their lives in a peaceful and uninterrupted manner.
<P>
	The justice minister made some rather interesting claims 
about the gun control portion of the legislation. I would like to 
examine those claims. I hope that members opposite will be 
quiet long enough to listen to what I have to say.
<P>
	First, the justice minister said that registration will improve 
safety for police by letting them know who owns firearms. The 
fact is that fully 96 per cent of guns involved in criminal activity 
are illegally obtained. Police do not know who owns these 
firearms because criminals do not register their guns. They are 
criminals. They are not operating within the law and they are not 
going to do it just because the justice minister thinks it would be 
nice if they did.
<P>
	Second, the justice minister claims that registration will 
combat smuggling by monitoring the types and quantities of 
firearms coming into Canada. Perhaps the justice minister, 
being a very educated man, could look at the dictionary. The 
dictionary defines smuggling as ``unmonitored and secret 
activity''. I fail to see why smugglers will register firearms. Will 
they say: ``We are smuggling these in and we will send you a list 
of what we are smuggling?'' That is a little ridiculous. I am sure 
that even members across the way can see the logic in that.
<P>
	Third, the justice minister claims that registration will 
improve public safety and only penalize criminals and those 
who fail to accept responsibility for gun ownership. The justice 
minister has been repeatedly asked but has never produced 
information to support his claims that registration of firearms 
will increase public safety and decrease the criminal use of 
firearms.
<P>
	If we could be safer with registration, every one of us would 
wholeheartedly enter into this activity. We have asked for this 
kind of evidence and we have asked for documentation to 
support this unfounded allegation made by the justice minister. 
If he has a shred of evidence, why does he not bring it forward? 
All he does is say that the association of police chiefs wants this. 
The association of police chiefs wants capital punishment to be 
reinstated. Is the justice minister going to accede to that request 
as well?
<P>
	This is an important issue and the justice minister should be 
putting forward the facts on which he is basing these allegations.
<P>
	The justice minister claims that registration will help police 
to enforce prohibition orders against individuals prohibited 
from owning a firearm. My colleagues have cited case after case 
where crimes have been perpetrated by people who have already 
been prohibited from owning firearms but are still using them. 
In fact, in Ottawa a few days ago that very situation took place.
<P>
	Plain, real life experience shows that the claims of the justice 
minister simply do not hold up. It is very important that we 
examine this in a common sense and rational manner. If we are 
going to make these kinds of claims and promises, they should 
stand up to real life scrutiny and they do not.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	The justice minister also claims that registration will ensure 
that owners of firearms store them safely and securely beyond 
the reach of thieves. Any responsible firearms owner has 
already been doing this for decades.
<P>
	Registration simply puts unwarranted restrictions and red 
tape on responsible, law-abiding, freedom loving citizens as a 
substitute for getting tough with criminals. This is simply 
unacceptable in our society.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11166"> 11166 </A></B>
<P>
	We have literally millions of firearms in our country. Every 
one of them under this scheme will have to be examined and 
registered. This will entail an enormous amount of paperwork 
and administrative time for our already overworked law 
enforcement agencies.
<P>
	We want these people out on the street. We want them 
responding to our calls for help. We want them to be there when 
we need them, not shuffling paper to make sure that all the hoops 
are jumped through, all the <I>p</I>s and <I>q</I>s are minded by people who 
have never committed a crime in their entire lives nor are they 
likely to.
<P>
	There is a real commitment in our country to democracy, to 
freedom, to individual rights. This kind of government 
intrusion, this kind of restriction on freedom, this type of 
interference in the way we order our lives, we own our property 
and manage it, is simply not warranted. It is simply not 
acceptable.
<P>
	I urge members of the House to put a stop to this nonsense by 
supporting the amendment, dealing with what should be dealt 
with and leaving law-abiding citizens alone.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
will follow up very quickly on what the hon. member for 
Calgary North said.
<P>
	I am very concerned that although we have asked the justice 
minister on many occasions to give us the evidence that shows 
that registration of guns will lead to a reduction in crime, each 
and every time he has used a phoney argument.
<P>
	He has tried to appeal to the authority of the police chiefs. The 
police chiefs are just offering their personal opinion as 
politicians, certainly not as experts in the field. We have given 
him instance after instance of other jurisdictions where gun 
control has been attempted, where registration has been 
attempted, not the least of which is Canada.
<P>
	I point that out to the hon. member for Kingston and the 
Islands. We have had the registration of handguns for 60 years 
and we still have an increase in the criminal misuse of handguns. 
That is a very powerful argument against the further registration 
of long guns.
<P>
	Also, we have pointed out what has happened in other 
jurisdictions around the world, such as Australia, where they 
have had to repeal the idea of the registration of guns because 
the system did not work. Let us not engage in emotional 
arguments about guns. Let us look at some of the evidence out 
there.
<P>
	The fact is that in other jurisdictions and in this jurisdiction 
gun registration has not been effective in controlling crime. If it 
had been, this party would be at the lead in promoting it but it 
has not. For that reason, we cannot support it.
<P>
	I also want to touch for a moment on the whole idea of 
personal responsibility. There is a concept that many people 
believe in very strongly, which is that if one is responsible for 
something then that person should  personally pay the 
consequences. In this legislation the government has stood that 
concept on its head. It said that if the bad guys do something bad 
then everybody should pay for it. That is what the legislation 
promotes.
<P>
	I urge Canadians around the country to write to the 
government and tell it that this is wrong-headed legislation.

	The House resumed from February 16 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-263, an act to amend the Financial 
Administration Act and other acts in consequence thereof 
(exempted crown corporations), be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is with great 
pleasure that I present the government's position on Bill C-263 
tabled by the hon. member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt. I will be speaking to this 
House about the International Development Research Centre, or 
IDRC as it is better known, and why it is and should remain 
exempt from the Financial Administration Act, or the FAA.
<P>
	It is with great pride that I tell you about this well respected 
Canadian organization in true Canadian form. It is one of our 
institutions that is better known outside this country than it is by 
the taxpayers who support it.
<P>
	IDRC was the first such institution in the world. Lester B. 
Pearson, a strong proponent of IDRC, was named as its first 
chairman. The centre was then copied in Sweden, set up as 
SAREC in 1975, and in the U.S.A., Australia, Germany and the 
Netherlands.
<P>
	The debates here and in the Senate showed there was strong 
agreement that IDRC should represent a new approach to 
relations with developing countries. The idea of the centre was 
to bring together Canadian and foreign experts on the problems 
of developing economies.
<P>
	During second reading the Hon. Mitchell Sharp, well known 
to everyone in Canada, who was then Secretary of State for 
External Affairs, pointed out that the centre would be ``a 
Canadian institution with an important international dimension. 
Both the board and staff will include specially qualified people 
from various parts of the world, including the developing 
countries. The centre will be structured so as to provide the best 
possible environment for creativity and problem solving''.
<P>
	Therein lies the reason why IDRC is not an agent of Her 
Majesty. Canadians must form the majority of its board 
members but the remainder is made up of prominent residents of 
developing countries. The current board members include Sir 
Sridath Ramphal, former Secretary-General of the 
Commonwealth, and Dr. Miguel de la Madrid, former President 
of Mexico. It would be very difficult for non-Canadian 
governors to serve, without a conflict of allegiance, an 
institution which was an agent of Her Majesty.
<P>
	The importance of having staff from outside Canada is the 
reason the employees are not members of the public service. To 
this date the centre's staff comprises many scientists from 
developing countries. These bring to the centre's work a unique 
knowledge and appreciation of local conditions which is 
essential to finding practical and useful results. If its staff were 
to join the public service, it would become extremely difficult to 
recruit scientists in developing countries.
<P>
	Now we come to the thrust of Bill C-263, the question of 
IDRC's exemption from the FAA. When the centre was created 
the parliamentary subcommittee reviewing the bill noted in its 
report that there was concern that there be ``a reasonable 
measure of accountability for the use of public funds''. At the 
same time it was  recognized that ``an essential prerequisite for

such an institution is that it be fully free to exercise purely 
professional standards of prominence and integrity''.
<P>
	The report went on to say that ``constant vigilance will be 
required to protect the independence and integrity of the centre. 
The object will be advanced by the diversification of the sources 
of financial support and this should be a high priority for the 
governors''.
<P>
	Throughout its existence, IDRC has used its exemption from 
the FAA to enable it to seek financial support from diverse 
sources, something which it has had some success in doing. 
However in the current climate of government fiscal restraint, 
IDRC has made it a priority within the centre to reduce its 
dependency on the public purse by raising and leveraging 
resources from organizations outside Canada: multilateral and 
bilateral institutions and private not for profit foundations. 
Many of these, because of their mandates, would be unable to 
provide funds to the receiver general of a developed country.
<P>
	In other words, by putting IDRC under the FAA which the 
member wants to do in his bill, we would make it more reliant on 
government funding and limit its ability to diversify its revenue 
resources. I am sure this was not the intention of my esteemed 
colleague when he tabled this bill.
<P>
	This exemption from the FAA does not mean that the IDRC is 
unaccountable. On the contrary, IDRC is accountable to the 
Parliament of Canada. Its transactions are audited annually by 
the Auditor General of Canada who has also just completed a 
second value for money audit undertaken at the centre's request.
<P>
	The centre's annual report is tabled in Parliament and the 
centre's chairperson and president frequently appear before 
House of Commons committees. I know I cannot use props but I 
do have the International Development Research Centre's 
annual report for 1993-94 if any member is interested in 
obtaining a copy.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	I have just returned from Montevideo where I visited the 
regional office of IDRC. I also have a copy of its annual report 
which is available to any member who wishes to study it.
<P>
	The current status allows for flexibility and enables the centre 
to move with great speed when political situations change, as 
they did in South Africa, Vietnam, Ukraine and who knows, 
maybe Burundi in the future.
<P>
	IDRC's work at implementing sustainable development was 
given a positive mention in the special joint committee review 
of Canada's foreign policy. Its performance was rated highly by 
the National Advisory Board on Science and Technology's 
review of science and technology in Canada.
<P>
	IDRC's flexibility has brought enormous benefits to Canada 
and the developing world. The centre is seen internationally as a 
dynamic, knowledge based and results oriented organization 
which has helped improve the  lives of people in developing 
countries. It is particularly suited to these times of considerable 
change and constant upheaval.
<P>
	I could refer to many examples of the outstanding work of 
IDRC but I know my time is limited. However, I would like to 
share a few examples with the House.
<P>
	Members may have heard of the fog catcher in Chile. Peter 
Gzowski on ``Morningside'' a month ago and the extremely 
influential British magazine <I>The Economist</I> in January had 
stories describing this IDRC technology which is bringing clean 
drinking water to the poor people of a Chilean village. It is now 
being introduced in neighbouring Peru and Ecuador. It has the 
potential to bring water to many other communities in Africa, 
the Middle East and Asia.
<P>
	In this its 25th year, IDRC and Canadians who have supported 
it have much to be proud of. IDRC is a leading Canadian agency 
for research and innovation, an area this government regards as 
key to our future growth. Its work benefits not only people in 
developing countries but also people here in Canada.
<P>
	I visited the IDRC regional centre in Uruguay just two weeks 
ago and held a round table meeting with the regional director, 
the staff and the researchers. I learned how the work of IDRC in 
developing countries provides information, technology, 
goodwill and knowledge that can lead to business opportunities 
for Canadians at home or in those countries.
<P>
	I also learned that the IDRC can contribute in a unique way in 
helping economies in transition to prepare for a market economy 
and build ties to Canada. IDRC's assets in this regard are its in 
house expertise and its international network of experts in this 
field.
<P>
	IDRC helps emerging economies tap Canadian scientific and 
technological expertise and establish links with Canadian 
researchers and the private sector. This was the case, for 
example, in IDRC's work in Vietnam, China, Singapore, 
Pakistan and India.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to reiterate that IDRC's exemption 
from the FAA has served it and Canada well. Removing this 
exemption would make it difficult for the centre to raise revenue 
from sources outside Canada. It would make it less flexible. It 
would thus hinder its fine work and would limit the international 
component of the centre.
<P>
	When we have a good institution, a uniquely Canadian 
institution, why change it? For these reasons and others, the 
government does not support Bill C-263.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the bill 
before the House today, Bill C-263, an act to amend the 
Financial Administration Act and other acts in consequence 
thereof, deals with exempted crown corporations, and is, in the 
opinion of the Bloc Quebecois, entirely useless, and we will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11172"> 11172 </A></B>
<P>
therefore vote against this bill. Let me take a few minutes to 
explain.
<P>
	There are nearly 50 crown corporations in Canada in various 
economic sectors across the country. These crown corporations 
employ around 115,000 people. In 1992-93, the government 
spent a little over $4.5 billion through parliamentary votes on 
these corporations. Their impact on the country's economy is 
therefore very substantial.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	The Financial Administration Act, Part X, sets the 
management framework for crown corporations. These 
corporations are responsible for producing certain documents, 
since they are accountable to Parliament through their minister. 
Every crown corporation must submit a corporate plan annually 
to the department and every corporation must also submit an 
operating budget for approval by Treasury Board.
<P>
	Every corporation must also produce an annual report 
containing financial statements as well as accounting data. They 
must also proceed with internal audits to ensure that assets are 
protected and that operations conform to the regulations. In 
addition to the obligation to produce documents, a special audit 
must be conducted at least every five years by an in-house 
auditor, to determine whether the corporations develop and 
implement sound management practices.
<P>
	Consequently, crown corporations are subject to very strict 
and very specific rules. However, not all corporations are 
subject to Part X. In fact, the Act contains a number of 
exemptions, including the Bank of Canada, the Canadian Wheat 
Board, to which the hon. member referred earlier, and the 
International Development Research Centre, but he forgot to say 
that votes had been cut in this sector. The same applies to the 
Canada Council, the National Arts Centre Corporation, the 
Canadian Film Development Corporation-here again, the 
government has slashed the budgets-and of course the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which we discussed last 
week.
<P>
	These corporations were exempted because in 1984, it was 
felt that it was necessary to protect their arm's length 
relationship with the government. The bill before the House 
today wants to do the opposite, except in the case of two 
corporations, and I am referring to the CBC and the Bank of 
Canada. I will get back to this later on. These corporations are 
under no obligation to produce a corporate plan or to be 
accountable for their results, and they are under no obligation to 
carry out internal or special audits. Bill C-263 is intended to 
eliminate exemptions from the application of divisions I to IV, 
and thus from the obligations I mentioned earlier.
<P>
	This bill does not, however, affect the Bank of Canada or the 
CBC. In fact, the CBC is already subject to accountability. Why 
should we impose additional rules on the CBC or other 
corporations, through further legislation? And of course that is 
why the Bank of Canada and the CBC are not part of the group. 
As far as the Bank of Canada is concerned, the position seems to 
be that the arm's length relationship of the Bank of  Canada to 
the government could be affected, and that is the reason for 
excluding them.
<P>
	This position, in other words, the arm's length relationship to 
the government, is not as strong in other cases where political 
interference would not have the same impact. So there is an 
attempt to open the door to patronage. This bill goes too far in 
terms of controlling the administration of these corporations. It 
would subject the five crown corporations to close supervision 
involving both their accountability and control over their 
management. Instead, why not make them more accountable?
<P>
	Since 1985, the Financial Administration Act has been 
amended 58, yes 58 times, which means an average of once 
every two months. I understand very well that the aim of the 
changes over the years was to keep in tune with and to adjust to 
the so-called changing environment. But 58 times? Think of all 
the time wasted.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	People then wonder why Quebec wants to become sovereign. 
What choice is there when Quebecers see their federal 
government being inconsistent to the point of wanting to amend 
legislation every two months.
<P>
	Would it not be smarter to take the more flexible approach, 
proposed in 1991 by the auditor general in his annual report, of 
incorporating into the legislation the legislator's undertakings? 
It would also be a good idea to see, after analysis, how best to 
provide for accountability and a level of control in each 
corporation, in keeping with its particular mandate and mission.
<P>
	It would be much wiser, indeed, to make these corporations 
accountable by giving them more responsibility instead, I 
repeat, instead of controlling them as the bill proposes.
<P>
	It is important to give officials in crown corporations more 
responsibility in all areas. Why? To make them accountable to 
Parliament and thus enable us to more fairly and better evaluate 
their individual performances.
<P>
	This bill accords the same status to all crown corporations, 
which should not be the case. This bill also gives the minister the 
power to meddle in the policies of crown corporations that have 
a cultural mandate, when they should have more discretionary 
authority in their respective areas.
<P>
	The comments of the auditor general can help us significantly 
on this. I therefore say simply that, with regard to staffing, these 
crown corporations will no longer be able, once the bill is 
adopted, to recruit employees with training in the disciplines 
they require. I do not understand why the government, which cut 
45,000 jobs in the public service in its latest budget, is trying to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11173"> 11173 </A></B>
<P>
prevent crown corporations from obtaining qualified people 
from outside the public service.
<P>
	I repeat; this bill is not needed, and we will of course be voting 
against it.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
delighted to have the opportunity to participate in this debate on 
Bill C-263, an act to amend the Financial Administration Act.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to subject five crown corporations to 
the provisions of Part X of the FAA. Three of these crown 
corporations, the Canada Council, the Canadian Film 
Development Corporation and the National Arts Centre 
Corporation are accountable to Parliament through the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Crown corporations are vehicles permitting the government 
to reach goals which are in the public interest when it is 
necessary to distance the crown from the management of 
day-to-day operations. Each crown corporation has an enabling 
act which loosely defines its functions, powers and objectives.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Parliament legislates the general governance of crown 
corporations and the allocation of public funds to individual 
crown corporations. Parliament votes the estimates to which 
operating subsides, loans and advances are made to the crown 
corporations.
<P>
	The main estimates of the Canadian heritage portfolio are 
annually submitted to the Standing Committee on Canadian 
Heritage for review. In conjunction with this review, heads of 
crown corporations may be called before the standing 
committee to make presentations and reply to questions from 
committee members. The committee examines the financial 
resources provided to these crowns and their plans on spending 
these resources.
<P>
	Part X of the FAA outlines the control and accountability 
framework for crown corporations subject to this section. The 
framework entails the following six elements. The preparation 
of a corporate plan for the approval of the the Treasury Board 
and the governor in council; the tabling of a corporate plan 
summary in Parliament; a requirement to disclose in their 
annual reports the extent to which certain objectives have been 
achieved; the use of generally accepted accounting principles in 
the preparation of financial statements; the undertaking of 
internal audits or the establishment of internal audit committees 
as well as a requirement to undergo special examinations by the 
Auditor General of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	These agencies have been exempted from part X because of 
the need to protect the special nature of their relationship to the 
government, that is, a degree of independence from political and 
bureaucratic control.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This means that the government does not interfere with the 
day to day management decisions of these organizations. The 
government, nevertheless, is responsible for developing 
detailed policies on issues of national importance and must be 
able to keep the paths followed by crown corporations in line 
with the government's main game plan. This arm's length 
relationship should not prevent these organizations from being 
fully accountable to government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In this vein the exempt crown corporations in the Canadian 
heritage portfolio follow the control and accountability regime 
outlined in their enabling legislation and many have chosen to 
voluntarily adopt a number of the key accountability provisions 
of part X of the FAA.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Founded in 1957, the Canada Council promotes and 
encourages the study, appreciation and production of works of 
art. It also co-ordinates UNESCO's Canadian operations and 
Canada's participation in that organization's operations abroad.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	With the assistance of the Canada Council, Canadian artists 
and cultural institutions have played an integral role in 
developing a strong Canadian cultural fabric recognized at 
home and abroad, have fostered a deeper awareness of our 
history and have bestowed on us new visions of possible futures.
<P>
	The Canadian Film Development Corporation, now more 
commonly known as Telefilm Canada was established in 1967. 
Its mandate is to foster and promote the orderly growth of an 
independent film and television industry in all regions of 
Canada through investment and financing of the development, 
the production, the marketing and the distribution of Canadian 
motion pictures and television productions. It also administers 
Canada's co-production treaties with foreign countries and 
assists with foreign marketing and the promotion of Canadian 
productions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Telefilm Canada is a veritable economic and cultural pillar in 
the Canadian film and television industries. As a key investor in 
these industries, Telefilm has forged a strong partnership with 
Canadian film and television professionals, participating in all 
aspects of production.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11174"> 11174 </A></B>
<P>
	Over the years, Telefilm has gained worldwide acclaim for its 
expert production, distribution and marketing support of 
Canadian productions of cultural importance. Canadian 
companies count on Telefilm for many different kinds of 
financial support. In fact, the works financed by Telefilm 
Canada produce an economic spinoff of close to $300 million 
each year.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The National Arts Centre, which opened in 1969, arranges for 
and sponsors performing arts activities at the centre in the 
national capital region, across Canada and abroad, as well as 
radio and television broadcasts of performances at the centre. 
The NAC plays an important role in the development of the 
Canadian performing arts.
<P>
	As such, the centre strives to develop new works and new 
talents as well as develop audiences for the arts in Canada by 
showcasing the finest Canadian and international works and 
talents and to foster the development and touring of Canadian 
music, theatre and dance.
<P>
	As a group, the three exempt crown corporations encourage 
the creation, production, distribution and consumption of 
cultural goods and services which are essential to Canada's 
identity as a country. They comply either with their enabling 
legislation or voluntarily with several of the key accountability 
provisions of part X of the FAA including the following 
measures. All utilize generally accepted accounting principles 
in the preparation of their financial statements. The auditor 
general audits these financial statements to ensure that the 
accounts and statements are a fair representation of the financial 
position of these organizations.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	Each organization's board has established an audit committee 
which reviews and advises the board on its financial statements, 
reviews its accounting procedures and internal controls, 
oversees any internal audits undertaken, reviews and advises the 
council on reports from the auditor general and reviews any 
corrective measures implemented as a result of audits.
<P>
	Each organization prepares an annual report which is tabled in 
Parliament. This document offers to central agencies, 
parliamentarians and the general public alike valuable 
information concerning each organization's activities and the 
important roles they play.
<P>
	Each organization prepares planning documents which 
outline missions, issues, objectives and strategies for a specific 
planning period. These documents contain information similar 
to that which would appear in a corporate plan required by part X 
of the FAA.
<P>
	The government strongly supports the principle of effective 
accountability of crown corporations to government. The 
challenge before us is to ensure that an appropriate balance is 
struck between accountability of crown corporations to 
Parliament and the public demand  for how these crown 
corporations spend public moneys, and the essential autonomy 
of these organizations to operate without interference from 
government on issues such as artistic merit and taste.
<P>
	The accountability regimes which the Canada Council, 
Telefilm and the NAC follow, either in compliance with their 
enabling legislation or through voluntary compliance with 
several of the key accountability provisions of part X of the 
FAA, are strong evidence that the balance between 
accountability and autonomy can be achieved.
<P>
	Indeed, in his 1991 report the then Auditor General noted that 
he was not aware of any accountability problems in the exempt 
crown corporations that might have been avoided if they were 
subject to part X.
<P>
	The proposed bill by the Reform, as tabled, unfortunately 
would not provide the exempt crown corporations with adequate 
protection from directive power from the government. The 
arm's length relationship of these crown corporations and the 
government is a hallmark of Canada's cultural tradition, one we 
wish to maintain. Moreover, the bill would bring more 
employees into the public service at a time of fiscal restraint and 
downsizing.
<P>
	Notwithstanding the shortcomings of the bill, in the light of 
the government's commitment to the accountability of crown 
corporations, I want to inform the House that the government 
intends to work with the exempt crown corporations to ensure an 
appropriate accountability regime.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
gives me great pleasure to rise in the House today to speak to 
Bill C-263, an act to amend the Financial Administration Act.
<P>
	The bill is about a non-partisan issue, one of which we as 
members of the 35th Parliament should be keenly aware, and 
that is accountability. Accountability is what Canadians want 
from their governments, from their elected officials and the 
institutions which they fund. The last government failed in 
many areas, but one area that really disturbed the voters was the 
lack of accounting for funds spent in the name of the taxpayer. 
That government paid the price for its failings, so I feel 
confident that this mistake will not be repeated by current 
members and changes will be made in the way we conduct the 
nation's business.
<P>
	The bill does not require anything of the crown corporations 
listed other than the standard of accountability imposed on most 
government operations. All that we are asking for is a corporate 
plan, a budget summary and an annual report.
<P>
	As a small businessman I can tell the House that without a 
business plan, proper accounting and auditing, any business is 
doomed to fail. We are not dealing with a small business though, 
we are dealing with the nation's biggest business and its 
funding. It comes in trust from  the Canadian taxpayer. We have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11175"> 11175 </A></B>
<P>
a moral obligation to ensure that these funds are spent as wisely 
as possible.
<P>
	The Canada Council is one of the affected agencies in the 
proposed legislation. As a granting council, budgeting should be 
a fairly simple and non-controversial matter. A corporate plan, 
setting out the corporate vision, objectives and a timetable for 
meeting those objectives are fundamental to the proper 
operation of a granting council. Without such a business plan 
businesses fall apart. Without such a plan the granting council 
leaves itself open to be captured by special interest groups. A 
gap forms in accountability between an organization and those 
who fund it and the taxpayers feel disenfranchised.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	Perhaps this is part of the real problem with the Canada 
Council. With no ongoing vision, plan or objective, special 
interests are able to find a measure of control in deciding who or 
what is worthy of funding. This can be the only explanation for 
the council to even consider giving $10,000 to the Writers Union 
of Canada for its ``Writing through Race'' conference in 
Vancouver last year. The conference openly discriminated 
against a segment of our society on the basis of race, and it did so 
with public money.
<P>
	Robert Fulford wrote at the time: ``The idea of the Writers 
Union reinventing apartheid for any purpose would have been 
beyond belief''. Unbelievably, when the issue broke in the 
media, associate director of the council, Brian Anthony, dared to 
defend the grant. He said that support to such conferences that 
seek solutions to the problem of systemic barriers, whether they 
be gender, cultural, artistic or race related, is an essential step in 
bridging the gap between artists and the public.
<P>
	These are not the viewpoints of the Parliament of Canada and 
they are not contained in the statutes that created the Canada 
Council. However there is no holding the council to account for 
this outrageous action.
<P>
	A further example of waste at the council came to light last 
week when it was revealed that the agency's director is receiving 
a $1,300 a monthly stipend in addition to his generous salary 
which is something between $110,000 and $130,000. The 
allowance in lieu of moving costs is given to the director 
because he lives in Montreal and commutes to Ottawa to work. 
My suggestion to the heritage minister is to find a bureaucrat 
who is willing to move to Ottawa and so save the taxpayers some 
hard earned dollars.
<P>
	I was interested to find that the council receives $98.4 million 
from federal taxpayers each year. Believing that the council was 
a granting agency, I was shocked to learn that of the 98.4 million 
in tax dollars, the council spends $21 million on administration. 
It would appear that the 248 full time cheque writers at the 
council have managed to create quite a bureaucracy since it was 
formed in 1957.
<P>
	Accountability to Parliament over the years might have 
prevented the current situation from developing and could help 
the organization to downsize efficiently along with the rest of 
government as the recent budget requires. A clear corporate 
vision with financial accountability would help to avoid the 
paper shuffling and internal policy development that now go on.
<P>
	There has been a great deal of controversy surrounding the 
purchase of some paintings at the National Gallery recently. A 
few of the paintings were reported to be worth millions of 
dollars, even though they appear simplistic to the untrained eye. 
The question many have asked me because of the controversy is: 
Were the paintings a waste of tax dollars? The debate that 
follows usually centres around a question of how art is defined.
<P>
	According to the Canada Council Act the object of the council 
is to foster and promote the study and enjoyment of the arts. I 
believe part of the answer about how art is defined is found in 
the following phrase. The key word is enjoyment. If Canadians 
do not like it, if they get angry and upset that their tax dollars are 
frittered away on such items, enjoyment is lost.
<P>
	If my constituents come back from Ottawa upset after a visit 
to the National Gallery, how can we say that value for their 
money was achieved? We certainly cannot justify it by the 
statute definition because they felt resentment and not 
enjoyment as the law requires.
<P>
	Many proponents of art try to brush off these criticisms and 
suggest that people such as my constituents simply do not 
understand art. While this may or may not be true, it is not 
relevant to whether such art should be funded by tax dollars. If a 
large majority of my constituents believe that our scarce tax 
dollars would be better spent on medical research, national 
defence or policing, I am happy to support their position.
<P>
	The Reform Party has developed a policy on cultural 
industries that will affect the Canada Council, the National 
Gallery and other arts bodies. The Reform Party will promote 
the freedom of the Canadian cultural community to develop and 
grow without needless protection and government regulation, 
encouraging a free cultural market that offers choice while 
lowering cost to consumers as services are provided by the 
sectors that are able to do so most cost effectively. This is our 
vision of how culture should develop.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	Our vision of a new and better Canada allows Canadians to 
use their own judgment in picking winners and losers in the 
cultural marketplace. This already happens to a large extent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11176"> 11176 </A></B>
<P>
	If we look at the Canadian television industry we see two 
private national broadcasters that both manage to make a profit 
most years. Then we have the CBC which is mortgaged to the 
hilt and costs over $1 billion a year. The major reason two are 
winners and one is a loser is based on incentives or lack of them. 
The winners must produce programming its audiences want to 
see. The loser can produce whatever it wants and then forget all 
about the consumer because it already has its funding kindly 
appropriated by Parliament.
<P>
	Reform policy would place the government sponsored loser in 
a situation where subsidies are weaned away and the future of 
the company is based on consumer satisfaction.
<P>
	I received a card a few weeks ago, as did all MPs, that asked 
me to imagine Canada without musicians, painters, writers and 
other artists. The card implied that without the Canada Council 
we would lack culture and imagination.
<P>
	Canadians have culture and imagination in spite of the Canada 
Council. Our art galleries, theatres, music halls and libraries are 
full of examples of Canadian culture and imagination that 
existed long before the Canada Council was ever conceived. No 
grants were handed out prior to 1957 yet artists have flourished 
in Canada for centuries.
<P>
	I was elected on a platform of accountability. I promised my 
constituents I would represent their concerns before all other 
considerations. I also promised to help put in place the kind of 
democratic reforms that would hold myself and other elected 
officials accountable to the people who elect them. If Parliament 
is to be responsible about spending tax dollars I believe there 
must be a direct accounting from all those who receive funding.
<P>
	The Canadian taxpayer is demanding accountability. The bill 
moves us in that direction and I ask all members for their 
support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I too 
am pleased to speak on Bill C-263, an act to amend the Financial 
Administration Act and other acts in consequence thereof, 
especially with respect to exempted crown corporations.
<P>
	The bill as presented would remove exemptions from the 
application of divisions I to IV of part X of the Financial 
Administration Act for five crown corporations, the 
corporations being the Canada Council, the Canadian Film 
Development Corporation, Canadian Wheat Board, 
International Development Research Centre and the National 
Arts Centre Corporation.
<P>
	I believe all members agree that part X was designed to 
achieve an appropriate system of accountability and control for 
all crown corporations. The need for such a system was 
highlighted by the auditor general in his 1979 and 1982 annual 
reports to the House. The Auditor General reports noted that 
three main parties effectively participated in the corporate 
accountability process:  Parliament, government and the boards 
of directors and senior management of the entity involved.
<P>
	Part X clearly establishes that corporate management was 
empowered to be responsible for acting in the best interest of the 
corporation and its day to day operations. At the same time part 
X ensures that shareholders' rights and objectives are duly 
considered.
<P>
	Increasing globalization of trade and recessionary forces have 
pressured both private sector and crown corporations to be more 
competitive and efficient. Additionally crown corporations 
must also achieve the public policy objectives for the reason that 
their statutory mandates remain respective of taxpayers' 
dollars.
<P>
	The government recognizes that crown corporations served 
the public interest in a business environment. They are expected 
to use the best available private sector business practices and in 
practicality are treated in the same manner as private sector 
firms.
<P>
	Having rules to govern accountability is one way to cement 
the expectation. These rules also make roles very clear.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Until 1983-84, the Financial Administration Act did not 
clearly specify these roles. Because of the resulting lack of 
co-ordination, it was impossible to ensure effective control or 
properly account for certain activities such as the creation of 
new crown corporations and making financial commitments for 
which, in the end, the government would be responsible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In 1984 the Financial Administration Act was amended to 
address these shortcomings and part X as we know it came into 
existence.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Under part X, a crown corporation annually submits a 
corporate plan specifying all its projects and operations, 
including its investments and those of affiliates of which it is the 
sole shareholder. The crown corporation must describe the 
mandate of the corporation, its objectives for the duration of the 
plan and the strategy for achieving those objectives. It is also 
required to do a comparative study of projected results and 
annual objectives.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Corporate plans of crown corporations subject to part X 
require annual approval by the governor in council. 
Corporations may not carry on any new business or activity that 
is not consistent with an approved plan.
<P>
	As well, once a corporate plan receives approval its summary 
must also be tabled in Parliament by the appropriate minister. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11177"> 11177 </A></B>
<P>
This element of planning and planning approval was regarded as 
a progressive part of part X of the system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This accountability framework was not ideal for all crown 
corporations. The 1984 legislation contained exceptions which 
may be found in subsection 85(1) of the Financial 
Administration Act. Under this subsection, seven crown 
corporations are not subject to part X.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Along with the five corporations mentioned in Bill C-263, 
subsection 85(1) includes the Bank of Canada and the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation. In addition, the legislation that has 
been passed but not yet proclaimed would create another crown 
corporation exempt from part X, the Canadian Race Relations 
Foundation.
<P>
	The grounds for exemption are significant and relate to the 
uniqueness of corporate mandates. The 1984 inclusion of the 
CBC was due to its uniqueness as a corporation. It required 
arm's length protective measures although not from the rules of 
good planning and accountability but from the possibility of 
political interference in the actual day to day business choices.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Subsequently, in 1991, amendments to the Broadcasting Act 
integrated many elements of part X in the legislation governing 
the CBC, while maintaining the arm's length position of the 
corporation. The auditor general felt this was a step in the right 
direction, since he had expressed his concern about the 
exemption.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Some of the remaining exemptions follow certain part X rules 
on a voluntary basis. Progress in accountability has been made 
outside part X. Bill C-263 is well intentioned. Although there 
may be merit in bringing other exemptions under a modified 
form of accountability framework similar to the part X regime, I 
suggest that additional work be done first.
<P>
	For example, Bill C-263 contains the provision that 
employees of the National Arts Centre, Canada Council and 
International Development Research Centre become members 
of the public service.
<P>
	Why does the bill aim to increase the size of the public 
service? Bill C-263 has clearly not addressed all the issues. The 
bill does not respect the fact that corporate independence in 
certain sensitive areas needs to be protected.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the past, it was felt that it was necessary to maintain 
corporate independence and to avoid excessive controls as 
opposed to providing for an acceptable accountability 
framework.
<P>
	For instance, the museums, which are crown corporations, are 
subject to the provisions on accountability in part X. However, 
under the museum's enabling legislation, no guidelines may be 
imposed that would affect their decisions on the acquisition and 
dispersal of works in their collections.
<P>
	Similarly, one cannot impose guidelines on the CBC that 
would encroach on its journalistic freedom.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Specific wording in section 27 of the museums legislation 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No directive shall be given under section 89 or subsection 114(3) of the 
<I>Financial Administration Act</I> with respect to cultural activities, including</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) the acquisition, disposal, conservation or use of any museum material 
relevant to its activities;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) its activities and programs for the public, including exhibitions, displays 
and publications; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) research with respect to the matters referred to-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1900 ) </B>
<P>
	I ask if there are better ways to ensure accountability for those 
crown corporations named in this bill.
<P>
	Subject areas such as auditing, corporate governance, 
financial management and control, corporate planning, 
reporting to Parliament and borrowing plans have been 
thoroughly addressed in part X of the Financial Administration 
Act. It has resulted in a system which according to the Auditor 
General is working well.
<P>
	This system does not rule out modifications which are 
prepared to meet the specific circumstances of the majority of 
exempt crown corporations. Whether this is best achieved 
through one bill or through a series of amendments to existing 
statutes for each crown corporation is something we may need to 
further explore.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In concluding, I am convinced that every effort will be made 
to achieve the ideal combination of accountability and the arm's 
length relationship enjoyed by crown corporations that are 
exempted, and that Canadians will continue to consider this to 
be in the public interest.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In closing, I cannot recommend support for this bill, despite 
its valiant effort.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
to speak on Bill C-263 sponsored by my colleague from 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt regarding bringing five 
crown corporations under part X of the Financial 
Administration Act. These five crown corporations are the 
Canada Council, the Canadian Film Development Corporation, 
the Canadian Wheat Board, the International Development 
Research Centre and the National Arts Centre Corporation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11178"> 11178 </A></B>
<P>
	Why would my colleague suggest that they come under part 
X? It is because part X of the Financial Administration Act 
requires a corporation to submit an annual report, a corporate 
plan, and budget summaries to be tabled in Parliament. It seems 
fairly simple to me that we would want to have that information 
from crown corporations. Therefore, it seems perfectly 
reasonable that we would want to put them under part X of the 
act.
<P>
	The section also allows the Auditor General of Canada to 
conduct special examinations once every five years. A special 
examination is a value for money audit. There are auditors in 
these crown agencies and external auditors, but it is only the 
Auditor General of Canada who does value for money audits. 
When we are spending money by the billions in this country, a 
lot of it being wasted, it sure is good for Parliament and 
Canadians to know that somebody is taking a look at these crown 
corporations to find out if we get value for our money.
<P>
	I have just come from a public accounts committee meeting. 
Every time a department or crown corporation comes before us 
we find that management has been lackadaisical and unfocused. 
We find there is no real commitment to maximizing the benefits 
for the money which has been spent. Therefore, I cannot think of 
any better thing than bringing them under part X of the Financial 
Administration Act, even if it is only to get a value for money 
audit once every five years.
<P>
	This bill will bring greater accountability for taxpayers' 
dollars. It would ensure that Canadians achieved value for their 
money.
<P>
	I understand and I have heard from members on the other side 
that these corporations are exempted because they are cultural 
crown corporations and they need independence but I cannot 
buy that argument. The fact that they are involved in the cultural 
aspects of our society is absolutely no reason whatsoever that 
they be exempted from good management, fiscal responsibility 
and accountability both to this House and to the Canadian 
people. Therefore, there is no valid reason whatsoever that they 
should not be included in part X of the act.
<P>
	I do understand that there are two crown corporations that are 
also exempt from part X of the act. The private member's bill 
does not require them to be brought under part X.
<P>
<B>(1905 ) </B>
<P>
	One is the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and it is 
already subject to similar requirements of part X under the 
Canadian Broadcasting Act. The other one is the Bank of 
Canada. Of course, we know it is absolutely vital that the central 
bank maintain its independence which is critical for the proper 
conduct of monetary policy. There is no doubt that we can leave 
these two corporations exempt and bring the other five in to 
obtain this greater accountability.
<P>
	There were 42 other crown corporations included under the 
Financial Administration Act in 1984 and it certainly has not 
done them any harm. I understand it has resulted in improved 
management. Of course, the whole argument being put forward 
here is improved management and greater accountability. In 
1993 the auditor general stated that the requirements for 
planning, strategy and cost systems resulted in improved 
management practices for these non-exempted crown 
corporations.
<P>
	The auditor general also supports the idea of greater 
accountability. If I may quote from his 1991 report, section 
4.100, he said: ``The office strongly supported the strengthened 
legislative framework for crown corporations, and it is 
continually urged that those crown corporations that were 
exempted from part X of the FAA be brought into line with its 
accountability provisions. It is important that Parliament have 
assurances that appropriate accountability provisions apply to 
all crown corporations. When exemptions are granted, means 
should be found to ensure adequate control and accountability''.
<P>
	More recently the finance minister stated: ``The operations of 
various other cultural agencies, commissions or corporations 
will be reviewed to reflect tighter fiscal circumstances''. That 
was a quote from the 1995 budget, page 104. When the Minister 
of Finance calls for greater accountability, I cannot think of any 
greater way he could achieve that than to support this private 
member's bill.
<P>
	We listen to the government side giving us all the reasons it 
should not be. There are all the reasons from the Bloc because it 
is culture and therefore it should be exempt from all kinds of 
examination allowing them to do whatever they want as far as 
Quebec is concerned. We therefore need to have the 
accountability for Canadians that they deserve. They are the 
ones who put up the money. They are the ones who have to dig 
deeper and deeper every year so that these crown corporations 
can spend money on culture.
<P>
	Remember back to the big outrage we had in the National Art 
Gallery a few years ago with the ``Voice of Fire''. A couple of 
million dollars was spent for a piece of canvas painted red and 
blue. Or was it red and white? Or red and green? I cannot 
remember. It made a great impact upon me.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Yellow and green.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Yellow and green. I think we will have to take 
a vote on this. It seems that I do remember red. These are the 
types of things the Canadian public want to know about.
<P>
	Accountability cannot be oversold in this day and age, when 
we have a debt of $550 billion and a Minister of Finance who 
adopts a policy of gradualism to deal with a budgetary crisis. I 
<P>

<B><A NAME="11179"> 11179 </A></B>
<P>
think this bill has to be supported. It should be supported 
because it makes sense.
<P>
	The Auditor General talks about accountability. The Minister 
of Finance talks about accountability. The Reform Party talks 
about accountability. Surely, we should get all kinds of 
co-operation and perhaps even all-party support on this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
my pleasure to speak this evening on the bill presented by the 
hon. member for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt.
<P>
	I believe wholeheartedly, as do all of my colleagues I hope, 
that the objectives of the bill are well intended. I am in favour of 
ensuring that accountability for all of our crown corporations is 
adequate.
<P>
<B>(1910 ) </B>
<P>
	Before indicating whether or not this bill should be supported, 
I want to examine it objectively and in some detail. What we 
want is responsible accountability. This is a fairly technical bill.
<P>
	We are talking about a bill that has as its basic purpose the 
removal of exemption from application of divisions one to four 
of part X of the Financial Administration Act for five crown 
corporations. These are the Canada Council, the Canada Film 
Development Corporation, the Canadian Wheat Board, the 
International Development Research Centre and the National 
Arts Centre Corporation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The accountability framework set out in part X is widely 
viewed as being very well designed and progressive. However, it 
has some shortcomings where some crown corporations are 
concerned. The act passed in 1984, which first included part X, 
contained exemptions which are now found in subsection 85(1) 
of the FAA. This subsection exempts this crown corporation 
from the provisions of part X, which deals with operations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As I said earlier, this is not bedtime reading. It is a fairly 
technical bill. Along with the five corporations named in Bill 
C-263, two other crown corporations are exempt, the Bank of 
Canada and the CBC. In addition, legislation has been passed 
but not yet proclaimed that would create another crown 
corporation exempt from part X, the Canadian Race Relations 
Foundation.
<P>
	Perhaps when examining what Bill C-263 is trying to 
accomplish hon. members should also be willing to examine the 
grounds for exemption. Why were these particular crown 
corporations exempted from part X when others were not? This 
is an important fundamental question. While not found in any 
written or formal criteria or regulation, the reasons for 
exemption reflect some of the very special sensitivities in the 
relationship between the government and these particular 
corporations.
<P>
	I note that all of these corporations were created by special 
acts. All have mandates carefully specified in these acts and for 
some they involve administration of resources provided by third 
parties.
<P>
	The Canada Council as an example is mandated to foster and 
promote the study, enjoyment and production of works in the 
arts and to co-ordinate United Nations Educational, Scientific 
and Cultural Organization activities in Canada and Canadian 
participation in various UNESCO activities abroad. Part of its 
activities involve administering an educational fund created by 
its act and other funds established through private donations.
<P>
	Certain of these funds specify the payment of grants and 
scholarships in the arts field ``in such manner as the council 
shall determine''. Would contributors to these funds feel as 
comfortable if the Canada Council were not an independent 
crown corporation?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I believe that the hour reserved for consideration of this bill at 
this time is drawing to a close, so I will finish in the next hour of 
debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The time provided for 
the consideration of Private Members' Business has now 
expired. Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the order is dropped to 
the bottom of the order of precedence on the Order Paper and 
will come up again for a third hour.

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ROYALCANADIANMOUNTEDPOLICE">ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, on February 7, over 500 members of the RCMP 
marched for the first time in history here on Parliament Hill to 
denounce the attempt of the Liberal government to deny them 
their fundamental constitutional rights to free collective 
bargaining and in fact to even punish them for talking about 
collective bargaining.
<P>
<B>(1915 ) </B>
<P>
	The next day I asked a question in the House of the Solicitor 
General. I asked him to explain why the government intended to 
proceed with Bill C-58, legislation that would clearly deny the 
most basic rights of members of the RCMP.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="11180"> 11180 </A></B>
<P>
	At that time the minister stated that the bill does not add to the 
powers of the commissioner and it does not take anything away 
from members of the force.
<P>
	The bill has now gone to committee, has gone through 
committee and has been reported back to the House. What is 
very clear is that statement of the minister suggesting the bill 
does not take anything away from members of the RCMP is 
completely and utterly false.
<P>
	What the bill does very clearly is deny and override the effect 
of the 1994 judgment of the Federal Court in the Yvon Gingras 
decision. Pursuant to that decision it was clear RCMP 
employees are guaranteed certain rights under the Public 
Service Staff Relations Act. In other words, the commissioner of 
the RCMP was not free to simply rule arbitrarily with respect to 
all working conditions of members of the force.
<P>
	In addition there is a strong argument that part II of the 
Canada Labour Code, the provisions with respect to 
occupational health and safety, are guaranteed now prior to the 
bill to members of the RCMP.
<P>
	The effect of this legislation, this draconian bill, is to take 
away those existing rights. The bill may as well dramatically 
affect entitlement to other benefits, to other entitlements such as 
the bilingualism bonus which will now be completely 
discretionary.
<P>
	The current provisions of governing labour relations within 
the RCMP are totally unsatisfactory. The divisional staff 
relations representative system has been vigorously condemned 
by among others the E Division Members Association from 
British Columbia and the C Division. I want to pay tribute in 
particular to the president of the E Division Members 
Association, Michel Funicelli, and members of his executive.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would also like to pay tribute to Mr. Gaétan Delisle who has 
been fighting in Quebec for some time now for the rights of 
members of the RCMP stationed in that province.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Also the Canadian Police Association and its executive 
officer, Scott Newark, who have worked long and hard to expose 
this attack on the basic rights of members of the RCMP.
<P>
	I am calling today on the government to realize it has made a 
mistake, to come to its senses and to back off on this legislation, 
to allow members of the RCMP to make their own decisions 
about their future, about their labour relations.
<P>
	This bill would eliminate any possibility of third party 
intervention in employee-management relations. It would 
basically put all power in the hands of the commission. It is a 
bad bill. I call on the government to withdraw it now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway says Bill 
C-58 will if passed deny RCMP members collective bargaining 
rights.
<P>
	RCMP members have never had the legal authority to enter 
into collective bargaining. How can they possibly be denied 
these rights by the passage of this bill if the right is one they 
never had? He is misleading the Canadian public when he makes 
that statement. They have never had the right to engage in 
collective bargaining. Therefore they are not being denied these 
rights by this bill.
<P>
	Collective bargaining is not a natural or inherent right but a 
right granted by Parliament. Collective bargaining rights have 
never been extended to RCMP members under either the RCMP 
act, the Public Service Staff Relations Act or the Canada Labour 
Code.
<P>
	The Solicitor General has repeatedly said Bill C-58 has one 
purpose and one purpose only, to confirm the status quo that 
existed before the Gingras decision and with regard to the 
management of the RCMP.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member knows there are no points of 
order during the adjournment debate.
<P>
	That continues to be the case. Collective bargaining is a 
completely separate issue from Bill C-58 and would have to be 
looked at by both the government and Parliament as a separate 
matter. The RCMP already has its own labour-management 
forum for members to raise and discuss issues of concern 
regarding forced management.
<P>
	Created in 1974, the RCMP division staff relations 
representative, the DSRR program, was intended to respond to 
concerns expressed by members for greater involvement in 
management issues. That program has proved to be successful 
and workable-despite the assertions of the hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway-at which members at all levels can voice 
their opinions through representatives elected by the force's 
general membership across Canada, regardless of rank, category 
or grade.
<P>
<B>(1920) </B>
<P>
	Each division elects at least one full time representative and 
two part time representatives. These people met three times with 
the Solicitor General in the last 14 months. They continue to 
meet. The system works well and the RCMP members are 
represented well at those meetings with the Solicitor General.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INDIANAFFAIRS">INDIAN AFFAIRS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, for the past 16 months the Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development has been consulting with 
<P>

<B><A NAME="11181"> 11181 </A></B>
<P>
native leaders and native groups across Canada on the issue of 
native self-government.
<P>
	To date the minister has provided funding to national and 
regional native organizations in the amount of $5 million to 
assist these groups in preparing their briefs and input on the 
consultation process. The consultation was to last six months 
and culminate in a report on self-government.
<P>
	Last week, the national chief of the Assembly of First 
Nations, Ovide Mercredi, called a press conference to protest 
the minister's procrastination and to ask him to release a 
document that he said the minister was using in his meetings but 
keeping secret from the Assembly of First Nations and others.
<P>
	Chief Mercredi released copies redone from memory of the 
minister's document that Chief Mercredi was allowed to read 
and that the minister allowed to be read to a meeting with 
Alberta chiefs in Calgary.
<P>
	I am concerned with the minister using and allowing the 
contents of this still secret document in meetings and not being 
forthcoming with the House and Canadians on an issue that 
affects us all.
<P>
	On March 23 and again on March 24, I questioned the minister 
on the contents of the document. I asked him the nature of the 
document and why parliamentarians had to rely on the chief of 
the Assembly of First Nations to shed light on this undertaking 
and make the process public. The minister told the House on 
March 23 that it was not a secret document. If it is not a secret 
document, the minister should release it today.
<P>
	My further concern was with the delay in completing the 
projected six-month undertaking which has now run over 16 
months. I am concerned that the consultation on the inherent 
right to self-government does not become another aboriginal 
royal commission. That is now two years overdue and over 
budget with spending at $58 million from an original projected 
cost of between $8 and $12 million.
<P>
	I am not satisfied that my question of March 24, taken as 
notice by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs on behalf of 
the minister of Indian affairs, will prompt the minister and 
government to finalize its consultation on self-government and 
to release the contents of what the minister has called ``not a 
secret report'' to Parliament and the Canadian people rather than 
only to individual chiefs and the Assembly of First Nations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, 
Lib.):</B>
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I am pleased to respond on behalf of the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to the 
question raised by the member for North Island-Powell River 
on March 24, 1995. More specifically I wish to reply concerning 
the status of the so-called secret federal document on the 
inherent right of aboriginal self-government; the $5 million 
price tag  referred to by the hon. member; and finally when the 
federal government's consultations will conclude.
<P>
	First, I wish to comment on the $5 million referred to by the 
member. That is the amount of funding provided by the federal 
government in 1994-95 to some 69 aboriginal groups across 
Canada to support their participation in the inherent right 
consultation process.
<P>
	Second, the so-called secret document is personal speaking 
points that the minister is using in his discussions on the 
proposed general approach to the inherent right that federal 
ministers first set out in Quebec City in May 1994 at a meeting 
with their provincial and territorial counterparts and leaders of 
the national aboriginal associations.
<P>
	These discussion points are intended to continue the 
minister's consultations with the parties concerned, aboriginal 
people, provincial and territorial governments and third parties, 
on how to proceed. The minister has used them extensively in 
his recent meetings with those parties.
<P>
	The government has not yet taken any policy decisions. The 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development has 
clearly stated he wishes to ensure the views of all parties are 
considered before proceeding further. He has not picked a 
specific date for concluding his consultations. However, the 
minister has indicated he wishes to complete the consultations 
as quickly as possible. This will enable him to report back to his 
cabinet colleagues.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly, it being 7.26 p.m. the House 
stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing 
Order 24(1).
