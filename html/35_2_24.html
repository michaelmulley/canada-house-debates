	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-16, an act to amend the 
Contraventions Act and to make consequential amendments to 
other acts, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure for me to speak to Bill C-16, an act to amend the 
Contraventions Act. The amendments to this act are the result of 
consultations and discussions with the provinces.
<P>
	I would like to thank the critic for the Reform Party and the critic 
for the Bloc Quebecois for agreeing to expedite the proceedings of 
this bill and for treating it in a non-controversial fashion. I 
appreciate the co-operation.  The end result will be an effective and 
harmonious contraventions system throughout Canada.
<P>
	This bill is but another example which clearly demonstrates this 
government's willingness to work with its provincial partners and 
to avoid unnecessary duplication in federal and provincial 
activities.
<P>
	To understand the bill, it is important to understand the act which 
it amends. The Contraventions Act was given royal assent in 1992 
but it is not in force yet. It creates a contraventions scheme for 
federal offences. Currently those who are charged with an offence 
under federal statute or regulations are treated in the same way as 
those who are charged under the provisions of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	The Contraventions Act provides for the establishment of a 
contraventions scheme as an alternative procedure to the Criminal 
Code. It will permit enforcement authorities to issue tickets to 
persons who are charged with an offence designated as a 
contravention under the act. Individuals who wish to plead guilty 
and pay a fine could do so, thus avoiding a formal court process and 
a formal court appearance.
<P>
	There are three objectives to the contraventions scheme. The 
first is the decriminalization of certain federal offences. 
Decriminalization in effect means that a person convicted of a 
contravention will be subject to both civil and administrative 
sanctions without criminal stigma. Certain traditional criminal 
consequences of conviction such as finger printing, having a 
criminal record and being denied a passport will not apply.
<P>
	The second objective is to ease the court's workload. The courts 
are presently administering all federal regulatory offences. Taking 
most of these cases out of the court system will reduce costs. The 
defendant will still have the option of taking the matter of 
contravention to trial for a hearing.
<P>
	The final objective of the contraventions legislation is the 
improved enforcement of all federal regulations and legislation. It 
is much more efficient and effective to have enforcement 
authorities enforcing the law rather than spending a great deal of 
time testifying in courtrooms and getting ready for trial in order to 
bring a conviction.
<P>
	The Contraventions Act is a great tool to achieve compliance 
with rules that protect Canadians. The act and amendments which 
are before us are designed to provide Canadians with a fairer, more 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1408"> 1408 </A></B>
<P>
efficient and more  practical process for federal offences. It will 
ease the workload of courts, prosecutors and enforcement officers.
<P>
	Over the years the provinces have developed expertise in 
handling tickets for offences under provincial legislation. Some 
provinces have central agencies capable of dealing effectively and 
at a reasonable cost with a large number of tickets. Quebec and 
Ontario for example have central computerized systems that deal 
with all their provincial tickets. These systems will be able to 
handle the federal tickets issued on their territory.
<P>
	Using the provincial systems would avoid the creation of a 
complex federal administrative structure. Also, the provinces have 
indicated they prefer that we use their respective offence schemes 
rather than establish a federal structure in duplication of their own. 
Indeed it is simpler for Canadians to know one system within a 
province.
<P>
	The government is dedicated to finding solutions with its 
provincial partners. The current bill would allow us to accept the 
provincial offer and use their systems. This bill would allow 
federal contraventions to be dealt with under the ticketing 
procedure and process of each province.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	In other words, the Ontario Provincial Offences Act, the Quebec 
Code de procédure pénale and the Manitoba Summary Convictions 
Act would apply to designated federal offences committed in their 
respective jurisdictions. Therefore an Alberta resident who has 
contravened federal regulations will face the same administrative 
and judicial system as if that resident had committed a provincial 
infraction.
<P>
	It is important to note that fines levied for federal contraventions 
will be the same across Canada for the same offence. Some 
provinces impose court costs and administrative fees in addition to 
the fine. Bill C-16 would permit these provinces to continue to 
collect these costs and fees.
<P>
	The bill would also authorize the Minister of Justice to enter into 
revenue sharing agreements with the provinces. Under these 
agreements part of the fine revenues collected by the provinces 
would be used to compensate provincial costs and efforts. This I 
believe is a very reasonable approach.
<P>
	Some provinces are ready to proceed immediately with the 
implementation of the Contraventions Act while others would need 
more time. Bill C-16 would allow us to bring the legislation in 
force province by province and provide the flexibility required for 
the smooth implementation of the Contraventions Act across the 
country. Federal departments and enforcement authorities are 
waiting for these changes to help them with their workload.
<P>
	This bill reflects our government's willingness to co-operate 
with our provincial partners. It demonstrates flexibility and 
understanding of the realities of Canadians and Canadian society. It 
has the support of the provinces and I would urge all members of 
the House to support this initiative.
<P>
	Once again I would like to thank the Reform Party and the Bloc 
Quebecois for providing their assistance in expediting passage of 
this important bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will add a few comments to those made by my 
colleague on the other side of the House, the hon. member for 
Prince Albert-Churchill River.
<P>
	We do support this bill. It is not providing major changes and 
seems to be streamlining the justice system somewhat. It will 
provide a procedure for the prosecution of regulatory 
contraventions as designated by the governor in council through 
what is essentially a ticketing scheme much like that of highway 
traffic offences.
<P>
	This bill assists the process by introducing administrative 
agreements of the provinces and territories, their municipalities 
and agents to utilize existing resources and to share the revenues 
generated.
<P>
	We have looked at the bill and I have been in communication 
with my colleague, the hon. member for Crowfoot, who is the 
justice critic for our caucus. He informs me that the bill will not 
forfeit provisions. The forfeiture of provisions in fact will be 
maintained and the provinces have agreed to this legislation.
<P>
	The bill will make our justice system more effective and 
therefore I am happy to add my support to Bill C-16.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	(Clauses 1 to 6 inclusive agreed to.)
<P>
	On clause 7:
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Chairman, the parliamentary secretary will be back momentarily. 
He will be indicating to the committee of the whole the text of the

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Chairman, 
the amendment is to the English text as its meaning does not 
conform to the French text put forward.
<P>
	I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the English version of clause 7 of Bill C-16 be amended by striking out 
line 31 on page 3 and substituting the following: ``menced under this act''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Chairman, we would like 
to know what words would be replaced by ``under this act''.
<P>
	<B>The Chairman: </B>Does the hon. member for Joliette have a copy 
of this amendment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Chairman, the words were not mentioned in 
what was read by my hon. colleague. I therefore wonder if my copy 
conforms with what my colleague said.

what he has said conforms with the wording of his amendment?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Chairman, if it can help, is it the words ``by 
means of a ticket'' on line 31 that would be replaced by ``under this 
act''? That is what I was asking, but if that is indeed the intention, 
we have no objection.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> That is correct.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Chairman, I want to ask the parliamentary secretary if he 
would make it clear that the wording does not change the effect of 
the legislation. In other words, by adding the words ``under the 
act'' to replace by means of a ticket, are the same ends being 
accomplished?
<P>
	That is my understanding but I want to confirm with the 
parliamentary secretary that this does not change the substance of 
the legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Mr. Chairman, it is my understanding that this 
amendment does not in any way change what is being proposed in 
the bill. It is merely a technical amendment to ensure that the 
English and French texts are equivalent.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock</B> moved that the bill be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be very brief. I want to take the opportunity to 
mention to the House that the original Contraventions Act, which 
was passed in 1992 and amended today, began a long process that 
dates back to 1982. I would like to pay tribute to my predecessor, 
Mr. Stan Darling, who initiated the legislation.
<P>
	I want to let my colleagues know how important this piece of 
legislation is to my riding of Parry Sound-Muskoka. We have 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1410"> 1410 </A></B>
<P>
long suffered a safety issue on our waterways and have needed 
better enforcement  procedures. This bill will give us that 
opportunity. It works well through provincial regulatory authorities 
to make that happen.
<P>
	Negotiations are taking place right now between Ontario and the 
federal government and within a very short period of time 
enforcement officers will have the means to enforce safety 
regulations.
<P>
	I would like to thank my colleagues from the Bloc and from the 
Reform Party for agreeing to this process today. It has allowed this 
bill to be passed quickly so that enforcement can be on our 
waterways this summer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I too will be brief. I would like to take this 
opportunity, particularly when the Minister of Justice is with us, to 
say that when his department brings forward good laws we can 
move co-operatively to have the legislation pass quickly through 
the House. It is in stark contrast to legislation such as Bill C-68, 
which was a bad law and which the minister had considerable 
difficulty getting through the House.
<P>
	The bill is basically cosmetic, but it does provide minor 
improvements to existing legislation. The bill permits changes to 
prosecution by provincial attorneys general or their agents. This is 
an improvement and it will likely reduce the cost of enforcement. 
That is one reason why we can support it. Therefore, we would like 
to see this bill passed and go to the Senate to become the law of the 
land.
<P>

consent to move immediately to private members' hour until 
shortly before 11 a.m. and to resume private members' hour 
immediately afterward to complete that item on today's Order 
Paper.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>

	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should, in conjunction 
with the Canadian National (CN), carry out repairs to the Pont de Québec.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, as the mover of the motion, I welcome this 
opportunity to speak to this motion, but before getting to the heart 
of the matter, I would like to remind the hon. members of an 
incident that happened at the Standing Committee on Transport last 
June, during the clause by clause consideration of Bill C-89, the 
CN privatization bill.
<P>
	One day in June, the Coalition pour la sauvegarde du Pont de 
Québec appeared before the committee to support an amendment 
put forward by the Bloc Quebecois, which was designed to exclude 
the Quebec bridge from the operation of the privatization bill.
<P>
	The coalition was represented by Mr. Jobin, the coalition's 
leader, and Mr. Beaulieu, an engineer and Laval University 
professor who has been taking an active interest for nearly 10 years 
now in the important matter of the repairs to be made to the Quebec 
bridge.
<P>
	They made their case, then the government members spoke, and 
the attitude they displayed was an absolute disgrace. They started 
by saying: ``Look, one bridge cannot be excluded from the 
privatization process; there are 6,000 bridges in the Canadian 
railway system'', which was like saying that the Quebec bridge had 
no more value than any of the 6,000 small bridges crossing over 
gullies, brooks and small rivers. This is the first indication of the 
government's absolute ignorance.
<P>
	The second one is the fact that several government members who 
sit on the Standing committee on transport and who only 
understand English, and this is certainly their prerogative, did not 
even bother to use their earphones to listen to the comments made 
by the two individuals who were representing the coalition. Worse 
still, some committee members would get up, leave and then come 
back, so that the meeting took place in a circus-like atmosphere and 
these two people had the impression of being treated the way they 
might have been in a school yard.
<P>
	Let us now go back to the motion itself. Why are we submitting 
motion M-202? We do so out of despair, because the Quebec City 
bridge is in such a deplorable and preoccupying condition.
<P>
	Let us not forget that when the Quebec bridge was built to span 
the St. Lawrence River-until the day it collapses-it was the 
easternmost bridge, all the others being located in Montreal. At the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1411"> 1411 </A></B>
<P>
time, trains could not  cross the St. Lawrence when travelling from 
the maritime provinces to Montreal.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	Consequently, the Quebec bridge was a very important addition 
to the economic development of the Quebec region. This is still 
true today. I will not discuss the historical aspects or the actual 
construction of the bridge. The hon. member for Lévis will deal 
with these issues later on, and he will also talk about the bridge's 
heritage value.
<P>
	Today's motion is important because it reminds the Canadian 
government and the CN that they have a duty to maintain this 
monument, because it is indeed a monument, which is also an 
essential component for the economic development of the Quebec 
region.
<P>
	To give you an idea of the state the Quebec bridge is now in, I 
have decided to read you a few paragraphs from an article by 
Louis-Guy Lemieux that appeared in Le Soleil on September 10, 
1995. It is entitled: ``Bridge of Shame''.
<P>
	The article reads as follows: ``It is possible for a person to lift off 
shovel-sized chunks of rusted iron with their bare hands. Motorists 
are treated to pieces falling on their hoods and windshields. 
Pleasure boats do not like to pass under the bridge-for fear of 
falling debris, of course. It is going to crumble into the river one 
day, and sooner than you think. You do not need to be an expert to 
see that the Quebec bridge is on its last legs. It is in such a decrepit 
state that traffic should not be allowed on it''.
<P>
	The article continues: ``After the alarm sounded by the coalition 
to save the bridge, and the on the whole comforting conclusions of 
the study by CN's experts, I went to see it up close, this marvellous 
old bridge I remember from my youth. I did not recognize it. The 
old bridge, this heap of rusted iron, abandoned to the elements, 
cannot be the longest cantilever bridge in the world, the triumph of 
civil engineering, the eighth wonder of the world. These were the 
glowing terms used in all the newspapers at its inauguration on 
September 20, 1917. Today we would have to call it the first 
cantilever bridge no longer fit for use, an embarrassment to local 
civil engineering, a perfect example of the inertia of government''.
<P>
	The question we must ask ourselves is the following: Who owns 
the bridge? There is no doubt that from the moment construction 
began in 1907, until 1993, there was no possible doubt, it was the 
Canadian government, represented by Transport Canada, which 
owned the bridge, although it must be understood that 
responsibility for its maintenance was given to Canadian National 
several decades ago.
<P>
	Since 1993, however, the bridge has belonged to CN. It must be 
kept in mind that this was exclusively a train bridge between 1917 
and 1928, however. Its sole use was  for the railway. From 1929 on, 
the Government of Quebec obtained the right to have automobiles 
use it, back in the days, some forty years ago, when vehicular 
traffic was light.
<P>
	This makes no difference in terms of who owns the bridge. Even 
if the Government of Quebec has used the Quebec bridge, is still 
using it, and the use is increasing, this does not in any way cast 
doubt on the ownership, since the Quebec department of transport 
has been doing this on a leasing arrangement.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	Since 1949, the Government of Quebec has been engaged in an 
agreement renewable more or less every 20 years. I doubt that the 
Quebec government forced the federal government to sign it at gun 
point. The federal government has, therefore, signed this 
succession of agreements willingly, and in full knowledge of the 
situation.
<P>
	The current agreement will terminate in 2012. If the arrangement 
no longer suited the Canadian government when the last renewal 
came up, during the 1980s, it had only to terminate the leasing 
agreement with the Government of Quebec. It did not. Instead, it 
extended the agreement to the year 2012, at a rate I would agree is 
somewhat low, $25,000 a year. I do not think this rate was imposed 
by Quebec. It is my understanding that the Canadian government 
was in agreement on it.
<P>
	Earlier, I waxed somewhat poetic in describing the location and 
the appearance of the Quebec bridge, because Mr. Lemieux is a 
poet as well as a journalist.
<P>
	Now I shall offer a description, not by a journalist, but by an 
American company. It appears that no Canadian company was 
capable of offering an expert opinion on the true condition of the 
bridge. This is particularly surprising when one of the designers, 
Dominion Bridge, has a business office in Quebec, if not its head 
offices. But no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé: </B>It bought out MIL Davie.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paré: </B>As my colleague from Lévis has reminded me, they 
have just acquired MIL Davie. So it was an American firm, 
Modjesky and Masters, that the Canadian government asked in 
1994 to thoroughly assess the state of the bridge at a cost of $1 
million. The money might better have been put toward maintaining 
the bridge, but that is what they did with it.
<P>
	The results of the study are fairly alarming. The bridge has 
reached a point where it is rusting at a much faster rate than it ever 
did in past decades. Repair and maintenance work are needed to 
extend the useful life of the bridge well into the 21st century. The 
bridge, therefore, is in real danger.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1412"> 1412 </A></B>
<P>
	A little further along they go on to say that, while the structure 
shows no signs of falling apart, if it is to remain intact and 
irreversible damage avoided, work must be done within the next 
five years.
<P>
	This is not the dream or the vision of a group of Quebec bridge 
lovers, who are defending the bridge. No, the bridge is really in dire 
straits.
<P>
	The price tag is a big one, we have to agree. The company 
expects that full repairs, including architectural lighting will cost 
$63 million.
<P>
	This is the funny part. The federal government says it is washing 
its hands of it. A real Pontius Pilate. It is washing its hands of it, 
because it handed the bridge over to Canadian National in 1993.
<P>
	However, the government fails to recognize that, over the 
previous 10 or 15 years, maintenance of the bridge was seriously 
neglected. It is, therefore, not true that CN alone is responsible for 
getting the work done.
<P>
	The state of the bridge reflects the negligence of Transport 
Canada over the past 15 years. Who then should pay the $63 
million? The answer is very clear: Canadian National and the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	The Government of Canada claims that Quebec has significant 
responsibility.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that Quebec only leases the bridge. In spite 
of the fact that it is only the leaseholder, the Government of Quebec 
has shown incomparable magnanimity in offering to tear up the 
$25,000 per year lease agreement if the CN and the Canadian 
government promptly commit to initiating the work called for in 
the agreement entered into by Transport Canada and CN in 1993. 
The Government of Quebec is prepared to tear up the $25,000 per 
year lease and to pay $1.5 million per year instead.
<P>
	This is 1996, and the lease agreement expires in 2012, which 
means that there are 16 years left in the term of the agreement. If 
the federal government and CN had the wits to realize what the 
Quebec government is offering, they would jump at the offer. 
While under no obligation to do so, the Government of Quebec is 
offering to change the terms of the agreement, putting $24 million 
on the table, and all the Canadian government has to do is to say: 
``Yes, we readily agree; this is a deal for $31.5 million'', especially 
since the repairs, which will take between seven and ten years to 
complete, will create 400 to 500 summer-long jobs for many years 
to come. It is estimated that this would generate approximately $10 
million in taxes for the federal government.
<P>
	So, adding the $24 million the Government of Quebec is putting 
on the table and the $10 million the federal government will collect 
in taxes, we get a total of $34 million. But when a $31.5 million 
contribution is requested, the federal government does not want to 
have  anything to do with it and says: ``No. The government has 
handed over responsibility to CN''. It certainly did.
<P>
	Either the Canadian government pays the $31.5 million that 
makes up its share or the CN will be forced to operate under the 
agreement signed in 1993, a perfectly clear agreement, which 
states at section 1 that Canada will hand over to CN all Canadian 
government railway land, with a few exceptions. They gave CN a 
present. Section 2 states that the commissioner shall transfer to CN 
all national and transcontinental railway land. Another present.
<P>
	In today's <I>Le Soleil</I>, the former mayor of Quebec City and 
illustrious chief of staff to the PM is quoted as saying that the land 
given to CN was worth $35 million. CN was to use the proceeds 
from the sale of this land to initiate the work, but failed to do so.
<P>
	Article 4 is very interesting. It reads as follows: ``Canada shall 
transfer the Quebec bridge to CN-CN shall undertake to fund a 
major maintenance program on the bridge, including the 
installation and maintenance of architectural lighting, which shall 
restore this structure to a condition which shall ensure its long term 
viability and ensure it is maintained in this state''.
<P>
	Without limiting CN's obligations described above, the company 
was asked to try to reach a new agreement with the Quebec 
government, and that was done.
<P>
	Article 12 of the famous agreement signed by the former Quebec 
transport minister, Mr. Gobeil, and CN's president, Mr. Tellier, 
provides that the agreement can only be amended through an 
instrument signed by the parties to it. The agreement does not 
appear to have been amended. Article 13 says that the agreement is 
subject to the law of Canada, is interpreted pursuant to that law, and 
is binding on the parties, their successors and their assigns.
<P>
	In other words, CN's privatization does not change a thing. CN 
must do the work and the Canadian government must pay its share, 
since it has a direct responsibility after 15 years of neglect. I will 
stop here. Someday, we will have to expose the petty role played by 
the Prime Minister's chief of staff.
<P>
	In a memo released today, he says that the federal government no 
longer has any obligation regarding the restoration of the Quebec 
bridge, and that it is now CN's responsibility. It may be so, but then 
the federal government should tell CN to do its homework.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	One thing is certain though: the taxes Quebecers everywhere 
have paid since the bridge was built should have gone to its 
maintenance, but nothing was done. Let those who had a duty to 
maintain the bridge do it now.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to continue the debate on the motion  presented by the hon. 
member for Louis-Hébert who would like to see the federal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1413"> 1413 </A></B>
<P>
government in conjunction with CN carry out repairs on the 
Quebec bridge.
<P>
	I reiterate the Quebec bridge is a safe structure. The bridge is 
inspected regularly by CN to ensure it is reliable and will remain a 
safe structure. An in depth inspection on critical aspects of the 
bridge is undertaken on an annual basis and every five years a 
detailed inspection takes place on the railway section of the bridge.
<P>
	As the hon. member may be aware, the Quebec bridge has been 
the subject of a great deal of attention particularly by la Coalition 
pour la sauvegarde et la mise en valeur du pont de Québec.
<P>
	Originally built for $25 million, the first train crossed the bridge 
in 1917. In 1923 the Government of Canada entrusted the bridge to 
CN. In 1949 the federal government removed one rail line from the 
bridge and moved the second rail line and widened the highway 
section. The bridge has two sections, a railway line and a section 
for vehicle traffic. A long term lease was concluded with the 
province of Quebec at that time for a $25,000 annual rate. As my 
hon. friend has acknowledged, that lease expires in 2012.
<P>
	In 1993 as a result of an agreement between Canada and CN on 
Canadian government railway lands CN became the sole owner of 
the bridge. The bridge is recognized as a masterpiece in bridge 
engineering. It spans a total of 3,239 feet. It has a clear centre span 
of 1,800 feet.
<P>
	In 1987 the American Society of Civil Engineers and the 
Canadian Society of Civil Engineering jointly designated the 
bridge a historic monument. It is a very historic structure. In 
addition, the bridge was recently declared a national historic site by 
the former minister of Canadian heritage. Steps have been taken to 
have UNESCO designate the Quebec bridge an international 
historic monument.
<P>
	I have digressed from the hon. member's motion to emphasize 
this bridge is a world landmark. CN has long recognized this fact 
and has been spending more than $700,000 per year on the bridge's 
maintenance. Following the transfer of ownership to CN the 
company engaged the consulting firm Modjeski &amp; Masters to 
perform a detailed investigation to determine the state of the 
bridge, its condition, and the work that would be required for its 
long term maintenance.
<P>
	I reiterate the inspection of the bridge revealed that its overall 
condition is remarkably good given its age and the operating 
environment of the structure. It is fully capable of handling 
projected traffic for years to come.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	Nevertheless, as with any structure which is nearly 80 years old 
with a very complex design, a major maintenance program must 
from time to time be  undertaken in order to ensure the structure's 
long term use.
<P>
	I understand the bridge is now at this stage. To achieve this goal, 
CN plans a major maintenance program to begin this summer. CN 
expects to invest between $1.5 million and $2 million per year on 
the bridge over the next 15 years, in other words $22 million to $30 
million. That planned expenditure is there.
<P>
	An expenditure of this magnitude confirms CN's commitment to 
maintain this important structure. The hon. member is 
recommending that the federal government, in conjunction with 
CN, participate in the repairs to the Quebec bridge.
<P>
	I advise the hon. member that as of 1993 the federal government 
is no longer a player, no longer the owner of the bridge and is under 
no obligation to share in the maintenance.
<P>
	In 1993 Canada and CN entered into an agreement stating in part 
that the Quebec bridge and Canadian government railways lands 
were to be conveyed to CN.
<P>
	By this arrangement, CN agreed to fund a major maintenance 
program on the bridge ensuring its long term viability and 
maintaining it in the current state.
<P>
	The 1993 Canada-CN agreement also transferred to CN the lease 
between Canada and Quebec. Initially entered into in 1928, which 
my hon. friend alluded to, the agreement allowed the province to 
construct and maintain a roadway on the bridge for $25,000 a year, 
a lease arrangement.
<P>
	With the last option exercised in 1991, the current lease 
agreement will expire in 2012. This annual payment, negotiated 
decades ago, no longer comes even close to contributing to CN 
sufficient funds to reverse the deterioration that has been caused by 
roadway de-icing and other things used in maintaining a road.
<P>
	Roads come under provincial jurisdiction. The predominant 
users of the structure, motor vehicles, represent approximately 75 
per cent of the bridge's volume now. It has become more of a 
roadway than a railway.
<P>
	I have already stated CN's commitment to the bridge. It also is 
prepared to participate in a more complete restoration program if 
the Quebec department of transport agrees to review the terms of 
the 1949 lease agreement with the view to financing half the cost of 
a major maintenance program. I have been advised that CN is ready 
to discuss with the province of Quebec and its transport reps a cost 
sharing initiative.
<P>
	The hon. member responsible for bringing forth this motion may 
wish to discuss cost sharing with his provincial colleagues or 
examine other cost sharing alternatives such as contributions from 
neighbouring Quebec City municipalities. This could lead to an 
accelerated maintenance program.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1414"> 1414 </A></B>
<P>
	The Quebec bridge serves commuters who cross the bridge daily 
to get to their places of work. Currently the bridge supports one 
railway track and three vehicle roadways. There are approximately 
10 trains a day utilizing the bridge, whereas there are upwards of 
25,000 cars regularly crossing the bridge on a daily basis.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	The Quebec bridge has, for all intents and purposes, become a 
highway bridge for commuters from the north and south shores. 
The former government made the transfer of Canadian government 
railway lands contingent on CN's assuming full responsibility for 
the Quebec bridge. The federal government's contribution was 
made at that time. This responsibility is now clearly CN's.
<P>
	The government recognizes the uniqueness of the Quebec bridge 
and that it was and still is one of the engineering marvels of the 
world. I am very confident that CN will fulfil its obligations agreed 
to in the 1993 Canadian government-CN agreement at which time 
the responsibility for the federal government's maintenance of the 
bridge ceased.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Fraser Valley East, you have

<P>
	Debt and deficit elimination is possible. Recently the 
agricultural society in the hamlet of Calahoo in my riding

$200,000 debt and not pass it on to the next generation.
<P>
	Two months ago a constituent, Lyle Quintal, accepted the 
challenge of getting the community to pay off the last remaining 
portion and personally phoned everyone in Calahoo. The people of 
Calahoo rose to the occasion, made the contribution to their 
community and the debt is now gone.
<P>
	Congratulations, Calahoo. Will the Minister of Finance 
recognize that Canadians want balanced budgets and debt free

Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	In 1996, there are over 23 million victims of persecution in the 
world, and it should be pointed out that Canada is now taking in 
fewer refugees than it did under the Conservatives. In addition, the 
Canadian and U.S. governments are getting ready to sign an 
agreement that would force thousands of refugee claimants now in 
the United States but hoping to come to Canada to apply in the 
United States, when that country offers a much lower level of 
protection than that offered in Canada.
<P>
	I ask the Canadian government to fully respect its international 
humanitarian obligations and to demonstrate openness and 
tolerance for victims of persecution.

government claims to be modernizing the unemployment insurance 
program, but in reality what it is doing is adulterating it.
<P>
	When one pays for protection, one expects to be able to benefit 
from that protection when the need arises. That is the very principle 
of insurance. With the new legislation, however, workers and 
employers will be paying more for less. The government will be 
pocketing a $5 billion surplus from UI contributions.
<P>
	In addition, the burden on employers and employees will be 
greater, because deductions start with the first hour worked. This 
raise in taxes on the salary mass will have a devastating and 
catastrophic effect on small business.
<P>
	Part time workers will also be affected. In Quebec, 68 per cent of 
part timers are women. Why has the minister chosen women, small

	The residents of Saint-Ignace Island and the surrounding area are 
concerned, and rightly so. If the work must be done, the 
government should act responsibly and require that the polluted 
sludge be disposed of on land. The shores of my riding do not have 
to suffer from the carelessness of the government. You do not solve 
a problem by creating another one.

	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, recently I was 
pleased to assist at the opening of another infrastructure project in 
my riding of Oxford. This was a $2.5 million project which has 
made a modern performing arts centre, conference centre and art 
theatre out of a 100-year-old market building in the centre of the 
city of Woodstock.
<P>
	The Woodstock Little Theatre, after 50 years of operation in 
rented facilities, now has a new home in which to present quality 
theatre for its growing audience.
<P>
	As a Little Theatre member and sometimes actor I look forward 
to enjoying this new facility for which the Little Theatre members 
raised $400,000.
<P>
	This project is another fine example of co-operation among three 
levels of government and a community group. I was honoured to 
present a plaque with congratulations from the Prime Minister of 
Canada both to the city of Woodstock and to the Woodstock Little 
Theatre.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the camouflage operation under way at the Department of 
National Defence and made public this week by the information 
commissioner raises questions about the authenticity of over 
80,000 documents, that is, more than 450,000 pages the department 
provided the Somalia commission.
<P>
	The Minister of Defence would not say yesterday whether these 
documents could still be considered reliable.
<P>
	Does the Deputy Prime Minister not believe, now that we know 
some documents provided by the Department of National Defence 
were totally falsified, if not destroyed, that the government should 
declare a moratorium on the work of the commission of inquiry, 
until the authenticity of all the documents provided by the 
department can be verified?
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I acknowledge the question from the hon. member.
<P>
	The Department of National Defence has acknowledged that 
some very serious problems have arisen in the access to 
information requests and how they have been managed.
<P>
	However, two inquiries and an outside inquiry have allowed us 
to take action. Strict measures have been taken to correct these 
problems. Written directions are being reissued to all members of 
the Department of National Defence to remind them of their 
obligations under the Access to Information Act. This is in 
accordance with a recommendation recently made by the 
commissioner in his report.
<P>
	Other measures have been implemented which allow us to 
respond to requests in a manner Canadians have come to expect. 
DND and Canadian forces officials are conscious of the need to 
respond quickly, completely and fully to requests.
<P>
	I can assure the House that we will continue our efforts, working 
with the information commissioner when appropriate, to ensure 
continued progress in our commitment to fully meet our 
obligations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is very comforting to hear that people at  National 
Defence are being told to stop falsifying documents. Quite frankly, 
if they did not know this before, I wonder what business they have 
being there.
<P>
	Does the Deputy Prime Minister realize that, by refusing to 
declare a moratorium, because this is what we have just been told 
about the work of the commission, the government is putting all of 
the commission's work at issue, since it relies primarily on the 
documents provided by the Department of National Defence? If 
these 80,000 documents have been falsified, are we being told that 
they will be updated? This makes no sense. How credible will we 
consider the work of the commission, when it is based on 
documents that may have been falsified?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I stated before, actions have been taken to make sure 
that the rules concerning access to information are strictly 
enforced.
<P>
	I would like to go over the sequence of events that led up to this. 
On September 21, 1995 three members of the Canadian Armed 
Forces reported to their official that they had breached the code of 
conduct and had altered documents.
<P>
	On September 22 the deputy minister and the chief of defence 
staff sent a letter to the chief of review services tasking him begin 
an internal inquiry into what happened in the situation.
<P>
	The deputy minister, then to be sure that they were doing it right, 
contacted the commissioner, John Grace, to tell him what she had 
discovered and the measures she had taken to deal with the 
investigation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> We are not looking for a 
speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richardson:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member wants a clear a 
thorough answer. I am trying to give one.
<P>
	She asked if there was anything she could do. This is important 
to establish the veracity of the Department of National Defence. 
Mr. Grace said she was doing the right thing and would keep him 
informed.
<P>
	Later, Mr. McAuliffe, a reporter, asked for an investigation 
under the regulations of the act. The commissioner complied and 
made his report. His report is truly congruent with the conclusions 
of the internal investigation of the Department of National 
Defence.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the problem with National Defence is that it pretty well 
always takes a video for an inquiry to be called. There has to be 
some sort of revelation before things start happening.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1419"> 1419 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	We are told that three officers admitted to having altered 
documents. We are not told their names, however. Not bad, in 
terms of transparency. There are 80,000 documents, and we are told 
that they will not do it again. I would argue that the commission of 
inquiry is not investigating the future, it is investigating the past. 
Commissions of inquiry rarely investigate things that might 
happen. It might not be a bad idea at National Defence, but there 
has been so much in the past that they have enough to keep 
themselves occupied for a long time, I can assure you. The 
commission spokesperson, Sheena Pennie, says she herself is 
concerned and is keen to know whether the information received 
was not falsified as well.
<P>
	I would therefore ask the Deputy Prime Minister if she could at 
least tell us what resources the government will make available to 
the commission to get through the 80,000 documents and the 
450,000 pages? I hope they will provide resources and, especially, 
that these resources will not come from the Department of National 
Defence, because the army's art of camouflage looks like cover up.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the questions put forward by the hon. member are serious 
questions. Of course, the inquiry is at arm's length from the 
government, but there are qualified and quality people on that 
commission. If they suspect any of the documents, they have the 
right to return them and ask for verification.

	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Deputy Prime Minister. At a press conference yesterday, a 
former member of the armed forces was very critical of the 
government for dragging its feet on the gulf war syndrome issue. 
She said that over 200 former soldiers are affected. While the 
American administration has acknowledged the existence of this 
syndrome, the Canadian government simply stated that it has been 
impossible to find a clear relation between certain symptoms 
affecting some members of the forces and their involvement in the 
Gulf War.
<P>
	How can the government remain so passive and refuse to have 
this issue really looked into, thus depriving those allegedly affected 
by the syndrome of all public support?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, again this is a very good and  serious question. I would 
like the House to know that the epidemiologist for the armed forces 
has asked for further studies because of the seriousness of this 
claim of the gulf war syndrome.
<P>
	We are not the only country that is wrestling with this problem. 
Britain has done the same thing. The leading epidemiologist has 
undertaken to make further and more extensive investigations into 
the serious problems which face all who served in the gulf war. 
When the final conclusions come forward we hope they will be 
acted on.
<P>
	I know that in the Department of Veterans Affairs they are 
getting a good hearing but I will leave that for the Secretary of 
State for Veterans to answer.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, are we to 
understand that the position of the government is that potential 
victims of this syndrome should be left to fend for themselves, so 
that the government can avoid compensating them, should the 
department be found to have some responsibility?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Secretary of State 
(Veterans)(Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency), Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canada has a long and proud tradition of taking care of its

veterans in the world.

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the defence minister told this House that his department 
initiated the information commissioner's investigation into DND's 
document tampering. That is just not true. According to the deputy 
information commissioner, the investigation was launched at the 
specific request of CBC radio.
<P>
	I ask the government, why did the defence minister mislead this 
House?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, the word mislead usually is not used 
in the House. Of course it would be completely unparliamentary to 
say ``deliberately mislead''.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	I would take it that because there is nothing else to qualify it, I 
am going to permit that question to go ahead. However I would ask 
the hon. member to couch his question in such words that it would 
be more acceptable to the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Defence and Minister of Veterans  Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday in the debates the minister alluded to our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1420"> 1420 </A></B>
<P>
involvement with the commissioner through the involvement in 
process and conclusions. In that sense, we did get involved with the 
commissioner. It was Mr. McAuliffe, a CBC investigative reporter 
who did request the investigation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
take that then as an admission of guilt, shall we call it.
<P>
	Let us go over the facts one more time. At the written request of 
CBC Radio the information commissioner investigated allegations 
that the Department of National Defence tampered with 
documents. It was at his initiation. Yesterday however the minister 
said it was the defence department that went to the information 
commissioner and that is false, false, false.
<P>
	I ask the government again, why did the defence minister say 
what he said?
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister did not deliberately mislead this House. The 
minister was going through a series of contacts with the 
commissioner and inadvertently mentioned it. There was not a 
deliberate falsification. There was not a misleading of the House. 
The hon. member knows that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
then we have other problems. As a former member of the armed 
forces like the member himself who just spoke, I can tell this 
government a thing or two about leadership, honesty, integrity and 
responsibility.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence cannot keep blaming his 
subordinates for the chaos in the department. He is the Minister of 
National Defence. Documents were altered. Unlawful orders were 
given and cover-ups happened on the minister's watch.
<P>
	If the minister is not willing to take full responsibility for the 
chaos in the Department of National Defence, will the government, 
the Prime Minister or the Deputy Prime Minister demand his 
resignation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Government of 
Canada as represented yesterday by the Prime Minister in the 
House of Commons has full confidence in the capacity of the 
Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	I would point out that the Reform Party is very intent on 
claiming a cover-up. Why would the government of the day be 
interested in the cover-up of a mess that was created by the 
Conservatives?

	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the finance minister.
<P>
	Yesterday, in a poverty profile report, the National Council on 
Welfare stated that the average poverty rate was higher in Quebec 
that in the rest of Canada, and that it remained significantly higher 
than the national average.
<P>
	How can the finance minister explain his refusal to immediately 
close all the loopholes, which amount to billions of dollars and 
benefit rich Canadians, as shown by the council?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
poverty levels in Quebec and also in the other Canadian provinces 
are a concern for all of us.
<P>
	If there is a scourge we must deal with, it certainly is the poverty 
of children, of single mothers in our society.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	This is one of the reasons why, in our past three budgets, we 
closed the majority of loopholes. What is left are incentives to help 
industry create jobs. One of the most important ones, for instance, 
is the taxation level which is much lower for small and medium 
size businesses than for major corporations.
<P>
	The best way to help is first to give money directly to the poor, 
but also to create jobs, which has been the result of our past three 
budgets.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, does the finance minister not agree that it is high time for 
him to listen to the official opposition's proposals and, for the sake 
of fairness, to open the government consultation process on 
business taxation to groups representing the poorest members of 
our society?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
not only do I totally agree that we have to meet with these groups, 
but I have done it. I met with the antipoverty association before 
each budget. In preparation for the budget, I met with most social 
groups wishing to talk about the budget. The finance committee did 
the same, and we intend to keep on doing it.
<P>
	On the other hand, as I know the member is well aware, all 
governments are faced with the same problem. We have debts, we 
have deficits, this is a burden we do not want to pass on to our 
young people. This is why, when we see in today's <I>Le Devoir</I> 
community groups comparing Bouchard to Harris, we understand 
that it is another provincial government faced with a problem.
<P>
	I do not intend to criticize the Government of Quebec. 
Governments are trying to do their best, and so are we.

yesterday in this House the Prime Minister said that he is proud of 
his minister of defence. What a strange use of language. Is he proud 
of the hazings? Is he proud of the continued cover-ups? Is he proud 
that senior officers ordered documents destroyed or falsified? Is he 
proud that morale is at an all time low?

exactly what it is the Prime Minister is proud of.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of

complaints about morale in the armed forces, he should get himself 
a mirror to see the reason why.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, are 
there no better answers than this?
<P>
	The incompetence of the minister sets an unacceptably low 
standard for all other ministers to stoop to and we have just seen it 
right there.
<P>
	The men and women on the front lines of the Canadian military 
are the most courageous in the world and they deserve better 
leadership. My question again, if I can get a decent answer this 
time, is: What message is the Prime Minister sending them when 
he does not have the courage to do the right thing and demand the 
defence minister's resignation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know that the Reform 
Party is obsessed with moles, cover-ups and other kinds of stories. 
If the Reform Party is truly interested in getting to the bottom of 
the facts it should support the decision of the Minister of National 
Defence who had the courage to call a public inquiry into the 
events surrounding the Somalia affair precisely because he did not 
want to have anything to do with the mess that was created by the

company making huge profits, will receive a $843 million tax 
refund from the federal government.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. While the minister is 
asking all Canadians to tighten their belts, is asking the people 
most in need to forego $7 billion through his cuts in social 
programs, including $500  million to Quebec students, and is 
asking the unemployed to cough up $5 million in premiums each 
year, is it normal and morally acceptable that a company that will 
make $514 million in profits this year should benefit from such 
generosity on the part of Revenue Canada?
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this 
opportunity to clarify to Canadians that the Government of Canada 
through Revenue Canada will be paying refunds. The refunds are 
not the government's decision but are in reaction to and the reality 
of a court decision, and this government does obey the law in this 
country.
<P>
	With respect to the resource allowance refunds it has been nearly 
a quarter of a century that the mining and oil and gas sectors, very 
important sectors to our Canadian economy, have needed clarity. It 
is with the work of the Minister of Finance since 1992 when the 
court procedure ended and in discussions with these very important 
resource sectors of our economy we have now in a very proactive 
manner inserted regulations and legislation that will give certainty 
that was not there before to an area of the law. This is very 
beneficial for all the stakeholders.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the secretary of state is telling us that taxation is defined 
by the Supreme Court. He has some nerve, using that as an excuse.
<P>
	I will rephrase my question. Is it not time that the minister 
understood, once and for all, that it is crucial and urgent to proceed 
with a total and complete review of business taxation, not behind 
closed doors, not exclusively by a group of experts of the type that, 
indeed, made sure that Imperial Oil receives an $843 million tax 
refund, but a real review, through a parliamentary process open to 
the public and transparent, to ensure that this sort of thing does not 
happen again?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to answer this 
question by stating very clearly that this government has acted to 
stop the situation from repeating.
<P>
	The government of the day in 1992 issued draft regulations after 
the court decisions were halted and over with. We passed 
legislation in 1995 requiring large corporations to specify and 
quantify their outstanding tax issues. We released the new tax rules 
for the resource allowance in the 1996 budget.
<P>
	Of the refunds being issued over this time period, they were 
anticipated and prudently allowed for in our  budgets. Fully 
two-thirds of the moneys being expended as refunds now is 
interest. There will be corporate tax, mostly at the top corporate tax 
<P>

rate, payable on this interest. Therefore the government will be

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Ontario 
Premier Mike Harris has said that hell will freeze over before we 
will see co-operation for a 15 per cent sales tax in Ontario and with 
good reason. His finance minister has said that harmonization 
would cost Ontario taxpayers up to $3 billion.
<P>
	Page 15 of the red ink book states: ``Governments have little 
room to find new revenues from the tax side. Indeed the long term 
objective of all governments must be to reduce the tax burden''.
<P>
	Will the finance minister now admit that his $3 billion 
harmonization proposal for Ontario based on the red ink book 
promise to eliminate the GST actually breaks another red book 
promise to harmonize and reduce the tax burden?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> No, Mr. 
Speaker. The fact is that our proposal does exactly what we said in 
the red book. What the member has just called for, which is 
harmonization, is in fact what the member's party called for in the 
finance committee.
<P>
	It is important to understand that the $3 billion the hon. member 
refers to, as far as the federal government is concerned, whatever 
would occur would be revenue neutral. If there would be a gain on 
one segment of the taxpaying public in Ontario, the Government of 
Ontario would certainly have the opportunity to use that funding 
either to reduce taxes or in fact to increase social services in the 
province of Ontario. It would have complete flexibility.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	Therefore it is simply not true to say there would be a shift from 
one level of taxpayer to another. In fact, it would give the 
government the scope for far more fairness in Ontario, as was the 
conclusion of the Ontario fair tax commission over a year ago.
<P>
	What we are looking at is a profound structural change in the tax 
system which would do a great deal of good for small business and 
the consumers of Ontario.
<P>
	In terms of the opening statement of the hon. member, his 
reference to hell freezing over, that may be the case. It may well be 
that the hon. member and other governments have a better 
knowledge of that place than I have.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, based on 
that response I suggest the finance minister get himself a fur coat.
<P>
	A study done at the University of Toronto Institute for Policy 
Analysis found that the Liberal plan for harmonization could lead 
to the direct loss of 70,000 jobs in Ontario; 70,000 more people on 
UI in Ontario. The government was elected on a promise of jobs, 
jobs, jobs.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance now admit that his harmonization 
proposal breaks yet another red book promise? Does the finance 
minister consider one job, the Deputy Prime Minister's job, ahead 
of 70,000 jobs in Ontario?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Canadian Tax Foundation and most other commentators have 
indicated that the savings available to small and medium size 
business would be between $400 million and $700 million, and 
they may well be in excess of $1 billion. That is the kind of money 
that small business needs to create jobs and it is the kind of money 
that harmonization and the new tax would provide.
<P>
	There is a reason the majority of Canadian exporters have called 
for a harmonized tax. They know it would put them in a more 
competitive position vis à vis the United States. That means jobs.
<P>
	There is a reason the consumers have called for it. They 
understand the simplicity it would provide to small retailers. That 
means jobs. Virtually every economic group in the country has 
called for a single tax. They all recognize the benefits.
<P>
	The hon. member is calling for ten different sales taxes plus the 
federal sales tax across the country. Immense complexity. We are 
the only country that does not have a single sales tax.
<P>
	Why does the hon. member continue to try to take Canada 
backwards? Is that an essential part of Reform Party policy?

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of

the same right as students elsewhere in Canada to be connected 
to the information highway and that is what we are trying to do 
with this project. It is unfortunate that the Bloc Quebecois is much 
more interested in political separatism than in the information that 
will open the doors to the 21st century for our students.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Deputy Prime Minister just demonstrated all the respect she has 
for areas of provincial jurisdiction. Such is her position. In the 
information the federal government is releasing about Rescol, 
teachers are invited to apply to the federal government to get 
funding for this Internet project. Again, the federal government is 
going over the heads of the provinces.
<P>
	When will the minister and the government recognize the 
provinces' jurisdiction in the matter and transfer all the money they 
spend on schools?

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of

dealing precisely with the information highway.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	The system linked us with students in Hamilton, Winnipeg and 
other parts of the country. Why is the hon. member scared of 
information? Why is he afraid to let students from various areas of 
the country start talking to each other? Does it go against his 
separatist policy which closes doors instead of opening them up?

Ontario, is being increased to $60 million over three years.
<P>
	In view of the concerns of the auditor general, will the

businesses in northern Ontario?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

Minister of Industry revitalizing FedNor and providing the 
financing that has been referred to in the question.
<P>
	This is a necessary step in helping small business in northern 
Ontario. By setting up the system that has been put in place there 
will be a leveraging approximately fivefold in the money from the 
banks in helping establish greater financing for small business in 
northern Ontario.
<P>
	FedNor is a regional agency along with other agencies in 
Atlantic Canada, Quebec and western Canada; the same agencies 
the Reform Party would have destroyed in its budget. It wants to

<P>
	When tens of thousands of pensioners saw their American social 
security payments cut by 25 per cent, the only thing the 
government found to say in this House on March 14 was that it 
would raise the issue with the U.S. government, in order to find 
a solution to this inequity resulting from the new Canada-U.S. tax 
treaty.
<P>
	Such a meeting has not yet taken place, and the pensioners are 
still waiting. Will the minister commit to raising the issue on his 
next visit to Washington, and can he tell us right now exactly when 
that will be?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Yes, Mr. 
Speaker, my next trip to Washington will be in two weeks, and it is 
on the agenda for the talks I shall be holding with the Secretary, Mr. 
Rubin.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since the minister agrees these pensioners are not being 
treated fairly, why does he not commit to passing the appropriate 
tax measures to compensate Quebecers and Canadians, if the U.S. 
does not respond favourably to his request.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member knows that this is an American legislative issue 
that affects other countries as well as Canada. There seem to be 
exemptions, which is rather discriminatory, but Canada is not in a 
position to compensate Canadians who are taxed by other 
countries, whether that country be the U.S., Britain or France.
<P>
	I am totally in agreement with the hon. member that this is 
unfair. We do not agree with the way the Americans are handling 
this, and I certainly intend to raise the issue directly with Mr. 
Rubin. I should add, moreover, that there have already been 
discussions between officials of our two departments.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
year John Fraser's report on the Fraser River fishery laid the blame 
for millions of missing salmon clearly on the mismanagement and 
negligence of the fisheries minister.
<P>
	Since then the government has also failed to negotiate a new 
Pacific salmon treaty. It failed to use licence fees to help fishermen 
and even failed to keep open the fish hatcheries which are the 
future of the industry. It destroyed the fishery and now the minister 
will be forced to announce the destruction of the fishing fleet.
<P>
	Will the minister accept that his bungling, his mismanagement 
and his negligence of the west coast fishery are responsible for 
this? Or would he like to blame it on his predecessor, Brian Tobin?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State (Agriculture 
and Agri-Food, Fisheries and Oceans), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
certainly do not accept the premise of the member's question.
<P>
	The minister is on the west coast and will be making an 
announcement later today. This follows a long series of 
consultation with the industry and will also go a long way to 
meeting recommendations that were made by people who 
participated in the round table.
<P>
	I would have thought the member would be out there today to 
applaud what the minister will be announcing. The measures will 
be in the direction which will certainly contribute to the 
revitalization of the salmon industry in B.C.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
suppose they will have lots of places to hold the press conference. 
About 18 fish hatcheries have been shut down.
<P>
	One recommendation of the Fraser report was that fee increases 
were acceptable but only if ``it can be assured that all moneys 
collected will be used only for local fisheries management''. Now 
we find that $65 million collected in fees did not go to fisheries at 
all, the government has already shut down 18 fish hatcheries and 
enforcement is at a dismal level.
<P>
	Why did the minister not follow the recommendations of the 
Fraser report accepted by the government and use the fees collected 
from fishermen to help out the fishing industry?
<P>

<P>

mineral exploration in Canada is declining at an alarming rate. Is 
mineral exploration in Canada decreasing?

	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister

mining in Canada cover only 10 per cent of the total number of 
companies conducting mineral exploration in Canada. They 
exclude any company spending less than $4 million annually.
<P>
	This year exploration expenditures are forecast to reach $850 
million. Canada has ranked first in the world in 11 of the past 15 
years. In 1996 I am confident that Canada will maintain its premier 
position in the world, thus creating jobs for thousands of

question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs, or the parliamentary 
secretary.
<P>
	Following personal comments made during the referendum 
campaign by George Berthu, the president of the European 
Parliament's delegation for relations with Canada, the then 
Minister of Foreign Affairs exerted pressure in a number of ways, 
including cancelling a visit by European parliamentarians to 
Ottawa last February, with the aim of having Mr. Berthu relieved of 
his duties by the European authorities concerned.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Foreign Affairs intend to pursue the course 
taken by his predecessor, by continuing to intrude in this 
unacceptable manner in the affairs of European parliamentarians, 
through the person of his Canadian ambassador to the European 
Union?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Parliamentary Secretary to

Foreign Affairs intends to work with all members of Parliament in 
the conduct of Canada's foreign policy, in Europe as elsewhere.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does 
the minister realize that by burning bridges with the leadership of 
the European Parliament's delegation for relations with Canada, he 
is alienating one of the better allies Quebec and Canada have in 
several very important issues involving Europe that represent 
thousand of jobs here?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the conduct of

	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Krever report 
is stalled by government lawyers who are looking at, in the justice 
minister's words, narrow grounds of procedural fairness. This guy 
is a judge, a supposed expert in the area of procedural fairness.
<P>
	Does the justice minister not recognize that he is calling into 
disrepute the competence of this judge?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have professional and personal 
knowledge of the skill and ability of Mr. Justice Krever. He is a 
person of extraordinary ability.
<P>
	The reason government lawyers are in the federal court is that 
notices were given to certain individuals in circumstances in which 
we contend there was not fairness shown as required by law. It is a 
procedural matter.
<P>
	In no way do we quarrel with the commission's authority to 
make findings against people if that is what it chooses to do on the 
evidence. In no way do we wish to slow down the inquiry. We have 
asked the court to expedite the hearing and it has agreed. It will be 
heard on May 22.
<P>
	Without departing at all from the respect we have for Mr. Justice 
Krever or the anxiety we have that he finish his work and make his 
findings, we want to take the points, which we think are important 
and have to do with fairness in the process, before the court for a 
quick determination.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the health 
minister faces quite a challenge. We have a justice minister looking 
at procedural fairness for fat cat politicians. We have a health 
minister who should be looking after procedural fairness for the 
victims, victims like Lynn Kamph from Pickering who is infected 
and ill, victims like Chris Taylor of Duncan, B.C. who is sadly 
already gone.
<P>
	Would the health minister take off his lawyer's hat, put on the 
health minister's hat, a compassionate hat, and let Justice Krever 
speak and tell everything he knows?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, implicit in the hon. member's 
question is the suggestion that by resorting to court we are 
somehow trying to stop the commission or Mr. Justice Krever from 
making findings or from making recommendations, which is 
simply not so.
<P>
	The anxiety we have about seeing this commission complete its 
work and make findings so we can improve the system of blood 
storage and control is reflected in our  agreement to extend the

requested.
<P>

<P>
	We are in court but we are there on questions which we think are 
important for the fairness of the process. We are not there to 
interfere in any way with the judge's powers to make findings as 
soon as possible. We have asked the court to hurry up the case and 
it has agreed to do so. We hope we can get these matters resolved 
quickly so we can get on with the commission's report.

	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as the member and the House will know, when we signed NAFTA 
there was protection, particularly annex II.
<P>
	However, due to the fact that Canadians had some anxieties and 
due to the fact that we as a government wished to reassure those 
Canadians that medicare in this country is protected, we have been 
able to negotiate an agreement in principle with the United States, 
Mexico and us which will further give assurances to Canadians that 
our health care system, which is the best in the world, will be

	The bill seeks to amend both the Criminal Code and the

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to present a petition signed by more than 200 
people who criticize the inequity of the new Canada-U.S. tax treaty 
on American pensions paid to Canadian residents.
<P>
	The petitioners call on the Canadian government to deal with 
this problem either by changing the way these pensions are taxed 
by the Americans or, if that is not possible, by finding a way of 
making sure these people are not penalized by the new tax treaty 
signed by Canada.

Standing Order 36, I am pleased to present a petition from citizens 
in Edmonton who draw to the attention of the House that since 
1926 the opposition in Westminister Parliaments have been known 
as Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition; that the Bloc should be moving 
over; that the Reform Party should be taking its place.
<P>
	They call on Parliament to implement a means by which it could 
be determined democratically whether the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois should continue as Leader of the Opposition.

	<B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it pleases me to present 52 petitions to the House from 
Newfoundland. One is from over 400 employees of Revenue 
Canada. They all deal with the same subject.
<P>
	The petitioners are demanding the reinstatement of about 50 
employees of Revenue Canada who are being laid off today. 
Because these people process the child benefit cheques and the 
GST tax credit cheques, the layoffs will lead to delays throughout 
Atlantic Canada for millions of people.
<P>
	We look forward to a response from the Government of Canada 
to this petition. The layoffs do not make any sense and I agree with 
every single person who signed these 52 petitions.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
is my fourth attempt at this speech. I started before question period, 
I started after question period, I started before petitions, I have 
started after petitions and now I am going to deliver this speech.
<P>
	I am a little concerned as I did promise the Speaker just before 
question period to deliver a barn burner. I am grateful to see there 
are enough empty seats in the House that if members from the 
government side flood across the floor after my speech, there will 
be room to accommodate them over here.
<P>
	The motion we speak to today is about the Quebec bridge. It is a 
famous landmark and is sometimes called the eighth wonder of the 
world because of its engineering expertise in its day. I understand it 
is still a marvel.
<P>
	I have to admit up front that I have never seen this bridge. From 
what I have heard about it today and read in the press releases sent 
out the heritage minister and by others, it is a beautiful bridge. I 
hope one day to travel on it and to see it for myself. I will plan that 
in my future travels and I look forward to it.
<P>
	The bridge is 80 years old. It started out as a railway bridge. It 
graduated into a multi-purpose bridge and now is used more for car 
traffic than it is for rail traffic.
<P>
	The problem is that the bridge is not being maintained properly 
by CN which is now the legal owner of the bridge. The Quebec 
government pays only $25,000 a year for the use of the bridge for 
car traffic and it probably costs $4 million or $5 million a year to 
maintain the bridge and bring it back up to standard.
<P>
	The gist of the argument being studied is the shortfall in the 
maintenance of this bridge. Who should pay for bridge 
maintenance on this project?
<P>
	Since the 1980s CN has been putting only about $600,000 a year 
into the bridge. That is not enough. It is gradually deteriorating and 
engineers tell us that it will deteriorate until it becomes unsafe, 
some time in the next century. Maintenance has to be improved. To 
repair it now will cost about $45 million. If repairs are not ongoing 
one day it will be unsafe and will eventually have to be demolished. 
Obviously a landmark like this should not be demolished. It should 
be part of our heritage and preserved so people like myself, who 
have yet to see it, can have a look and appreciate what our 
forefathers and mothers have created for us.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	In 1993 the federal government sold the bridge to CN for one 
dollar with the proviso that CN maintain the bridge.
<P>
	The principle being discussed is: Who should look after the 
bridge? The motion says it should be the federal government. I 
would argue that there are principles at stake in this debate and I 
would like to elaborate on them at this time.
<P>
	I would argue the principles are ownership and user pay. The 
users of the bridge, CN Rail and the people of Quebec and the 
maritimes, should pay to maintain it. However, they are reluctant to 
shoulder their responsibilities in this regard. They want to escape 
the increased costs which are incurring. They want to return the 
responsibility to the federal government which has already sold it 
to CN for one dollar.
<P>
	Why should the federal government maintain it if it does not 
own it? I would like to note the wording of the sale agreement. It 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Canada shall transfer the Quebec Bridge to CN as part of the first land block 
transfer of CGR lands. CN shall undertake to fund a major maintenance program 
on the Bridge, including the installation and maintenance of architectural 
lighting, which shall restore this structure to a condition which shall ensure its 
long-term viability and ensure it is maintained in this state. Without limiting 
CN's obligations described above, CN will attempt to reach an agreement with 
the Province of Quebec to co-fund such a maintenance program.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is CN's responsibility. It is obligated to work out a co-funding 
agreement with the province of Quebec.
<P>
	Clearly CN is not meeting its obligations under the agreement. 
We understand its reluctance when there are others who use the 
bridge. As a matter of fact, car traffic amounts to three-quarters of 
the traffic on the bridge.
<P>
	CN is reluctant to shoulder all the cost and I can understand why. 
However, there are several options which flow from this and I 
would like to mention a few of them.
<P>
	First, the Department of Transport, which has jurisdiction over 
the safety of the bridge, could continue to inspect it, table reports 
and finally, when it becomes unsafe, throw its hands up in the air 
and close the bridge. Obviously that option should not be pursued.
<P>
	Second, CN has indicated that it could use other routes for its 
railway traffic and is prepared to do so. It has indicated that it has 
been using the bridge primarily for political reasons. It looks good. 
It is historic. However, CN could work its way around the situation. 
It does not need the bridge for rail traffic.
<P>
	If CN can no longer afford to maintain the bridge and if it no 
longer needs to use it, maybe it should sell it to the province of 
Quebec for its use. This would force a resolution to the problem, 
although I am not sure it is the best one.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1430"> 1430 </A></B>
<P>
	Third, CN and the province of Quebec could look at alternate 
means of funding to maintain the bridge. They could look at a toll. 
There are 25,000 cars a day. There are 10 trains a day. Some fees 
could be applied for people who want to use the bridge to shorten 
their trips. A toll such as the one we pay on the Coquihalla 
highway in B.C. could help to raise money for maintenance 
purposes.
<P>
	I would argue that the federal government coming up with more 
money is not an option. The federal government purposely sold the 
bridge to CN. CN has an obligation to look after it. It should work 
out a co-funding agreement with the province of Quebec.
<P>
	It is fair to note that CN has offered to pay half of the cost of the 
repair. It is willing to ante up $27 million. It is willing to do its 
share. However, CN expects some level of government to pick up 
the other half of the tab. I would submit it would be a bad precedent 
to set if the federal government agreed that it had millions of 
dollars available for the repair. I would argue it has no legal or 
ethical obligation to do that. I agree with the previous government 
speaker and I may even agree with future speakers.
<P>
	We should think about the precedent it would set. I can think of 
several bridges in my riding which could use some federal money. I 
think of the bridge over the Chilliwack River which is an old Bailey 
bridge built by the armed forces about 50 years ago. It now handles 
hundreds of thousands of cars a day and is one of the busiest 
bridges off the Trans-Canada Highway. People going to Cultus 
Lake have to use the bridge. It is continually jammed to capacity. It 
is a dangerous, narrow bridge built by the federal government.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	If the government can put money into the bridge in Quebec, 
maybe it would not mind putting in a four lane bridge in Chilliwack 
but I do not think it will happen. The government has to be 
consistent. Unless it is willing to be consistent it will find itself on 
the tab for hundreds of bridges around the country and it will be 
unable to fulfil the needs many people have.
<P>
	As I mentioned, I appreciate the historic significance of the 
bridge. It has tweaked my interest again to actually go and see the 
bridge someday soon, hopefully when the snow quits blowing. I 
hope to make a trip over the bridge.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Over which way?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Not over the edge of the bridge, but over the bridge 
proper and enjoy it.
<P>
	I encourage CN to continue with its maintenance plans and I 
encourage the province of Quebec to do what it takes to make sure 
the maintenance is done properly and that safety is maintained. 
Other options should be explored, perhaps a small toll or fee which 
would help  the bridge pay its own way. The federal government 
has no obligation in this area. It cannot afford to cough up millions 
of dollars whenever there is a cry for more money. The feds are 
going to have to stay out of it. CN and the province of Quebec are 
going to have to solve the problem.
<P>
	I promised a barn burner speech. I am now on my fourth try and I 
think I will rest while the resting is good and leave it to hon. 
members on the government side to wrap things up.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this afternoon, I would like to comment on the motion 
by the member for Louis-Hébert dealing with the federal 
government's responsibility for repairs to the Quebec bridge.
<P>
	As my colleague, the member for Louis-Hébert, already knows, 
the Quebec bridge is an issue which has been much discussed in 
recent years. In fact, the bridge was recently declared a historic site 
by the former Minister of Canadian Heritage. As the longest 
cantilever railway bridge in the world, it is a remarkable tribute to 
the perseverance and triumph of engineers and bridge builders.
<P>
	In 1987, the Quebec bridge was classified as a historic 
monument by both the American Society of Civil Engineers and 
the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering. Like any other 
complex 80-year old structure, this bridge must be examined and 
repaired regularly. I can assure all the members of this House that 
the Quebec bridge is very safe.
<P>
	It can safely withstand existing traffic and the expected increase 
in suburban traffic for many years to come. This was confirmed by 
CN, following a comprehensive study on the condition of the 
bridge conducted by Modjeski &amp; Masters, a firm of engineering 
consultants.
<P>
	This firm was one of the major consultants involved in the actual 
building of the Quebec bridge. According to the comprehensive 
inspection it carried out, the bridge is in a remarkably good 
condition, considering its age and the operating environment of its 
structure.
<P>
	The member recommends that the federal government, in 
conjunction with Canadian National, participate in repairing the 
Quebec bridge. I want to remind the member that the bridge is no 
longer the property of the federal government.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	An agreement signed in July 1993 by the Canadian government 
and CN provided for the transfer to CN of the Quebec Bridge and 
the Canadian government railway lands. Pursuant to this 
agreement, CN undertook to invest in a maintenance program to 
restore the structure in a way that ensures its long term viability.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1431"> 1431 </A></B>
<P>
	I am glad to announce to the House that, in accordance with 
its commitment to ensure the long term viability of the bridge and 
honour the agreement signed in July 1993, CN intends to launch 
next summer a major maintenance program.
<P>
	CN expects to invest in the bridge $1.5 to $2 million a year for 
the next 15 years. Such a significant investment proves that CN is 
committed to maintaining this important infrastructure. This is a 
huge commitment on the part of a railway for a bridge that is used 
mainly for suburban road traffic. Surely the hon. member knows 
that, although the bridge was originally constructed to meet the 
needs of rail transport, a Canada-Quebec agreement signed in 1928 
allowed the province to build and maintain a road span on this 
bridge.
<P>
	An agreement signed in 1949 allowed for the widening of this 
span for $25,000 a year. This agreement is still in force and will 
expire only in 2012. Needless to say this payment negotiated 
almost 50 years ago is far from covering structural costs resulting 
from daily road traffic.
<P>
	Motor vehicles represent close to 75 per cent of present traffic on 
the bridge. Although I should point out again that the bridge is safe, 
a certain amount of deterioration has occurred from the use of 
products to remove snow and ice on the road portion of the bridge's 
superstructure.
<P>
	In addition to the sums CN is prepared to invest in order to 
ensure the long term viability of the bridge, the railway company is 
totally willing to contribute to a more complete restoration 
program, if the Quebec Department of Transport agrees to review 
the terms and conditions of the 1949 agreement and if it agrees to 
assume half of the costs of an important maintenance program. I 
have also learned that CN is willing to meet with the 
representatives of Quebec's Department of Transport to discuss 
cost sharing.
<P>
	The hon. member for Louis-Hébert should admit that the 
previous government disposed of the railway lands belonging to 
the Canadian government on the express condition that the CN take 
total responsibility for the Quebec Bridge. The federal government 
made its contribution at that time.
<P>
	Since deficit reduction is our priority, the participation of the 
government in a maintenance program that is clearly the CN's 
responsibility would be an inappropriate use of public funds.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Louis-Hébert knows, the Quebec Bridge 
is primarily used by south shore commuters who cross over every 
day on their way to work on the north shore. In fact, less than 10 
trains use the bridge daily while 25,000 cars cross it regularly. All 
things considered, the Quebec Bridge has become a road bridge 
used mainly by commuters. The deterioration of the bridge is 
certainly attributable in large part to that car traffic.
<P>
	The government recognizes the unique character of the Quebec 
Bridge and its historical significance for the world. Its unique 
splendour must be preserved for future generations and it will be. I 
am convinced that the CN will fulfil its obligations according to the 
agreement concluded with the Government of Canada in 1993.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the member for 
Lévis, I am one of those who cross the Quebec bridge regularly to 
come to the federal Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	One of the bridge's piles is in the riding of Lévis, the other in 
Louis-Hébert. This explains why my colleague and I sponsored this 
motion together. He was lucky in the draw today, and I fully 
support his motion.
<P>
	I have already detected a positive impact of discussing the 
Quebec bridge for one hour. I have noticed, for example, that a 
Reform Party member showed a certain interest in the subject, also 
a certain ignorance. This has allowed us to make certain 
clarifications, and to more fully inform all the members of the 
House.
<P>
	I have also noticed that the members across the floor have been 
forced to ask about the respective positions of the Department of 
Transport and the Department of Canadian Heritage since, two 
days before being relieved from his duties, the former Minister of 
Canadian Heritage had recognized the Quebec bridge as a national 
historic site-national, in the Canadian sense, of course.
<P>
	Let me review the historic significance of this structure. This 
bridge has been the subject of a long debate that dates back to the 
very beginning of the Canadian Confederation. I remind the House 
that, at the time of Confederation, the railway issue was important. 
All regions had to be linked. At that time, trains ran along the south 
shore. They did not serve Quebec City which was a capital. No 
service was provided to those who wanted to cross over from 
Quebec City to get to the Maritimes.
<P>
	This issue was discussed at length, and one could say that Sir 
Wilfrid Laurier, who declared it an important issue, was it main 
champion. Since history was to be made, he wanted this bridge to 
be a symbol. He had said-I do not have the exact quote-that it 
was the symbol of federalism in Quebec.
<P>
	The coalition wrote this week to all the members opposite, in 
fact to all members of the House of Commons. They sent them an 
envelope with a little piece of the bridge enclosed, to show that any 
member concerned about Canadian heritage has reason to be 
worried. This symbol of federalism is now becoming a symbol of 
collapse, of disintegration. This is a signal, a warning sign.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1432"> 1432 </A></B>
<P>
	It is very important; it is history. If Sir Wilfrid Laurier was here, 
I am sure he would agree with me. He would say that it is critical 
to save this historic structure.
<P>
	Unfortunately, Canadians do not judge it at its true value. The 
member for Louis-Hébert told us earlier that the members of the 
transport committee did not show any interest, when they met the 
coalition's members. One member, whose name I will not reveal, 
said that, all told, CN owned some 6,000 bridges across Canada. He 
compared this bridge to any structure that crosses a stream or small 
river.
<P>
	We are talking here about the St. Lawrence River, and the 
longest railway bridge in the world. It is also the first cantilever 
bridge in the world. Later on, there was one built in Scotland, 
which is also recognized as part of the world heritage.
<P>
	The member for Pontiac reminded us earlier that the American 
Society of Civil Engineers had recognized the bridge as a 
masterpiece of engineering. As for folk culture, everyone 
remembers that the bridge of Quebec was considered to be the 
eighth wonder of the world. But absolutely no one is filled with 
wonder by it anymore; on the contrary, many are afraid of it.
<P>
	I invite the people opposite, all those who still have some 
interest in the Canadian national heritage that is symbolised by the 
Quebec bridge to respond as soon as possible to the letter of the 
Quebec bridge coalition's president by saying: I am convinced that 
the necessary efforts should be made and I support the federal 
government in doing so.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	But since my time is almost up, I would like to remind the House 
of some numbers. First, I listened to the hon. member for 
Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle when he said 25,000 vehicles a day 
are now using the bridge, that is, more automobiles than trains. 
That is true. And that because of it, the owner, the CN, should make 
the leaseholder pay more.
<P>
	I would inform the hon. member who announced his 
government's position, which is that CN will spend the necessary 
amounts, that the Quebec government agrees, and in writing. Not 
just orally but in writing. It told the president of the coalition they 
were ready to spend $1.5 million a year over 16 years to review the 
contract, provided, of course, that the owner first undertakes to do 
the work. A tenant does not pay the rent on a new apartment in 
advance before the work is done.
<P>
	Then, the government replies, like Pontius Pilate: ``Oh, but you 
know, it is not really our responsibility. CN is now a private 
company''. I remember, I was one of those who took part in the 
debate at the time. We wanted the new Canadian corporation, CN, 
which has since become a private company, to exclude the Quebec 
Bridge, as it did the CN Tower in Toronto. This, however, was not 
done. The government did not exclude  the Quebec Bridge. 
Although it recognized, six months later, that it was of national 
patrimonial interest, it left the matter in the hands of CN.
<P>
	They are now content to say that CN will do its part, that it is a 
private company, that, in 1993, an agreement was reached to 
transfer the bridge to CN, but the members did not read everything. 
It may take me a while to find the article, but there was a land 
transfer worth $35 million, provided CN did the work.
<P>
	Well, the work would cost around $63 million. I was listening to 
the hon. member for Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle earlier. In the 
end, only $22.5 million to $24 million would be spent, although the 
work would cost $63 million. The announcement is made, and the 
people listening think: ``My God, the federal government is saying 
it will be done, that CN will do it'', even though this amount 
represents only half the cost, even less. Of the $63 million needed, 
$40 million is still missing. Where will it come from?
<P>
	Again, the Quebec government is prepared to contribute $1.5 
million per year for 16 years, for a total of $24 million.
<P>
	The federal government recognizes the heritage value of the 
bridge, but there is still $14 million missing. The federal must do 
one of two things: either provide the $14 million missing, or force 
CN to do what was provided in the agreement. After all, a contract 
means something.
<P>
	Article 4 reads as follows: ``Canada shall transfer the Quebec 
bridge to CN as part of the first land block transfer of CGR lands''. 
This is what is worth $35 million. ``CN shall undertake to fund a 
major maintenance program on the bridge, including the 
installation and maintenance of architectural lighting, which shall 
restore this structure to a condition which shall ensure its long term 
viability and ensure it is maintained in this state. Without limiting 
CN's obligations described above, CN will attempt to reach an 
agreement with the Province of Quebec to co-fund such a 
maintenance program'', etc. That was done.
<P>
	So, we ask that articles 4 and 13 be applied, because even if CN 
is privatized, it cannot elude its obligations. Let the federal 
government force CN to pay the missing $14 million.
<P>

Business has now expired and the order is dropped from the Order 
Paper.
