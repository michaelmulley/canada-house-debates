    </p><a name="Para631186"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I would like to talk about the importance of sport and the importance of supporting it. I will of course address the importance of the Olympic Games and, above all, the importance of protecting Olympic marks from ambush marketing and trademark theft.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631187"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Olympic Charter, established by Pierre de Coubertin, the goal of the Olympic movement is to contribute to building a peaceful and better world by educating youth through sport practised without discrimination of any kind and in the Olympic spirit, which requires mutual understanding with a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play. What an excellent example and lesson for our youth.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631188"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois supports Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2754603,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2754603&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-47</A> because we believe in the Olympic ideal. We do not think it is outdated. On the contrary, we believe it is important to promote the movement. Furthermore, as we have seen in this House, the Standing Committee on Health has tabled bills concerning obesity rates among our youth. Sport is a good way to tackle that problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631189"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Problems of hyperactivity among young people, the majority of them boys, can be resolved by involvement in sports. It is therefore important for our society to support sports, and the Olympic Games provide an excellent opportunity to focus on sports and increase activity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631190"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had an example of this after the Montreal Olympics of 1976, as generations of young people acquired a taste for sports in general, Olympic sports in particular. It is a matter of health and of well-being.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631191"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We became aware, however, at the same time, that funding was both difficult and fraught with peril, and this is why Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2754603,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2754603&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-47</A>, is so important. This bill makes possible the funding of the Olympic Organizing Committee, which is essential. We need to keep in mind that we are talking of $700 million in connection with Vancouver and with marks. Forty percent of the Olympic Games budget is linked to sponsors, whose ability to use Olympic marks is what will be able to fund those games. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631192"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill deals with the protection of Olympic and Paralympic marks, and with protection against certain misleading business associations between a business and the Olympic Games, the Paralympic Games or certain committees associated with those Games.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631193"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore important for us to provide real support, but for a limited time. This bill is about special protection, but for a limited time, of intellectual property rights, words and symbols relating to the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631194"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois is in favour of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2754603,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2754603&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-47</A>. We note, however, that the Conservative government may be moving quickly to protect Olympic marks, but it is taking far more time to protect intellectual property adequately. At the present time, in fact, the Standing Committee on Industry, Sciences and Technology is looking at the issue of counterfeiting and intellectual property, a major problem for our economy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631195"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights is hard at work to find ways of dealing with film pirating. This committee has, moreover, adopted a motion, thanks to the efforts of the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78559,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78559&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Hochelaga</A>, the Bloc Québécois justice critic, which is about proceeding with an examination of this matter. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631196"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has, unfortunately, already been faulted for its inaction on film pirating by just about every country on the planet, and rightly so. No fewer than 20% of films pirated by videotaping in a movie theatre originated in Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631197"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what about intellectual property? Generally, the notion of intellectual property covers rights related to intellectual activity in the industrial, scientific, literary, or artistic fields. Intellectual property rights include patents, trademarks, copyright, industrial drawings, integrated circuit arrangements, plant breeders' rights and so on.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015">(1015)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para631198"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these are considered intellectual property. We know that if intellectual property is not protected, not only will creativity and inventiveness be suppressed, but the cost to our economy will be enormous. This is becoming a disaster of epic proportions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631199"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Olympic mark, which we are discussing today, includes all names, phrases, marks, logos and concepts related to the Olympic movement. If we do not protect Olympic marks, why would major sponsors want to invest in these Olympic Games? It is critical that any unauthorized use of the Olympic mark be prevented because it could undermine the entire sponsorship system, the way the Olympic Games organizing committee awards licences and the committee's ability to raise the money needed for these games. Products, sponsorship and licences are truly essential to the success of the Olympic Games, and that is why we really support this bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631200"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill criticizes ambush marketing. What is ambush marketing? Users, individuals, retailers and people selling all kinds of products could claim to own Olympic marks and use them to sell their goods. They would use the marks to appeal to the public so they can sell their fake Olympic logo products.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631201"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill is really aimed at protecting these Olympic marks. Not protecting them will reduce the value of sponsorship rights. Why would major sponsors pay top dollar for sponsorship rights if they are worthless because the marks are used by everyone? For viable Olympic Games, the trade-marks must be well protected. Every time the Olympics are held, a new bill must be introduced, because the Olympic marks are extremely valuable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631202"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian and foreign organizations have always invested a great deal of money because we have been able to guarantee the Olympic marks. Unauthorized use of Olympic marks must be illegal and carry severe penalties. With this bill, we are not trying to prevent companies from doing business, but it is important to protect the rights of major sponsors who are supporting sport and the building of facilities that will stay in Vancouver and promote sport, which is what happened in Montreal. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631203"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, under this bill, it would be illegal to use the Olympic rings, the Olympic torch, the logo of the 2010 Olympic Games or the mark Vancouver 2010 on a website or sign, in a written document or on an item, or to use the Olympic mark in a corporate or company name or a trade-mark. The Olympic Organizing Committee is responsible for protecting the Olympic mark, but it is prepared to take legal action if necessary to protect that mark. This could include orders to seize unauthorized wares and recover damages. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631204"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What sorts of activities are considered ambush marketing? They include the unauthorized use of the Olympic mark or similar marks or names in connection with a business, organization, event or commercial Internet site; an Olympic contest, including offering a trip or tickets to the Olympics as a prize in a program or promotion; “good luck” advertisements or advertising or prizes to congratulate the Olympic athletes; and references to the Olympic movement, the Olympic Games or the athletes in advertising or marketing.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020">(1020)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para631205"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also the merchandise, posters and stickers distributed in connection with the Olympic Games, publications in connection with the Olympic Games, including programs, guides, magazines, maps and supplements, books, personal journals and calendars, and visitor services in connection with the Olympic Games. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631206"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One question often asked by promoters is whether Olympic Games tickets can be given as prizes in a contest or promotion. There are specific conditions attached to Olympic Games tickets that expressly prohibit using them for commercial, advertising and promotional purposes, including as prizes in contests. A person who obtains Olympic Games tickets in a manner that violates the applicable conditions can be refused access to the games site or be asked to leave the premises. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631207"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the Conservatives’ haste to defend the Olympic trademarks stands in some contrast to their lack of haste in defending athlete development in Canada and Quebec. On that point, it seems to me that introducing this bill should be an occasion for the Conservative government to give more thought to how it supports sport. We cannot support sport in Canada and Quebec only when the Olympic Games are being organized. We should be doing that all the time, and it should be a requirement, for public health. In our opinion, it is important that more Canadians, in all segments of society, take part in sports activities of every variety. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631208"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the 1976 Olympic Games, the Government of Quebec did a lot for sport. In my riding, there was a very important initiative: the creation of the Les Estacades Sports Complex, in which $8.5 million was invested. And what is this sports complex? It is a strategic centre for sports development, not only for young people who are involved in a program combining sport with academic work, but for all adults and young people in the riding, who can all use the sports complex, which has also received substantial funding from the Mouvement Desjardins. This will make it possible to build an indoor soccer field and an Olympic-sized arena, to open around about December. There will be a range of facilities that everyone in the riding will be able to use.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631209"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are increasingly realizing that soccer is an expanding sport, and one that calls for little expenditure. As a mother, I have seen my sons play a lot of soccer. The youngest still plays. This is a very democratic sport, in the sense that it does not involve astronomical costs for parents. Every family can let their children get involved in this sport, which genuinely contributes to improving our young people’s health.</div>

    </p><a name="Para631225"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am very pleased that we have received the support of a majority of members of the House to restore the bill, and while the bill we debate today is amended somewhat from its original form, it still contains tough mandatory minimum penalties for serious offences involving firearms. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631226"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More specifically, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A>, as amended, proposes escalating penalties of five years' imprisonment on a first offence and seven years on a second or subsequent offence for eight specific serious offences involving the actual use of firearms. Those offences are: attempted murder, discharging a firearm with intent to injure a person or prevent arrest, sexual assault with a weapon, aggravated sexual assault, kidnapping, hostage taking, robbery, and extortion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631227"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should point out that these tough penalties will apply when the offence is committed in connection with a criminal gang or if a restricted or prohibited firearm is used.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631228"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can be against that? Who can be against those provisions? This is what we talked about with the Canadian public in the last election and I believe there is widespread support for a bill of this nature.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631229"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A> defines what will constitute a prior conviction with respect to these use offences, that is, the use of firearms. This means that any prior conviction in the last 10 years, excluding the time spent in custody, for using a firearm in the commission of an offence will count as a prior conviction and will trigger the enhanced mandatory penalty for repeat offences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631230"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I should point out that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A> now proposes penalties of three years on a first offence and five years on a second or subsequent offence for four serious offences that do not involve the actual use of a firearm. Those offences are: illegal possession of a restricted or prohibited firearm with ammunition, firearm trafficking, possession for the purpose of firearm trafficking, and firearm smuggling.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631231"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the non-use offences it is important to note that the prior convictions for both the use offences and the non-use offences will trigger the higher mandatory minimum penalties applicable in repeat offences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631232"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill, as amended, also creates two new offences dealing specifically with the theft of firearms. Breaking and entering to steal a firearm and robbery to steal a firearm now are made indictable-only offences, subject to life imprisonment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631233"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, as we can see, this bill targets serious gun crimes with a particular focus on when such crimes are committed by criminal organizations, which of course includes gangs. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1030"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1030"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1030">(1030)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para631234"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sends a very clear message to the public that this Conservative government is serious about dealing with this type of crime. I am very pleased and proud that we are introducing this piece of legislation and seeing it through to its conclusion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631235"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should point out the manner in which Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A> was amended at report stage is an example of this government's willingness to make this minority Parliament work. Together with members of the New Democratic Party we dealt with a problem and we found a solution that responded to our respective concerns and priorities. I am pleased that we had their support and that of several other hon. members of this House. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631236"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw, I believe, about five members of the Liberal Party who broke ranks with their own party. I want to tell the House how much I welcomed that and certainly appreciated their support. I think they received the message on this. I am very pleased to have that support at third reading. I would welcome more support from other members of the opposition.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631237"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should point out that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A> has the support of other important stakeholders as well. Police officers and prosecutors are supportive of this government's attempt to pass this tough on crime legislation. They have said that tougher mandatory penalties are needed to target the specific new trend that has emerged in many Canadian communities, and that is the possession and use of firearms, usually handguns, by street gangs and drug traffickers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631238"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, I point out the support that this approach received from the attorney general of Ontario. He pointed out in a <i>Globe and Mail</i> article on March 6 that he liked this approach of getting tougher. He called on his federal colleagues in the Liberal Party to get behind legislation of this type because he believed this was the way to go. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631239"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, the safety and security of Canadians are not partisan matters. If we want to see progress in tackling gun crime, we will all have to do our part. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631240"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police officers have to do their part in investigating and apprehending those who commit crimes. Crown attorneys have to do their part in ensuring that accused persons are effectively prosecuted, and of course, judges have their part to do in imposing sentences. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631241"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As parliamentarians we have a strong role to play as well. We set the laws. We signal to the courts what we consider to be appropriate penalties for specific crimes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631242"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of opposition members who say they cannot support Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A>, but many of these same members have already supported mandatory penalties in the past, and particularly for firearms offences. In fact, it was the Liberal government that introduced a number of mandatory penalties in the mid-nineties and proposed a very modest increase to some of the gun-related crimes in the last Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631243"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government does not believe a one year increase is going to make enough of a difference. We want to send a clearer message. We need to ensure that the appropriate stiff penalties are imposed on gun traffickers and gang members who use guns in such serious offences as attempted murder, hostage taking, robbery and extortion. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631244"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that the proposals in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A>, as amended, are both tough and reasonable. As I have already indicated, the proposals are restricted to the key areas that are a growing concern to people across this country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631245"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There certainly is evidence to support the problems associated with the current level of gun crime. Crime statistics, police, and several other experts in this area, point to a growing problem with respect to guns and gangs. While the national trends show an overall decrease in some crime over the past few decades, it is not the case with violent crimes such as homicide, attempted murder, assault with weapons, and robbery, especially in larger urban areas across the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631246"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statistics also show that while crimes committed with non-restricted guns are down, handguns and other restricted or prohibited firearms have become the weapon of choice for those who use firearms to commit crimes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631247"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toronto's rate of firearm homicides in recent years has frequently been reported by the press. Statistics Canada data shows that it is not just a problem unique to central Canada. The rate in Edmonton has also recently increased and Vancouver has consistently had higher rates over the last decade. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1035"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1035"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1035">(1035)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para631248"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gang-related homicides and the proportion of handguns used in violent crimes have become a major cause for concern and gun crime with restricted weapons or guns used by gang member is an increasing problem in urban communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631249"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organized criminals are fuelling much of the crime problem and the government's justice agenda aims to curtail this problem by increasing the mandatory minimum penalties for crimes committed with guns, ending house arrest for those convicted of serious violent crimes and sexual offences, and other significant crime, such as major drug offences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631250"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A> includes a number of sentences for both use and non-use firearms offences with the stiffest penalties. The bill targets serious gun crimes committed by gangs or organized crime and the prohibitive weapons that they use.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631251"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this legislation, the federal government of course has a role to play in making funds available to help prevent crime before it happens. I am happy that the government has made investments in crime prevention and specifically to help at risk youth from becoming involved in criminal gangs, guns and drugs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631252"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funding is available to allow communities to examine issues surrounding gang involvement, create awareness of youth gang recruitment, prevention and intervention strategies, identify service gaps and best practices, and develop program responses.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631253"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several activities have already started to fulfill the government's commitment to work with the provinces and territories to help communities provide hope and opportunity for our youth and end the cycle of violence that can lead to broken communities and broken lives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631254"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to speak for a moment on how the bill is consistent with the sentencing principles provided in the Criminal Code and charter rights. The Criminal Code provides that it is a fundamental principle of the Canadian sentencing regime that a sentence should be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631255"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also provides that the purpose of sentencing is to impose sanctions on offenders that are just, in order to contribute respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631256"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the objectives in sentencing are to denounce unlawful contact, deter the offender and others from committing offences, and separate offenders from society where necessary, as well as assist them in rehabilitating and accepting responsibility for their actions while repairing the harm they have caused to victims and their community. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631257"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manner in which the higher mandatory penalties will apply under Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A> is intended to ensure that they do not result in disproportionate sentences contrary to the charter. The higher levels of seven years for using a firearm and five years for non-use offences are reserved for repeat firearms offenders. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631258"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an offender has a relevant recent history of committing firearms offences, it is not unreasonable to ensure that the specific sentencing goals of deterrence, denunciation and separation of serious offenders from society are given priority by the sentencing court.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631259"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government considers that the mandatory penalties proposed in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A> are not only just but are also appropriately targeted at the specific problem which they seek to address; that is the new trend that has developed with respect to guns and gangs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631260"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of my remarks I mentioned that the government is determined to make Canadian streets safer, communities safer and to stand up for victims. The good news on this front is that we are only just getting started.</div>

The Bloc Québécois believes that it is reactionary and that it is reminiscent of 19th century thinking whereby those who commit crimes must be punished.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631263"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, history has shown that those who commit crimes do not give a second thought to the fact that they may spend their lives, or many long years, in prison. This has been documented by studies conducted by universities and prevention groups.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631264"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that my colleague travel a bit and that he come to Quebec, where he will see that we think in terms of prevention rather than repression.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does he have against prevention? Why does he always think about repression? Is it because he is mired in the reactionary thinking of 19th century morality?</div>

He said that people who commit crimes do not think about the consequences. Certainly, I believe they should think about the consequence. One of the good things about this bill is that we are going to give them the opportunity to think about them. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631267"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if individuals did not get the chance to think about the consequences or did not get a chance to think about the victims or what they are doing to their community or their family, it would be my sincere hope that with a mandatory five years in a federal penitentiary those individuals would have that time to reflect and think about where they had gone astray and how they have messed up their life.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631268"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, one of the good things about this bill is that extra opportunity. If these individuals did not have enough time to reflect and to change their ways, and wanted to commit another serious crime with a restricted firearm in an attempt, for instance, to shoot or wound somebody, those individuals then would have seven years in a penitentiary to think about it. So then, again, that time for reflection would certainly be there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631269"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as I said to the hon. member and as I pointed out in my remarks, I am certainly interested in intervening with these individuals who do not reflect on the consequences of what they do and I am very much in favour of programs and, quite frankly, funding.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following up on the comments made by the member from the Bloc, it seems that we have seen a huge amount of emphasis from the Conservative government on its crime agenda and that it is very willing to grab the Criminal Code and say, “What are we going to do to toughen up the Criminal Code and bring in more penalties?” </div>
    </p><a name="Para631275"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In certain circumstances, that is obviously an appropriate thing to do, but I think it begs the question as to what is the government's agenda in terms of crime prevention? </div>
    </p><a name="Para631276"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have virtually had no debate on this. We have seen no initiatives from the Conservatives. I think that most people in local communities would agree that certainly law enforcement and penalties are very important measures. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631277"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the real building block of healthy and safe communities is around dealing with proper housing and dealing with substance abuse in a way that is actually helping people, from a health point of view, and not simply just throwing people in jail because of a health issue and a substance use issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631278"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would really like to ask the minister this question. Although he made the briefest of references to crime prevention, where is the government's agenda on crime prevention and supporting strong and healthy communities? We have really seen that it does not exist from what the government has brought forward in terms of the budget and other legislative initiatives. I would like to ask him to comment on that.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We made it very clear to people in the last election that we want people to have confidence in the criminal justice system, we want safer streets, we want safer communities, we want less crime, and we are prepared to take steps in that direction. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, the hon. member made the very good point that everyone has a stake in intervening and trying to prevent crime in our communities and she said I only made the briefest of reference. Of course, I was running out of time at that point, but I certainly believe in that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631283"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I was indicating that there was funding.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member asks why there is no other alternative. Believe me, if I thought that sending these people to camp or sending them away on a vacation somewhere was the solution to this, I would go along with that. However, it seems to me that when individuals commit these serious crimes, and do them repeatedly, because the bill talks about escalating penalties, when people cannot get the message that this type of activity is abhorred in Canadian society, then one of the options proposed in this legislation is imprisonment.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give the Bloc Québécois credit for being consistent. It consistently opposes these efforts to toughen up the Criminal Code. We have a break coming up and I would ask the hon. member to go back and talk to some of his citizens, explain these offences that I am talking about here of people using restricted firearms, using a pistol in an attempted murder, and see if they agree with me. I bet they will. I think they will say that the Conservatives are on the right track and that maybe those individuals should be in prison and not sent to summer camp in those instances.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say at the outset that this bill does not allow judges to impose stiffer penalties. The maximums are still the same.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind people that we have a committee system. When a proposal comes to Parliament we have a committee meeting. A number of members from each party go to the meeting to hear expert witnesses in the field. We look at bill after bill day in and day out and obviously members of Parliament cannot be experts on all of them. Therefore, we bring people who have spent their careers in these fields before committee and, based on their knowledge, expertise and input, we wisely make our decisions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631295"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think, in this particular case, a single committee member would not admit that the overwhelming evidence from a vast majority of experts indicates that mandatory minimums do not work.

    </p><a name="Para631296"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in true conscience, using the system as it is meant to be used, that one could take the expertise and overwhelming advice in this particular case.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CBA consistently opposes the use of minimum penalties. It supports measures to deter the illegal use of firearms but stresses that such measures must be consistent with the fundamental sentencing principles in the Criminal Code with constitutional guarantees and following the well-established guidance offered by Canada's common law. This is the position of the CBA, representing 37,000 individuals. It is opposed to this legislation. Surely. it must have good reasons and information for making such an important decision.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631300"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CBA's opposition can be summed up in four points. First, unlike what many people may think on the surface:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, this law would make society more dangerous. I know that is not what appears to be what happens on the surface but, as the social science experts and the government's own report suggests, this would make society more dangerous.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631304"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason the Bar Association brings forward is:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens is that these serious offenders are already given long sentences and the people who should not have long sentences because of the circumstances are the ones who are unfairly caught by these minimums once discretion is taken away from the judge.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important criticism from the CBA comes from its interpretation of section 718.1 of the Criminal Code. CBA states:</div>

    </p><a name="Para631314"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proportionality reflects the delicate balance that must be achieved in fashioning a sentence. Common sense and fairness require an individualized proportional sentence. The Canadian Bar Association believes this is why minimum sentences have been severely criticized in many important studies, including Canada's own sentencing commission report.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631315"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the Criminal Code contains a statutory acknowledgment of the principle of restraint, stating that the purpose of sentencing is to separate offenders from society where necessary.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will now quote the final words of the address from the Canadian Bar Association. It says:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now quote some other witnesses we had before the committee who also provided evidence and the expertise from years of experience in this field as to why this is flawed legislation, and by flawed I mean flawed in the view of the expert witnesses who came before committee. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631319"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the witnesses, Paul Chartrand, a professor of law at the University of Saskatchewan, told us that if we wish to “promote a just and tolerant Canada...then, with respect to Bill C-10, is minimum mandatory sentencing a legitimate means to address the problem? My answer is no.” </div>
    </p><a name="Para631320"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Chartrand went on to ask, “Will mandatory sentencing work? Once again the answer is no.” In his opinion, the way to combat crime is to combat the root causes of crime: assist children through children's benefits; assist families through community services, recreation and so on.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631321"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Chartrand also told us that the federal government could not do it alone. He said that it would need to work not only with the provinces and territories, but with municipal governments as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631322"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another witness, Mr. Alan Borovoy, general counsel, Canadian Civil Liberties Association, told us about the flaw within Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A>.

They reduced this sentence from 12 months to six months because in the opinion of the court he had an exemplary record previously and he was acting in a situation of high stress that required split-second decision-making. The prisoner, it turns out, was a police officer. The person at whom he unloaded his firearm was a burglar he was chasing. He grazed his arm.</small></td>

    </p><a name="Para631325"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, the maximum sentences are not changed here. Very stiff penalties are available in the justice system. They are not increased in the bill and are still there for the judge to use under this particular bill.</div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para631332"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Stewart also outlined this grim reality, an offshoot of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A>:</div>

          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Harsh penalties encourage greater recidivism. When the impact of Bill C-10 runs its course, the same number of gun offenders will be released each year from prison as is the case today. Having served longer sentences, those being released from our prisons will likely be much more difficult to reintegrate into society. We will have fewer resources to either prevent crime or rehabilitate offenders. They will be more likely to offend again.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para631334"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There we are hearing the same message that we have heard before. When we put people in prison for longer sentences, especially when under the circumstances those sentences are not just, offenders actually tend to reoffend. Our criminal justice system has actually failed in that respect. Most of the crimes in society are not first offences, so the way to stop them, as the witnesses said, is to first of all deal with the root causes and, second, with the treatment in the jails, or alternative sentencing, which another bill tried to eliminate a lot of, but fortunately Parliament would not allow that to occur. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631335"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I was somewhat apprehensive when the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105824,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105824&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">justice minister</A> said in his speech that there is much more to come after these bills.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631336"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another witness explained that when we put people in jail for a longer time, in that university of criminals, they come out worse. They come out more likely to reoffend and then society's recidivism problem is worse. Thus, we are going to increase crime in society because people are more likely to offend when they come out. Once we get caught up on the years, we are going to have the same number of people being released.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1105"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1105"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1105">(1105)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para631337"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People have to remember that all these criminals get released. Everyone we are dealing with under the bill gets released. There are a few dangerous offenders, but there is another bill that keeps them in forever. Under this bill, everyone gets out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631338"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we want to do justice to the victims in our society, if we want to do justice to innocent people so they are not re-victimized or are not victimized for the first time, we want society to be safer. We want people who are coming out of prison to be less likely to reoffend because they are the ones who actually create most of the crimes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631339"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How are they going to be less likely to offend? The statistics, the social scientists and the experts who came to committee showed that the actual facts are that they are less likely to reoffend if they have had shorter sentences and the appropriate treatment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631340"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Stewart also asked this key question, which no one on the government side could respond to, when he said:</div>
    </p><a name="Para631341"></a><p>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para631342"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to go on to yet another witness who came before the committee. I guess people listening at home and the many members of Parliament here are beginning to understand why the public perceptions on crime are different from what we might have thought. I think that is one of the reasons why the committee system serves Parliament well. People thought that in general crime was going up, but violent crime is going down.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631343"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I have to commend the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. In about two weeks, it will have a session specifically on crime, on the fact that violent crime is going down, and on what the role of the media is to ensure that people get the right perception.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631344"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, a number of people coming to committee would have thought that on the surface this type of bill is common sense. That is why I think the testimony from so many witnesses, who were called to the committee by all parties, changed the minds and the understanding of a number of people in regard to what is a very complex situation. It has to be complex or we would have solved it long ago and obviously we have not.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631345"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go to the second last witness I want to speak about and that is Ms. Debra Parkes, member of the board of directors of the Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies, which of course has tremendous experience in this area. She said:</div>

    </p><a name="Para631348"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, Kim Pate, executive director of the Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies, summed up the association's position by saying:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned at the start of my speech, these were the people who appeared before the justice committee hearings on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10.</A>.

    </p><a name="Para631351"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I think it is the objective of all members of the House of Commons to reduce crime. I think members of the House are very good listeners in their role. Hopefully they will listen very carefully to the evidence, to the facts and to the experts as they search their hearts in making their final decision on what is actually best and what will make Canada safer, and hopefully they will take into consideration the years of expert testimony that I have just presented for the members of the House of Commons.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that we often speak of criminals and the rights we should give them, but I am wondering if the member actually has been a victim or has talked to victims who have been involved in this type of altercation and what his interests are in that. Could he see himself supporting a bill that allows people to be traumatized, that allows people to continue to be aggressive in robberies or situations like that, and that allows people to not be deterred? Because there is evidence on both sides of the equation to say that these types of bills indeed do deter people from committing crimes like that.</div>

I was taken by the story about the policeman. What I am considering now is that right across this country we are arming more of our peace officers, our park wardens and our border guards. I am thinking to myself that in reality these people must uphold the law at least to the extent that every other Canadian citizen must. In the case of those who are empowered to carry a firearm, they must act with complete regard for the law.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631359"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am thinking of the case of a police officer who shot at someone and was charged for it. He obviously had done it outside the law. He grazed the person, but he could well have killed somebody there, and there has to be some deterrent for that as well. There has to be some understanding that leniency is not given simply because one is in a position of authority in this country. There is no leniency given to endangering other people's lives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631360"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effects of this law are going to be profound for people who carry lawful firearms, but there are important considerations that we must take into account as well in the protection of our citizens and their rights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631361"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the hon. member across not consider that whether a policeman shoots somebody unlawfully or an ordinary person shoots somebody unlawfully, the end result is the same, with the victimization of both the person who was shot and his or her family?</div>

Whether it was a police officer or not, the judge felt in this case that it was a high tension situation, the person had to act quickly and there should have been some leeway for him to give a just sentence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631363"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member mentioned people who carry firearms for the protection of Canadians. Will these people be deterred from using their firearms given the fact that they could get lengthy unjust sentences? Will they be less likely to discharge their firearm in the line of duty to protect innocent citizens, allowing more innocent citizens to be in danger or hurt in a particular situation? People should think about that ramification.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hoped the member would talk about aboriginal people because we both have them in our ridings. I did not get a chance to emphasize a point that one of the witnesses made, which is the fact that we already have a disproportionate number of aboriginal people in our justice system. A number of the bills that the government has brought forward will exacerbate this situation. I do not want to just chastize the government and its agenda, but there has been no effort by Parliament to deal with that problem. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member's second point was very important.

    </p><a name="Para631370"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member is exactly right. How can the judge look at that situation if he has no option. This may actually be unconstitutional. It may be against the provisions of sentencing in the Criminal Code because it does not allow special consideration for aboriginal people. They are automatically assigned a minimum sentence.

    </p><a name="Para631376"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at everything going on around us, we see that truly tragic events occur, like the one at Dawson for example. I doubt that the prospect of a minimum sentence would have stopped this young man from committing that crime. I doubt that the prospect of a minimum sentence would have stopped Mr. Lépine from killing so many young women at the École polytechnique.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631377"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the tragic events of this kind are unplanned crimes committed by a deranged individual, and minimum sentences would not change a thing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631378"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of American states, unfortunately, still have the death penalty. But still a lot of crimes, murders and homicides, are committed in those states. This means that it does not work very well, despite the death penalty. We should wake up and look at who the people are in the U.S. prison system who have been sentenced to death. They are not white collar workers, or millionaires, or people who have had an easy life. There is always a small percentage of incorrigibles, of course, people who can never be helped to reintegrate into society or turn their lives around. Unfortunately, these people do exist. The devil exists. I know personally that he exists. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631379"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier, one of my colleagues asked the hon. member in the Liberal Party whether he had ever been victimized by a criminal act. If so, he would know and understand what it is to be afraid of being victimized. Personally, I have been victimized. Several times I have found myself in dangerous situations where I was facing firearms and knew the end might be nigh. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631380"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a job in a restaurant and, very late one evening, a young man put a gun on his table because I did not want to serve him and so he tried to threaten me. I know, therefore, what it is to be threatened. However, the fact that crimes are committed does not mean that all the people who commit them are habitual criminals. That is not true. Many people can be reintegrated into society and can go on to make a great contribution. We see it every day and we know some of these people. I would not want to see these people’s lives permanently blighted because they made a mistake when they were young. But that is exactly what minimum sentences do. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631381"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Canadian legislation, there are already 29 acts that can result in a minimum sentence. Does the system work better because we have all these provisions? Are there fewer people in prison? </div>
    </p><a name="Para631382"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As my colleague in the New Democratic Party just said, if we really want to combat crime, I think we should attack the root causes, which are poverty and a lack of human contact, human warmth and communications, as a result of which many of our young people find themselves isolated and without anyone to guide them. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that if we paid more attention and ensured that people have real jobs and real salaries perhaps it is possible that we would have less crime. I am not talking about cheap labour, about seasonal jobs, or jobs where a woman who works 35 hours, 40 hours or 60 hours is compelled to remain on the employer’s premises and can not go out. It has been proven that imposing minimum sentences does not reduce crime. Many studies have been done on this subject. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631384"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found a study conducted by Nicole Crutcher and Thomas Gabor. It is a study that was carried out over a period of 20 years. Twenty years is not insignificant. A study carried out over 20 years is a serious study. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631385"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This study showed that minimum sentences accomplish nothing and do not help in any way. It is simply a way of making people believe that because we put more people in prison and give them minimum sentences that there will be less crime. That is not true. That is not the way it works. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631386"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to this study, only a small proportion of offenders committed to prison are of the calculating type who carefully weigh the pros and cons of committing a crime. They also said that many offenders prefer to go to prison rather than serve community-based sentences. They do not consider the difference between a sentence of three years, five years or ten years. They do not make that distinction. When they commit a crime, they do not think of the sentence they might receive. The only thing they think about is not getting caught. Publicizing the penalties will not make them think about them any more, believe me. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631387"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be better to reinstate the gun registry and ensure that we do not just give young people the tools to commit crimes. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631388"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, on television, I heard that a grandfather had obtained a gun permit for his two-year-old grandson. Two years old. Is that what our colleagues of the Conservative party want to see? Is that what should happen? Do we need weapons to defend ourselves? That is what was claimed in the United States during the shooting some weeks ago. Is that what we want? Do we all need to have weapons so that the law can come after us every time we use them to commit a crime? There are no weapons in my house. Most people do not want them either. We will not prevent people from owning weapons through minimum sentences. Rather, let us arrest the real criminals and put them in prison. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631389"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very often, young people who are members of a street gang commit small crimes. That is unfortunate. Let us deal with the problem of street gangs. We should not think that minimum sentences will stop young people from becoming members of a street gang. That is not the way things work. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631390"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When criminals commit crimes, they do not think, “I might get caught and be put in jail for three years, so I had better not use a weapon. Instead, I will just give the victim a little piece of paper that says I am about to commit a crime”. They do not think that. Once they have decided to commit a crime, they do it regardless of the minimum sentence associated with it.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if a young man without a record gets caught doing the kind of thing teenagers do to impress their peers or if the only thing he knows how to do is to be the baddest of the bad, he could wind up in jail for a long time. He could be lost to our society. That would be very unfortunate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631392"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, instead of getting rid of the methamphetamines, ecstasy and hard drugs that hurt our children, instead of conducting raids all over the place to wipe the drug problem out, the government wants to give people minimum sentences. That makes no sense. That is not how our society works.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631393"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that teenagers are often easily influenced. We have to keep an eye on them constantly. The most easily influenced teenagers are the ones who fall through the cracks. The rate of incarceration among young people from aboriginal and visible minority communities is high. Why? Because poverty is even more prevalent in those communities than elsewhere. Would it not be a better idea to provide social housing and affordable housing, to offer young people decent jobs and to build community centres? Would it not be better to give them the opportunity to work in the summer and in their communities rather than cut youth employment assistance programs? That is not what the government is doing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631394"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the pretext of wanting to ensure public safety, the government has introduced legislation that will help very few people, and will fill up our jails with even more people. What will they do once our jails are full? They are already full. Will they build more jails? Perhaps they want Canada to become a military state. Do we want to live in the kind of country where the only thing the government does is make sure that nobody ever commits a crime? We have to get serious. The government does not govern for itself. It governs for the people it represents.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631395"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were accused earlier of not consulting the people we represent. It is precisely because we consulted them that we refuse to adopt such a philosophy. It is precisely because we consulted them that we know that this is not what people want. On the contrary, people are asking us to restore the gun registry. Police forces are asking us, and so are abused women and other groups. That is what people want to ensure real security. That is what we need. We need tools. We do not need stringent legislation that will put more people behind bars without giving them the opportunity and the chance to otherwise rehabilitate themselves. That is not what we need. That is not what people want.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631396"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues from the Bloc Québécois, the NDP and the Liberal Party have also made their position very clear. We want humane measures, measures that allow people who have lost their way to get back on the right track, to start over and participate in society, instead of being sent to the dungeons for 10, 15 or 20 years, where they will certainly not learn anything.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631397"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these people are released from prison, they certainly will not be out to do good, because they will have only one thing in mind, and that is what they learned on the inside to avoid being sent back. When a person is released after 10 or 15 years, a person who was young going in, what have they learned about society? What have they learned about living in society? What have they learned about involvement, sharing or integration? Nothing. They have learned only how to survive. Is that what we want, a population of survivors? That is not what I want.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631398"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am convinced that many members in this House will agree with me. Survivors are like rats and will do anything to get by. That is frightening.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1135"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1135"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1140"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1130"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1135">(1135)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para631399"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is scary. But with progressive and humane laws that take into account all the factors, enabling judges to hand down informed sentences, we can move forward. As a society, with such laws we can be proud because our children will not fall through the cracks. I am sure of this, because all the studies say so and prove it. It is not Nicole Demers saying it. I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, but I am allowed to name myself. Hundreds of experts say so. The proof is that in the United States, in states where there are mandatory minimum sentences, there is more crime than in other states.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631400"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what does the government need to see the light? What does it need to open its eyes? I do not know. Instead of using smoke and mirrors, the government should listen to real people and stop holding little focus groups that give the answers they want to hear, instead of real answers from real people who live in the real world. That is what it should do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631401"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that this bill will not be adopted. I really hope so because if that is the direction we are going, it will be a serious mistake that will affect our children, grandchildren and the society we live in. That is for sure.</div>

    </p><a name="Para631405"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The opposition members' comments on this kind of legislation is that they have no real position other than they would like to hold these people by the hand and the poor little darlings are the victims rather than the perpetrators of the crime. It is time that we said that criminals are criminals and they deserve to be punished accordingly--it is that simple--rather than to hold them by the hand, pat them on the head and tell them, “Be a nice little person.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would hope that all members of this House would recognize that Canadians want a judicial system that works, that applies punishment, that makes sure our streets are safe. This kind of legislation is resonating with the general public.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What tools are available within the criminal justice system, in particular in the prisons, for effectively dealing with those who have to go to prison?

In Quebec, we have a number of programs designed to rehabilitate our young people and prisoners. If we really wanted to tackle crime, we would tackle the problem of excessively early parole. That legislation has no teeth. If we really want to deal with this problem, that is what we should do. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631414"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, we have education, information and awareness programs in our prisons, especially in Quebec.

    </p><a name="Para631415"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great deal of prevention is done as well. Other groups promote discussions where victims meet with criminals and talk about their experience as victims. Even if that particular criminal was not directly involved with these particular victims, the victims can still explain how crimes affected them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631416"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This raises awareness. When someone becomes more aware, I think we have to look at what point that person has reached in his or her own life. Often, these people are quite desperate and not very spiritual. In my opinion, with this sort of approach, which is much more humane, we may be able to bring these people out of the misery they are living in, so that they will not go back to prison but choose to re-enter our society.</div>

In this matter, not only has there been a financial cut, but the method has also changed. Now one major centre has the opportunity to decide, for the surrounding regions, who will get the summer jobs programs. This is being done without any regard for the area, the social stakeholders who need this money, or for what has been done in the past. Now an impersonal, administrative approach is being used in a big office. These are administrative cuts and an administrative approach is being used without any regard for the impact these cuts will truly have in these areas.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my riding, four agencies were doing exceptional work; one agency in particular. They were working in a multi-ethnic area that has a high crime rate with youth who cannot necessarily rely on their parents for help with their school work, people who do not have many job opportunities.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These young people, through agencies working in the area with people from the area, could be assured that at least for the summer they could gain self-confidence, become involved and stay motivated. This no longer exists.</div>

    </p><a name="Para631428"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bill that would improve the safety of all Canadians by ensuring that violent criminals who use firearms to commit their offences will receive serious prison time consistent with the gravity of their offences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631429"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill addresses two groups of offences. First of all, there is one group which involves offences in which a firearm is used in the commission of another crime. We call that the use offence, where it is actually being used in the commission of a crime. The second group involves the possession of illegal firearms, and we call those non-use offences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631430"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with the first group. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A> will impose mandatory minimum penalties where a gun is used in the commission of a serious Criminal Code offence. These offences would include such things as attempted murder, discharge of a firearm with intent, sexual and aggravated sexual assault, kidnapping, hostage-taking, robbery and extortion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631431"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a restricted or prohibited weapon is used in the commission of any of these offences or if such guns are used in relation to gang activity, which of course is a very real problem in Canada, a first time offender will receive an automatic five year prison sentence. Penalties escalate to seven years on a second and subsequent offence for the same or similar type of gun crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631432"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, this bill targets repeat violent offenders who must be kept off the streets for the good of our communities. It also provides a deterrent to youths who are involved in gangs, forcing them to weigh the consequences of their actions before engaging in crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631433"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second group of offences of course involves the illegal possession of a restricted or prohibited firearm, and some of the offences that would be targeted under this particular section would be firearms trafficking, stealing a firearm, possession of a firearm for the purposes of trafficking in narcotics, making an automatic firearm, and also firearms smuggling. For these non-use offences of course there are going to be mandatory minimum sentences as well. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631434"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legislation is aimed directly at, among other things, the gun trafficking industry. Virtually all gang-related crime we see across Canada is committed not by those who purchase their firearms legally and register them, but by people who purchase them illegally on the black market or steal them from legitimate gun owners.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631435"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my home province of British Columbia, it is estimated that gang-related shootings or murders occur on average of once every month, sometimes more often than that. The rate of increase in gang activity in B.C. is astonishing. Most of it, of course, is fueled by the drug trade, mainly high grade marijuana, and it is carried out by young people with illegal firearms who have complete disregard for the safety and the lives of those around them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631436"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my home riding of Abbotsford, we are known to be a beautiful community. It is a safe community, relatively speaking. It is in a beautiful setting, nestled between 10,000 foot Mount Baker and the Fraser River. We are a community of elderly, young families, singles and students who all enjoy Abbotsford because of the quality of life it offers. It consistently scores high in all of these areas. In fact, it was recently named as the most generous community in all of Canada, and that is backed up by a number of different studies, both Statistics Canada and other studies within British Columbia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631437"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the blight has crept into Abbotsford. Gangs and guns are increasingly common, usually in connection with the drug trade. Although the gangs in my area are quite fluid and frequently travel throughout the lower mainland, we have seen our share of unimaginable pain and grief caused by shootings.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631438"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2006 year end statistical report from the Abbotsford Police shows that 126 firearms offences took place in my riding. Some of these include robbery; assault; a sexual assault with a weapon; drive-by shootings, which are very common now; and home invasions. This is happening in Abbotsford and it is happening right across the country in communities that all of us live in.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 26, 2006, the <i>Abbotsford Times</i> reported that the police responded to a 25-year-old man who had been shot and was in serious condition. The man was known to police who believed he was purposely targeted.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631440"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just last Friday, May 11, the CBC reported a shooting on Commercial Drive in Vancouver in a popular cafe. This man was shot several times in the stomach and transported to hospital for emergency surgery.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631441"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An 18-year-old Abbotsford native, Yulian Limantoro, was gunned down when he got caught in the crossfire of a drug deal gone sour and that was in Surrey on March 3, 2006.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631442"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 28, 2005, a 40-year-old woman in Port Moody was struck by a stray bullet while watching television in her living room. The bullet lodged itself in her brain but luckily she survived.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631443"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, none of us can forget the string of violent crimes the city of Toronto suffered in 2005. By mid-September 40 people had been slain in the city. All of us were shocked and horrified especially by the senseless death of grade 10 student, Jane Creba, on Boxing Day 2005. Jane was gunned down on busy Yonge Street along with six others who were injured in the crossfire. The 15-year-old was the 52nd murder in Toronto in 2005.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631444"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going back to 2006, police in B.C. recorded that over 1,000 firearms were used in crimes or kept illegally in the lower mainland. Anyone who still thinks gun crime is an American phenomenon need only look at British Columbia. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631445"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 2001 and 2006, 195 British Columbians died in gun-related homicides. In 2006 alone police recovered 379 semi-automatic pistols, 28 revolvers, 139 other handguns, 76 rifles, 66 shotguns, 88 assault rifles and 12 modified weapons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631446"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current mandatory minimum penalties for gun crimes are not sufficient. We need to discourage these criminals by making it costly to buy, sell or use firearms in the commission of offences. The way we do that is by taking away their freedom to commit such crimes and making the penalties for subsequent offences escalate in severity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631447"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A> will not only send a clear message that gun activity will be met with serious consequences, it will also take these criminals off the street for longer periods of time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631448"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To place this into context, I want to stress that the bill does not represent an across the board increase in mandatory minimum sentences. Rather it targets crimes that are specifically related to gang activity and repeat and violent offences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631449"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going back to my community of Abbotsford, as the House knows, Abbotsford shares the border with the United States and it is part of a complex web of organized crime on the lower mainland of British Columbia. Drugs, such as high grade marijuana, meth amphetamines, crystal meth are regularly exchanged for firearms from the U.S. These are the same firearms being used to commit the wide range of violent gang related crimes we are witnessing today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631450"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although both American and Canadian border security officials are quite vigilant in protecting our borders and stopping the cross-border gun trade, there is only so much that they can do with limited resources when the same people go to prison for short periods of time and are turned back onto those very streets only to take up crime once again. Of course, usually that is violent crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631451"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gun and drugs trade are quite lucrative industries. Unfortunately, there are many young people that are into the gang lifestyle. These mandatory minimum penalties that we are proposing should go a long way in discouraging youth from taking up this behaviour.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631452"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Conservative government is also concerned with preventing young people from getting involved in the crime lifestyle in the first place through community initiatives. That is why in our 2006 budget the government invested $20 million in a plan for communities. This money will be focused on preventing youth crime and helping young people stay away from guns and gangs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631453"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that both this bill and our other prevention initiatives will work together to reduce the number of gun-related crimes and deaths in Canada.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1155"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1155"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1200"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1150"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1155">(1155)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para631454"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not send a clear message to criminals that the consequences of using handguns to carry out a crime will far outweigh the benefits, I believe these gun crime numbers will only increase. The clear message we are sending is this. Criminals should be prepared to go to prison if they commit a serious gun offence, period. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631455"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe these penalty schemes will also be an important tool for police officers who must place themselves in potentially deadly situations on a daily basis. They will now know that should they send an offender to prison for committing a firearms offence listed in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A>, that offender will not be back on the streets for a long time. When we take those offenders off the streets and put them behind bars for longer periods of time, they do not represent a crime threat during that period to ordinary, hard-working, law-abiding citizens. At the same time, police officers can focus their efforts on other criminals in our communities. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631456"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that our communities across the country are suffering from violent gun crime, yet the previous Liberal government, over 13 years, did absolutely nothing to address this scourge in our country. Sadly, the Liberal and the Bloc opposition parties have done everything in their power to try to thwart our attempts to pass Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631457"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when this bill went to committee, it was essentially gutted, leaving it meaningless. It had no teeth to it anymore. It was only with the support of the NDP that we were able to reintroduce the mandatory minimum sentence provisions of the bill, a five year mandatory minimum sentence for the first offence and seven years for a second and subsequent offence. Even so, the 10 year mandatory prison sentence that we had proposed for a third and subsequent offence was removed. The bill, as drafted, is better than nothing at all. Canadians are demanding this kind of legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631458"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be comical, if it were not so serious, how the Liberals have managed to flip-flop on the issue of gun crime. The House may recall that through a deathbed conversion late in the election campaign, the Liberals suddenly agreed to get tough on crime and specifically promised to introduce and support tough mandatory minimum sentences for gun crimes. They suddenly got religion so to speak.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631459"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were promises that were made to Canadians about their personal safety, yet here we are. The Liberals are asked to defend Canadians against an ever increasing cycle of gun violence, and what do they do? They have done a 180° turn and have fought against our Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A>. Shame on them. The Liberal Party of Canada has rightly earned its title of being soft on crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631460"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to end the cycle of gun violence, our new Conservative government is committed to filling our election promise to get tough on serious criminals. We owe nothing less to the Canadian public than to protect it to the fullest, and I believe this bill is the way to do that. Effective deterrents, including escalating minimum jail terms, are an important step in reducing crime on our streets, as is choking off the supply of illegally acquired handguns. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631461"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we have these two facets to the bill. One deals with the use of firearms in an offence. The second is the illegal possession of firearms. Typically, if a drug trafficker's car is stopped, guns will be found in that car, so it is easy to prosecute these individuals.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631462"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British Columbians and residents of Abbotsford are tired of watching criminals execute violence and get off with a slap on the wrist. Finally, we have a government that is committed to the right of law-abiding citizens to live in safety and security. That is a promise we made during the election and one on which we are fully following through. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631463"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust the House will do the right thing, protect Canadian families the way we promised to do.</div>

However, in the end I found his remarks to be partisan, simplistic and misleading in many respects. I am not saying everything he said is misleading, but simplistic to be sure. As a result, they are not credible and I will ask him a couple of things.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631465"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that the proposed new sentencing will cause gangs or criminals to reconsider if they really want to go ahead and do the crime. Has he ever been to one of these crime meetings where they sit down and consider if they really want to do the crime? Do they use a calculator? Do they have a lawyer come in and tell them what the sentencing might be if they are convicted? Do they have a chart on the wall and a road map that tells them exactly what the sentence will be?</div>
    </p><a name="Para631466"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have not heard of these meetings, these deliberations, so maybe he could inform the House about where these meetings take place and what they consider. It is a revelation to me that criminals or potential criminals sit down and go through the deliberation about whether they will really do the crime and measure up what the penalty will be.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631467"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing I want to ask the hon. member, and he is really being quite misleading, is this. He said, “The Liberal government, in 13 years, did absolutely nothing to address the issue of firearms crime”. I will not use the harsh words, but what he said is absolutely untrue and misleading. The member clearly omits to mention that the House, under a Liberal government, did enact additional penalties, mandatory minimum penalties of one year and four years for firearm crimes. That does not equal absolutely nothing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631468"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member should be careful about what he says. Could he answer those two questions, please?</div>

    </p><a name="Para631470"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For years the Liberals have been promising to get tough on crime. What the hon. member does not explain is why, during the last election, they promised to impose tougher mandatory minimum sentences for gun crimes and now have done a complete flip-flop. That is embarrassing. Canadians expect more than that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631471"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I being partisan? You bet, Mr. Speaker, I am being partisan. I am standing up for Canadians who deserve to be protected against gangs, drug criminals and those who use guns in committing crimes. They are not only targeting people who are involved in the drug trade, but are impacting innocent bystanders who are being killed and permanently maimed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631472"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the member to reconsider his position, as a party. The Liberal Party should come on side and do what is right for Canadians. I would be ashamed to be a Liberal today. I would be ashamed to stand up and say “We promised to get tough on these gun criminals, but today we are changing our minds and we hope Canadians forget about it”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631473"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage the member to re-evaluate his party's position on this issue. This is an issue that is critical to Canadians.</div>

    </p><a name="Para631475"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the minister said that, I wondered why current projects on the table and accepted by the provinces are subject to cuts when they get to the federal level? Cuts have been made to all prevention projects, even those that are inexpensive.</div>

He said that the government was providing $20 million for prevention. Imagine, $20 million in prevention for all of Canada. The Canada summer jobs program injected $95 million and now has been reduced to $85 million. It is a prevention program because it keeps young people busy, teaches them a trade, and gives them something to do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631477"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experts estimate that between $400 and $500 million are needed for a solid prevention program to be implemented in Canada. Yet, we are talking about only $20 million. What can we do with this amount? That is a pittance.</div>

I want to remind the hon. member that on January 23, 2006, Canadians elected a new Conservative government, certainly not a Bloc government and not a Liberal government. Why? One of the reasons was the Liberals were known to be soft on crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631480"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To specifically to address the member's question, I remind him, just from my own experience in British Columbia, that our Conservative government does take a balanced approach to the issue of crime in our country, ensuring that our youth are not enticed into a life of crime in the first place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631481"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, let me give him an example. We have taken action by giving almost $2 million to British Columbia's anti-gang initiative, which is called “Preventing Youth Gang Violence in British Columbia”. It is going to be implemented in Abbotsford, my hometown, as well as in Vancouver, Surrey, Richmond, Kamloops, and we hope to expand that in the future. It aims to reduce gang involvement through public forums that discuss issues that are relevant to the community, education and awareness campaigns, after school recreation programs, youth mentoring programs, intervention programs, parent education and youth outreach programs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631482"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we have a balanced approach to this? Yes. It is not all about getting tough on crime. That is part of it as is Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A>.

    </p><a name="Para631485"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remind her that it is not only the universal child care benefit that our government has delivered. We have delivered many other family friendly initiatives such as the $500 sports tax credit for families. We have also delivered just recently the family tax credit, which provides an extra incentive for families to take the money and apply it to the children rather than paying it to the tax man.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to also mention that the focus of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A> is not just deterrence. In fact, in my mind deterrence is probably the least of it. For me, it is important that we get the violent offenders out of society so our police can focus in on some of the underlying petty crime that our youth tend to get into. By allowing them to focus their efforts on the criminals who perhaps are on the cusp of becoming lifetime criminals, we are going to do an excellent job of moving forward, ensuring that our youth are encouraged to be upright, responsible citizens.</div>

What the minister was articulating was in part lousy public policy but, from his point of view, good politics.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that the government wanted to send a message. I think he meant the government was trying to send a message to criminals on the assumption that we have in every case identified who those criminals are. He wants to send a message to criminals, but really what the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105824,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105824&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</A> and the government are trying to do is send a political message to Canadians.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78942,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78942&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Yukon</A> mentioned a list of witnesses who appeared before the justice committee, the vast majority of whom had good public policy reasons not to agree with the mandatory minimum sentencing regime proposed in this bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631490"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the assumptions underlying mandatory or harsh sentencing is that it will deter. There is a sense that the higher the sentence, the higher the deterrence. There may be some logic in that, but statistics, sociologists and criminologists now consistently tell us that it is not the severity or length of the sentence which deters, it is the prospect of being caught that is the major component of deterrence in society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631491"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is a potential life sentence or a two day sentence, the person who may or may not commit a premeditated crime is thinking more about the prospect of getting away with it as opposed to what sentence might be imposed later. It is false logic to presume that by increasing sentencing or imposing a mandatory minimum sentence there will be a direct linkage into the mind of a potential criminal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631492"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the same token, my party and I readily accept that there are envelopes within the Criminal Code, components of activity where society needs to denounce the criminal activity in a way that requires the use of a mandatory minimum. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631493"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will point out for the sake of reference that the Criminal Code was amended relatively recently, just in the last three or four years, to impose one year mandatory minimums for firearm offences and a four year mandatory minimum sentence for a robbery with a firearm. I believe that is section 344. We also have mandatory minimums for drunk driving, particularly on a second offence. If someone reoffends, the offender will do time. Parliament, government and Canadians accept the existence of mandatory minimum penalties. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631494"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The false logic underlying this bill, however, is that by creating and delivering a whole raft of mandatory minimum penalties, it will cause a direct response and a reduction in crime. This is not the way it works. I do not think any credible witness at the committee that reviewed this bill was prepared to accept that if we bump all these sentences into mandatory minimums, the crime rate is going to drop. There might have been a feel good part in putting criminals away.</div>

I found it hard to believe, but the Minister of Justice said that the criminals will have time to think about it in jail. The question raised by the member from the Bloc Québécois was whether or not the potential offender might have thought about it before he or she committed the offence. The minister's logic was the person would have time to think about it afterward. That is like the horse going out the barn door; once the act is done, it is done. There is no deterrence there. I regretted that logic and I regretted the fact that the minister did not want to address the logic pattern that was introduced by the member from the Bloc.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister was also, in my view, trying to send a message and another example of that messaging is a quite inappropriate use of the term “house arrest”.

    </p><a name="Para631497"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most Canadians would ask what is house arrest, does it have something to do with bail or prison? Anyway, if the minister wants to use these silly street terms instead of the proper terms, that is his business. He also referred to “sending the offender to camp”. What nonsense. We are hearing this from the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105824,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105824&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</A>.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I thought that his use of the terms “house arrest” and “sending people to camp” was really a disingenuous and dishonest attempt to deprecate our current corrections procedures. I personally do not like that coming from a government minister, but that is his business and if he were here now, we would probably have a little debate on it. Having had an opportunity to address the minister's remarks on this bill, I will now get to some of my own.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> Maybe you should.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631500"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Derek Lee:</b> Well, maybe I won't. The member does not like my remarks about the minister but this is a public forum.</div>

    </p><a name="Para631503"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, I want to note that throughout the country there is a perception that there has been an increase in violent crime. In the statistical data if we look back into the 1960s and forward to the present, we can see an increase in crime. Many criminologists say it is actually an increase in reported crime. The criminal activity of the 1960s and early in the 1970s, was in fact arguably under reported so that our data was a little bit lower than it actually should have been. In any event, the trend line was there. We can see the material increase from the 1960s right up to 1992.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631504"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1992 things changed sociologically. I do not believe it was anything government did or did not do. We were in a bit of an economic recession at the time but we can see the trend line. After that point in time, all criminal activity starts to drop. I still accept that there is a perception in society, that people see a lot more crime. They are certainly getting a lot more media. We have more television, more newspapers and more Internet. If there is something happening out there in crime, people are going to hear about it and that may exacerbate the public policy problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631505"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying there is not any crime. There is a truckload of it and it is a social issue, but it is not increasing in the way that people are being led to believe that it is. In Toronto there was a sense that we had of a very serious firearm problem about two years ago. That was true. There was a clear spike and increase in the number of shootings and firearm incidents in Toronto. As I am going to point out a little later, that year 2005 turns out to be spike, a spike up and down. Things are actually quite different now. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in looking at crime statistics from across the country, I can see that not every city, not every urban area or every rural area is in the same position. There are cities in Canada that have crime rates almost double what they are in Toronto or Montreal. That may seem counterintuitive to many of us, but while big cities do have crime, small cities also have crime. In some cases the rates of crimes, not necessarily the raw incidents, are significantly higher than some of our other urban areas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631507"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these places across Canada, citizens definitely have an issue. I represent a Toronto area riding. It is impossible for me to speak about this issue without acknowledging that in various parts of the country, the north, the east, the west, the south, there are different takes, different perceptions of just how bad or how good or where the level of criminal activity is.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631508"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before going on any further, on the sentencing that is currently in the Criminal Code, including the existing mandatory minimums that I mentioned earlier for firearms, my party in the last election campaign did undertake to increase the mandatory minimum penalties. The member opposite makes that point, but the increases that were proposed were an increase of the one year and four year penalties that were there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631509"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the government had proposed in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A> was a whole regime of increasing mandatory minimums, an escalating scheme of mandatory minimums that ran three, five, seven and up to 10 years. That is a much different kettle of fish than what the Liberal Party had proposed, of targeted, specific, reasonable mandatory minimum adjustments in the Criminal Code. Maybe we could put that debate to rest. Was it discussed in the election? It sure was, but I wanted to be clear about what my party had proposed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631510"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not talking about creating a new offence. This bill does not create new offences. This bill does not create new sentences. All of that is already in the Criminal Code. What the bill does, and I could say only, is create a mandatory minimum sentence at the bottom end. Judges in this country are charged with sentencing and they can give the appropriate sentence and they do. Ninety-nine per cent of the time they give the right sentence. They can sentence to more than the mandatory minimum and sometimes they do, but it depends on a whole number of criteria set out in the Criminal Code. We legislated them here about 10 years ago. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view the criminal justice system from the point of view of the sentencing regime is working quite well. Once in a while there is an aberration. Once in a while there is a circumstance in a court and a judge and a set of facts that looks a little odd. A newspaper, a television station, a reporter will see it and think it looks strange, that a penalty looks a little stiff, or that a penalty looks a little light and it becomes a public issue, but those cases are far and few between. We just see a lot more of them now because we have a lot more media. If it is a story, it is a story.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one of the comments on this bill earlier today there was a scenario that I found very compelling at the committee. It relates to sentencing in the rural areas, in the north, the west and the east of the country, but generally in the north. We have to remember that before someone is actually sentenced, there has to be an investigation, the person is charged, convicted in a trial and then is sentenced.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225">(1225)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para631513"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A witness at the committee made this point in a very compelling way. When there is a conviction in a northern community for an offence, even if a violent one, the only prospect for rehabilitation and reintegration of an offender from those northern communities is if he or she is able to be in that community. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631514"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is just not possible to take offenders from a northern community, yank them out, send them to some place in the south and hope that they can rehabilitate or reintegrate. They are not from the south. They are citizens of our north.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631515"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instituting a mandatory minimum regime of sentences over two years essentially ensures a federal sentence. All sentences over two years are served in federal penitentiaries. Sentences under two years are served in provincial penitentiaries. By imposing mandatory minimums way beyond the two years, this type of sentencing would remove individuals from their northern communities and place them in a federal penitentiary, which could be a thousand miles away or two thousand miles away, but not even close to their communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631516"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is generally accepted that prisons are simply warehouses for offenders, where young people actually learn better how to become criminals. Prisons are not the best location. I accept that we need them to protect society, at least as a clearing house, but the witness from the north said that the existence of these new sentencing regimes with mandatory minimums greater than two years would make it virtually impossible to rehabilitate and reintegrate offenders from those northern communities. In other words, we are creating lost causes before we even begin.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631517"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may ask me what I would propose for someone who has committed a serious crime and needs to do serious time. The criminal justice system has already provided for that with a regime of sentencing options and a skilled judge who will make the decision on what an appropriate sentence for that convicted offender will be, taking into consideration all aspects of the case, including the circumstances of the victim, previous criminal record, propensity to reoffend and prospects for rehabilitation. That is what we ask our judges to do. The escalating sentencing regime contained in this bill would, practically speaking, remove all of those options from a sentencing judge. If the bill passes, that will be the case. I regret that but that is the way it is.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the remarks of my friend opposite, he referred to the spike this year in Toronto of gun crimes. I am pleased to report that while in 2005-06 the incidents of shootings were at about 87 and 81, this year the number of shootings to date is at 60, which is a drop of over 25%. The reason for that is good policing. However, I do not have time to go into the details. One shooting is too many but if we have a huge city with a few million people, we will have incidents, and I am saying that there has been a 25% drop. The perceived increase in these firearm incidents is not there, and these decreases have occurred under current laws. I just wanted to get that on the record. I give a lot of credit to the Toronto police and their new policing methods.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will point out to my colleague that in the province of Quebec—my province—there is a body, namely the Société de l'assurance automobile du Québec, which has an obligation to protect citizens and in particular to make recommendations to the federal government, since we are responsible for the Criminal Code, on harsher sentences for alcohol-related offences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631521"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My response to my colleague's theory is as follows. When I started practising law, the fine for someone who had consumed alcohol was only $300. We subsequently created three different levels with different penalties for each of the first three offences. This is called the progressive system. If we had heeded my colleague at that time, today there would be but a single $300 offence, and everybody would be fine with that. The criminals would be protected but the victims left out. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631522"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask a question of my colleague, my fellow committee member, whom I appreciate for his good advice on procedural matters. Even if his party is opposed to the bill, I know very well that his fellow citizens will agree with us, because the people of Canada do want to see victims protected before criminals. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631523"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does my colleague not agree with imposing progressive penalties for criminal acts, particularly in these specific cases where extremely serious offences are involved? We are not talking about minor situations, but extremely serious ones. We have been doing that same thing for over 20 years, and the most clear example of this is section 259 of the Criminal Code which, as my colleague is well aware, sets progressive sanctions for criminal acts. </div>

Those penalties, of course, start off with a mandatory fine and then the offender will do time after a second offence. The person will not do seven years, but the person will do a few weeks, although I do not recall exactly how many weeks. The point is that with the mandatory minimum the offender will do time. There is an escalator for a third offence and the offender will do more time. However, we are talking about doing time as opposed to doing years and years of time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631525"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I would object to the escalating three, five, seven and ten-year type escalation is that the three, five, seven and ten years have never been shown to provide any more public safety. If it is necessary to keep the individual in jail because the person is a very violent offender, then the judge should impose a lengthy sentence of that nature.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631526"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I object to the automatic, structured, built-in, no exception mandatory minimum in the bill running up to seven years. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What really jumped out at me was his statement that “the sentencing regime is working quite well”. In other words, business as usual, no change is required and even though Canadians misunderstand, everything is okay.</div>

I said that the current sentencing regime in the Criminal Code was generally working all right. However, there has never been a time in the history of the human race when there has not been a problem with crime, let us say, ever since Cain killed Abel. There also has never been a time when we have not found the need to alter the Criminal Code. We are always adjusting. I have been here for 19 years and I can hardly recall a year when there was not a Criminal Code amendment on the order paper somewhere. There are 15 of them now.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631533"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is that it is one thing to respond to public perception that there is a problem but it is another thing to analyze it from a public policy point of view to see exactly what the problem is and what the best response is. A whole bunch of knee-jerking, increase the sentencing and get tough on crime things, without dealing with the public policy issue in detail and with precision is not my way of doing things.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631534"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a problem is seen, I really do want to address it. If a weak sentence in a particular case or systemically is a problem for society, if we saw one place where we, as a society, had to really firm up, like we did with drunk driving and with firearm offences three years ago, and as we might need to do in other things in society, I am prepared to do that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631535"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I do not support is the approach in the current bill that simply lists about 20 different things and says that we will now impose an escalating three, five, seven, ten-year thing where we know statistically, based on corrections' social science, there is no payback unless we need to keep an offender in because he or she is a danger.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our justice critic has made it very clear that where we can use it in a very specific way, and the issue of drunk driving would be one of those instances, it can be very effective.

I will start and see where we end up.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631546"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was listening to the debate on the monitor in my office for the entire morning and trying to get a lot of things done, but I could not help but come over and try to get involved with the debate to some degree because there are a few things that I would like to point out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631547"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just very recently we heard a speech from the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78861,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78861&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Abbotsford</A> that was what I considered to be a talk that was coming from the hearts, the souls and the minds of ordinary people in his riding. A lot of ordinary people are out there wondering what is going on and what is happening.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631548"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a lot of respect for lawyers, I really do, but they seem to approach things with a totally different idea than a lot of us do. I say that simply because it is difficult to understand them when they begin their lingo. Their language becomes so legalistic that it is difficult to know exactly where they are at and their comeback always is that the problem with people like me, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78861,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78861&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Abbotsford</A> and others is that we are just too simplistic. I have heard that term so many times that it just about drives me crazy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631549"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a simplistic answer, they say, when what we are doing is expressing this in terms as best we can, as every member can, and I know that you are the same, Mr. Speaker. We listen to the people in our ridings. They are really fed up with some of the things that are happening in our justice system. They want a truly good justice system. It appears to have turned into more of a legal system, where we are constantly engaging in debates as to what this term means and what that term means, et cetera, such that we lose sight of some things, that is, the public is not happy with the way that the justice system is operating. That is it, pure and simple. The public is not pleased. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631550"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members can check any poll, or if they like they can conduct their own in their own riding. Even the Liberal member who just spoke can do that in his own riding with just ordinary people out there. Members can forget about those ordinary people being simplistic. Members should just remember that they are the people who are thriving in this country, who are working and paying their taxes, and they want the services rendered by this government to be efficient and effective.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631551"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the best things we can do to answer a lot of their concerns is provide a system that will make society as safe as possible and will protect society as a whole. One of the most elemental duties that we have as members of Parliament is to come up with legislation that will do that. I think we all try hard to do that, even in our own way of thinking, which too often is referred to by too many people in this House as simplistic.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631552"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day that I really started getting more concerned than I ever had in the past was the day I saw 14 farmers, and prior to that another two, hauled away from a court, in shackles and chains, and going off to jail to serve consecutive sentences. Consecutive sentences meant that for each crime they had to serve a specific amount of time before they began to serve the next one. The courts do not usually sentence people consecutively; they sentence them concurrently. Clifford Olson, for example, is serving a life sentence for the death of 11 people, but he is only serving one. He probably should be serving 11 life sentences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631553"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These farmers were hauled off to jail. They were taken to jail in shackles and chains, in most cases in front of their wives and children. For what? For selling their own grain, their own product that they raised on their farms with their own hard-working hands. They broke the law because they went across the border and tried to sell their grain. Nobody is denying that it was a disobedient thing to do and nobody is denying that maybe there should have been some charges. That is not the question.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631554"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is this: how did the punishment fit the crime? How well did we do in that department? We had farmers who worked hard to raise their own crops and who, in a form of civil disobedience, made a move to try to make more money, more profit, for their farms, which are struggling all the time. How well did we do when the Liberal government in power at the time did nothing about the fact that all these people were hauled off to jail?</div>
    </p><a name="Para631555"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Ed Fast:</b> That's the Liberal way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631556"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Myron Thompson:</b> That is the Liberal way. That is what I was thinking. This is not right. There is something wrong with that picture.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1250"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250">(1250)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para631557"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, somebody might say that is a simplistic way of thinking, but it is not. The punishment should fit the crime. I see nothing wrong with that philosophy. Yet when we check on various other aspects of sentencing, we see that offenders actually receive house arrest or community service when they commit a violent offence. All of this was going on at the same time that those 14 farmers were hauled off to jail for selling their own grain. But that is probably simplistic talk. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631558"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Millions of Canadians are wondering when we are going to stop all this nonsense and start addressing crime. They want us to send out a strong, loud and clear message that it is not acceptable for criminals to hurt people or their property or do something that is against the law. It blows my mind that some members cannot grasp that concept.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631559"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet on one occasion a bunch of farmers were hauled off to jail in shackles and chains for selling their own grain. They were hauled off in front of their crying wives and kids. I was there and I saw it. I talked to the wives and the children after the event was over and those farmers were locked up and the doors were slammed shut. It was that day that I vowed we had to get some common sense into the minds of the people here in the House of Commons. We need to realize that this kind of activity is not right.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631560"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we prepared legislation. We want to get tough on crime so we brought in minimum mandatory sentencing for the use of a gun in the commission of a crime. We are trying to send the message that it is not acceptable to use guns for the purpose of committing crimes. We are telling criminals that it is not going to be tolerated. We are going to get tougher. We are telling criminals that minimum mandatory sentences will be the result. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631561"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this going to deter criminals? As people say, it probably will not go through the minds of a lot of them. I do not disagree with that. That is not the point. The point is this: is the punishment going to fit the crime? Is it going to match up? Yes, we are starting to take serious action, particularly against people in cases of violence and who use guns in the commission of a crime. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631562"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of examples out there. There is not a member in this House of Commons who cannot think of one particular instance where house arrest or community service was the punishment for a crime of violence. It is a shameful disgrace to this place. Unfortunately, many of the crimes I know of were crimes against children, the most vulnerable in our society, who are treated with the least respect.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631563"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are trying to bring forward a piece of legislation that will send a message that this House of Commons is not going to tolerate violent crimes. We are going to do our very best to make certain that criminals pay the price for their crimes, that they get a penalty they deserve. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631564"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, at the same time, we have to work very hard with earlier programs and prevention activities. I was in a schoolhouse for 30 years and 90% of my time was spent trying to prevent kids from getting into trouble. However, they learned after a period of time, and they knew that once they crossed the line they were going to be held responsible for their actions. They knew that the punishment would not be pleasant. I was trying to send out a message that I did not tolerate the activity that took place and I wanted it to cease. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1255"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255">(1255)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para631565"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it really discouraging when we get a debate going in the House of Commons and the best argument I keep hearing is, “I listened to the speech by the fellow from Abbotsford and he was far too simplistic”. Good grief, he is talking the hearts and minds of the people in his riding who discuss these very issues day in and day out with every one of us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631566"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be frank. I am pretty simplistic and I will be as simplistic as I can. I am sick and tired of this nonsense. I am really sick and tired of it. I have acquaintances, friends of mine, who have lost loved ones and have had no real closure because the perpetrator is going to be released on parole very soon who took the life of an individual. They do not understand why their loved one is gone forever and the perpetrator, who committed the most sadistic crimes of sexual assault and murder, is going to be released back into our society soon. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631567"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can all rub our hands together and say we have done a wonderful job. I want us to think about that just a little, just start thinking about it a little more. Does the punishment fit the crime? If it does not, then let us do something about it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631568"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105824,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105824&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Justice</A> who brought this bill forward and wants to do something about it. None of us has any magic answers as to what we can do that will make it better, but we have to concentrate on all the possibilities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631569"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, when individuals cross the line and use a gun in the commission of a crime, the penalty will be stiff. It will be tough. If that does not work, we may have to make it tougher. We have to get a message out that this is not the society we want to live in. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631570"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it takes a few million dollars more to build another penitentiary to keep people like that off the streets, then let us do it. What is wrong with that? I always thought keeping criminals behind bars was a wise thing to do. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631571"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are small communities in rural Alberta that do not have police on every corner or do not have access to police. There are small businesses and little grocery or hardware stores in small towns where it would take a policeman half an hour to get to once a crime has been committed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631572"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do they live? They live behind bars. They have bars on every window and door. They are doing everything they can to protect their property and keep criminals from coming in. They unlock their doors, enter their businesses, slam their doors and work throughout the day behind bars because they are afraid of the people on the street running free. There must be too many of them because there are constant troubles of breaking and entering and destroying property. Hopefully, they do not run into any these people while they are at work because it could be dangerous.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631573"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that people do not believe that I am being too simplistic. I have lots of friends and relatives who all work hard and pay their taxes. The least I can do for them while I am here, I hope, is to make certain that we have people in this place who are willing to decide that criminals are not a good thing in our society and we are going to do the very best we can do take care of it. Then we get into these legal matters and opinions which most of us, including me, do not understand when conversations are engaged in with witnesses in committee. When the Bar Association representatives have discussions with members who have law degrees, they lose me most times. I admit that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631574"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened to one speech today about the expert witnesses who are against this bill. I do not know why they are considered to be expert witnesses when people who agree with the bill, like the police and many others, are not referred to as expert witnesses. In other words, if witnesses agree with that member's idea of what the bill should look like, then they are experts and if they do not, they must not be experts. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631575"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police made a very good presentation in regard to their support for this bill and others associated with it. It made very good sense. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We certainly did not get into any legal wrangling because they would lose me, but we can converse and society as a whole can converse. I simply say “Wake up, folks, wake up”. The public out there is not satisfied with the way the justice system is working.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631577"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If people do not believe me, get on those little computers and newspapers and put out all kinds of polls and ask: “Folks in my riding, are you satisfied with the way our justice system operates, yes or no”? Then people will see how satisfied Canadians are. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631578"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are not satisfied. They are paying for something they are not satisfied with. I say let us work hard to give them something that they are paying for and that they will be satisfied with. I believe in satisfying the customer.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631579"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that is too radical or too extreme for some members of the House, then that is too bad. That is the way it ought to be. That is the way people are telling me in my riding it ought to be. As long as I can stand on my two feet in this place I am going to expound that. That is the way it ought to be. </div>

Let Canadians know that we are not being simplistic about it, but that we are sincere about it. If people think I am not sincere then give me a test.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631581"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know if I have any time left, but I do not think I need to say any more. I have just about said all I want to say and all I can say. For the love of me, I cannot understand what goes through the minds of individuals who simply say that the punishment fitting the crime is not right.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631582"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will revert once again to that day that I saw farmers hauled off in shackles and chains for selling grain. I do not think there was a person in the entire public society of Canada that cheered that day, not one. “Yes, we are going to teach those farmers a lesson”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631583"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say it is not a deterrent to do these other things, but they certainly thought that would be a deterrent. It is not about deterrents. It is about punishment fitting the crime, letting society know as a whole that it is not acceptable to hurt people in this country, that it is not acceptable to destroy their property or steal from them. It is a wrong thing to do. It is a very wrong thing to do and we are going to take tough action. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631584"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am thankful that we have a minister sitting in that seat that wants to do just that. I thank the House for the time. I did not intend to speak today, but I could not resist after hearing many of the things that I heard this morning. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631585"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope people will give this bill a second thought before they react to the bill with such negativism and criticism that says we are too simplistic because we mean what we say and we are going to get the job done. It has not been done for years. Now is the time to get it done.</div>

That is what we are here to do. I have worked with the member on the justice committee. We do not always agree, but most of the time we do and it has been a good run over a number of years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631587"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wanted to ask two questions. The first one is really a comment. In the matter involving the grain farmers who were ultimately jailed, as I recall it, I believe they were fined by the court. When they came back to court, not having paid their fines, not because they could not afford to but because they refused in protest to pay the fines, I believe the court had no alternative but to resort to either imprisonment or contempt. The court resorted to the short jailing. So the member is correct. It happened, but the sequence involved more than just selling grain and going to jail. It was more complex than that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631588"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the member not think that in this House from time to time we are forced by reason of the federal jurisdiction to focus on only two things when it comes to response to criminal activity? The only thing we can do federally is write the Criminal Code and from time to time set the sentencing range. That is all we get to do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631589"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With criminal activity there has to be an offence, an investigation, it may need police intelligence gathering, a charge, a conviction, and a sentence, but we only write the law and deal with the sentencing. The provinces and the cities do the policing, the investigation, and the prosecution is done by the provinces. So, we actually may be kind of frustrated from time to time that we do not have a greater role on the ground in the components.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631590"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the member not think that out of frustration from time to time we federally may tend to overemphasize our role in that whole complex thing with just the law and the sentencing?</div>

It is strange that such things as house arrest, community service or those kinds of penalties did not enter the minds of the court. It was jail. The farmers did not comply. Jail. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631592"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am talking about the punishment fitting the crime. They did not pay a fine. Jail. I guess the Liberals do not get the picture. It is not the idea of how much more was involved in it. That was the event that took place. Did the punishment fit the crime? The answer in Canadian society was no, not even close. Unfortunately, the answer is also no in society when we ask if the punishment fits the crime in so many of our violent crimes that take place. The answer is still no.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As legislators, we write the laws and what is wrong with providing sentences that we believe, from our discussions with our constituents, are more in line with the thinking of society as a whole which pays for a system that it wants to work on its behalf. We must write laws that make it possible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631594"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have many laws. Sometimes I do not think we need to write any more laws. I look at the maximum penalties on some of these charges and my goodness, when is the last time we ever had a maximum penalty issued in Canada? So, I guess the judges need a little nudging from minimum penalties to nudge them toward a little more severity in their sentencing.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not feel that the solution proposed in the bill is the right one. For example, in the United States, more criminals are incarcerated and the crime rate is much higher than it is here. It has been proven that the homicide rate is three times higher in the United States than in Canada. Maximum or additional prison time does not have the desired results. I do not believe that anyone here thinks that people in big cities such as New York or Chicago feel safer because more people are put in jail. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, I would direct my colleague to the budget cuts the government is making to get to the source of the problem. The summer career placement program was cut by $10 million this year. The are not consulting those who live in the communities, and decisions are made by civil servants who are not necessarily aware of the needs. Young people absolutely need these jobs. The government's budget cuts could leave these kids with nothing to do, and perhaps they will become criminals. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know what my colleague thinks about that. Should the government not get to the source of the problem, rather than further punishing the criminals?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But even better, the number of violent crimes—homicide, attempted murder, assault, assault with a weapon, sexual assault, kidnapping and robbery—fell year over year between 1992 and 2004.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a fundamental principle, one that has been stated by the Supreme Court of Canada. I hope that the 308 members in this House respect that institution. The Supreme Court of Canada has said, and reiterated, that when sentence is to be passed, one of the essential factors is the individualization of sentences. What that means, in words that are easy to understand, is that when a person comes before the court, the judge must impose a sentence that fits the person standing before the judge. I know that, unfortunately, these are not words that the member from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78373,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78373&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Wild Rose</A> and a majority of the Conservative Party members want to hear. They should go and read the Supreme Court’s decisions. I am not the one who wrote them. Personally, I have enormous respect for the Supreme Court and what it has said, which I repeat: the sentence must be individualized and must fit the individual.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631621"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What that means is that when an individual receives a sentence, we must tell that person or make him or her understand that the crime is serious and that society condemns that crime. However, in the sentence that the judge is about to render, an important factor must be considered: the possible rehabilitation of the individual. On that point, once again, I address myself to the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78373,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78373&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Wild Rose</A> and his colleagues in the Conservative party. Following recent amendments, the court must take into account the impact of the crime on the victim. In English, that is known as an impact statement. The victims come into the court and give testimony to explain the impact of the crime on them. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631622"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would say to the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78373,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78373&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Wild Rose</A> and his colleagues in the Conservative party that since this measure came into force less than 10% of victims come before the court.

What we are saying is that an individual who receives a sentence must serve time in prison and, if he or she serves a prison sentence, that person should be eligible for parole. Could someone be paroled too quickly? That is a debate that we should have soon in this House. However, we will not solve this problem by tying the hands of judges with minimum sentences.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill will not solve the problem.

Perhaps judges must be given instructions. In my opinion—at least, I hope this will be the case—there will always be courts of appeal and the Supreme Court to review, study and analyze the appropriateness of a sentence, and to confirm if it was handed down in accordance with the sentencing rules governing the courts. That is what I would like the members opposite to understand, as well as those who are about to vote in favour of a bill that not only is incomplete and fails to solve the problem of violent crime, but will only exacerbate the existing backlogs in our court rooms. If this bill passes, there will be more backlogs. Criminal defence lawyers will make a pile of money. I can guarantee it.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I find regrettable as well as that huge investments are also planned for the prisons.

I too have been inside on a number of occasions to visit clients, unfortunately. Penitentiaries are schools for crime. No one in this House can convince me otherwise.

    </p><a name="Para631639"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout my career, I asked my clients questions, as did others when they were inside. What I asked is whether they would have thought twice about committing such a crime, had they known there was a minimum three year jail time for it. They said no. When a person has made up his mind to commit a crime, he will do anything to make sure he does. We must stop holding on to this belief that crime will be reduced if prison time is increased. It is a false belief. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631640"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we must do is to work as quickly as possible at solving the problems that are the causes. What must be done in particular is to start thinking seriously that there may be a problem at time of release. What I mean by that is that people may be getting out a bit too soon.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not difficult to figure out.

We could put him away for centuries, but that will not solve the problem. He must come to the realization that he has a problem, he must accept it and take steps to deal with it.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke to them. I did everything I could to make them understand that it does not make any sense to pass such a bill, unless they are getting ready to join the Conservative Party, which I doubt. Either that, or they are playing more politics. In a matter as important as fighting crime, we should avoid playing politics, which only serves a small group and will truly deny many people their rights.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all I can say. With all due respect to my NDP colleagues, I would invite them to reconsider their position. That being said, I understand the Conservatives.

He talked about victims' impact statements and about victims being involved in this. He said that victims' statements should be part of sentencing, and that would be good, but that only a limited number of victims got involved in the victims' impact statement process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631660"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might suggest that the reason for that is the limited time they see the person who committed a crime against them getting. They may not want to be involved in sitting across the table with the person who victimized them so that the person could get out early and victimize them again. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631661"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also said, in answer to the question asked by the member for Wild Rose, that the best sentence was the sentence that the client accepts. I love it that we are judging the sentences on how well the criminal likes them and that we should tailor the sentence to fit the individual. Again, we should set sentences based on what the perpetrator should say.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631662"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went on to say that perhaps we should look at the parole system in closing off the end of it so that if people were not getting out early we could probably accomplish what we are trying to accomplish by putting them in for longer</div>
    </p><a name="Para631663"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not certain how opening or closing either end of this works but I will just quickly get to how we protect the victim. One of the greatest ways is to have the person incarcerated at the time when they might have committed the crime and then the crime would not occur at all. What we are suggesting by mandatory minimums is that people are actually in jail rather than out perpetrating crimes.</div>

    </p><a name="Para631672"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill has been brought back to the House with significant changes after being reviewed by the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. But behind the scenes, an unholy alliance has developed between the reactionary minority Conservative government and the NDP. Together, these two parties put back a series of regressive provisions, ruining the good work of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. I think that the newly amended bill is simply not good legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631673"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am happy that this bill has shed some light on the debate on mandatory minimum penalties.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631674"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I am proud to speak, and I invite my fellow members to follow the lead of the Liberals and vote against the bill as newly amended.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631675"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill the government initially introduced proposed heavier minimum sentences for repeat offences, despite the views expressed by experts on the fight against crime. In addition, the bill even went so far as to add offences unrelated to the crime in question to the previous convictions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631676"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to remind this House why the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights so substantially amended the initial bill. The opposition members on the committee were very reluctant to introduce escalating minimum sentences depending on the number of previous convictions.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para631677"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In undertaking this tack, the committee members were simply agreeing with most of the expert evidence they heard. In the opinion of all the experts, and it is perhaps rather surprising, there is no proof that minimum terms of imprisonment deter offenders who commit serious crimes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631678"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In certain cases, in California, for example, the method seems to have actually been counterproductive. The annual rate of serious crime has risen since this type of sentencing was introduced. This is the conclusion of the recent report by a commission set up to study the California correctional system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631679"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 2005, the Little Hoover Commission submitted to the governor of California its report on what it called “California's corrections crisis”. The report highlights the major failure of the Californian “three strikes and you're out” system. It raises serious questions about the Californian model of sentencing, which there is called “determinate sentencing”. Here in Canada, it is called “minimum mandatory penalties”. In other words, its determinate sentence is the U.S. equivalent of the mandatory minimums that the Conservative government wishes to not implement, but to make even harsher and escalating here in Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631680"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report of the Little Hoover Commission of California is clear:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;California has one of the highest recidivism rates in the nation. Furthermore, Governor Schwarzenegger himself described the California prison system as a powder keg.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631683"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it not absurd that at the very moment that Americans are trying to fix their flawed system, Canada, under the Conservative minority retrograde government, is trying to copy the American's old and utterly proven to be inefficient model?</div>
    </p><a name="Para631684"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The American model of escalating minimum mandatory sentences is a failed model. Why in God's name, for heaven's sake, would Canadians want to follow a failed model? We want to follow models of excellence. The American model of determinate sentencing, and in particular escalating determinate sentencing, which is the equivalent of the Canadian mandatory minimum sentencing or penalties, is a failed model. In fact, since 2003, some 25 American states have eliminated their lengthy minimum mandatory penalties and their escalator penalties.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631685"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criticisms of mandatory minimum sentencing are based on very sound arguments. It has more than its share of drawbacks. Often, and because of the excessively serious consequences it can have, what happens is charges are withdrawn or pleas are modified to get the charges changed and diminished. Equally often, the threat of a mandatory minimum sentence will discourage an accused person from pleading guilty, which obviously results in greater costs and delays for the system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631686"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, this type of measure can also make a jury hesitate to convict, not because of the accused's actual guilt or innocence, because the sentence strikes the jury as being unjustly harsh, given the crime committed, given the accused, given the victim and given the real and proven impact on the victim and the community.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631687"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, it is known that mandatory minimum sentencing seems, as evidenced by the Australian and American experiences, to hit harder at members of certain ethnocultural communities, blacks and aboriginals. That certainly is not an outcome that Canada should be seeking.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paradoxically, the increase in mandatory minimum sentences suggested in the newly amended bill would have cost Canada's justice system an exorbitant amount of money. Does this government realize that, by proposing to increase the number and length of minimum sentences and decrease the number of conditional sentences, it would have added a huge number of inmates to our already overcrowded penitentiaries, according to its own <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78755,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78755&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Public Safety</A>?</div>
    </p><a name="Para631689"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Neil Boyd of Simon Fraser University, Canada would have to build no fewer than 23 new prisons to house all these new inmates. At $82,000 a year per inmate, the bill this government initially introduced would have cost Canadian taxpayers an additional $220 million to $245 million over five years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631690"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, this new obsession with sending people to prison systematically will obviously lead to other additional costs, because it is reasonable to assume that, with this attitude, appeals and lengthy trials will become increasingly common. Mandatory minimum sentences are therefore not the best way of dealing with crime in Canada. They restrict judges' discretionary power to look at the particular circumstances of a case. We should use mandatory minimum sentences very sparingly to target specific offences and, above all, we should limit them to first offences. That is what Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2136785,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2136785&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-82</A>, introduced under the former Liberal government, sought to do.</div>

    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para631691"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole point of minimum sentencing is its effect on an individual committing a first offence, taking into consideration the impact on the victim of that offence and on the community where the offence took place. It is designed to take the person guilty of serious wrongdoing out of his or her community for awhile in order to prevent that person from committing other crimes, while at the same time ensuring the community is not put at risk again. In such cases, this kind of sentencing serves its purpose very well. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631692"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with escalating minimum mandatory sentencing, proposed in the newly amended version of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A>, was that they applied to repeat offenders. What was initially proposed would have forbidden judges, in the case of a recidivist, to tailor an appropriate sentence that took into account the criminal, himself or herself, the particular circumstances and nature of the new crime, the impact on the victim and the community and the background situation and the possibility of rehabilitation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631693"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of a repeat offence, a judge needs to be able to consider all these factors in order to determine an appropriate sentence. With escalating minimum sentences, this is impossible. With this bill, as it has been amended at report stage by the government with the collusion of the NDP, it will now be impossible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631694"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newly amended bill shows that the government wants to bring its so-called crime fighting strategy into line with the repressive approach favoured in the United States by the very right wing. The Conservative Party is proposing to emulate a model that does not work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631695"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might add that the NDP's support for this style of justice is baffling, at the very least. Once again the NDP is sacrificing its progressive roots for short term political gain and being the enabler of the right wing agenda of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631696"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at a few facts. The difference in rates of serious offences between our two countries is astonishing. For example, according to Statistics Canada, and that is not a left wing organization, the rates for robberies are 59% higher in the United States than in Canada. What about the rates for aggravated assault? They are 85% higher in the United States than in Canada. What about the murder rates? The murder rates are 275% higher south of our border than they are in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631697"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure my hon. colleagues will be interested to learn that a Calgary resident is 840% less likely to be the victim of murder than a resident of Dallas. If we want to compare the degree of safety of our two capital cities, a resident of Washington, D.C. is 2,700% more likely than his or her Ottawa counterpart to be the victim of a serious crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631698"></a><p>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to have played a role in bringing about these significant legislative changes under the last Liberal government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631758"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, much of the credit must go to the activists within the GLBT community itself. They fought long and hard to bring the bitter realities of their inequality to the attention of Canadians, using the court challenges program to demand their minority rights under the charter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631759"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, other minority groups such as transgendered persons, who still face discrimination in law, have no such recourse. </div>
    </p><a name="Para631760"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Conservative government, like the old Conservative government, cancelled the Liberal initiated court challenges program, effectively denying disadvantaged groups in Canada access to justice.</div>
    </p><a name="Para631761"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this International Day Against Homophobia, we need to remind ourselves that in today's Canada minority groups can no longer take their rights for granted.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This happens to be a fairly ambitious agenda. That is the nature of this government. He may not like seeing a government that wants to get things done, but the reality is I was answering the question he asked.</div>

    </p><a name="Para632014"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members of Parliament, we carry out our everyday work following a code and a set of ethics. I have had the good fortune of having been here for almost 19 years. This is my first experience that I have seen a minister telling committee members how to do their work. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105834,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105834&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Citizenship and Immigration</A> sent a letter to all members of the committee intimidating us as to how we carry on our work. I would like to refer to a few passages from the letter. It reads:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, Mr. Speaker, this is telling civil servants not to be accountable to this House. It continues:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this is a repeated circumstance by the Conservative government in this current Parliament, I would ask, Mr. Speaker, that you investigate this matter.

    </p><a name="Para632023"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member accused me of instructing witnesses from my department of withholding information. This is a very serious allegation, as intimidation of witnesses is clearly inappropriate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632024"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I submit that the member's question of privilege is not valid for two reasons. First, there is no evidence that the situation described by the hon. member constitutes a prima facie breach of privilege. At most, this is a debate about the interpretation of facts. Second, this concerns proceedings at the standing committee. Since the standing committee has not presented a report on this matter, this matter cannot be considered in the House as a valid question of privilege.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632025"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now if I may present the factual situation, Mr. Speaker, the citizenship and immigration committee was hearing witnesses from my department during a committee meeting on May 2, 2007. During this meeting the atmosphere and manner of questioning the departmental witnesses was hostile and some of the witnesses felt intimidated.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632026"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, I wrote to the chair of the committee, copying the members, following this meeting, expressing my concern over the intimidation of witnesses. I informed the chair that I had instructed the deputy minister of the department to instruct any future witnesses from the department that they should put their response in writing at a later date if they were in doubt of information that was required at the time of the questioning. I also instructed the deputy minister to indicate to future witnesses that they should not tolerate instances of inappropriate ways of questioning.</div>

    </p><a name="Para632034"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question of privilege flows from an attempt by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105834,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105834&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Citizenship and Immigration </A> to intimidate the standing committee on the subject by limiting the testimony of witnesses appearing before it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632035"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister's letter dated May 16, 2007 proposes to put in place guidelines and severe limitations on the testimony of witnesses. These proposed limitations are contrary to the law, privileges and customs of Parliament. They amount to a serious breach of my privileges as a member of Parliament and to the privilege of the House itself.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632036"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to be clear in stating that the committees are entitled to seek information from witnesses through both testimony and evidence. In this context, where public servants are called upon to testify, there must be a way to ensure that committees obtain the information they require while respecting the public servants' professional duty to the crown.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632037"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister will want to look at the appropriate provisions of the Parliament of Canada Act which specifically authorize committees to swear in witnesses. An attempt to deny that part of the law is an assault on my privilege and those of every member of the committee and of the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632038"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the language in the minister's letter regarding the style of questioning is nothing short of offensive to the committee and also a breach of my privilege as a member of the committee, in that it claims the committee members harassed, demeaned, belittled, humiliated and embarrassed witnesses. All these qualifiers are grossly exaggerated. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632039"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in part of my presentation to the committee, I commended one of the witnesses, Mr. Davidson, rather than criticize him. I commended Mr. Davidson for pointing out to the committee that the previous Liberal government had budgeted $20 million for producing a new updated Citizenship Act and how the Conservative government withdrew that funding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632040"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle at stake is the ability of members of Parliament in a standing committee to carry out their legislative work and to fulfill their duties as members of Parliament, independent of the government of the day.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632041"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon reviewing the minister's letter and checking the minutes of the standing committee meeting of May 2, 2007, I am sure you will find a prima facie case for breach of privilege, Mr. Speaker.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I begin my comments by saying that I am a new member of the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration. This was in fact the first full meeting that I had attended of that committee. What I found at that committee that day was absolutely shocking.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632045"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I believe that both members have not presented a prima facie case for a question of privilege. What the minister has done is to instruct junior officials to be careful witnesses and to be careful in the information that they relay to parliamentarians to ensure that members on that committee get good information. Of course they are going to be very careful witnesses because members opposite made a big production about swearing in those junior officials of the department. It was an incredibly intimidating meeting for the junior officials that appeared before our committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632046"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mood of the entire meeting was most distasteful. The junior officials were berated. If anyone is guilty of intimidation of a committee, it is the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78401,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78401&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Scarborough—Agincourt</A>.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Mr. Speaker, if you were to look at the blues from that committee meeting on that day, you would be shocked and amazed at some of the tactics used by members of the opposition to berate junior officials. These officials are good public servants who go to work every day and do their jobs and pay their taxes and raise their families. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632048"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that meeting we dealt with lost Canadians. The only motives of these officials were to deal with this matter and to help to identify who falls within the realm of a lost Canadian. They are doing an incredible job, despite receiving tens of thousands of phone calls. I believe they are down to 75 individuals who are in dispute as to whether or not they are lost Canadians. They are doing an incredible job.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632049"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, if you were to check the blues from that committee, the word “liar” was thrown out many times by members opposite. The member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78375,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78375&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country</A> accused the officials of being guilty of a snow job. He said that he knew a snow job when he heard it and they were guilty of creating a snow job that day at committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632050"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those poor officials were berated by members of the opposition. I want to commend the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105834,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105834&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Citizenship and Immigration</A> for standing up for these good public servants, for standing up for these officials and saying to them that if they are not sure of their answer, to take some time, make sure they get it right and then get back to the committee.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were only three people in that room that day that were guilty of intimidation. They are the members opposite that I have already mentioned. I want to congratulate the minister.</div>

He is not aware of what happened the first time that the minister came to the committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632054"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same vein, a question was asked of the minister and also was asked of a senior official, none other than the deputy minister, and the question was very plain, “Have you advertised?” The minister, not knowing, looked at the deputy minister and the deputy minister said, “I assure you we have advertised”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632055"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later on the deputy minister sent out a letter apologizing for misleading us. He even sent me a personal letter because I put the question to him, apologizing personally for having misled me.</div>

I have heard enough. We are getting away off the point of a question of privilege and getting into what happened in the committee which in my view is irrelevant to this issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632059"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have here a case where the minister has sent a letter to all the committee members from the copy that I have received. It is marked “copy” to all the members of the committee. It is addressed to the chairman of the committee. It is dealing with the giving of evidence before the committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632060"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a matter of the privileges of the members of the House. It is a matter for the committee to decide whether this directive is something that is satisfactory to the committee. That discussion must take place in the committee and not here on the floor of the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632061"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not for me to decide what evidence committees hear or what restrictions the committee may put on members or what restrictions the minister may be allegedly putting on witnesses who are appearing before the committee. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632062"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister is entitled to give directions to her employees in the department. She is entitled to write to the committee and express her views and pass on to it what she is telling the people in her department. It is for the committee then to make decisions whether or not this is satisfactory to the committee and its members, and not for Speaker on a question of privilege in the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632063"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the committee reports that in some way its ability to do its work has been restricted or impeded, that is another matter and it will be dealt with by the House if such a report should come to the House, as the minister has pointed out. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632064"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is not for me today to make a decision on whether the minister's letter constitutes a breach of members' privileges. It does not, it cannot, unless the committee finds that in some way its ability to do its job has been impeded or impaired. We have had no such finding from the committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632065"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not going to hear a whole lot more argument about what happened in the committee in terms of answers to questions. That is simply not the business of the Speaker, nor in my view is it the business of the House at least until such time as the House receives a report from the committee indicating some problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632066"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge hon. members to raise this matter in committee. They can have a fulsome discussion there. The chairman of the committee has the letter. There is nothing secret about it. The discussion can take place in committee and in my opinion, that is exactly where it ought to take place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632067"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I cannot find a question of privilege here today.</div>

The Liberal Party of Canada is not against minimum sentences. However, it considers that they do not represent the best way to combat crime in Canada. That is why we believed that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A>, as amended in committee, constituted an excellent compromise because it dealt in a serious and coherent manner with major crime in Canada. As I have explained, this compromise was destroyed by the deplorable union of the Conservatives and NDP. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632071"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without trivializing crime and the problem of access to weapons, the bill, newly amended by the Conservatives and the NDP, serves to establish and reinforce the neo-conservative ideology that is trying to impose itself in this House. It promotes increases in mandatory minimum sentences, so generously used but really only effective in very specific circumstances. It is important to mention that the Liberal Party in no way opposes minimum sentences but like a majority of the stakeholders in the criminal law community, it considers that they must be limited in use to already existing offences. They cannot constitute a new response to crime management. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632072"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I must remind members that the Liberal Party proposed a multitude of amendments designed to improve the original bill during discussion in committee. We tried the same thing at the report stage. Unfortunately, this government and its loyal allies in the NDP obstinately voted against my party’s initiatives on this issue. That is why the value of their joint bill is so diminished </div>
    </p><a name="Para632073"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I therefore invite my fellow members to reject Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A> at third reading, in large part, because of the amendments adopted at the report stage. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The fight against criminals won't be won with more police officers and bigger jails”. That is not only my view and that of my Liberal colleagues. It is a quote from Ben Anderson, spokesman for the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632075"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If front line witnesses of crimes, victims of crimes, our police in Canada, consider that crime needs to be tackled through social development in large part, maybe it is time for this government to show leadership in that direction. I suggest that effective justice is more than just a slogan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632076"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to talk about what a new Liberal government would do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632077"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would immediately convene a round table meeting of the federal, provincial and territorial ministers, together with representatives of key organizations representing the police, to commence discussions on developing a long term, sustainable, cost-sharing arrangement for additional police officers. This is a step the Conservatives have refused to take despite their campaign promise to hire more police officers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632078"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, a new Liberal government, would give the RCMP money for 400 additional officers to help local police departments deal with guns and gang activity as well as organized crime and drug trafficking.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632079"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would ensure that more money is made available to the provinces to hire more Crown prosecutors or Crown attorneys. We would continue to support, as we have done, the reverse onus bail hearings for those arrested for gun crimes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632080"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would establish a fund that would help at-risk communities cover the costs of security of their places of worship and other gathering places, whether it be schools, community centres, for instance, which was started by the previous Liberal government but which has been abandoned by the Conservatives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632081"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We Liberals would strive to set up organized crime secretariats, like Ontario's anti-guns and gangs task force, in every province, ensuring that each of the provincial secretariats would be seamlessly integrated across the country, kind of like organized crime is. But the Conservative government does not seem to realize that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632082"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Liberal government would also strengthen legislation aimed at preventing Internet luring. While passage of the above-mentioned bill would assist law enforcement in tracking down predators who use new technologies, new offences are needed to address explicit online conversations initiated by adults with children that are intended to groom the child for future attempts at luring the child.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632083"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would also act on the recommendations of the Privacy Commissioner to update and toughen current legislation to deter and prevent identity theft.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632084"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were almost 8,000 reports of identity theft in the past year, resulting in losses greater than $16 million. Too often, the victims have been seniors whose lifetime of hard work and savings can vanish in an instant.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632085"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new Liberal government would also amend the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, PIPEDA, to make it mandatory for organizations to notify people of data breaches involving their personal information. We would act immediately to implement all 22 recommendations made by the federal task force on spam, which have been completely ignored by that Conservative government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632086"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These recommendations include: introducing legislation that would make it an offence to use false or misleading headers or subject lines, construct false or misleading URLs and websites for the purpose of collecting personal information under false pretenses, and the harvesting of email addresses without consent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632087"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are just some of the initiatives that a new Liberal government has made a public commitment that it would implement immediately upon return to power.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632088"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I want to come back to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A>. The Conservatives use retail politics when it comes to the fight on crime. They are not using effective measures that really would result in effective justice because were they doing so, they would be listening to the experts, and the experts, yes, include our law enforcement.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does our law enforcement tell us, whether it be the Association of Canadian Chiefs of Police or the Canadian Police Association? They tell us one thing very clearly. They want the government to invest in our children and to invest more money in targeting our at-risk youth, and our communities, which are at risk of either being victims of crime or being perpetrators of crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632090"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the ways to do this is by actually investing in the organizations that deal with our youth in those communities where there is a high level of crime, where there is a high percentage of youth being swept up into street gangs or into organized crime. Investments, funding and opportunities need to be provided for the local law enforcement in the field to be able to work with those communities. We have seen it happen.</div>

Let me talk about some of the things the previous Liberal government members did when we were in office.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632095"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The previous Liberal government brought in the national strategy on crime prevention, which directed moneys into local communities that needed to work with their youth at risk and to ensure better levels of security. They were able to coordinate with the local law enforcement, community police officers, the health organizations and the schools to bring down to the grassroots real effective programs to ensure we had lower crime rates. That is an example of what a previous Liberal government did. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632096"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous Liberal government brought into being the dangerous offenders system. It was not a Progressive Conservative government, it was the Liberal government. It was a Liberal government that brought into existence the long term offender system. It was a Liberal government that recognized minimum mandatory penalties in very targeted areas could send a clear message and could be effective in the sense of removing the offender from the community and ensuring that the victim and the community were not re-victimized.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632097"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are the ones who brought in minimum mandatory penalties for firearm related criminal acts. It was not a Conservative government. It was not a Progressive Conservative government. It was a Liberal government that brought into effect integrated law enforcement teams. Whether it was for the border enforcement, or for financial money laundering, or for whatever, it was a Liberal government that brought those into effect. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632098"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a Liberal government that brought into effect all the new provisions, which are no longer new, to the Criminal Code to create the ability for law enforcement to seize drug money and to define a criminal organization and organized crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632099"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Liberal government did all of that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632100"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the member opposite should go back to the school benches, learn the actual history and cease taking the rhetoric and sloganeering of his party, which has tried to paint Liberals as not being tough on crime. Tough on crime does not do it. The supreme court of the United States of America recently ruled that its determinant sentencing, under the American federal sentencing guidelines, what it calls mandatory minimum penalties, was unconstitutional and should be used as an advisory only. In other words, in the United States federal mandatory minimum sentencing is considered to be unconstitutional and should only be used as a guideline.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632101"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am appalled that the Conservative government would want to take a failed model, which is the escalating minimum mandatory sentence system that existed in virtually all of the states in the United States and for which 25 of the states since 2003 have eliminated or severely reduced, and impose it here in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632102"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective justice is not sloganeering. Effective justice is not retail politics. Effective justice means taking the time to educate people. It means putting the taxpayer money where it will reduce crime. It is not pandering. The Conservative government panders and it conducts retail politics. It is not too lofty for the government to stoop to the most base accusations, disinformation, untruths in its quest to try to portray itself as being tough on crime.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being tough on crime means taking the effective measures that will actually make a difference on the ground. We had expert after expert come before the justice committee, whether it was on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2519653,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2519653&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-35</A>, or other bills, which the government has lauded to try to make Canadians believe they will make them safer. The experts have said that they could not really oppose them because it would not make any difference.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632104"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The de facto reality is that it already happens. Whether it be reverse onus for bail for gun related crimes, it already happens. If one is accused of a criminal offence and a firearm is involved, judges do not give bail. Therefore, we would simply be codifying an actual de facto practice. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632105"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is one of the reasons why the Liberals are able to support Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2519653,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2519653&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-35</A>, but we are unable to support Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A>.

We are involved in a very serious and complex discussion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632112"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Democratic Party is supporting the bill, with the amendments that our justice critic, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78397,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78397&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Windsor—Tecumseh</A>, brought forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632113"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realize the Liberals and the Bloc are not supporting it. I heard an earlier comment by the member of the government that it must mean the people approve of criminals. In fairness, I do not think anyone who sits in the House approves of criminals, whether they support the legislation or not. It is not a matter of supporting criminals. However, I do think it is a matter of how we approach it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632114"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I have asked myself some questions. How do I, as the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78702,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78702&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Surrey North</A> and as a member of the House of Commons, ensure that the public can have faith in our justice system? I can assure the House that much of the public with whom I speak do not have faith in the justice system. These people have not necessarily found that because someone comes before a judge on a firearms offence, that they are not released on bail. We would have many examples where this was not the case.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632115"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we have to look at what is the appropriate use of this legislation on crimes committed with a gun. In all the debate this morning, if people were sitting at home listening, they would fail to recognize that we are not talking about a general discussion on mandatory minimums. It is a discussion about crimes committed with a firearm. By the way, firearms today are much more technical, much more deadly and much more powerful than the image people might have of firearms that may come from a different place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632116"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I have to ask myself is what are we doing, other than the sentencing, to reduce gun crime. I have heard many people say either one is tough on crime or soft on crime, depending on where one stands on the bill. I do not think that is the case at all. We talk very much about being smart on crime. It is not hard or soft on crime. It is being smart in the way we approach crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632117"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about this. When someone picks up a gun to commit a crime, they automatically know there is a risk of someone being killed or critically injured. There is not a question in anyone's mind that this is what a gun will do, unless we are talking about a child picking up a gun. Anyone who is going to commit a criminal act with a gun knows there is an extreme risk to the person who will be the victim of that crime, not that any crime is acceptable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632118"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come from the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, from Surrey. Many of the things I have experienced around gun crime do not fit some of the things that I have heard about in the House. I hear people talking a lot about gun crime in inner cities. The gun crime I have seen, some of it certainly is inner city, but much of it has nothing to do with youth raised in inner cities. Some of it has to do with youth raised in affluence.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1555"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555">(1555)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para632119"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be careful not to stereotype this by saying that it is only inner city people who are vulnerable to being involved in a gun crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632120"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 10 or 11 years, 100 young men in the lower mainland and some in Surrey have been killed in a gun crime, which is not an insubstantial number. Is anyone behind bars? No. Was it the person's first offence? I do not know for sure, but I know with some it certainly was not their first offence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632121"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember that what we are doing is being smart on crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632122"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I am in support of the bill, with the NDP amendments, and having talked to the parents whose daughters and sons have been killed in a gun crime or critically injured, I do not feel that I have turned into a neo-Conservative. I do not know if anybody has ever called me a neo-Conservative before.</div>

    </p><a name="Para632124"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms. Penny Priddy: </B> My colleague said that I would remember. I am absolutely certain that I would remember and perhaps many things that were the opposite of that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632125"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as I talked to the parents of a young teenager who was shot, is in hospital critically injured and no one knows what the outcome will be, they do not think this is a draconian measure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632126"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some things I would say about it that I find interesting, some things we should do and some things we should acknowledge about the public. What does the public see and feel? There is a difference between what the public sees and what it feels. There is a difference between being safe in our community and feeling safe in our community. They are two quite different things. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632127"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have read the statistics that homicides may not be up. Well, homicides actually are up in some of the groupings of people I am talking about, but the incidents of gun crimes are certainly up. People read about gun crimes in the newspaper about where, in a perfectly ordinary kind of community, a bullet suddenly comes through the living room window and lodges in the living room wall or a bullet comes through a bedroom window and lodges just above the crib of a child. That is random. This is not gang violence. The people in those houses were not even the intended victims. Those were random shootings at the wrong houses, and that is not all that unusual. Those people actually are unsafe.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632128"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, people also need to feel safe and therefore they need to see their governments, municipal, provincial and federal, doing something so they will feel safe in their communities. The member who just spoke actually talked about this. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last 13 years, 40 to 45 mandatory minimum sentences were created by the Liberal government so I do not think this is somehow a great step off the path the Liberals followed, which was, as I say, 45 more mandatory minimum sentences in the length of time the Liberals were in government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632130"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also heard earlier today from a number of parties about sloganeering, about people changing their minds because they were influenced by politics and not by what they believe. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1600"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600">(1600)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para632131"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I entered politics, I have been very clear on what I believe about crime. I talked about mandatory minimums in the last campaign, as did our leader, because we understand the devastating effect it has on our communities. This is not sloganeering and it is not pandering, and to suggest that we are sloganeering to a parent who is crying because of the loss of a family member is actually quite shameful.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632132"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hear a lot about the conclusions that have been drawn in the United States about whether mandatory minimums work. As I said, some of the amendments we put forward at committee were accepted and now some of those mandatory minimums are not what they were when they were first proposed. Our justice critic worked very hard to get these amendments through and agreed to.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632133"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I think in the United States, it is missing a piece that I actually think the Conservative Party opposite is missing as well in some ways, because in any of the literature I have read which has concluded that it does not work, it has used the single-pronged approach, which is simply raising the mandatory minimums, sending people off to jail and then going back and saying that our prisons are about to explode and that they are hot spots.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632134"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand how many prisons in the United States would be hot spots because many of them are quite appalling, but we cannot solve a problem with one single prong. Work still needs to be done in that area and I look forward to the government bringing forward what I would hope would be the second part of what needs to happen here.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632135"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People often say that mandatory minimums do not work and that there is no history of them working at all but that is not true. I want to take people back to when drunk driving became a much more top of mind issue in our country and to the early work by Mothers Against Drunk Driving. The flaw in the United States' studies and what the Conservative government still needs to do is to look into other things that we need to do to ensure this becomes successful.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632136"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will use the drunk driving issue as an example. Yes, after a certain number of offences there is a mandatory minimum jail time, and people knew that, but that was not all they did. They increased the police resources to deal with drunk driving. In my province we called them BAT mobiles. I do not know what they were called in other places, but police set up to stop cars to see if the drivers had been drinking alcohol while driving. Many of those have been discontinued because the police do not have the additional resources to keep doing that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632137"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It takes intensives awareness and education, not just doing it once in grade six or grade 10, but continuous awareness all though school about the seriousness of it and the consequences of it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632138"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often when I talk to 16, 17 or 18 year olds they know people in gangs who are using guns. Many of them have heard of a mom, a dad or a grandma and sometimes it is themselves who have been left quadriplegic and in a wheelchair as a result of either a deliberate or a random shooting, and when they tell their stories I can see people starting to think differently about the consequences.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1605"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1605"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1605">(1605)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para632139"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to continue to inform and educate people but somehow we think that if we inform one group of people our work is done. Well, it is not. It does not matter whether we are talking about racism or something else, we must do it continuously. It is like putting a pamphlet on the dangers of alcohol in a doctor's office. If we do not keep putting them there for more people to read then we are not finished doing our jobs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632140"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The job we have in front of us today is a continuous job. This is not just about passing the legislation. This is a continuous piece of work that involves additional police resources, intensive education and, yes, jail time when necessary. However, I would say, as others have, that this is not a blanket answer, which is why I talked about the other things that were not done in most of the U.S. jurisdictions, where they came to the conclusion that it did not work, and that have yet to come forward from the government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632141"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wait with baited breath to see those initiatives come forward because this is not a blanket answer. It is something that should be used sparingly, appropriately and in a focused fashion. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632142"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now move on to the part that is critical to all of this. We often wait until somebody gets involved with a gang before we begin worrying and trying to figure out how to get them out of the gang, which, by the way, is using guns. Our leader has talked about things like safe houses because it is very hard for a gang member to get out of the gang safely and to ensure his or her family is safe.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632143"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the new baby that comes home wrapped in a blue or pink blanket. I unwrapped the blanket when I brought mine home and there were no instructions. By simply bringing the baby home did not automatically mean that I knew how to parent. It did not mean that I knew how to do all of those things to ensure that my youngster, in the zero to five years, would have the kind of support, education, choices, boundaries and all of those things that we do so that when children start school at five or six they are ready in all of the five areas that they are supposed to be ready in.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632144"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the longitudinal research on this, we know that those children are far less likely to ever be involved in the criminal system. That is the work that is not here. That is the work that is missing. If that work does not come into place then we will have a problem having this be successful. We need to put into place good child care programs, which we had but which the government slashed, to teach parents how to parent. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632145"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not assume that just giving birth makes one a good parent. Those programs have been cut by the provincial government in my province. The provincial government's child care was cut so it just downloaded it and cut the programs that support parents, those parents who are either in the workforce or parents who are parenting at home, who have no place to go for expert advice and resources on just about all those challenges that any of us face as a mom or dad in raising children. Without that, and without those kinds of additional multi-prong initiatives, this has far less chance of being successful. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632146"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I can support the bill because: first, I understand that our amendments are there; second, I know what people in my community have been telling me for a long time; and third, because I do have hope that the government will bring forward other initiatives to support this.</div>

    </p><a name="Para632151"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that too often we look at this as a crime and punishment issue. I keep having to explain that I am not here to punish anyone. It is not that I want mandatory minimums to punish anyone, but as the member stated in her speech, anyone who picks up a gun knows what it can do and what danger it can inflict.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632152"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not about punishing the people who do this. It is about protecting those whom these people may victimize or have victimized. If these people are away for a minimum period of time, perhaps they will victimize no one else while they are away.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632153"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to hear more from the member about the victims she has reached out to, just as I have had to speak to victims in my own riding.

I must admit that I also talk to parents who, for a variety of reasons, have not even recognized that their sons or daughters are moving into that area. It is not a matter of blame. That is not a lack of caring or love or appreciation of their children. Sometimes it is simply circumstances. They cannot be with their children or their teenagers on a continual basis, as none of us can, of course, in order to always be aware of what is happening.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632155"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have talked with those parents who blame themselves. They wonder where they have gone wrong. They wonder what they can do to help other parents so that other young people do not find themselves in the position of actually being the perpetrator.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632156"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the most part, the people I see who are victims of gun crimes are younger people. I have talked with the parents of a young person who is in a wheelchair. He is quadriplegic and therefore will require full-day assistance, for the most part, for probably the remainder of his life. It was a random shooting. He was not even involved in what was going on. He just happened to be present somewhere. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632157"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, I have talked with those people whose family members have been, very deliberately, victims of gun crime. They have been murdered. Those parents and those families as well look to what could be done differently. They want to know that there is an appropriate sentencing mechanism that appropriately reflects the severity of the crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632158"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody has said to me, “Put somebody away forever”. But people do want to know and the parents I talk with want to know that this life that was lost or the critical injury sustained is not simply something to be brushed aside, with no mark or legacy left other than in the hearts and minds of that family. They worry very much about that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632159"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are some of the victims that I have talked to. By the way, I do not have a chance to do this very often, and I am very glad I do not, but as well I talk with the victims who are police officers. Every day in our communities, RCMP or local police go out. They respond to a call and we know that certain calls are more likely to be dangerous. They actually have been victims of a shooting. Sometimes it is because there was not enough staff. Sometimes they did not know that there was a gun there. There is a variety of reasons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632160"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have talked to law enforcement people. We are telling people to please enter law enforcement because we need more people and we need them to be more diverse, including women, so that our police forces reflect our community. These police need to feel that they are backed up by the community, by the public and by the system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632161"></a><p>

Those kinds of appropriate supports for people with FASD, FASE and autism need to be in place much earlier.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632165"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am still waiting for the autism strategy from the government and I am still waiting for a FASD strategy from the government, but surely we do not wait until those folks find themselves in a position of having picked up a gun.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why without those prevention programs this will not be a successful initiative. We must have those in place.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It does not mean that I will not support this bill, but I am very vocal in saying that we need those supports in place early on. We should never even find ourselves in the position of having someone with a severe mental disability, or with FASD or any of the other disabilities we could name, in front of a judge, with the judge having to think about sentencing for somebody who indeed may not be able to reason that out.</div>

In my previous question, I said that one of the aberrations of this bill is that the proposed increase does not apply to hunting rifles. This bill creates two classes of firearms. There are long guns, as they are called in English—hunting rifles—and then there are hand guns. Some clauses in the bill even refer to prohibited weapons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632174"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems rather odd at the stage of defining offences in the Criminal Code. As legislators, normally it is our responsibility to establish the relative severity of each of these sentences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632175"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this bill, however, there are instances where minimal sentences will not be not the same, depending on whether the crime is committed with a long gun or a prohibited or restricted firearm.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632176"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us take the example of section 239 of the Criminal Code, which deals with discharging a firearm with intent, sexual assault with a weapon, aggravated sexual assault, kidnapping, hostage-taking, extortion and robbery. Bill C-10 proposes to impose a minimum five-year sentence for a first offence, seven years for a second, and to leave it at four years if another type of firearm is used, namely, a long gun.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632177"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this bill is passed, the message it sends is that it is considered more serious to commit an offence such as attempted murder or sexual assault with a hand gun than with a long gun. This is, in my opinion, completely ridiculous and totally baseless. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632178"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was what lay behind my question to my NDP colleague as to why the NDP were, as legislators, backing a bill in which committing a murder with a hunting rifle is less serious than committing a murder with a hand gun. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632179"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think this illustrates the approach taken by the Conservative government and its view of how to fight crime, to which the NDP has subscribed for the last few months. Under this approach, they take care of repression after the crime has already been committed but do nothing about prevention. This is not the first time under this government that we have seen this dichotomy between how hand guns and long guns are treated. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632180"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We saw it as well with the firearms registry. It was the same thing. To look good, the government says it wants to keep the firearms registry, but just for handguns and restricted weapons. They want to abolish it for long guns. What does that mean? Where did the Conservatives get the idea that long guns were less dangerous than other guns? </div>
    </p><a name="Para632181"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me a couple of seconds here to find a very interesting statistic showing that a good proportion of crimes are committed with long guns. Unfortunately, I do not remember the exact figure, but it was not negligible. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632182"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The differing treatments depending on the type of firearm highlight the inconsistency in the message conveyed by the government and the NDP, which supports it. This inconsistency can be seen again in the supposed intent of the bill, where they say they want to be tough on crime and fight criminality. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the minister himself admitted when he came to testify before the committee, there are no Canadian studies showing that minimum sentences are effective at fighting crime. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632184"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We could obviously debate it from the standpoint of vengeance or punishing people for having committed a crime. If that is the purpose of the government’s bill, it should clearly say so and not try to make people think that the purpose is to make Canadians safer, when that is clearly not the case. Minimum sentences only apply after the crime has been committed. All the studies show, though, that minimum sentences do not have any impact on the commission of crimes. Some other studies have been done in Canada. One very large study showed that the recidivism rate hardly changed on the basis of the length of incarceration or whether the offender was given a prison term or a community-based sentence. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632185"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is very interesting because it shows once again that the sentences criminals receive has no influence on the recidivism rate. Another study followed up on offenders. These authors even concluded that quite the opposite was the case and that increased prison terms led to a slight increase in the recidivism rate. I will provide a reference for this study so that my Conservative colleagues can read it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632186"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am referring to a study done by Paula Smith, Claire Goggin and Paul Gendreau of the Psychology Department and the Centre for Criminal Justice Studies of the University of New Brunswick entitled <i>The Effects of Prison Sentences and Intermediate Sanctions on Recidivism: General Effects and Individual Differences</i>. The study was delivered in Ottawa in 2002, and was written for the Solicitor General of Canada. The government will have ready access to it. The conclusion that I quoted is on page ii of the introduction. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632187"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to talk about this to show, once again, that there is no connection with the length of time a prisoner is incarcerated and serving a community-based sentence or a prison sentence. As well, there are certainly no automatic deterrent effects. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632188"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are other useful statistics in this regard and the Conservatives would do well to consider them: there are three times more homicides in the United States than in Canada and four times more homicides in the Untied States than in Quebec. In Quebec, in fact, an approach based much more on rehabilitation than punishment has been adopted, and this is the part of Canada where there are the fewest violent crimes and the least crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632189"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from a particular kind of popular morality or the simplistic discourse that amounts to saying that we must punish criminals severely, that we must be hard on them and impose longer sentences, ultimately reality will catch up to us. Everywhere in the world where a jurisdiction has tried to fight crime with punishment, we see higher crime rates than in jurisdictions that place greater emphasis on rehabilitation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632190"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously a balance has to be struck, and in the Bloc Québécois we believe that punishment is necessary in many case. We must keep that balance, however, so that we do not have to invest extremely large amounts of money in keeping people in prison. I gave the example of the United States, where the homicide rate is much higher, and the prisons are bursting at the seams because the incarceration rate is much higher than ours. The United States is using that money to put all those people in prison for longer times, rather than investing in fighting crime. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of our government colleagues rose in the House earlier to give some examples. They asked me what sentence I would like to see given to the guilty person if I were the parent of a person who was killed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632192"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally, I would prefer that that individual not have committed a crime. It seems to me that it is essential, and more important, to prevent crimes than to console ourselves by saying that the person who committed the crime will go to prison for a long time and will suffer, because he or she will not like it there. That does not cancel out the crime. That does not mean that the families who have had members killed, families in which women have been raped, families of people who have been terrorized by home invasions or the like, are going to be able to turn back the clock.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632193"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minimum sentences raise another problem, and I think that this should prompt us to use them very sparingly. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632194"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minimum sentences have perverse effects. This is documented, and is a known fact. I would like to talk about two of those effects.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632195"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, there will be instances in which judges will be forced to impose a minimum sentence that they find unwarranted. In such cases, they might acquit an individual entirely, rather than be forced to sentence that individual to a penalty they consider excessive under the circumstances, for cases in which a more appropriate penalty would be a conditional sentence, community service or a few weeks in jail. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632196"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has happened in the past, and this should be a real concern to those people who wish to get tough on criminals. By trying to force the hand of judges, we would be creating situations in which judges could not sentence certain individuals to a minimum sentence that would be inappropriate. They would therefore acquit the individual instead.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632197"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem is likely to arise, André Normandeau, a criminologist at the Université de Montréal, reminded us. With minimum sentences, lawyers often negotiate plea bargains for their clients in exchange for charges that do not require minimum sentencing. This involves some negotiation and ultimately does not lead to an appropriate outcome.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632198"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This measure leaves judges with no flexibility and, in certain cases, could lead to situations that are questionable, to say the least, because, when passing legislation, we could not possibly take into consideration all parameters and every case that could make its way to court. Judges are appointed specifically to consider these cases.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632199"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight the example of Robert Latimer, the father who killed his 12-year-old daughter, who was severely disabled, in an act of compassionate homicide. This is a subject that concerns us considerably and that many people are talking about. Mr. Latimer was convicted of second degree murder, which automatically forced the judge to sentence him to 25 years in prison, even though the jury that convicted him asked for a much more lenient sentence, given that it was an act of compassionate homicide.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632200"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge did not even have this option, because, quite simply, the law did not allow it.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1635"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1640"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1635">(1635)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para632201"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a future case, a jury could be faced with the same dilemma and could go to the other extreme by saying that it makes no sense to send someone to prison for 25 years for a murder committed out of compassion and that, in that situation, it would acquit him completely. In the end, that is what happens when we meddle in the judicial process. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632202"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was astonished, because so often we hear the Conservatives complaining of judicial activism, which is when the judges—those who are close by, at the Supreme Court—use the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, for example, to amend or to strike down laws and influence our judicial and legal system. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632203"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Conservatives repeatedly complained about this state of affairs, whether in the case of same sex marriages, or abortion or other issues. After having said that it is not right for judges to get involved in politics, the Conservatives table a bill that does the opposite and where members of Parliament want to do the work of the judges. I am sorry but it seems to me that as legislators we should be concerned with the issue of the gravity of crimes, establish maximum penalties in the Criminal Code to put into perspective the relative gravity of crimes, compared one to another, and leave to the judges the task of evaluating each situation in detail and determining what sentence is the most appropriate. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632204"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another important point should be emphasized, which is that there is a major issue of perception in this whole debate, with the explosion of the all-present media—especially a certain class of media—which puts out the news as performance. In fact, there really is a perception among the population that crime is increasing and that we are living in a society that is becoming more and more violent. It is unfortunate to see that government members, instead of doing the work of explaining the real facts to the population, will manipulate and use people’s fears to advance their right-wing cause. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632205"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, I would emphasize that between 1991 and 2000, the rate of crime went down by almost 26% in Canada. That is true in almost every area: the rate of crime is in constant and general decline. To claim that crime is a growing problem and that, therefore, we need tougher penalties does not in any way correspond to reality. The proof is that the place where the fewest violent crimes per 100,000 population are committed in Canada—I referred to this earlier—is Quebec. The government, therefore, should focus on getting results, take inspiration from the Quebec model of combating crime rather than that of the United States, which I spoke about previously and which has met with a resounding failure. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632206"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to conclude by saying that there is a little hypocrisy in what the government is proposing. In order to fight crime it should fully reinstate the gun registry and free up all the grants for programs to combat crime in all of our ridings that the minister has blocked and that are languishing on his desk. That would be a real campaign against crime rather than the appearance of a campaign. </div>

    </p><a name="Para632212"></a><p>

    </p><a name="Para632213"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When people commit crimes, there are two main kinds. First, there is the kind that is planned, organized and prepared. The people who commit this type of crime do not say to themselves that if they are caught, they will get 7.5 years in prison instead of 4.8. The people who plan crimes think that they will not get caught. That is why, as all the studies show, imposing minimum penalties on these people has no dissuasive effect. They are convinced that they will not get caught. The second kind, often committed with firearms, is crimes of passion which are not thought through. These are people, for example, who just lose it at some point, go crazy, take a shotgun they keep around the house, and go and kill their spouse. These people do not go down the stairs with their gun saying to themselves, “Gee, the new Government of Canada passed minimum sentences so I had better not kill my wife”. That is not what they are thinking. This bill will not change anything here and this woman’s life will not be saved. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What might help this woman, though, is a firearms registry that works properly, gun control, and a campaign to raise awareness that shotguns are no less dangerous than handguns. In the example I just gave, by the way, the minimum penalty would not be any greater under this bill because the minimum for crimes committed with shotguns stays at four years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632215"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This government bill is not consistent. They want it to look good, but the reality is something else. When criminals commit vicious crimes and deserve long sentences, judges hand them down. What the Conservatives are saying is that sometimes and in some situations, judges look at all the evidence and decide that the maximum penalty is not warranted or a lesser penalty should apply. Some critics say that these judges are wrong, but how are we supposed to know? What study shows that they are? </div>
    </p><a name="Para632216"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Studies have been done which took members of the public and gave them the facts of a case, all the evidence admitted by the court was explained to them, and they were asked whether the judge’s decision was appropriate. Most of the time, people who were well informed, who knew the facts well and who went beyond the news in the media concluded that the judges had made the right decision.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632217"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally, I am much more likely to have confidence in a judge who has listened to a trial for several hours and who weighs the evidence submitted to him or her before determining sentence than in a member who is talking about a hypothetical case, who does not even know the context and who says that the crime is less serious because it was committed with a shotgun or more serious because it was committed with a handgun.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632218"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where will it stop? Will we be saying that if the crime was committed between midnight and three a.m., it is more serious? Honestly, this makes no sense. I think we have to get back to basics, do our job as legislators—establish a legal framework that clearly defines the maximum sentences for various crimes so the relative seriousness can be determined. Most importantly, we have to do the work that is needed on prevention, through our social policy and crime fighting programs. Those programs exist now, but they are still sitting on the desk of the Minister of Public Safety. They are just waiting for a signature<A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78755,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78755&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"></A></div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not need a bill to be read three times in the House of Commons and three times in the Senate and be given royal assent to do this. We need the minister’s signature. And we are still waiting for that. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This would be genuine crime prevention, it would help families in Quebec and Canada. Those families do not want criminals staying in prison for the rest of their lives, or for as long as possible. What those families want is for there to be no crimes and no criminals. So that is what we have to work on.</div>

    </p><a name="Para632222"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that all members in this place want to ensure that our criminal justice system is doing the job that is necessary for the protection and safety of Canadians, and for the deterrence, rehabilitation and prevention objectives of the criminal justice system. However, the aspect of deterrence, the mandatory minimums, is really what we are looking at.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632223"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would just note that the supreme court of the United States recently found the determinate sentences for mandatory minimum penalties found in the American federal sentencing guidelines to be unconstitutional and deemed them to be advisory only. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632224"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder whether the member would maybe share some concern that even in Canada this particular serious escalation of mandatory minimums may in fact be challenged in the Supreme Court.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632225"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I note that the bill does not even come into force until there is a proclamation by governor in council, which means it is not going to be in force in Canada should it pass through all stages of Parliament. The government is going to have some discussions and I wonder if those discussions will reflect the fact that there may in fact be a constitutional challenge.</div>

Judges apply the laws and determine sentences, and in my opinion, in this case, we should rely on this fine British tradition, which is a good thing.</div>

Question period today reminded me of the circumstances which existed at the time when the government House leader pointed out that it took some 220 days for Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A> to be dealt with by the justice committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632229"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a perfect example of how in this place selectivity of the facts tend to paint a different picture unless all the facts are put on the table. Indeed, I can recall one member outlining in some glorious detail exactly what the facts were.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632230"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that at the time that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A> was referred to the Standing Committee on Justice there were 10 or 11 other bills already in committee for it to work on. I am not sure the public would fully appreciate the due diligence and kind of work that needs to be done by a standing committee when a piece of legislation comes forward, but many of these had to do with the Criminal Code. Some of them did not, but they were all part of the crime-related agenda that the government had spoken about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632231"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interesting thing is that when we talk about 220 days, it is not 220 sitting days of this place, it is 220 calendar days. I suspect any bill that gets introduced in mid-June is going to be languishing for about 100 calendar days but only because the House will not be in session. It is kind of disingenuous to describe things in terms of calendar days when it comes to Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632232"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of criticism of the approach that the government made to the criminal justice bills. Instead of doing what has been done in the past, which is creating a so-called omnibus bill where a number of the areas that a government would like to propose amendments to the Criminal Code would be put together in one bill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632233"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the witnesses that would be called for any one of those bills probably would be the same witnesses needed for the other bills and any others that might come along. They are representatives from the legal community, the justice department, stakeholder groups, advocacy groups, et cetera.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632234"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may not necessarily be lawyers. There are a number of members of Parliament who bring a lot of diversity to some of the committees. Being a lawyer on the justice committee is not necessarily the only prerequisite, so the committee must rely on expert testimony.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632235"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was kind of interesting that the committee found itself bogged down in so much work with so many different bills that it had to deal with, virtually sequentially, simply because the continuity of the witnesses and testimony made it so. Even though Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A> was sent to committee, it did not get dealt with for some time, that is true, but it was not because the committee did not want to deal with it or the opposition was being obstructive. It was because the committee was fully engaged in other legislation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632236"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will know that the Standing Committee on Justice along with the finance committee are the two most active committees. They meet several hours each week and have very detailed discussions of important legislation and other related matters.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632237"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to point that out in case someone suggested there was any deliberate delay. As a matter of fact, members may recall that the official opposition made an offer to the government on a number of those bills, I have forgotten at this time whether it was 8 or 10 of them, to deal with them summarily and pass them so they could go through the system.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government rejected that opportunity to get legislation through this place quickly, to make compromises, which is important in a minority government. There are very few bills that ultimately get through here that have not had the rigours of debate, negotiation and some compromise. That is the nature of a minority Parliament. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632239"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do have Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A> before us. There are some issues. I find it kind of interesting that, depending on where our motivation is, some will say that we need these mandatory minimums and we have to have them a little bit higher because we have to get tough on crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632240"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we have to understand, and Canadians will understand, that we are talking about minimums. That does not mean that someone who has, for instance, robbed a bank and had a gun but did not use it did not commit a serious crime. Committing a criminal offence while in possession of a firearm is a serious offence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632241"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue here is that minimums are established, but that the judiciary, the judges, have the discretion to set the penalties to fit the crime. We are not talking about the maximums. We are not saying, “Let us get tough on crime”. So, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A> really does not fit with the explanation or the characterization of being tough on crime. It has to do with deterrents.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632242"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A balanced approach to the criminal justice system in any country around the world has three elements. First, there is prevention. In the bills that the government has brought forward, not one of those bills that I can recall is dedicated toward crime prevention. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632243"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second element is deterrence. Deterrence does come from things like mandatory minimums, so that those who might contemplate committing a crime with a firearm, knowing that the offence may get them an automatic two year sentence in addition to whatever the judge may want them to have but it will be at least two years, that represents an element of deterrence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632244"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens when we raise that from two to five or from two to seven or maybe two to ten? The expert testimony that came before parliamentarians was very clear. There comes a point at which the amount of time is irrelevant to someone who will be committing a crime, so the mandatory minimum, it does not matter how high it is, will not be a factor on whether or not they are going to do what they are going to do. That is why we have independence of the judiciary. That is why we have judicial discretion and on a case by case basis, the sentencing is dealt with by the court, by the jury, and by the judge to determine an appropriate sentence, given the circumstances of the case. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632245"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final element in a balanced and responsible judicial system is rehabilitation. Rehabilitation is a very important part of our criminal justice system. People commit crimes and are sent to jail. If we did not have a program to promote rehabilitation, if we just put people away in a cell, slammed the door shut, slid the food through the door and that is where they stayed, we would basically be creating a situation where those people would come out of jail when their sentence was finished with a disposition that they would be very likely to be dangerous people in society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632246"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The justice system does provide for every opportunity for rehabilitation for those who have committed crimes. That is important because once people come out, we want them to be able to resume their lives once they have served the time they had to serve.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1700"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1700"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1700">(1700)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para632247"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even within the system for good behaviour, the system provides for parole situations and early release. It is reflective of those who have shown the remorse for their crime or who have circumstances which would indicate they are not a further danger to society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632248"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even under those circumstances, they also continue to have that sentence even though they may be on parole. If they violate any of their parole conditions, they will be immediately be back in jail. The sentence is the sentence. It depends on where one is serving it and in what form it is being served.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632249"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had some discussion about whether we have come to a point where mandatory minimums have escalated to an extent which brings into concern the issue of constitutionality. Earlier in a question, I advised the House about a note I had received about the supreme court of the United States. It recently found the determinant sentences for mandatory minimum penalties found in American federal sentencing guidelines to be unconstitutional and, therefore, deemed to be advisory only. I am also aware that about 25 states have eliminated the lengthy mandatory minimum sentences since 2003. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632250"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the supreme court of the United States now have this problem? Why have a number of states backed off these very high mandatory minimum sentences? There must be a reason. They did not do it just because they thought it might be good thing to do. It is not a matter of handling it on a whim. It is handled on the basis of experience and evidence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632251"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the comparative penal systems between Canada and the United States are quite different. The penalty system within the United States is much more serious than it is in Canada. I think people's first intuition might be that if there are stiffer penalties and stiffer sentences, that will be good to reduce crime. It is not the case, and the United States compared to Canada is in fact the proof.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632252"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sentencing is harsher in the United States, but the rate of criminal offences and incarceration of people is about 30% higher. However, that is not the only jurisdiction. There are others. The justice committee heard from expert witnesses to see what is going on. It had the benefit of this experience of tracking other jurisdictions and of what was happening in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632253"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People want to suggest that somehow Canada is a crime haven and things like that. Sometimes some very bad things happen in our country, but they plot on the graphs the incidents of criminal activity from a broad range. In general, the crime rate has been going steadily down over the last number of years. Canada is doing extremely well in addressing crime, but it is not through the penalties or the deterrents. It is what I talked about earlier. It is through the prevention measures. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632254"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will divert a little to a related matter. It has to do with how to deal with those who are mentally ill, or an example as we debated on Monday, those who have fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. It is a subject matter that I have been working on as a member of Parliament for at least 12 years. The subject matter at the time was referred to as fetal alcohol syndrome or fetal alcohol effects.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1705"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705">(1705)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para632255"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a member of the health committee. I had studied and researched what the health committee had been doing before I became a member of Parliament. I came across a report called “Foetal Alcohol Syndrome: A Preventable Tragedy”. In brief, the consumption of alcohol during pregnancy causes brain damage to the fetus in a prenatal situation and that the child will be born with brain damage, with mental disabilities. Interestingly enough, if we look at the pattern, people who suffer from mental disabilities have a very high predisposition to run afoul of the criminal justice system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632256"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This concerned me and I wanted to know more about it. I learned that because of the brain damage, people did not know the difference between right and wrong all the time. We can tell them a hundred times not to do something because it is wrong and they do anyway because they somehow think it is right. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632257"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I raise this because in our criminal justice system we have to deal with people who have, in some cases, mental disabilities. If a person has a mental disability and maybe had a gun when he or she robbed a bank, under certain circumstances in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2172019,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2172019&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-10</A>, this person could be put in jail with a mandatory minimum of say five years or maybe even seven year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632258"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to ask if prevention, deterrence and rehabilitation are all elements of a responsible criminal justice system. How is it responsible to take people who suffer from a mental illness and who probably do not know the difference between right and wrong and put them away in jail, in a system which is based on delivering rehabilitation? In the case of someone who suffers from mental illness, rehabilitation is not applicable. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an interesting case, but I raise it because there are circumstances on a case by case basis where two identical crimes may get different sentences. Some may be lower, some may be higher. Why? Because there are sometimes mitigating circumstances, sometimes exacerbating circumstances. That is why we need judicial discretion. That is why we have the independence of the judiciary.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to judicial appointments, I heard the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> say in this place that he would like to have judges who were more closely associated with his ideological thinking, people more attuned to the way he saw the world. Does this not attack judicial independence? Does this not affect our court system? It concerned me that the Prime Minister was prepared to say he would start shaping the courts just as is done in the United States. The President of the United States makes appointments to the supreme court because of a person's history on a certain side of an issue. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a pattern that we have seen time and time again, not only on justice bills, but on other legislation. Canada seems to be more driven by what is happening in republican America, what is happening with George Bush and how does George feel about these things. We seem to be following blindly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632262"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has a responsible system. The Liberals brought in 45 different instances where mandatory minimums were proscribed. There is no question that we support mandatory minimums, but there comes a point, and I believe that is the issue in this bill, where the escalation has gone so far that it brings into question the constitutionality of it and whether there will be a constitutional challenge here. If there is, Canada will not be the better for it.</div>

I would like to hear a bit more because the society bequeathed to us by our ancestors is a lawful society based on striking a balance between the crime committed and the punishment imposed. That is the choice our ancestors made in order to pass down a society that is different from American society. Too often we look at the Conservative government and see that it is moving closer to the system of repression established in the United States. That is not the system that our parents and our grandparents wanted to leave us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632264"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like my colleague to elaborate on the importance of maintaining a system of law where the punishment fits the crime.</div>

There are some principles and values which are built into our system, certainly starting with the charter and the protection for all under the rule of law. Even a serious criminal has rights under the charter and the rule of law. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632266"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member is also right with regard to proportionality. It is a principle that the judicial system tries to ensure. If we were to take a particular crime and put it outside of the proportionality model, we may find that all of a sudden the integrity of the system comes into question. That is a very serious consideration.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632267"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of the punishment fitting the crime, and I think the member would agree, is subject to certain elements or aspects in a certain case. No two cases are identical in all aspects. There may be mitigating factors. There may be exacerbating factors. They may warrant a more serious punishment or a lower one. This is with regard to people who we would consider lucid, who knew what they were doing, et cetera. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632268"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I raised in my commentary, we also have the situation where we have people whose knowledge or admission and their ability to understand what they have done all of a sudden creates a whole different situation. I do not know what happens to people who are put into the system. What I do know is it has been estimated that in some provinces almost half of the population in the jails of some of our provinces and in federal institutions suffer from some sort of mental illness or an alcohol related birth defect. This concerns me a lot.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632269"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fastest growing industry in the United States is building jails, putting people away. It has done nothing to make the United States safer. We should learn from their experience.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to discuss a second aspect. The almost automatic nature of parole is at issue and not the entire system of penalties, or penalties in the Criminal Code. Therein lies the problem and I would like to hear what my colleague has to say about that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632272"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, criminals are released when they have served one sixth of their sentence. That is the problem. The fact that we impose minimum sentences is not at issue. When the sentence has been imposed, the individual or the criminal must serve that sentence.

There are some other bills, and I mentioned about 10 or 11 other bills that have been presented by the government, some of which could have come together. There could have been a more comprehensive approach. The Liberals absolutely agree with that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632274"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the member's question, here is what a Liberal government would do. We would immediately convene a round table meeting of the federal, provincial and territorial ministers, together with representatives of key organizations representing the police to commence discussions on developing long term, sustainable, cost-sharing arrangements for additional police officers. This is the prevention side of it. In terms of early parole, conditional release, et cetera, these are areas of concern which still continue to be discussed by parliamentarians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632275"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that we need to continue to re-evaluate things. There has been some success, but the system must be responsive. I would certainly suggest that in a balanced system in which there are appropriate elements of deterrence, of rehabilitation and of prevention, the kinds of issues that the member talks about, whether or not the public sees someone getting out earlier and maybe reoffending, there are reoffenders, but statistically, they are not the majority. By far they are the minority of cases.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a balance to be achieved? Is there more work to be done? Absolutely.

It seems to me that the agenda is a little thin and so the government has gone back to its law and order agenda.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632283"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk about my riding. In some respects this is the kind of issue that the government thinks it is resolving. I have a riding in the east end of Toronto. I do not know how well members know Scarborough or the east end of Toronto, but Scarborough is the centre of the universe. My particular section of Scarborough is interesting in that below Kingston Road are some of the nicest homes one can buy in all of Toronto. It is a lovely area. Some of the homes run upwards of $2 million. North of Kingston Road, which is a rough dividing line, are some of the more impoverished areas in all of the greater Toronto area. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632284"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the more impoverished areas is Markham and Eglinton. In a very small area are approximately 17,000 people in a series of high rises. Many of them are new to this country but certainly what they all have in common is that they do not have a lot of income. The United Way identified that particular area, which is called Scarborough Village, as an area that was in need of assistance. There were a number of other areas around the GTA that got special attention from the United Way. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632285"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Way comes into an impoverished area and what would be, statistically at least, a high crime area and says to the community, “This is a problem. The community is not functioning. What should we do here?” It does community assessment, assesses community needs and identifies community leaders. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632286"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of working in that community for a year and a half to two years it has done the assessment. It has developed things like community events. It has developed a functioning community centre. The United Way has assisted the community in pulling itself up by the boot straps.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632287"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to bear in mind that a fair number of these 17,000 people are just desperate to make the rent. That is about as good as it gets for them. They have come from afar. They are struggling with the language. They are struggling with a diminished status vis-à-vis what it would have been like in their former countries. That creates social problems between spouses. It creates social problems between one generation and the next. Sometimes the kids adapt fairly easily and do not necessarily respect their parents who are having more difficulty adapting.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632288"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a bit of a fertile ground for crime. We as the larger community have been concerned, but the specific community of Scarborough Village has been concerned also. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632289"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have gone to quite a number of meetings. I have met with folks who think that something needs to be done. The police are very involved in this process. They are very keen on seeing the community heal itself, have respect for itself and reduce itself from a high crime area. Not once did they ever talk about minimum mandatories. Surprise, surprise. They did not talk about minimum mandatories. They did not really think that there was that much wrong with the Criminal Code. I can see areas where we might want to do reverse onus on gun crimes, the guns and gangs task force and things of that nature which have actually been useful in terms of getting some of the bad apples off the street, but minimum mandatories is certainly not one of the things that they actually talked about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632290"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That seems to me to be just about the classic statement of how wrong-footed this particular government is on the issue of security and safety in our communities. The Conservatives missed the boat.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1725"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725">(1725)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para632291"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Conservatives missed the boat because they think that getting tough on crime, which means this kind of draconian sentencing, taking away the discretion of judges, eliminating the ability of a judge to shape a sentence to fit the crime under all the circumstances, is the way to go. They do not think that minimum mandatory is the way to go.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632292"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague earlier talked about particularly disadvantaged people and how this kind of draconian one size fits all approach to the crime somehow or other would reduce crime. Unfortunately for the government, there is not a statistic, there is not a jurisdiction, there is not a study in the world that actually shows that. Minimum mandatories have virtually no impact on crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632293"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If in fact the government were seriously interested in doing something about crime, actually reducing recidivism, in fact getting criminals in particular back into a functioning element of society, it would get behind the guns and gangs initiative, it would get behind organizations like the United Way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632294"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a suggestion, and I have suggested this in other instances. Of the enormous amount of money that is going to be spent on housing all these criminals by virtue of this minimum mandatory legislation, which I am told would be something in the order of about $220 million to $250 million over the next five years, I would suggest that my riding's portion just be directed to the United Way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632295"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a little bet going with the government that if we were able to put that money into the United Way, we would have a lower crime rate. That money would be of more use than throwing folks in jail and throwing away the key. That does not seem to be a favoured view these days. People want to be tough on crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632296"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our position in the Liberal Party is we want to be smart on crime. We want to do what works. What a strange concept. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632297"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been shown that having minimum mandatories does not work. In fact there are apparently something like 25 jurisdictions in the United States that have backed away from minimum mandatories because they have experienced it and it does not work. Recidivism is up and they are spending enormous sums of money on keeping people in jail.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632298"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can see how this legislation works for those who are pro jail and for those who want to develop more and more jails so that we are housing more and more people. I guess it is some form of solution for homelessness.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632299"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My suggestion would be that the money be given to the United Way and organizations such as that to develop the community, to allow the community to develop. The best policing of the community is the community itself. Statistic after statistic, study after study shows that minimum mandatories fall disproportionately on disadvantaged groups.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not have a particularly large aboriginal population in my riding, but what I do have is a large black population in my riding. When we talk to the community leaders, they are very concerned about black crime, particularly black on black, and youth crime. What they need and what they are crying out for is community development, the ability to do some parent substituting, basketball courts, community centres, homework programs. They are asking for facilities where they can access the Internet, facilities where they can access all kinds of services that we tend to take for granted. They are not talking about amending the Criminal Code to get minimum mandatories, because they know that is just a useless exercise.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632301"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I respectfully say to the government that this exercise in minimum mandatories is frankly an exercise of hot air. The government could have allocated the money to facilities such as I am suggesting here.</div>

    </p><a name="Para632310"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin by saying that this is not a new concept. I know that there have been many members before me who have worked on this, either through private members' legislation or additional motions. I know that the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78690,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78690&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Yorkton—Melville</A> has done much work in this area and I am grateful to him.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632311"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir John A. Macdonald and the Fathers of Confederation clearly understood the importance of absolute property ownership for all Canadians. They wished to entrench in the institution of a self-governing Canada the primacy of property ownership.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632312"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister John Diefenbaker established the Canadian Bill of Rights, which for the first time included “the right of the individual to life, liberty, security of the person and enjoyment of property, and the right not to be deprived thereof”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632313"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As justice minister, Pierre Trudeau proposed the passage of a charter that would give constitutional protection to certain rights, including the enjoyment of property. As Prime Minister he again proposed entrenchment of the Charter of Rights, which would have guaranteed the right of an individual to use and to enjoy property. While the Charter of Rights and Freedoms became a reality, the inclusion of property rights did not make the final cut.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632314"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly happy to be able to move this important motion during the 25th anniversary of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. As Canadians, we celebrate the charter. The charter, which is embodied in the Constitution of Canada, enshrines our rights and freedoms. We value these freedoms. We value the political rights guaranteed in the charter. We value the civil rights ensured by the charter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632315"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for these reasons that we rightfully celebrate the charter, as it marks the progress we have made as a country, but as we celebrate this milestone for the charter and reflect on its meaning for Canadians, both collectively and individually, we should also ask whether there are areas that we can enhance to strengthen this living document.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632316"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be certain, the charter guarantees specific political and civil rights of Canadians from policies or actions of all levels of government. It nobly seeks to unify Canadians around a set of principles that embody these rights. But in seeking to unify Canadians, the drafters of the charter also glossed over those fundamental rights that were excluded, rights of Canadians that also deserve to be guaranteed and protected.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632317"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The absence of property rights in the charter is one area where we as parliamentarians may wish to focus our attention when thinking of whether there are ways that we can enhance this document.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632318"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Motion No. 315 urges the government to recognize the need to entrench property rights in the charter. The motion would amend section 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms to extend property rights to Canadians, with the intention of giving individual property owners the right to a fair compensation for their property, and to ensure compensation within a reasonable time period.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632319"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe in the rights of Canadians and specifically the need to strengthen the protection of property rights. Every person has the right to enjoyment of their own property and the right not to be deprived of that property unless the person, first, is accorded a fair hearing, second, is paid fair compensation, third, the amount of that compensation is fixed impartially, and fourth, the compensation is paid within a reasonable time period.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632320"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exclusion of property rights from our charter violates convention, convention as captured in the 1960 bill of rights, convention as captured in common law, convention as captured in provincial statute, and convention as captured in the United Nations declaration of human rights. The importance of protecting property rights has long been recognized in Canada and around the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632321"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that my Liberal and NDP colleagues share an understandable and healthy respect for the United Nations and hold it in high regard, so they might wish to recall that article 17 of the 1948 United Nations declaration on human rights states:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other democracies have taken a lead in property rights legislation, including the United States, Germany, Italy and Finland. Several Canadian provinces, including British Columbia, New Brunswick, and previously Ontario, also have at various times indicated resolutions that support stronger protection for property rights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632326"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Britain first introduced property rights in the Magna Carta of 1215. I know that the opposition loves to try to chastise the government when it comes to questions of rights. If all my colleagues are firm in their commitment to the rights of Canadians, they should support and embrace this motion. No document more ardently seeks to defend Canadian rights than the Bill of Rights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632327"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1960 Prime Minister John Diefenbaker brought in the Canadian Bill of Rights. Part I of the bill reads:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that all members of the House support such a principle as outlined in the Bill of Rights as it applies to property rights. There is, however, an arguable weakness in the bill. There is a flaw. While it mentions property rights, a guarantee of protection and compensation in those cases where private property has been expropriated is not explicit.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632331"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such ambiguity dilutes the level of protection for property rights. Because it is a regular statute, it could be overridden by a new federal statute. Without the explicit mention of compensation, a new federal statute could rather easily restrict the right of Canadians to fair and prompt compensation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632332"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion No. 315 would correct this by entitling Canadians to fair and prompt compensation in circumstances where it is necessary for an individual to surrender property to the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632333"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill of Rights remains in place today, but our courts tend to refer to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. While both have positively contributed to Canada and its people in the past, the emphasis on the charter severely circumscribes the rights of some Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632334"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowhere was this more clearly evident than in a ruling by the Manitoba Court of Appeal on February 4, 1999. The court ruled against a Manitoba resident's right to sell his own grain grown on his own land. The ruling stated that section 1 of the Canadian Bill of Rights, which protects property rights through a due process clause, was not replicated in the charter, and the right to “enjoyment of property” is not a constitutionally protected fundamental part of Canadian society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632335"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Canadian would become aware of this lack of protection for property rights, however, until it is too late, that is, until the government arbitrarily expropriates the property of a law-abiding, taxpaying Canadian without any compensatory measures. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632336"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This happens already with farmland, for example, where government may force farm families out of production for government purposes. For example, approximately 97,000 acres of Quebec's best farmland was expropriated. In spite of the fact that 3,200 farm families were displaced, only 5,000 acres were ever used for the airport operation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632337"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of this ruling is echoed by Professor Peter Hogg, a pre-eminent scholar of Canadian constitutional law. In <i>Constitutional Law of Canada</i>, Professor Hogg writes:</div>

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The omission of property rights from s.7 [of the charter] greatly reduces its scope. It means that s.7 affords no guarantee of compensation or even of a fair procedure for the taking of property by government. It means that s.7 affords no guarantee of fair treatment by courts, tribunals or officials with power over the purely economic interests of individuals or corporations.</small></td>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My motion would provide Canadian citizens with the protection they require but would not interfere with government's ability to continue its work. Canadians deserve to be reassured that the federal government respects their fundamental rights to own and enjoy property.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632342"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion, therefore, is an effort to continue the crusade started by our forefathers and the drafters of the 1960 Bill of Rights. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632343"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion No. 315 is consistent with our government's clear and unwavering commitment to introduce measures to promote rights in this country. Whether working to correct historical injustices like the Chinese head tax or dealing with the aboriginal residential school legacy, whether working to protect the rights of women and children from acts of criminality or endeavouring to extend to Canadians the right to vote for the representatives of the Senate in Canada, this is what our Conservative government has been doing.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1740"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1740"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1740">(1740)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para632344"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion No. 315 is also consistent with the earlier efforts of former prime minister Pierre Trudeau. He was an ardent advocate for improved protection of property rights. He first argued this case in a 1968 paper entitled, “A Canadian Charter of Human Rights”, tabled when he was the minister of justice.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632345"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He reiterated the case in his 1969 paper, “The Constitution of the People of Canada”, and once again in 1978, when he introduced Bill C-60, the constitutional amendment bill. He attempted twice more to extend the scope of the charter to include property rights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632346"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With such longstanding and diverse support, moving forward with such a motion as Motion No. 315 seems long overdue. Accordingly, I wish to urge the government and all of my colleagues to support the motion so that we can have measurable advancement on the promotion of Canadian rights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632347"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why would we seek to deny Canadians' intrinsic rights?</div>
    </p><a name="Para632348"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One concern that has been expressed about the inclusion of property rights in the charter is related to the complicated matter of the definition of the term “property rights”, but protecting property is not just a conservative or a liberal value but a Canadian value, a value that every party can support. Through time, the term “property”, not unlike the charter itself as a living document, has evolved to mean much more than simply real property.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632349"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the fact that the term will have to be interpreted by the courts, which may interpret it very broadly, is not a good reason for excluding property rights from the charter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632350"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If property were interpreted by the courts more broadly than in the traditional sense, the entrenchment of property rights also could have positive effects for those persons who do not own real property at this point.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632351"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The entrenchment of property rights in the charter could do more than simply protect those who own real property from expropriation without compensation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632352"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, if we were to ask who benefits from this motion, the answer is clearly every Canadian.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632353"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Property is not just land and buildings. It may extend to all forms of personal material properly. Merely in order to preserve one's right to own property at some point in the future, government must restrain itself in the present. The right to own property is as much about potential ownership as actual ownership.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632354"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best any government can do is work toward equality of opportunity. The right to own and enjoy property is pivotal to all other rights. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632355"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea captured in this motion embodies the principles of fairness and justice that Canadians hold dear. Our country was founded on these principles and values. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632356"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prospect of new property in its various forms drew our ancestors to this country to settle land, in both the east and the west. They wanted to protect the property that they worked so hard to attain. Canadians are no different today. Our charter should reflect the right to own property and the right to not be deprived of it without due process of law and compensation that is both just and timely.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632357"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is the farmer who fears losing his or her livelihood due to greenbelt expansion, families who must be uprooted to accommodate a much needed mid-peninsula corridor in my riding, or the senior citizens who have worked hard and saved well to pay off their home only to be forced out because it is located near an endangered species habitat, every Canadian who owns and enjoys property should not be arbitrarily deprived of that property. That is precisely what this motion seeks to ensure by amending section 7 of the charter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632358"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 25th anniversary of the charter provides an opportunity to highlight all its merits and to see how we can improve the charter. I believe the inclusion of property rights is an important step in this direction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632359"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All party support of this motion would demonstrate our commitment to enhancing the property rights of Canadians. The House has heard various debates over the protection of property rights. Indeed, the House has even witnessed widespread cross-party support for the enhancement and promotion of property rights on various occasions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632360"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one occasion, the Deputy Speaker of the House stated: “We must entrench the right to property in our Constitution. The right to hold and enjoy property provides one of the checks and balances against undue concentration of power in government at any level”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632361"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We cannot emphasize enough the importance of property rights.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632362"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not hard to find examples in this country of the government unjustly expropriating property or forcing people to sell land and other material without compensation, without other options, and indeed, without any form of recourse to the courts. It is simply misleading to suggest that we have adequate protection of property.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632363"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only when these rights to property are enshrined in the charter will our rights and freedoms no longer be in jeopardy. It is for this reason that I ask all members of the House from all parties to support the inclusion of property rights for Canadians in the charter.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we see happening at both the federal and the provincial level, although in Ontario it is happening more at the provincial level than at the federal level, are restrictions on people's use of their property, usually in the service of perfectly defensible environmental laws. These laws impose the cost, for example, of ensuring we have clean waterways, with substantial setbacks for animals to graze on, or requirements that large holding tanks be built for liquid manure in order to continue existing farming operations or so on. These actions are taken so they cause the use and enjoyment of property to be restricted unless substantial costs are paid. Title is not effected, but in reality part of the value of the property is confiscated.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the hon. member envision this kind of restriction on people's property and de facto compensation as being covered in some form in this kind of partial expropriation?</div>

I come from a rural area that has been designated greenbelt. There is not much in the member's particular example where individuals are required to do something. It may be more about what they are not allowed to do. That is one of the challenges our farmers face. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632374"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farming has become increasingly difficult over the years. We know there is always a challenge in terms of what we ask from farmers in terms of environmental regulations, what they are allowed to grow or when they are allowed to grow it. One thing this would provide would be some certainty, as farmers move forward, with their property rights and rights to their land. Maybe there could be some compensation given for environmental restrictions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632375"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More important, this would provide some security for our farmers as we move forward. In some of our rural areas it has become more difficult over time to suit the original purposes for which the land was intended.</div>

This would ensure that governments could no longer repossess lands without due process.

    </p><a name="Para632380"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms has rights that are already enshrined in it.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of that, the federal government put into place the court challenges program.

    </p><a name="Para632382"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said that the reason why it was necessary to enshrine property rights in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was because we had situations right now where people's lands or other property may be seized or had been seized by governments or by government agencies without proper due process, without proper and reasonable and fair compensation. I find it interesting that I have not heard the member once rise to question his own government's decision to abolish the court challenges program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632383"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the court challenges program actually encourage special interest groups to promote issues that are not supported by Canadians? Let us look at some of the issues that went before the courts in which certain individuals, groups or communities were able to benefit from the court challenges program to either intervene in a case or oppose a decision made by a government or a government agency.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go to R. v. Prosper, 1994, volume 3 of the <i>Supreme Court Reporter</i>, page 236. In this case the Supreme Court of Canada considered that whether an impoverished accused upon arrest had a right to state funded counsel. An intervenor in the case argued that depriving poor people of access to counsel would result in equality in access to justice that would be inconsistent with section 15 of the charter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632385"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court held that where an arrested person requested counsel, the police must desist from attempting to obtain a statement until counsel had been provided.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at another one, R. v Mills, 1999. Mr. Mills was accused of sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl and wanted to obtain records of visits she made to a counselling agency and a psychiatrist for use in his court case. He did not want to follow the procedures for accessing these records, which are imposed by Bill C-46. He argued that the Criminal Code violated his rights to a fair criminal process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632388"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victim, L.C., was able, through the court challenges program, to appeal a ruling of a lower court that said Mr. Mills was right, that he should be able to access that 13-year-old victim's records about her visits to seek counselling and psychiatric treatment and help. It was only because of the court challenges program that this young victim was able to appeal the ruling directly to the Supreme Court of Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632389"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were groups representing women, children, service providers and mental health consumers and providers who intervened in the case to explain why Bill C-46 was needed to protect the equality rights of sexual assault victims. A majority of the Supreme Court of Canada found that the provisions of that bill did not interfere with an accused person's right to a fair criminal process under section 7 and 11(d) of the charter. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632390"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court pointed out that the scope of these rights was not unlimited and must take into account the rights and interests of other people involved in the process, namely the survivors of sexual assault who must report the crime and testify in court. Sexual assault victims who are primarily women and children have historically been subject to bias and stereotype within sexual assault trials. The Supreme Court of Canada made it clear that equality was an integral component of the concepts of fairness and justice, particularly in the criminal law.</div>

    </p><a name="Para632392"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have the case of R. v. Williams, 1988. This ruling is of particular importance to those who have experienced the effects of racism within the Canadian justice system. The central issue in Williams was whether perspective jurors could be questioned about their racial bias to ensure a fair trial before an impartial jury. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that where there was a realistic potential of bias, it was reasonable for the accused to have the opportunity to challenge the impartiality of the jurors.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time that this issue has come before this House, and it is before us today by virtue of the motion that is before us.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of sections of the Criminal Code pertaining to property, including section 346 on extortion, sections 343 and 344 on robbery and section 322 on theft.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil laws in place on this in the various provinces would be too numerous to cite. Article 952 of the Quebec Civil Code, for instance, states as follows:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This relates to fair compensation in the event of an expropriation for public utility.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intent of the motion is perhaps not stated clearly but is certainly present: to institute property rights as an absolute right to which all others would be subject. The text offers no nuances or conditional applications for this property right. Also worthy of note are the perspective and location of this proposed addition of property rights as set out in the motion. Reference is made to section 7 of the Charter, which reads: </div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para632413"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would respectfully submit that putting property rights on the same level as the rights to life, liberty and security of the person strikes me as somewhat overdoing it. It indicates a certain lack of perspective. Everyone of course wants to see his possessions protected and is attached to his worldly possessions, but to claim that citizens place this right to material possessions on the same footing as their rights to life, liberty and security is completely unreasonable, ill-advised even. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632414"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any state, a necessary balance must be maintained between rights and the administration of the state. Constitutional recognition of property rights in such an absolute manner without any nuances or conditions opens the door in the most unbelievable way to all manner of legislational challenges, thereby essentially benefiting the most well-off members of society. One might, for example, think of environmental legislation, which often places restrictions on how people can dispose of, or make use of, property in their possession. Or the Income Tax Act, which allows the government to appropriate assets which are the property of citizens. Would declaring property rights to be virtually divine, absolute and near-sacred mean that the government could no longer legally appropriate the assets of an individual by virtue of the Income Tax Act? I will leave hon. members to imagine the consequences this would have for our society, if such were the case. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632415"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government ought to have a look at a few other rights it is diminishing at the moment: the right to be presumed innocent, the right not to be deprived of one's freedom arbitrarily, the right to live in a society that recognizes judiciary independence. All of these have been diminished by the present government. Legislation should be beefed up before rights—</div>

As everyone knows, property rights were intentionally left out of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It was a big mistake and now this House has an another chance to correct this major oversight.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632420"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that we have another opportunity or chance to change this because since 1983 property rights bills and motions have been debated 10 times in this House. I know that because five of those debates were on private members' bills or motions that I introduced. Sadly, Conservative MP John Reimer's property rights motion of 1987 was the only one that was passed by this House. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that China has put property rights in its constitution, I believe it is time for us to do the same. This is why I support Motion No. 315. And the vast majority of Canadians agree.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2005, the Canadian Real Estate Association commissioned an extensive survey involving almost 10,000 respondents. Ninety-two per cent of the telephone respondents thought it was important that the government fairly compensate property owners if their property was expropriated. Eighty-eight per cent thought it was important for the government to fairly compensate property owners if restrictions were imposed on how their property was used.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We just need ask the grain farmers in the prairie provinces who grow their own wheat and barley but still cannot sell their grain to the highest bidder. When they try to take their grain across the border because they cannot sell it in this country, the federal government throws them in jail just for trying to sell their own crops. This is a fundamental economic freedom that grain producers in Ontario and Quebec take for granted, but not out west. By the way, the court challenges program has not helped these people one bit and all the examples that I will cite have not helped. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We just need to ask the tens of thousands of law-abiding gun owners who have had their legally registered firearms banned, completely devalued by Bill C-68 in 1995. These owners never did anything wrong or unsafe with their property and yet it was banned anyway. They have also been denied permits so that they cannot even enjoy their property at the range. They have been denied compensation for the loss and value of their property, many of which are family heirlooms. In the case of a few hundred owners of section 12(6) handguns, the government is taking them to court because they want to register their firearms but the law that was passed, Bill C-10A, by the previous government was never implemented fast enough to take effect. </div>

However, if it were passed by this House, we would still need the approval of seven provinces and 50% of the population.

    </p><a name="Para632440"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms came into force on April 17, 1982, and as has been mentioned, we marked the 25th anniversary of this. A striking omission is the absence of the right to own and use property, and that is why I would like to give the House three reasons why this must be included.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632441"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, property rights are crucial for the building of a just and prosperous nation. The right to own property, to enjoy one's property, and the right not to be unfairly deprived of one's property, is fundamental to a free and democratic society. Property rights are essential to a Canadian way of life, to political freedom and autonomy, and to a well-functioning economy. These protections in themselves are not enough.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632442"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If property rights are essential for the well-being of our economy and our way of life, why do they have so little protection? The Bill of Rights is second best and it has been referred to already. We need to include these in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632443"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, property rights have been at the centre of the human rights movement from the beginning. Since the 17th century, people have understood that the right to own and use property is necessary for political freedom. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632444"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the English civil wars, John Locke famously argued that the rights to life, liberty and property were natural, inalienable rights, and if the state was to have legitimacy in the eyes of the people, it had to secure these rights. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632445"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are disillusioned with government today. One of the ways we can correct that is by adding these to the charter, so their rights will not be run over roughshod by government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632446"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this background, the charter appears to be an anomaly. As a document that guarantees rights and freedoms in a free and democratic society, its silence about property rights is clearly an omission that has to be corrected.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632447"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a third reason why the absence of property rights in the charter is an omission. Property rights were originally supposed to be in the charter. Early drafts of the charter naturally included the protection of property rights. This is what we would expect in any bill of rights. The Conservative Party at that time supported including these property rights in the charter. I could go on and explain many other things that we need to do in regard to this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632448"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am hoping that all members in this House will not be distracted by some of the things that I have heard here in the last hour. We need to focus on property rights, why they are important, why they need to be included in the charter, and then work together to try to accomplish this. </div>

I am a big fan of private members' items. I was interested to know a little bit of the history which was provided about the number of times this issue has come up. We have a history with regard to the charter and about, as the member who just spoke referred to, the early drafts in consideration. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632451"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not one of those cut and dry issues. There were reasons why those who drafted the charter felt that there were other considerations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632452"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What prompted me to rise is perhaps to point out how sometimes things that are said in debate tend to be explained in a way or presented in a way which would paint a particular picture, but maybe not be totally reflective of the facts and in fact all of the facts painting another picture.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632453"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give an example, the member who just spoke referred to some farmers who tried to sell their crop across the border and were arrested and thrown in jail. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632454"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that case. I happened to be the parliamentary secretary at the time to the then minister of public works and government services who also had responsibility for the Canadian Wheat Board. This happens to be under the Wheat Board and the House has dealt extensively with Wheat Board issues because the current government wants to disband the Wheat Board. It just wants to throw it away.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632455"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did a lot of work to understand the history and why the Wheat Board was there. It was the fact that without a Wheat Board, that meant that those who had to transport their product a lot farther than others would not have the accessibility to the same kind of profitability from the existing markets.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632456"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wheat Board is an interesting issue. To be relevant to the debate in terms of property rights, the member did say that they tried to sell their grain in the United States and they were thrown in jail. That was not the case.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632457"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, they were in violation of the rules of the game under the Canadian Wheat Board Act. They were charged with violations. They were charged, there were a number of them, and they were fined. The member will know that. They were fined for violating the rules of the Wheat Board. Two of them decided they wanted to make a demonstration and decided they would not pay the fine. Therefore, the consequence of that, if they did not pay their fine, was that they had to serve some time in jail. That is a little bit different than saying they tried to sell their grain and they were thrown in jail. That is not true; they were fined.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632458"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member talked about the poor gun owners, for example, who have these legally owned guns and they did not hurt anybody, but the government comes up with Bill C-68 which basically identifies guns which are very dangerous, automatic weapons, and all the listed firearms which have absolutely no useful purpose other than to kill people. The member says, “This is my property right. I should be able to have an automatic weapon. I should have an Uzi”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632459"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we twist it that way, the member knows that even under the existing gun legislation the firearms which are properly fixed can continue to be collector's items and so on, but now the member and the Conservative Party do not want to register long arms. They continue to defer things like that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632460"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big issue has to do with property in a sense, and maybe others would be considering this, but it would be things like one's land.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1825"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1825"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1830"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1825">(1825)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para632461"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the members raised the issue of the species at risk and that land could be confiscated. I remember debating that bill. I remember being involved in doing the research, just like this member does with his staff. I do my own.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632462"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at it and say here are the species at risk, there are certain habitats within large farms which in fact include designated species at risk. It means that there are protected habitats. It does not mean that the property is totally expropriated. It could be that there is a restriction on the use of certain parts of the property.</div>

    </p><a name="Para632464"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr. Paul Szabo: </B> The member says it is completely devalued. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632465"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At what point in time do we decide that we are going to protect species at risk? The laws of the land are evolutionary. It takes into account important aspects.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632466"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was never this idea, as was presented by the member I think very erroneously, that somehow all the land would be expropriated without compensation. That is absolute nonsense.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632467"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point I wanted to raise has to do with the court challenges program. The member's motion is suggesting that we want to enshrine something else in the charter. I think this is a good debate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632468"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a good debate when the starting point is that there is no guaranteed accessibility for all Canadians to the charter. If more things are put in, but the court challenges program is destroyed, how does that help? How does that help all Canadians?</div>
    </p><a name="Para632469"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is that the government has abolished the court challenges program. That program was put in there to make sure that all the protections of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms were accessible to all Canadians. If a person did not have the money to challenge a decision, whether it came from a municipal, provincial or a federal jurisdiction, the Federal Court, that individual would be able to defend his or her charter rights. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632470"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This costs money. Some people cannot do it. The members are suggesting and they have suggested on the public record that these are just a bunch of special interest groups. It really is sad when we look at something like the Montfort Hospital. This is a bilingual hospital that was trying to survive and is still there today because of the court challenges program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632471"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I raise it because if we want to enshrine more things into the charter, then obviously accessibility is an important part. That is what is missing in this debate.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians entrust us with billions of dollars of public funds, fully expecting that we will invest them wisely with the best interests of Canada at heart.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632550"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to say this evening that this government is doing exactly that. We have been an effective steward of public funds investing in the right things with the right results for Canadians. We have been an efficient steward of public funds making sure that with every investment we are getting the best bang for our buck.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632551"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated in the main estimates for national defence, the 2007-08 program amounts to some $16.9 billion. The department employs thousands of military members and civilian public servants.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para632552"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of National Defence and the Canadian Forces have a strong presence throughout this country, from Alert in the north, to St. John's in the east, to Comox in the west.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para632553"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These thousands of men and women, military and civilian, are fulfilling a critical national responsibility. They are defending Canada, Canadians and Canadian interests. Whether their job is financial accounting in National Defence headquarters, servicing aircraft in Bagotville or patrolling the grounds of Kandahar province, each of these individuals plays an important role in our defence team. This government is doing its utmost to support them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632554"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our first priority goes without saying. We want the Canadian Forces to achieve success in every operation we ask them to undertake. Providing for the defence of Canada, Canadians and Canadian interests is a no-fail mission. This past year has highlighted why we need our Canadian Forces now as much as ever.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632555"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mission in Afghanistan has been making the most headlines but do not forget the helping hand our forces gave to Canadians trapped in Lebanon last summer, or the 8,000 search and rescue missions our air force undertook, saving some 1,000 lives, or the thousands of kilometres that our Canadian Rangers patrolled in the north, or the assistance our military men and women are prepared to give right now in the event that flooding occurs in British Columbia, should that assistance be requested.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632556"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadians in Lebanon and the families in the Fraser Valley know that success in operations is paramount. That is why supporting operations is a priority for this government, whether it means putting tanks into theatre in Kandahar or supporting Arctic sovereignty patrols.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632557"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, we cannot realistically expect the Canadian Forces to maintain this high operational tempo at their current capacity. The downsizing and downgrading that the Canadian Forces suffered through the 1990s has left them with formidable challenges in human resources, in equipment and in infrastructure.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para632558"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that we do not have enough men and women in uniform. They must manage with some equipment that is old and out of date, and some parts of their physical infrastructure are in need of repairs, or no longer meet current needs.</div>

    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para632559"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Forces need the right people, equipment and infrastructure to achieve success in operations, not only today but also in the years to come. That is why the rebuilding of these core capacities of the Canadian Forces is critical for the defence of Canada and our national interests.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632560"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government will continue growing the regular and reserve forces, and I am pleased with the progress that the Canadian Forces recruiting group has already been able to make. The number of applications for enrollment in the Canadian Forces is already up 25% from this time last year, and the recruiting group has been working hard to streamline the recruiting process to better serve applicants. As it now stands, 21% of new applicants are being enrolled within one week and another 32% within one month.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632561"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government is also making significant headway in the area of equipment. In fact, under this government the budget for capital projects has now increased to 21% of the overall departmental program.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para632562"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going forward with a number of procurement projects, including strategic and tactical medium to heavy lift helicopters, joint support ships, medium sized logistics trucks, and main battle tanks.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para632563"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our airmen and airwomen based in Trenton will see the impact of these major projects firsthand when the first of our C-17 strategic lift aircraft rolls onto the tarmac this summer. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632564"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equipping the Canadian Forces is not only about buying the right things, it is also about acquiring them in a timely and cost effective manner. The fact that there will be a C-17 Globemaster in Trenton by this summer, just over a year after I made the initial announcement, is a testament to the progress that this government has made in modernizing defence procurement in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632565"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Canadian Forces should not and, in many cases, cannot wait 15 years to see a procurement project come to fruition. That is why, under the leadership of this government, the Department of National Defence is pursuing a number of procurement reform initiatives.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why implementing this government's Canada First defence strategy is another one of our priorities right now and it will make sure that the Canadian Forces are well positioned for the long term.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632571"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initiatives I have already outlined, such as the major procurement projects, have been part of implementing the Canada first defence strategy, but there is more work to be done. The department plans to move forward on several new initiatives this year. These include improving national surveillance, increasing the military's presence at home and enhancing the Canadian Forces' ability to respond to emergencies on Canadian soil, rebuilding and strengthening our military across all services so that they are well placed to respond to future defence needs is a large effort. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632572"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's approach balances operations, expansion and transformation efforts in a measured and steady fashion to ensure success in operations, to ensure steady expansion and to ensure continued capability renewal. We cannot move forward too fast because then we would be neglecting the needs of today. This government is committed to implementing the Canada first defence strategy but at a steady rate that does not stretch the Canadian Forces too thin and undermine their current operations.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government is acting as a responsible steward of public funds in defence. As members examine the cost estimates for defence in 2007-08, when they see a line item like the repair of roads at 4 Wing Cold Lake, they must remember that all these investments, both large and small, contribute to the broader goal of defending Canada, Canadians and Canadian interests. This is a complex and challenging job.</div>

The previous Liberal government irresponsibly allowed the state of our Canadian Forces to decline during its 13 year tenure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632577"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals left our military's resources and equipment in an inadequate state for our men and women in uniform. It has been left to our Conservative government to correct this problem. As the member of Parliament with CFB Moose Jaw in my riding, this issue is obviously of great concern to me.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632578"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unfortunate but it is not difficult to come up with an example of deteriorating equipment in the Canadian Forces. We only need to look at the fleet of Hercules aircraft. They are aging rapidly and in urgent need of replacement. Canada's Hercules fleet has logged more flying hours than any other military Hercules fleet in the world. It is considered the workhorse of the Canadian Forces and they have been operating effectively for decades. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632579"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, some of these planes, which have been in service since the early 1960s, will be grounded by the end of 2010. The tactical airlift capability must be replaced. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632580"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not only the air force that has been damaged by years of neglect. In my riding, the Saskatchewan Dragoons want to know about the tanks, the trucks and the ships. We should not forget that those are aging too. The fleet of Leopard 1 tanks are over 30 years old. We are in a situation now where the support and spare parts that are required to maintain these tanks will soon be obsolete. The tanks must be replaced. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632581"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The medium size logistics trucks for the army were fielded in the early 1980s. That was 20 years ago. This fleet needs to be replaced as soon as possible given its age and increasing maintenance problems. The trucks must be replaced.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632582"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us talk about the navy's replenishment ships. The HMCS <i>Protecteur</i> and the HMCS <i>Preserver</i> have done an exceptional job for the Canadian Forces but they are now over 35 years old and have become difficult and costly to maintain. The ships must be replaced.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632583"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also remember that this House voted on the mission in Afghanistan and committed our troops until February 2009. We cannot set them up for failure by neglecting their equipment needs. It is our obligation to provide them with the tools that they need to be successful. It would be irresponsible to send them into harm's way without agreeing to give them what they need and everything that they require.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632584"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government needs to ensure that the Canadian Forces are well-equipped, whether or not Canada stays in Afghanistan longer than 2009. Without proper equipment, the Canadian Forces cannot accomplish their tasks at home or abroad.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632585"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Forces need to be self-reliant. It is the only way we can be more secure at home and have a greater impact abroad. The Canadian Forces have been underfunded, understaffed and underequipped for far too long. </div>

By fixing, transforming, expanding and properly equipping our military, we will build a Canadian Forces that can effectively do the jobs that Canadians expect of them here at home and on the world stage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632588"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have worked hard over this past year to deliver on that promise. The government is doing its utmost to provide the tools our men and women in uniform need to succeed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632589"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we can all agree that investment in the Canadian Forces is long overdue. Because of years of significant under-investment, we have a huge replacement backlog. Aircraft, trucks, ships and other important military hardware that should have been replaced years ago are still in operation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632590"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last June, the government outlined its plans to purchase joint support ships, strategic and tactical airlift, medium to heavy lift helicopters and trucks for our men and women in uniform. Almost one year later, we are making progress with these important projects.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632591"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent signing of the contract for the purchase of C-17s is a bold step toward providing the Canadian Forces with the equipment they need, when they need it. In the coming months, the first of these aircraft will arrive in Canada and the Canadian Forces will take delivery on the first of many new and urgently needed resources.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632592"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquiring strategic airlift will make for more effective deployments within Canada and significantly contribute to our “Canada First” strategy. It will also fulfill a top NATO requirement and show that Canada is taking leadership among our allies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, our forces will have the rapid, reliable and flexible capability to move troops and equipment quickly over long distances. We will ensure that Canada's military maintains a vital ability to respond to domestic emergencies and international crises.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632594"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone are the days when we had to rely solely on chartered strategic airlift. Our own planes will guarantee that during a crisis, the Canadian Forces will have the tools they need to respond. </div>

Nonetheless, I intend to be fairly hard on him with respect to the Conservative government’s current defence policy. I think it is the role of the opposition to do this, and it is also the role of the opposition to stand up for taxpayers. So when it comes to Afghanistan and everything that follows—the purchase of military equipment—there has been a flagrant lack of control within the Department of National Defence. We have already been told that military spending, to the end of the mission, will be nearly $5 billion, not counting equipment. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632599"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have before us at present a list of military equipment totalling $21 billion. And here is where the problem lies. Earlier today, the minister said in his speech that Canadians have confidence in him. I think that if Canadians and Quebeckers knew that there is a bill for $21 billion attached to the bill for $5 billion, they would react very strongly. As well, when I have finished my 15-minute speech and my questions, I do not believe that my support from colleagues in the Conservative Party will have risen at all.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632600"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my opinion, buying this much equipment, for $21 billion, with no military capacity plan, is an absolute nonsense. It is outside the control of this House and the control of the public. I have some huge examples of this. I will not go back to the strategic airlift question, because the contract has already been signed. But I will come back to tactical airlift. The last time we talked about this, we asked questions and I am pleased to see that General Hillier is here. The last time, I told the media in Quebec that I had the impression that the entire matter of military procurement was in the hands of what I call the old boys.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632601"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These people I call the old boys are consultants. Look at the case of CFN, which includes Paddy O'Donnell—I believe Mr. Hillier was chief of staff for Paddy O'Donnell—and General MacDonald, who was formerly chief of staff of the air force. All these people are now part of CFN, and more specifically are lobbyists for the company. They are being paid by the taxpayers. I have an example here. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632602"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listen carefully. For the Hercules 130, these are the prices paid for each plane. Remember that we are buying 17 of them. The prices paid in the United States are as follows: the air force reserve, $44 million; the air national guard, $52 million; marine corps, $57 million; coast guard, $59 million; department of defence, $63 million; USA 95: $33 million; USA 98, $49 million; USA 2000, $61 million; and it goes on like that. The price is between $40 and $60 million.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632603"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know how much Canadian taxpayers will pay for the Hercules, probably thanks to CFN? They will have to pay $188 million per plane. So if we were to pay the average of what was paid by other countries—Italy, Australia and the United States armed forces—we would probably save $1.5 billion. I did the calculation. The overpayment will be $88 million for each of the 17 planes, for a total of $1.5 billion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632604"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can the minister confirm that he has completely lost control of his department and that he is no longer the one making decisions about military procurement? It is the chief of staff. There are big lobbyists whose ultimate concern is their companies’ interests, and they are making off with the pot, with the chocolate bar, and it is the taxpayers who are left holding the bill. Can the Minister confirm that he has lost control of his department?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My belief at the moment is the capital cost for a C-130J, which is quite a different aircraft from all the earlier models, is about $85 million Canadian. It is not the number the member quoted.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632607"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the integrity of the Chief of the Defence Staff, he is not influenced in any way by any lobbyists. We have a very rigorous system in the defence department, in public works and in the industry department. The basic requirement is made by the military. It does not say it wants Hercules aircraft or C-17s or anything. It defines in functional terms what it wants. Then teams get together to identify what equipment is available on the planet that could satisfy that. It happened in the medium transport requirement that the C-130 met the requirement. </div>

The Chinook is the famous heavy lift transport helicopter for which we are paying $4.7 billion, I believe. I have two things to say about this. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632610"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, what the government wants to acquire is the F series Chinook. There are almost no defences on this type of helicopter. The new generation of Chinooks, the G series, is currently being used by the U.S. special forces. These helicopters are not for sale. The F series does not have what is called a defensive package. This means that when the helicopter arrives, it will be rather vulnerable to combatants on the ground and will have almost no equipment to defend it. The government is not saying anything, but there are supposed to be escort helicopters that accompany these helicopters in theatres of operations. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632611"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it is important for Canadians to know this. In other words, the price that is quoted does not include the package to defend this helicopter in theatres of operations. It must be escorted by other helicopters. Does this mean that the government will be buying other helicopters? Does it mean that the government will insist that the Americans provide us with the G series? What is certain is that the price that was quoted does not include the defensive package I was talking about. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632612"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a problem, therefore, with the escorts for these helicopters. There is another problem with the delivery date. They have been saying since the beginning that these military purchases are for Afghanistan. However, the delivery date for these helicopters is 2012.

How does he explain the fact that the delivery date does not coincide with our mission in Afghanistan, which is supposed to end in February 2009? </div>

    </p><a name="Para632617"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bloc Québécois would be disappointed to learn that the only military equipment currently really devoted to search and rescue and Canada’s internal policies is being asked to pay the price of all the government’s other purchases. It seems, though, that the government is currently tempted to postpone this program until later because the financial commitments are just too great and they may not be able to pay for this plane. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632618"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the minister and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"> Prime Minister</A> say during the election campaign that this type of plane was absolutely essential for the people of Canada and that the government would purchase it. Now, though, they are saying that the program will be delayed and we may even have to work on the old Buffalos to extend their lifetime, which in my view is already over. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632619"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could the minister tell us what the latest developments are in regard to search and rescue aircraft? It seems to me that this would be a more justifiable expense. It would not necessarily be just for Afghanistan but for Canadians and Quebeckers too, who occasionally need to be searched for and rescued. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the search and rescue, the defence department spends about $600 million a year on search and rescue because it is a no-fail mission for us.

    </p><a name="Para632624"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just gone over the numbers again. Correct me if I have the wrong figures, but the total cost of the project is $4.9 billion, $3.2 billion of which is the cost of acquiring the equipment. Unless I am mistaken or my calculator is wrong, $3.2 billion divided by 17 airplanes means that each one costs $188 million. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632625"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the minister insist on telling me that each one costs $108 million when each one really costs $188 million? That is the number I am getting. I do not want to repeat all of the figures given earlier, but according to those numbers, the acquisition cost of each aircraft varies from $44 million to $71 million, and depending on those who procured them before us, we will be paying three or four times the actual cost of the planes. That does not make sense.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632626"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the minister to go over this again. There are the support costs, but those are separate. The cost to acquire the 17 aircraft is $3.2 billion. I agree with him that we will not be paying for that in cash tomorrow morning. The cost will be accounted over the lifetime of the planes, which will be used again elsewhere. For now though, that is the price we will be paying and it looks to me as though it is three or four times higher than what other suppliers were paid.</div>

I requested at that time, over a year ago, that the agreement be redrafted.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632649"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said it was a deeply flawed agreement that was agreed to under the previous government. It did not have any provisions for follow-up by Canada. It had no veto on onward transfer of prisoners and it did not have the same strong provisions that other NATO countries had in their agreements.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632650"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked the minister about that in committee as well. I asked the CDS about it in committee, and I asked department officials about that agreement over the course of that year in committee. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632651"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister's response at that time was that there was no intention of redrafting the agreement. The CDS and the officials of the department really kind of brushed off my concerns.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632652"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did it take so long for the minister to acknowledge the deeply flawed agreement and the problems within that agreement? Why did the government have to wait until human rights activists took it to court before it acknowledged the depth of the problems and then did redraft it?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than going into the past, I think we should appreciate the fact that we have now an extended agreement that is improved over the previous one signed in December 2005 by the previous government. This agreement guarantees human rights access. It guarantees officials from our government access. It also guarantees that the Afghan authorities will reduce the number of detention centres where Canadian detainees will be placed so we can track them better.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is, though, that the government's own Department of Foreign Affairs produced reports year after year of the potential of abuse and the knowledge that abuse and torture did take place in Afghan prisons.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new agreement is much better than the previous one.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Chair, the debate today is about the 2006-07 main estimates for the Department of National Defence.</div>

    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para632693"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have come to know them. I have come to know their families. I have visited them where they have been posted, where they train and where they unselfishly risk so much to carry out the duties assigned to them. I have gained a great respect for the Canadian Forces and what they do every day, the very real and very human face to the pages and pages of seemingly abstract figures presented here tonight.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632694"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight we are discussing numbers. Canada has regular forces of just over 64,000 and a reserve force numbering 24,000. Approximately 2,500 Canadians are currently serving in Afghanistan. Last January, I travelled to Afghanistan to gain a better appreciation of the conditions under which our troops were living and working. I met soldiers, sailors, airmen and airwomen from all ranks, regular force and reserve force.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632695"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spent time with our task force in Kandahar. I met with the provincial reconstruction team. I spoke with them about what life was like outside the wire and back at camp. They took me to visit their barracks. They showed me how they get needed equipment and they gave me a taste of what they did for fun and recreation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632696"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also visited the Afghan national army barracks and saw for myself the progress that we are fostering. I was impressed. Morale was high. Enthusiasm and pride abundant. Of course everyone misses Canada and their families, but many soldiers commented on their desire to return for a second or third deployment. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632697"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the main base in Kandahar it was also plain. Keeping in mind the environment they are working in, some of the comforts of home our soldiers need to stay fresh and sharp were readily available, things like hot showers, regular mail delivery, a thriving ball hockey league, good food and phones to call home to keep in touch with loved ones. And they have a memorial, a place they can go to quietly pay their respects and remember their fallen friends and comrades.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632698"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians can be proud of their professional and well-trained armed forces. Canadians should be proud of what they have accomplished in a poor and conflict-ridden country over a very short period of time. Our forces are making the world a better and safer place for Canadians and for those less fortunate than we are. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632699"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The job of this government is to support their efforts, and that is exactly what we are doing. With budget 2006, this government provided $5.3 billion over five years to help rebuild and revitalize the Canadian Forces. Budget 2007 has further recognized the tremendous demands we place on Canadian Forces members and the unique needs of our veterans and military families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632700"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fiscal year the defence budget will increase by $2.1 billion. Notably this fiscal year, the portion of the overall defence program, dedicated to capital projects, has increased to 21%. DND has increased the allowances of our soldiers. Veterans Affairs Canada has established funding for five new operational stress injury clinics across the country. We know we need to keep up our efforts, but let us look beyond the numbers and what our investment really means. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632701"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my visit to Afghanistan, I stood at a medical clinic in Camp Sherzai where I met an Afghan man named Ramazan. One evening last fall, as he walked home in Kandahar city, Ramazan became the innocent victim of a suicide bomber. Having lost his left leg in the blast, he faces a difficult future made a little easier by the generosity of the Wheelchair Foundation of Canada, which has distributed 560 wheelchairs to ensure that Ramazan and others like him can retain their mobility.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632702"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a project initiated by an anonymous Canadian donor, a second world war veteran. Canadians kept this project going by sending donations large and small. Like the generous Canadians who have made an impact through their donations, the Canadian Forces are helping to stabilize and rebuild Afghanistan, doing their jobs quietly helping Afghans and making a huge impression. They are establishing a secure and stable environment to allow for much needed development and reconstruction.</div>

    </p><a name="Para632704"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stated outcomes—within the program activity architecture—help to guide the men and women of the Defence team. They are:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, success in assigned missions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632707"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, military forces have an impact, provide informed professional advice with respect to the decision-making of the Government of Canada, contribute to a strong sense of Canadian identity and heritage, and exercise Canadian influence in the global community.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para632708"></a><p>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our priorities mean that the Canadian Forces must be capable of providing support to provincial and municipal authorities when in crisis such as a flood, or a forest fire or a catastrophic storm threatens here at home. They mean supporting other government departments and agencies in protecting Canada's borders.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632710"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internationally, they mean making our mark in places like Haiti, the Sudan and Afghanistan and fulfilling our international commitments to the UN, to NATO and to our allies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632711"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to be successful in operations Canada needs to ensure our regular and reserves have the training, the people, the financial and materiel resources they need to do their duties.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632712"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government is making the Canadian Forces an employer of choice, ensuring that benefits for our men and women in uniform are commensurate with all they offer Canada. This government is also working to implement its “Canada First” defence strategy. This is dependent upon not only good people, but also good equipment. Therefore, we are moving ahead with major capital acquisitions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632713"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past year alone we announced plans to acquire or signed contracts for strategic and tactical airlift, medium to heavy lift helicopters, medium and heavy trucks, joint support ships and Leopard 2 main battle tanks.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632714"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we are strengthening our key defence relationships through active participation in the United Nations, NATO and Norad. Of course the foregoing priorities require an administrative efficiency. That is why the Department of National Defence is making the procurement system more responsive. We are doing so by buying more off-the-shelf products and by reducing the requirement for costly prototype development and customization.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632715"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the goals and priorities of the Department of National Defence allow Canada to take up its leadership role in the world.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians wish to be world leaders. This spirit of leadership spurs a young man or woman to don the Canadian Forces uniform in order to protect their fellow citizens or to help stabilize and rebuild a distant country.

Together with the regular force counterparts, they have selflessly committed themselves to defending Canada and Canadians in North America and helping Canada ensure that we live in a peaceful and stable international community.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632719"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These reservists are exemplary citizens and they make us all proud. Not only are they serving Canada in the Canadian Forces, but as citizen soldiers, they are also representatives of the Canadian Forces to their communities and to the Canadian public. In many respects they are ambassadors of the CF to their families, neighbours and civilian co-workers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632720"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In domestic crises, whether it may have been wildfires in British Columbia, flooding in Manitoba or ice storms in Quebec, these reservists have answered the call. In our current mission in Afghanistan reservists have answered the call and are serving with distinction alongside the regular force and our NATO and Afghan allies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632721"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remind the assembled members that, under the terms of service of a reservist, all of these deployments are voluntary. Reservist who respond to a domestic crisis or international deployment have to balance their civilian lives, their career, family and other civilian responsibilities with their service and dedication to Canada and Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632722"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like their regular force counterparts, they have made the choice to serve Canada. It is an admirable one that all members here respect and pay tribute to. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632723"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This service is invaluable to Canada. That is why Canadians are pleased to hear that the Government of Canada has announced a modernized pension plan for the Canadian Forces that, for the first time, extends pension coverage to reserve force members.</div>

    </p><a name="Para632726"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government was pleased to introduce a modernized pension plan for the Canadian Forces that benefits regular and reserve members of the Canadian Forces. This modernization was recommended in 1998 and now we are following through and getting the job done for the Canadian Forces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632727"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All members of the Canadian Forces, regular and reserve, will benefit from the modernization of the pension system. These changes will improve the quality of life of our members. They will encourage Canadians to join the Canadian Forces. They will also encourage our regular and reserve force members to continue their service to Canada and Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632728"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the regular force, the changes to current pension arrangements include a broader range of pension benefits.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632729"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reserve force is the last large federal public sector workforce without a pension plan. It is estimated that in excess of 21,000 reserve force members will now be entitled to coverage under the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632730"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of the new pension arrangements will give all CF members pension coverage comparable to the pension plans provided to other federal public sector employees, and the coverage will still take into account the exigencies of military service.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632731"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the new pension arrangements include an immediate pension payable after 25 years of service in the CF and also provide an expanded opportunity for the portability of members' earned pension entitlements. This means that pension credits will not be adversely affected by members' military service and Canadian Forces members will have greater financial flexibility and security in planning their future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632732"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The modernization of this pension plan is of benefit to all Canadian Forces members, both regular and reserve, but as the member has pointed out, it is also a historic recognition of the service of reservists. Their contribution to the defence of Canada and support of Canada's role in the world are appreciated by all Canadians. Canada's new government is pleased to extend pension benefits to our brave men and women in the army, navy and air force reserves.</div>

    </p><a name="Para632807"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a privilege to participate in today's discussion on Department of National Defence spending. First, I would like to highlight the exceptional contribution of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78765,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78765&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of National Defence</A>, for the remarkable reconstruction efforts of the Canadian Forces after, and it must be said, years of inactivity and inaction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632808"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the minister explained, the success of our troops' operations is one of our government's priorities. He often says that we want the Canadian Forces to succeed in every operation we assign them. Even when we have the best soldiers—Canadian soldiers—we must still ensure that they have everything they need to accomplish their mission. This includes planning, training, logistical support and first-rate equipment. This is why the Department of National Defence must meet their needs. It knows that it must use its resources wisely if it wants to keep its Canadian security commitments. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632809"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it important that we succeed in our missions? Because lives depend on it. I will give two examples of situations where lives can be saved here in Canada: search and rescue and natural disaster response.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632810"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operational success is also crucial for other reasons. These operations enhance our international image and influence, as they have done in the past. They demonstrate our leadership role and help uphold our values in the rest of the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632811"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping that in mind, I would now like to talk specifically about Canada's mission in Afghanistan, which is currently employing a large proportion of our troops. In fact, it is the main operation of the Canadian Forces. Our presence in Afghanistan serves Canadian interests. Why? Because it helps prevent international terrorism here, which poses a threat to our national security. We saw that last year in Toronto and in the rest of the world as well. Failing states, which are in disarray, are breeding grounds for terrorism. Before we and our allies were present in Afghanistan, it was a source and centre of terrorism. We are there to support our friends and allies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632812"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. members know, we are part of an operation in Afghanistan involving 37 countries, led by NATO and mandated by the United Nations. Like the other members of this international force, we are in Afghanistan at the invitation of the Afghan government to help the Afghans rebuild their country. Our efforts are improving the lives of millions of Afghans who have suffered through decades of war. Using a three-pronged approach—development, diplomacy and security—we are helping them take charge of their own future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632813"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these initiatives are part of a plan known as the Afghanistan compact, which involves nearly 60 countries. The compact sets benchmarks for security, governance and development in Afghanistan. Our Canadian troops are making an invaluable contribution to this compact, because we know that without security, there is neither governance nor development. These three areas of activity are closely linked and reinforce each other.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632814"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us talk a little about security. Since 2002, more than 18,000 men and women of the Canadian Forces have served in Afghanistan. The work Canada has done and continues to do there with the international community contributes to the relative stability that reigns in most of the country. In Kabul, the economy is flourishing and the streets are filled with people tending to their daily activities. The north and west of the country are also relatively stable. However there is still a strong Taliban presence gripping the south. Success in this region is essential to the entire NATO mission.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T2005"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2005"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2000"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2005">(2005)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para632815"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why our country has committed up to 2,500 soldiers to help stabilize and rebuild Afghanistan. Next August, our soldiers from Valcartier, Quebec, will relieve their fellow troops in the great Quebec military tradition. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632816"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of these troops are deployed in the south of the country, in the province of Kandahar. Twelve Canadian Forces members from Lévis—in the riding I represent—who are members of the 6th Field Regiment, are currently serving in Afghanistan. We are not the only ones in southern Afghanistan. Other countries are there with us. There are nearly 12,000 troops on the base in Kandahar. We are there with our NATO allies and our partners in order to provide assistance to this region of Afghanistan that needs our help. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Canadians arrived in Kandahar in February 2006, it was one of the most dangerous places in Afghanistan. Every one of us here today knows the burden this mission has placed on our troops and their families. However, their sacrifices in Kandahar are paying off and in just a year they have made impressive progress. They have driven back some of the Taliban's strongholds in order to make room for development and reconstruction.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632818"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the Afghans want to ensure their own security.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632819"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Forces are working tirelessly to help create Afghan security capabilities. They are involved in joint military operations with the Afghan national army. The skill and professionalism shown by that army as it joins forces with ours in the operation are in large part attributable to the guidance provide by Operational Mentor and Liaison Teams, which are nicknamed “omelets”, from their acronym, OMLT. Despite their English acronym, a number of them come from Valcartier. I had the opportunity to meet them during my January visit over there with the Standing Committee on National Defence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632820"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the improved security, projects can be stepped up and extended to development and reconstruction projects. With long term security, the Afghans are able to take control of their country and their lives, which means rebuilding the essential institutions and infrastructure we take for granted here. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632821"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Kandahar, these reconstruction efforts are being coordinated through the combined efforts of the PRT, or provincial reconstruction team, and local Afghan leaders. This 330-member team is made up of members of the Canadian Forces, a contingent of civilian police officers under RCMP direction, and representatives of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, the Correctional Service of Canada, and the Canadian International Development Agency. The horizontal nature of this mission is evident. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632822"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together, they are delivering highly useful services to the local population on behalf of the Afghan government. These services in fact help to beef up the presence of the Afghan government in the Kandahar region. The PRT distributes food and delivers immunization programs. In addition to its numerous development activities, it carries out demining operations. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632823"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following are some of the concrete projects that have been carried out by the provincial reconstruction team: 55 km of canal; two dam bypasses; restoration of 120 km of rural roads in order to provide Afghan villagers with access to the market; installation of 7 km of high tension power supply lines; construction of 1,100 shallow wells and 13 deep ones in order to provide the decent drinking water essential for any human activity. These projects are part of the Afghan government's national solidarity program, which is giving rural Afghans a say in development via elected community development councils. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632824"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These successful reconstruction and development projects will help to gain the confidence of the rural Afghans. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632825"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warrant Officer Dean Henley is one example of a master confidence builder. In Kandahar province, in the town of Bazar-e-Panjwayi, he is knows as the “Prince of Panjwayi”. On pay days he turns up with a suitcase packed with money for the locals working in “money for work” projects. Like many other members of the Canadian Forces in Afghanistan, he has a strong belief in the work our troops are doing there, which is why he has even asked for an extension of his deployment. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Kabul there is a 15-member strategic advisory team helping the Afghan government put in place a fully democratic government with administrative and responsibility centres at all government levels. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632828"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, this is an extensive and complex mission and an excellent illustration of all the strengths of our Canadian troops and the reasons we are so proud of what they have done and continue to do. </div>

    </p><a name="Para632834"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to point out, and I will elaborate a little, the progress that has been made in Afghanistan during these past five years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632835"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are making a tremendous difference. In the five years since this international mission began, we have witnessed a turnaround in the mood of Afghanistan, from one of despair to one of hope. Afghans want security. They do not want to live in fear. They want to look forward with hope to a brighter future. This is exactly what we are doing in Afghanistan. We are bringing them hope. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632836"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are working with the Afghan people to rebuild their society. A society can rebuild only if its citizens feel secure. Development is only sustainable if security and stability are firmly established. The first step for reconstruction in Kandahar is to create a secure environment. It is our troops on the ground who are helping to open up the opportunities for the goals of the Afghanistan Compact to be achieved. They are creating the safe spaces where Afghans can begin to rebuild their lives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632837"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, despite the decades of war, the years of extremist rule, the lack of basic infrastructure and public services, the extreme poverty, the harsh environment and the corruption, these people have hope. They can see the possibilities for the future, for their families and for their villages. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632838"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are seeing life return to the streets of Afghanistan. Last month the Kandahar amusement park reopened. That is a sure sign that the people are beginning to feel like they can go out again and feel safe.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632839"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six million children, one-third of them girls, are now getting an education for the first time, compared to only 700,000 boys in 2001. Twenty-five hundred villages now have access to electricity. Six thousand kilometres of roads have been built and repaired.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632840"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I want to talk a little bit about the Route Summit that was built by our Canadian troops. This is a new two-lane road that will connect the Panjwai district to Highway 1. Route Summit is only about four kilometres long but its impact is immeasurable. This road means that a farmer can get his produce to bigger markets, finally earning a reasonable income for his family. It means doctors from the major urban centres can now visit villages where they had no access to medical services before. It means the police and the army can respond to the crises where and when they are needed. Most important, the road is a symbol of the Afghan government providing for its population and unifying the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632841"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians played a very important role and we should be very proud of our role in the Route Summit. It was our combat engineers who worked with local construction crews to build the road while our soldiers protected them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632842"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to quickly quote President Karzai from when he was here to remind us of the progress that is being made. He said: </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike 4 Wing Cold Lake, 3 Wing Bagotville does not have a firing range for CF-18 training. It trains in various firing ranges in eastern Canada, especially at Valcartier. The Minister of National Defence, through the air force commander, authorized derogation for CF-18 training at Valcartier. A note from the defence minister indicates the modifications that must be made to the firing range. The work was expected to cost an estimated $2 million. This derogation for CF-18 training expires in October 2007.</div>

A derogation was signed by the commander of Canada's air force, and it expires in October 2007. I would have liked to have received an answer to the question. Will the derogation be renewed, and for how long? Perhaps the minister cannot answer the question. If that is the case, I will go on to my next question.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632855"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the eastern Canada firing range, we know that a study is currently underway. The minister has confirmed this. In June 2006, military officials stated that an analysis of potential sites was underway and that proposals would be presented shortly. I am sure the minister is aware of this because the correspondence was addressed to him. With regard to the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region, elected representatives are in agreement and are waiting for a proposal from the Department of Defence concerning the location of this infrastructure.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632856"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want the minister to give me the same answer he gave in the fall of 2006. Can he tell us when this file will be made available and when we will have access to the report's conclusions?</div>

    </p><a name="Para632888"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to be a member of a government that strongly supports our men and women in uniform and more particularly, to serve with a <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> who has so clearly demonstrated his compassion and respect for the women and men of the Canadian armed forces.</div>

Little did I know that when I invited the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> to join us in Petawawa, we would also be hosting the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78765,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78765&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of National Defence</A> and the chief of defence staff. Their presence meant a lot to the soldiers and their families. I would like to take this opportunity to thank them. I would also like to thank Lisa Miller and Karen Boire, the organizers of Red Fridays across the country. Their heart and passion does their community proud.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632890"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am full of pride to be part of a national government that strongly supports our women and men in uniform. These Canadians serve our country with incredible professionalism, dedication and courage. There are none more deserving of our support than the very people who are willing to put their lives on the line for their fellow citizens and their country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632891"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exceptional commitment of some of our military members was recently recognized at a ceremony at the Chateau Laurier. I would like to draw this committee's attention to that event because I think it speaks volumes about the men and women who make up our military.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632892"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in 1993, Her Majesty created a series of new decorations to recognize military valour: the Canadian Victoria Cross, the Star of Military Valour and the Medal of Military Valour. For 13 years none of these medals had been awarded, given the distinction that they represent. None of them had been awarded that is until last fall.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632893"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first presentation of these medals was right here in Ottawa in February. They were awarded because the soldiers who were the recipients exhibited the highest degree of valour in the most dangerous of situations. Those acts of courage happened in Afghanistan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632894"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our military members have not been exposed to such deadly combat situations since the Korean War. Their stories, and others like them, need to be told. All Canadians need to be reminded of the incredible work our armed forces are doing for our country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632895"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent experience of Hannah Doyle of Pembroke, who had the opportunity to go to France as a member of a group of young people who participated in the anniversary commemoration of the Battle of Vimy Ridge, is an example of how important it is to impart the stories that contribute to our shared heritage of nation building.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632896"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, we as elected representatives need to be reminded of the exceptional service both veterans and currently serving members and their spouses have made to this country. When the time comes to review our defence spending, as this committee is doing today, we need to be prepared to do our utmost to support our military members and their families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632897"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I refer to supporting military spouses at this time I make special mention of the widows of our soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of our country. I recognize Jackie Girouard, Charmaine Tedford, Darcy Mitton and Kelly-Ann Dove, just to name a few of the spouses I have had the pleasure of meeting. The widows tell me that the honourable way to respect their sacrifice is to continue the mission, recognizing the noble cause that Canada is involved in. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632898"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way that we as parliamentarians can preserve the memory of our fallen soldiers is to ensure that their serving comrades continue to receive the support and the financial resources they need to get the job done.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T2035"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2035"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2035">(2035)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para632899"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleagues gather here today, the Department of National Defence has a budget of just under $17 billion for the 2007-08 fiscal year in recognition of the role a credible military presence plays in demonstrating nationhood and sovereignty, recognition that has been lacking until our government took charge in budget 2006. The department received a much needed boost of $5.3 billion over five years to help rebuild and revitalize the Canadian armed forces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632900"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, for the fiscal year, the defence budget will go up by $2.1 billion and under the government, the budget for capital projects has now gone up to 21% of the overall department program. We are investing some of the funding in new equipment because the government recognizes that our military personnel need to have the right tools to do their jobs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632901"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the privilege recently of taking part in a plant tour of Pacific Safety Products, an all-Canadian company located in Arnprior, Ontario. This company manufactures a safety vest that protects our soldiers in places like Afghanistan. Canadians are proud to be able to assist in providing the right equipment to keep our soldiers safe. It is made here in Canada right here in the Ottawa Valley.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632902"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these funds are being used to recruit and train Canadian Forces members, so that the military has enough people to meet the current and future demands, but this government has not forgotten that we also need to allocate sufficient resources to provide for a good quality of life for our military members and their families. It is important to the families, the spouses and the dependents to keep the home fires burning.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632903"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to provide this committee with some recent examples of how this government is making a difference in the lives of our armed forces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632904"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, just last month, the government announced plans to construct a new multipurpose facility in St. John's. This new facility will bring together operational training space, offices, classrooms, special medical and dental services, and a warehouse space in one location. Quite simply, the facility will better support our troops and it will also stand as a sign of this government's commitment to maintain a vital military presence in the region.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632905"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in Atlantic Canada, this government announced plans last October to improve the heating systems at Canadian Forces Base Gagetown, to make it more cost effective and environmentally friendly. The department is spending just over $1 million to convert all heating and hot water tanks in the military housing units on base to natural gas. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632906"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This money will be put directly back into our soldiers' pockets, saving them around $200 a year in home heating costs. Moreover, it will make a significant contribution to improving the air quality of New Brunswick and the surrounding region.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632907"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is not only through infrastructure improvements that we are taking care of the Canadian Forces. We have also provided pay and allowance increases across the ranks. </div>
    </p><a name="Para632908"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, just this past spring, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78765,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78765&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of National Defence</A> announced the implementation of modernized Canadian Forces pension plan arrangements. Now, all eligible Canadian Forces members, both regular and reserve, have pension coverage that is comparable to the pension plans of other federal public sector employees. This means that for the first time our reserve forces are entitled to coverage under the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632909"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also made it possible for reservists to contribute and earn benefits from the Canada pension plan. They too should be able to collect a pension that will allow them to prepare for retirement and provide their families with basic financial protection.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632910"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that Canada asks a lot of its military and their families. In addition to their regular burdens of military service, there are times when our Canadian Forces members have to put themselves in harm's way to defend our country, so we also have a responsibility to look after our Canadian Forces members when they get wounded in combat or fall ill from the conditions in an operational theatre.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632911"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new allowance for loss of operational allowance, or ALOA, which the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78765,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78765&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of National Defence</A> announced in December 2006 will ensure that those military members who have to return to Canada because of injury or illness continue to be compensated adequately. Let me explain.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632912"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members serving in a theatre of operations, like Afghanistan, receive special deployment hardship and risk allowances. This new allowance will make sure that if the deployment of military personnel is cut short due to injury or illness, they will not be financially penalized.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T2040"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2040"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2040">(2040)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para632913"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now they will receive this new allowance in place of their special deployment allowances up until the last day of their planned tour of duty. For example, if a soldier is deployed on a six month tour and is wounded after one month, he would receive the ALOA for the five remaining months. This new allowance will mitigate the burden faced by members and their families when other operational allowances cease.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is for the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78956,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78956&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">parliamentary secretary of defence</A>. Canadian Forces Base Petawawa has provided important contingents of Canadian troops to the Afghanistan mission. To date, some 2,000 troops from base Petawawa have been deployed to Afghanistan: 1,500 recently returned; another 500 began a tour of duty last month; and another 1,000 are due to go in August 2008.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ontario ombudsman launched an investigation in March, after receiving a complaint from the executive director of the Phoenix Centre, the only children's mental health centre serving residents in Renfrew county, and that includes CFB Petawawa, that the provincial government was failing to provide adequate mental health services for military children. The Phoenix Centre reported that the demand for psychological counselling had grown from just 2% of its cases to 20% since August 2006, and children were being forced to wait four to six months for treatment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632918"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Phoenix Centre struggles to help children traumatized by their parents' deployment, an issue Canada has not had to deal with since the Korean war, many health staff at Petawawa worry that the challenge has just begun, not only in their community but for the military families and communities across the country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para632919"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Ontario ombudsman recommended was for the federal and provincial governments to sit down in an attempt to determine what was needed and how the costs could be split up instead of leaving it entirely up to the province. If this does not happen, the ombudsman has already warned the situation could easily revert to its initial stage and this would spell disaster to the Petawawa community. I am sure all members will agree we have a moral duty to provide the best health services possible for our children in support of their parents in uniform.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight I would like to contribute to the debate on the 2007-08 main estimates for the Department of National Defence.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para633016"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This budget reflects our government's commitment to rebuilding and revitalizing the Canadian Forces. At the height of the most demanding combat operations our forces have faced since the Korean war, we have worked hard and kept our promises. Our commitment to the mission in Afghanistan has shown how essential it is for the Canadian Forces to have good equipment in order to do their important work. </div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para633017"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we are not just focused on our abilities in Afghanistan. We have to plan for future international operations and future domestic requirements. Our Canadian Forces have had to do battle against underfunding, cope with personnel shortages, and work with obsolete and aging equipment for far too long.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633018"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found some quotes from a document called “A Democratic Society Taskforce Report on Security”. The task force was chaired by the hon. David Collenette, a former minister of national defence. One quote is:</div>

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Over the past thirteen years Liberal governments have cut back resources for the Canadian Forces...because a philosophical choice was made to diminish the military's place in Canadian society and invest in other priorities. However, this has come at a price.</small></td>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para633020"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a good quote from a Liberal. In fact, we might call the last little while a decade with an absence of light.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government is standing up for the Canadian Forces, making sure that those who commit themselves to defending Canada and Canadians have the essential tools they need to protect themselves and to do their jobs effectively.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what led to our losing our favoured status under ITAR, and do not be mistaken about it.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to procurement, this has been an unprecedented year for the Canadian Forces.

    </p><a name="Para633028"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that just in the past month our government has responded to a need identified by our soldiers in theatre for more modern tanks. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78765,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78765&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of National Defence</A> announced that Canada will borrow 20 Leopard 2 main battle tanks from Germany to meet pressing short term needs this summer for the protection of our soldiers. The minister also outlined the government's intentions to purchase up to 100 Leopard 2 main battle tanks from the surplus stock of the Netherlands. These are to meet Canada's long term requirements. </div>
    </p><a name="Para633029"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Chair, I was in Afghanistan at a place called Masum Ghar with a whole bunch of infanteers at Christmastime and they were there with the Leopards as well. I can tell you that the infanteers sure appreciate having the Leopards around.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633030"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also provided our troops with other modern equipment, the XM777 gun and the Nyala mine protected vehicles, and the forces will soon take delivery of new fully armoured heavy logistic trucks. </div>
    </p><a name="Para633031"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are undertaking the biggest re-equipping of the Canadian Forces in decades. These procurements represent the government's commitment to the Canadian Forces' current missions, domestic and international. They reflect careful forethought about the uncertain security environment that will ensure the Canadian Forces can meet the challenges our country will face in the decades to come.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633032"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not agree more with our <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78765,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78765&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of National Defence</A> who said when he appeared before the Standing Committee on National Defence in February, “These are essential purchases, and time is of the essence. Failure to take action today to replace equipment will create serious problems for our military units in the near future. Investments in defence are investments in our future”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633033"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not just new equipment that is needed. It is the procurement process itself that needs improvement. On average, it has taken 15 years from the initial identification of the need to the delivery of new equipment. Clearly this is unacceptable. Ensuring that our men and women in uniform have the tools they need to succeed is why we must have an efficient and reliable procurement system. This government, keeping in mind our duty to be open, accountable and financially responsible stewards above all else, has taken steps to speed up and improve the purchasing of essential equipment.</div>

    </p><a name="Para633035"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we are also determined to do better. The Department of National Defence is eliminating the need for the costly development and adaptation of prototypes. It is ensuring that the procurement process is more flexible. It is procuring more commercial products and the emphasis on efficiency will pay off.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 2006 we announced our intentions to acquire a strategic airlift capability. I will quote from a Liberal paper. It states:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is from December of last year or thereabouts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633039"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 2007, only eight months later, we announced that a contract had been signed for the purchase of C-17s from Boeing. This August, a little over a year after that first announcement, the first of four C-17s will land at 8 Wing Trenton. A process that previously took years, and in some cases more than a decade, has been reduced to four months.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again from December of last year, here is a quote from the Liberals that I really like:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had no idea the Liberals had so much common sense. They should let it out more often.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633043"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the ceremony held at the Boeing plant where the four major sections of the first four aircraft were joined together, Sue Hale, project manager for the C-17 project, spoke about the improvements in the process. She said:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But efficiency is not just about ribbon cutting ceremonies and numbers on paper. To quote one of our aviation technicians, Master Corporal Desaulniers: </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That day is approaching quickly. This summer our military will begin to have an independent, reliable and flexible capability to move troops and heavy equipment quickly over long distances. The first crews are training right now. They are full of pride and enthusiasm. Again, Master Corporal Desaulniers put it all in perspective when he said, “The future is looking so bright for us”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633048"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what we asked for, now we have it, and that is very good. It is also a good day for Canadian industry. On this acquisition and others, contractors are required, under the industrial and regional benefits policy, to invest an amount equal to the value of the contract in the Canadian economy. Dollar for dollar, money spent on this new equipment will be matched by spending right here in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633049"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians will also reap ongoing benefits through long term, in service support contracts, which will bring jobs and investment to Canadian industry, economic investment in our communities, and jobs for Canadians as we work to create a well-equipped armed forces. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By providing much needed equipment, our government is ensuring that the Canadian Forces possess key capabilities needed to produce combat capable forces.

Irresponsible decisions by previous Liberal governments left the Canadian Forces unable to replace critically important equipment, resulting in a loss of capabilities. As if this was not bad enough, the Liberals cut funding while increasing operational tempo, further stretching the Canadian Forces.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think all of us in this House tonight can agree that we owe it to our brave men and women in uniform to provide them with the equipment they require to perform their jobs both safely and effectively.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I proudly stand here today as a member of a Conservative government that, under the leadership of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78765,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78765&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of National Defence</A>, has recognized the dire situation of the Canadian Forces and has taken drastic action to restore Canada's military.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633062"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things I found so disheartening about the neglect shown to the Canadian Forces in the 1990s was how these cuts limited Canada's sovereignty. That is ironic, as the Liberals like to talk about Canada having a strong, independent role in the world, yet the cuts they oversaw in the 1990s left the Canadian Forces increasingly dependent on other actors for mobility, be it our allies such as the United States or other allies or corporations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633063"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can a strong and independent Canada exist if we are dependent on other actors to move our military where the Government of Canada deems necessary? How can the Canadian Forces respond in a timely manner to disasters and crises if we are facing competing interests and queues to rent equipment?</div>

    </p><a name="Para633066"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he said, under the leadership of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78765,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78765&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of National Defence</A>, this government has undertaken a major effort to increase the independence of action of the Canadian Forces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633067"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think its most notable development thus far has been this government's decision to acquire four C-17 Globemaster III strategic airlifters. They will be delivered later this year, as was noted. A dedicated strategic lift capability is absolutely pivotal toward restoring the operational independence of the Canadian Forces and, consequently, our foreign policy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633068"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strategic lift, with its capability of transporting outsize equipment--and by that I mean assembled heavy equipment such as disaster assistance response team hospital equipment or water distillation equipment, or the new Leopard tanks--is integral toward sending properly equipped response teams to troubled areas, whether the response is military or humanitarian.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633069"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, dedicated strategic lift capability means we can transport whatever amounts we need of personnel and material whatever distance we need, when we need to do it. This makes a truly rapid response now possible without relying on others, as the member said, such as other nations or corporations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633070"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can say that it expands the Canadian Forces' core capabilities by giving them the ability to react faster, to take the equipment they need to get the job done, to travel where they need to, when they need to, and in the numbers necessary for the mission. </div>
    </p><a name="Para633071"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this obviously increases the potential independence of the Canadian Forces, it also helps us in fulfilling multilateral commitments. Rather than relying upon our allies, we now can help them transport their equipment and personnel. Developing our strategic lift also helps us to fulfill our obligations like the ones we have with regard to NATO and to better carry out our UN missions as they arise.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633072"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to try to answer the second question as quickly as I can. By possessing an independent and dedicated capacity for strategic lift, Canada will have less need than ever before to rely upon foreign nations and corporations to transport its men and women, its equipment and its emergency humanitarian aid. We will have the capability of operational independence, with all the implications that brings.</div>

    </p><a name="Para633079"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to return to the question of the CC-130Js that was raised earlier, the aircraft that Canada is buying.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier tonight the minister indicated that he thought the cost of each plane was $85 million Canadian. When we have $3.2 billion for 17 planes, it works out to $188 million each. I want to ask the minister, if it is his contention that they are $85 million Canadian each, what is it that we are buying besides planes? What else are we getting for our $3.2 billion for 17 aircraft?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October, Canada sent Leopard tanks to Kandahar. I have here a photo from the Department of National Defence from the November 22 issue of <i>The Maple Leaf</i>. It shows Leopard tanks rolling off C-17 transports in Kandahar. I also have a document that was released to me under access to information by DND showing the contract for transport of Leopard tanks via Antonov 124 from Edmonton to Manas Airport just outside Bishkek in Kurdistan. I want to ask the minister why most of the flight was made by an Antonov and only the short end of the trip by a C-17.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633087"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, on October 4, Major General Daniel Benjamin was at our Standing Committee on National Defence and said that the Antonov cannot land in Kandahar. Is this also the minister's understanding? Will we continue to use Antonovs to do most of the transport of heavy equipment?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have very much information about what precisely is involved with the proposal that was talked about but are we talking about a corvette type of ship, a frigate or is it something larger? Could the minister tell the House where this plan for Arctic patrol vessels, the six that were mentioned in the media, is in the planning stage and what part of the process is it at now?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the minister was sworn in, it was the view of the department that because of climate change the Arctic would be largely ice free by 2015. Does the department have an understanding of how climate change is affecting the Arctic?

I am wondering if the minister could indicate whether his government has any policy, particularly DND, that takes objection to the stated objectives and the policies of the Mayors for Peace movement, which actually has 1,632 member municipalities in today's world, and growing all the time, because of the renewed threat in today's world of nuclear arms.</div>

As someone who was not born in this country, I had the very great honour of spending some time with the 22nd Regiment in Valcartier and later, with that same regiment in Bosnia. I must say that during the weeks I spent with them, I learned a lot.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the minister a few questions. First, the minister recently stated in this House that he intended to change the policy on bilingualism in the armed forces. I find that the change amounted to lowering the standards and reducing the level of bilingualism in the armed forces. Can the minister explain to the House how the new system works and can he tell us about the new percentage targets for the armed forces?</div>

    </p><a name="Para633173"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main estimates reflect the commitment this government has made to rebuild the Canadian Forces. Since we came to power, we have made major progress toward that goal. In the 2006 budget, we injected an additional $5.3 billion over five years to help rebuild the Canadian Forces. That represents an increase of $2.1 billion in this fiscal year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633174"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have invested in new equipment for the Canadian Forces, such as aircraft for strategic and tactical airlift , tanks and medium to heavy lift helicopters.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633175"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also supported our soldiers deployed in Afghanistan, who are doing a tremendous job despite difficult conditions.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para633176"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afghanistan is not only a priority for national defence. As the minister said in his speech in Australia last September, there is a “home game” and an “away game”. This means that we are defending our country and its citizens right here at home and also in distant lands like Afghanistan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633177"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I would like to talk a little bit about the home game. That is because I believe that no debate on the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Forces can be complete without considering what our military is doing here at home or talking about our important and enduring defence partnership with our neighbour and friend to the south, the United States.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633178"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defending Canada and North America is an integral part of the defence mission and it is at the heart of this government's “Canada First” defence strategy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633179"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to talk about Norad and its importance to continental defence in the post 9/11 world. </div>
    </p><a name="Para633180"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norad was established in 1958 to monitor and defend North American airspace against Soviet aircraft and missiles.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633181"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events of September 11, 2001, underscored Norad's continued relevance. That day also highlighted the need to further enhance our cooperation and adapt to the evolving threat.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633182"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norad no longer just monitors aircraft coming into North American airspace, but it now monitors civilian aircraft within North American airspace as well. That is exactly what Norad has done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633183"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May of last year, Canada and the United States renewed Norad indefinitely. The Norad agreement was also enhanced. Norad has a maritime warning system and Norad processes intelligence regarding maritime threats or potential attacks against North America and disseminates it to national authorities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633184"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national commands, Canada Command and U.S. Northern Command, are then responsible for supporting civil authorities in response to these threats.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633185"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norad is not the only organization that has adapted to this new security environment. Canada and the United States have introduced new commands to focus specifically on domestic security and defence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633186"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada Command stood up in February 2006 as part of the ongoing transformation of the Canadian Forces. Its mission is to detect, deter, prevent, pre-empt, and defeat threats and aggression aimed at Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633187"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the creation of Canada Command, the Canadian Forces awareness of events of national significance has been enhanced.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633188"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Forces have also improved their preparations for natural disasters and man-made threats, and their ability to respond effectively to these events.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633189"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Canada Command and U.S. Northern Command have a domestic focus, both of our countries recognize there are threats that cut across borders and are of concern to us both.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633190"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why Canada Command has been working closely with the United States to monitor and defend our maritime interests. That is also why both commands are also closely connected to each other and to Norad through staff interaction and through the exchange of liaison officers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633191"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This close relationship enables all three organizations to be prepared to respond to any emerging situation in support of our other departments and agencies who have the lead responsibility for domestic security.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633192"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To increase our readiness, Norad, Canada Command and U.S. Northern Command take part in many cooperative land, air and sea training exercises each year. </div>
    </p><a name="Para633193"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these exercises are designed to ensure that our maritime approaches and airspace are protected from terrorist threats. Others are designed to strengthen the arrangements that we have made with the United States to support civilian authorities during emergencies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633194"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to tell members about one such exercise that was designed to ensure that Canadian and American military personnel work together effectively if a disaster ever occurs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633195"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a bilateral exercise called Ardent Sentry/Northern Edge involving Canada Command, U.S. Command and Norad, and a host of government departments and agencies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633196"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a part of this exercise, Canada Command coordinated responses to threats to infrastructure, as well as air and maritime security threats. The Canadian scenarios took place in Alberta, British Columbia and Northwest Territories.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633197"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of this exercise was for the Canadian Forces to practise military assistance to civil authorities, including bilateral planning, communication, information sharing and coordination with U.S. Northern Command and Norad.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633198"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our “Canada First” defence strategy includes many initiatives aimed at strengthening Canadian defences. In the decade following the end of the Cold War, the Canadian Forces focused a lot of attention on deployments abroad. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T2155"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2155"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2200"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2150"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2155">(2155)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para633199"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the continuing terrorist threat to North America, the Canadian Forces are being called upon to play a greater role at home. Several initiatives this government has undertaken in recent years reflect this increased commitment to defending Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633200"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we have established marine security operations centres on both our coasts to detect, assess and provide a coordinated approach to marine security threats. These centres bring together civilian and military resources from the Departments of National Defence and Public Safety, the Canadian Coast Guard, the Canada Border Services Agency, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Transport Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633201"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The centres facilitate information sharing between departments and agencies, allowing them to build a more complete marine security picture. The centres combine and analyze data from all sources. The results of this analysis are then given to government decision makers who have the authority and mandate to act on it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633202"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases the Canadian Forces can be asked to come to the assistance of other federal departments and agencies. For example, if a ship is suspected of carrying illegal drugs destined for Canada, the RCMP can ask the Canadian Forces for help. That is what happened last year when the HMCS <i>Fredericton</i> supported an anti-drug operation off the African coast. HMCS <i>Fredericton</i> and its crew supported police officers and served as a command post throughout the operation, in which the RCMP seized a 22.5 tonne shipment of hashish that was intended for the Canadian market.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633203"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Forces can also be asked to help provincial or territorial governments with natural disasters. Last spring, for example, the residents of Kashechewan, Ontario had to be evacuated because of flooding. Thunder Bay's reserve units were there to help. They prepared local arenas, brought in cots and helped create a hospitable environment to receive the people of Kashechewan in their time of need.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633204"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Forces will continue to be ready to help in years to come, whether it is in response to floods, forest fires or other natural disasters.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633205"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of our “Canada First” defence strategy, the Canadian Forces will continue to step up their training exercises and sovereignty patrols in defence of North America.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633206"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members might have heard of our most recent training exercises in the Arctic, Operation Nunalivut. Last month, Canadian Forces members travelled thousands of kilometres across some extremely challenging terrain in the high Arctic. This exercise illustrated the government's commitment to defending the Canadian Arctic.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633207"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Forces of course take part in search and rescue activities. This critical and often dangerous service takes them to every corner of our nation and the surrounding oceans. The air force, for example, did about 8,000 search and rescue missions in 2006 and saved some 1,000 lives.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to conclude my remarks by reminding my colleagues that this government is determined to rebuild the Canadian Forces so that they can continue their important work here in Canada and alongside our partners in the south.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para633210"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2007-08 estimates reflect this commitment and deserve the support of this committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633211"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now have a question. </div>
    </p><a name="Para633212"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said in the House about the overseas deployments and operations of the Canadian Forces. This is important work and it is work that our men and women in the Canadian Forces accomplish day in and day out with professionalism, excellence, and commitment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633213"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we applaud these efforts, however, let us not overlook the important work that the Canadian Forces are doing here at home. I will take this opportunity to remind the assembled members of the fundamental mission of the Canadian Forces.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633214"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I just mentioned, the Canadian Forces work in concert with their allies and our friends and partners to ensure international peace and stability. However, they also work in partnership with our American friends in the defence of North America.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633215"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost, the Canadian Forces are tasked with the defence of Canada and Canadians. This is primarily their responsibility and naturally it overlaps with the other two I mentioned. However, what does it mean in the domestic context?</div>
    </p><a name="Para633216"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I need not remind the representatives from Manitoba, British Columbia and Quebec. When a flood or forest fire or ice storm has threatened our communities, the Canadian Forces were ready and able to respond to requests from the provinces for assistance. Likewise, in the event of a terrorist incident, pandemic or earthquake, the Canadian Forces stand ready to come to the aid of Canadians.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, today, Canada Command concluded a bilateral national level exercise with the United States Northern Command and the North American Aerospace Defense Command. Canada Command is the Canadian Forces organization responsible for the defence of North America, in cooperation with the United States Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command. Canada Command is also responsible for routine and contingency domestic operations. This would include providing support to civil authorities, like municipalities and such, for such events as natural disasters.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633220"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada Command's aim in this annual national level exercise is to practise the role of military assistance to civil authorities, including bilateral planning, communication, information sharing and coordination with the United States Northern Command and its subordinate formations in Norad.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633221"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian exercise scenario involved threats to infrastructure, air and maritime security. The key objective of this exercise was to validate plans that support military assistance to civil authorities. Canadians can be assured that Canada Command is prepared to provide assistance to provincial authorities if and when requested.</div>

It is understandable. Just look at the size of the territory, the complexity of the potential threats and the challenging climate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633223"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensuring the security of the Arctic region is a daunting task, however, this does not excuse the actions of the previous government. While we were all aware of those challenges, the previous government adopted a do nothing attitude during its time in power. Its lack of political will for securing the north resulted in a slow and steady deterioration of the resources necessary for the area. Unfortunately for Canadians, this led to a decline in the military resources that were required to sustain operations and activity in the north. </div>
    </p><a name="Para633224"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy of the previous government was simple. It simply reacted to the actions of our neighbours. It underestimated and ignored the potential threats in the Arctic and acted as though no protection was necessary. What is worse, the maintenance of many of our installations in the north has been seriously neglected. Consequently, the capacity of the Canadian Forces in the Arctic has been dangerously reduced. </div>
    </p><a name="Para633225"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite considerable changes in the geostrategic situation, security in the north still depends on a sustained presence and activity by the Canadian Forces. Indeed, the intensification of air and maritime traffic and the potential for transnational criminal activity are among the new challenges facing the Canadian Forces and their partners. </div>

At this point I would like to send a big congratulations and a bon voyage to our outgoing base commander, Lieutenant-Colonel James MacAleese.

I was wondering if the minister could clarify the position that it will indeed stay in Gander.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, he mentioned earlier that he was awaiting information from the air force about fixed wing aircraft search and rescue.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to fixed wing search and rescue, I think it is one of the most vital requirements of the Canadian Forces.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to talk about the Chinook.

    </p><a name="Para633308"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, according to Boeing itself, the base model Chinooks cost $40 million U.S. However, because of the way we want to use them, they will cost $80 million.</div>
    </p><a name="Para633309"></a><p>
