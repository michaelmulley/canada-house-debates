	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Fundy-Royal):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
address the issue of suggested changes to the registered 
retirement savings plan and possible new taxes on employee 
benefit plans.
<P>
	I have received numerous letters and inquiries from 
constituents in New Brunswick who are concerned about any 
reduction in the amount of allowable contributions to their 
RRSPs. These concerns are from small business owners and 
professionals who rely on their RRSPs as they do not enjoy the 
luxury of large corporate retirement savings plans.
<P>
	To reduce or alter this plan would be a serious blow to these 
Canadians who are already enduring difficult economic 
conditions. The government must send a signal that it is 
prepared to help small business owners and other self-employed 
Canadians to prepare for their retirements.
<P>
	By maintaining the amount Canadians are allowed to 
contribute to their RRSPs the government will ensure these 
Canadians have the opportunity to save adequately for their 
retirements. This is especially important at a time when the 
Canada pension program is under increasing strain.

	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate Jean-Luc Brassard from 
my riding on his brilliant victory this morning in the free-style 
skiing finals at the Lillehammer Olympic Games. Mr. Brassard 
won the first Canadian gold medal. That is a glorious event for 
this young Quebecer who, on many occasions, has been an 
honour to Quebec and to Canada in several international 
competitions. The people of Beauharnois-Salaberry are very 
proud of the outstanding performances of this talented athlete. 
His  spirit and his determination will continue to inspire all 
young Quebec and Canadian athletes.
<P>
	On behalf of my constituents and on behalf of Quebec and 
Canada, I would like to reiterate my most sincere 
congratulations to Jean-Luc and wish him good luck for the rest 
of his stay at the Olympic village.

	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when governments propose to eliminate tax loopholes 
they talk about soaking the rich. When the so-called loopholes 
are then closed it is more likely the not so rich get the bite.
<P>
	The finance minister wants to make the tax system more 
equitable. Advice from his people says abolish deductions for 
the business lunch. It might take money from modestly paid 
travelling salesmen while devastating the often marginalized 
food service industry.
<P>
	Lowering the cap on RRSPs might deprive rich people of 
some tax savings, but it would hit hard the lower and middle 
class self-employed who have no company pension or union 
contract plan.
<P>
	Government bureaucrats can identify some loopholes, but 
before they get too enthusiastic they should take a good look at 
who exactly gets bitten.

	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
week I met with a group of individuals in Newmarket in my 
riding of York-Simcoe. These individuals represent a diverse 
economic and community interest and various political 
ideologies in all parts of the riding. They express different 
concerns and solutions to the financial and economic challenges 
we face as a nation.
<P>
	However, in spite of this they successfully reached a 
consensus. This group of individuals concluded that Canadians 
are willing to pay taxes for services which are delivered in an 
effective and efficient way. They want value for their dollar.

all its citizens, in particular for the people who were brutally 
mistreated in the recent uprising in the Chiapas region.

<P>
	The constituents of London-Middlesex were gravely 
concerned with reports of torture and summary executions of 
guerrilla combatants by government troops, and they condemn 
the indiscriminate bombing by the military.
<P>
	I join with my constituents in urging the Canadian 
government to call on the Mexican government to respect the 
presence of human rights organizations, to allow the bishops of 
the area to mediate in the conflict and to act on the natives' call 
for land reform.
<P>
	Canada has a responsibility to ensure that the human rights of 
the citizens of our new trading partner are respected. This can 
only be guaranteed through continued monitoring by the

<P>
	Respect for life and the dignity of human suffering together 
with the recognition of the moral, ethical and spiritual values is 
well founded in both natural law and Canadian law.
<P>
	The Criminal Code of Canada forbids aiding, counselling or 
assisting suicide. This law does not merely exist to regulate our 
behaviour. Rather, it articulates and symbolizes our values and 
beliefs as a nation.
<P>
	In recognition of all the heroic individuals who silently suffer 
the physical pain and endure the emotional torments of this life 
from day unto day until natural death, I demand that the existing 
laws of the Criminal Code respecting assisted suicide be strictly 
enforced to ensure that our nation's values and moral conscience 
with respect to life not be fettered, for not to do so will create a 
greater injustice to mankind than any human pain or suffering 
could possibly inflict.

own behalf and on behalf on my colleague from Saint-Jean to 
stress the dazzling performance by skaters Isabelle Brasseur and 
Lloyd Eisler who won the bronze medal in the pairs figure 
skating category yesterday at the Lillehammer Olympic Games.
<P>
	Isabelle Brasseur and Lloyd Eisler were bronze medallists at 
the Albertville Olympic Games, have been the Canadian 
champions for several years and hold the world champions title. 
Their impressive record is due to their exceptionally hard work 
and determination.
<P>
	After giving this wonderful performance and winning this 
beautiful medal, Isabelle Brasseur and Lloyd Eisler are now 
putting an end to their successful career at the amateur level. 
These two champions, who train at the Haute Performance 
Centre in Boucherville, will now enter a professional career that 
promises to be as successful.
<P>
	To these two champions who thrilled Quebec and Canada and 
who so often filled us with pride, and earned our admiration, I 
say congratulations and good luck on behalf of Quebec and 
Canada.

behalf of the people of Cariboo-Chilcotin I would like to 
congratulate the athletes representing Canada at the winter 
Olympics at Lillehammer, Norway and wish them great success.
<P>
	It is unfortunate, however, that a world class athlete from 
Quesnel, British Columbia, was not given the opportunity to 
participate in this prestigious sporting event because of a tough 
new qualification policy.
<P>
	Tony Fiala has dedicated his whole life to preparing for 
competition. In the 1991-92 season he scored first overall in 
Canada and second overall in the North American biathlon. 
Canada's qualifications standards are not based on an overall 
record which would place him at the top but by a two occasion 
showing with a standard much higher than that required by most 
other countries fielding competitors.
<P>
	Tony Fiala may not be winning any medals at Lillehammer, 
Norway, but to the people of Quesnel and throughout British 
Columbia, Tony Fiala is a winner all the way.

	<B>Mr. John Loney (Edmonton North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to bring to the attention of the House that the composite 
leading index rose by .08 in January, matching its revised 
growth rate for December. It is noteworthy that these gains are 
the highest since the index began its recovery in 1991.
<P>
	An upward trend in the index points to better economic times 
ahead. Most economists expect stronger growth in 1994.
<P>
	Statistics Canada reported that the leading indicator is 
heading in the right direction. The acceleration in recent months 
has been the result principally of a continental upturn and the 
buoyancy in the stock markets.
<P>
	Manufacturing demands have been steady. New orders 
recorded a third straight increase despite the effect of temporary 
plant closings in the auto industry. At the same time, shipments 
to stocks ratio continue to improve, rising to the highest level 
since the data series began in early 1952.
<P>
	The stockmarket soared to new all time records in January, 
accelerating from 1.6 per cent growth to 2.1 per cent growth at a 
time of falling interest rates.

where companies are acting responsibly in this regard. They are 
Forpan and Agnico Eagle, in Val-d'Or. Forpan will invest $8.3 
million to increase the capacity of its particle board plant by 25 
per cent. Through this investment, the company will increase its

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. 
Yesterday, the Solicitor General had to admit there were links 
between organized crime and cigarette smuggling networks, in 
connection with weapons and drug trafficking operations on 
Mohawk reserves.
<P>
	He also contradicted himself by first admitting that certain 
people had cancelled RCMP anti-drug operations and then 
claiming there were no no go zones for the police in Canadian 
territory.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister insist that the law is enforced 
evenhandedly across Canada when yesterday Mr. Claude 
Lessard, the RCMP spokesman in Quebec, stated that the RCMP 
was not on the reserves, despite the fact that the reserves are said 
to play a major role in illegal trafficking in alcohol, drugs and 
cigarettes?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
about the police presence on the reserves: there are three police 
forces. There is the Mohawk police force which is locally 
recognized and controlled by the aboriginal authorities. There is 
the provincial police, which has jurisdiction because it was 
given the former powers of the RCMP and which must do its job 
there as it does elsewhere. The third one is the federal police 
which is concerned with smuggling. The federal police is doing 
its job at this very moment.
<P>
	According to our information, cigarette smuggling in Quebec 
has decreased considerably. If we can break up the cigarette 
smuggling networks, we can break up the others as well. I am 
convinced the police are doing a good job. We have always told 
the police they can go anywhere across Canada to do their job.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government keeps changing its story. For a long 
time the government said, as it just said today through the Prime 
Minister, that the law is enforced everywhere, that the RCMP 
goes everywhere in Canada and that those are the government's 
instructions.
<P>
	Yesterday, however, the Prime Minister used the word 
``hesitations'', when he said he had never heard there were no go 
zones until it was said the police had some hesitations.
<P>
	I want to ask the Prime Minister to explain what kind of 
hesitations he was referring to. Are these hesitations caused by 
the government's lack of political will?

	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this nation has been facing this problem of contraband for the 
past four years. The member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell 
was asking questions here in the House when the Leader of the 
Opposition was with the government and nothing was being 
done. When I asked for a report on that, it said that there was 
some hesitation. I said there should be no hesitation. I said to the 
RCMP: ``You do your job everywhere in Canada'', and that is 
exactly what they are doing today.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr.

or not he confirms the allegation expressed yesterday by Chief 
Jerry Peltier according to which the government is on the brink 
of launching a massive major operation in Kanesatake.

Mr. Speaker, is no.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, with his 
retirement only a few days away, the commanding officer of the 
RCMP in Quebec had the following comments to make and I 
quote: ``We did not want to create social chaos over a few 
cartons of cigarettes, but the negotiations never amounted to 
anything and smuggling increased without anyone taking 
action.''
<P>
	My question to the Prime Minister is as follows: How can he 
reconcile the comments of the commanding officer of the RCMP 
in Quebec with his own statements, when he asked us to name 
names, ostensibly because the RCMP did not have enough 
evidence to intervene?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have nothing further to add. We delivered a very clear statement 
in the House last Tuesday. The police are doing their job and 
cigarette smuggling networks in Canada are in the process of 
disappearing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, for over a 
month now, the Prime Minister has been telling this House that 
the RCMP can enforce the law anywhere in Canada, that there 
are no ``no go'' zones and that the law applies equally to 
everyone.
<P>
	What is the Prime Minister's reaction to comments by the 
commanding officer of the RCMP in Quebec to the effect that 
politicians, out of fear, never succeeded in negotiating with the 
natives on this issue and as a result, cigarette smuggling spread 
throughout the reserves?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker,

reduction is to get the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP or down to 
about $23 billion for 1996-97.
<P>
	Is this still the government's deficit target, the target that 
Canadians should have in mind when they read the deficit 
figures in the budget next week?

that is what was written in the red book, so that will be the target.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a supplementary question for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The government has implied that it wants to broaden the tax 
base to achieve greater equity but not to increase the total tax 
burden on Canadians. Is this still the primary objective of the 
government's tax policy, the objective that Canadians should 
have in mind when they analyse the tax changes in the budget 
next week?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am wondering what kind of question the hon. member will have 
next week.
<P>
	We will have the budget next Tuesday and he will have all 
these answers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question was whether or not that was still the objective. My 
second supplementary question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The government has stated time and time again that job 
creation is its highest priority and that its economic policies 
should be judged first and foremost on their impact on jobs.
<P>
	Is this still the government's highest priority, the one that 
Canadians should have in mind when they analyse the job 
impact of the budget next week?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we started before the budget when we put in place the 
infrastructure program that was to create jobs. There are other 
programs of the same nature in the red book.

<P>

we have to understand that New Brunswick has had the privilege 
of having six years of good Liberal government.

	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question is 
for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister is going to achieve a balanced budget 
eventually, and the red book states that the government will do it 
in three years which will require an $8 billion a year reduction, 
will we see that in the budget coming down next week?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member should read the red book again. His leader 
referred accurately to the fact that we said we had a goal to 
reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of GNP at the end of the third year 
of our mandate. We never said a balanced budget.
<P>
	If the member wanted a balanced budget, it would have been 
better for him to have voted for the provincial Liberal Party in

<P>
	As the minister knows, international companies with 
subsidiaries in Canada establish prices for transferring goods 
and services between them. This is known as transfer pricing. 
Although the finance department is attempting to clarify the 
rules for establishing these prices there is still the question of 
tax fairness as profits can be internally adjusted.
<P>
	This government says it is concerned about increasing its 
revenues. In order to create more equity in the tax system would 
the minister commit to investigating tax losses from transfer 
pricing and report to the House his plan to access that lost 
revenue?
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr.

monitoring by my department and of course by officials of the 
Department of Finance.
<P>
	I would like to inform the hon. member that we are pleased 
she has come forward in this House to point out there may be tax 
inequities which my colleague the Minister of Finance will 
address next week in the budget.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
supplementary question. By issuing a press release on January 7 
urging Canadian taxpayers and companies to encourage 
compatible transfer pricing methods, the government 
recognizes there is a problem.
<P>
	Will the minister commit to developing legislation for 
transfer pricing to ensure these corporations pay their fair share 
of taxes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member, her party and all other parties in the 
House can be assured that is an objective, to ensure there is 
fairness not only in this particular area of taxation but in others.
<P>
	I will give a little more information on this. There are 
differing theories of how to tax international corporations and at 
what point. We do have some differences with the Americans in 
this regard. It is a matter not only for my department and the 
Department of Finance to work on, but also for other colleagues 
to deal with the Americans and other countries to make sure we 
establish a system which is not only fair from a national point of

<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> As a point of law, Mr. Speaker, local 
municipalities are creatures of the province. However, in the 
spirit of these negotiations, because municipalities are 
concerned about zoning where they abut aboriginal lands and 
economic development where it affects both the municipalities 
and the First Nations, I put forward, as a statement not as a 
policy, that where possible municipalities should be invited in 
an open and transparent mode so they will know exactly what is 
happening, and they will know exactly where they fit into the 
mosaic. Generally this has been accepted by many of the mayors 
I have talked to across the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River):</B> Mr.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Again, Mr. Speaker, although I do not like the 
term because I was once a mayor, municipalities are creatures of 
the provinces, the direct jurisdiction between the province and 
the municipality.
<P>
	Any municipality that is interested is invited to listen and to 
participate from Yukon down through B.C. As a matter of fact I

remarks about a year ago now, or last summer, in respect of the 
desirability of a plebiscite.
<P>
	Having said that, we are not philosophically opposed to a 
plebiscite or to the proposition that was put forward by the farm 
groups referred to in the hon. member's question.
<P>
	I would caution the hon. member and those farm 
organizations that we all need to think through very carefully 
both the procedures and the implications of a plebiscite with 
respect to this particular farm marketing issue because it is not 
quite as simple as those who might raise this proposition would 
lead some to believe.

	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the other day an article in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> stated that Canada 
Post recently awarded an Australian firm a contract to produce 
Canadian stamps.

<P>
	The hon. member should be apprised that 57 per cent of 
Canada Post's printing requirements are done by Canadian 
suppliers. I can assure the hon. member we are continuing to 
work with Canada Post as well as Industry Canada to ensure that 
the remaining 43 per cent which comes from offshore will come 
from Canadian suppliers in the not too distant future.

	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the minister of agriculture or Minister of Transport.
<P>
	Last August the previous government began dismantling the 
Crow benefit portion of the Western Grain Transportation Act 
by cutting it by 10 per cent. It proposed further cuts over four 
years which would see the Crow disappear completely.
<P>
	Since rents and farmland values are being forced down by this 
policy, making the refinancing of a diversified western economy 
more difficult, if not impossible, will the government fully 
reinstate the Crow benefit in perpetuity?

unaccustomed as I am to taking the same line as the Minister of

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of National Revenue. On February 
11 last, I called the attention of this House to the case of the 
young Patrick Tremblay who is fighting a severe form of cancer. 
This young man has to undergo expensive treatment available 
only in Texas.
<P>
	To raise money to pay for his treatment, a foundation has been 
set up. This foundation, we are told, will go on helping other 
people in a similar situation after Patrick is cured. 
Unfortunately, the Department of National Revenue is delaying 
granting the accreditation application that would enable this 
foundation to issue income tax receipts.
<P>
	My question is the following: Is the minister aware that any 
further delay in accrediting such a foundation is endangering not 
only Mr. Tremblay's life but also the lives of all Quebecers and 
Canadians who suffer from the same disease and who could 
benefit from the assistance provided by this foundation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the issue is a very important and serious one 
particularly for the family involved.
<P>
	The department is faced with the problem of the very tight 
legal requirements put on it by this House and of course by 
legislation. I will however attempt to see what I can do. In due 
course I hope to be able to report to the hon. member a decision 
one way or the other.

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have an 
unexpected question for the Minister of Justice. It concerns the 
mercy applications under section 690 of the Criminal Code 
which pertains to applications for new trials by convicted 
Canadians.
<P>
	As the minister knows, it has taken as long as four years for 
his department to process and decide on such applications. In 
view of this would the minister consider a review of the process 
within his department in order to expedite these applications? 
Would the minister give consideration to adopting the 
recommendations made by the royal commission of inquiry into 
the Donald Marshall case?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, a review of the process 
surrounding the section 690 applications is presently under way 
in the Ministry of Justice. We are taking a close look at the 
recommendations of the Marshall inquiry.
<P>
	We will be announcing in the next few months changes in the 
system to ensure that all such applications are dealt with fairly 
and as quickly as possible.
<P>
	I should point out one thing. While it is true some of the 
applications in recent years have taken an extended period, I 
have examined the records and they show that in those cases 
counsel for the applicant was making additional submissions 
sometimes with new evidence. Therefore those working on the 
application had to take that new material into account which 
delayed the process.
<P>
	I do agree we should process them as quickly as possible in 
the interests of fairness and justice. We do have it under review. 
I will be happy to report to the House when we have come to our 
conclusions.

	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the member for Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville 
rose on a question of privilege and made submissions with 
regard to certain allegations that have been made.
<P>
	He indicated when he rose on his question of privilege that he 
wished to clarify an issue, and I am quoting from <I>Hansard</I> at 
page 1387: ``that has become a subject of debate not only in this 
Chamber but also across the nation''.
<P>
	The member stated: ``This has impeded my ability to function 
effectively and efficiently as the member of Parliament for the 
riding of Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville''. Later on in his 
submission he stated: ``I invite my colleagues in the House to 
examine my academic credentials and weigh the accusations in a 
rational and judicious manner''.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I confirm that you and I had a discussion earlier 
this day with regard to this particular matter. I understand you 
are presently considering the question of privilege raised by the 
hon. member.
<P>
	I indicated to you that I wished to make submissions on this 
question of privilege. Therefore I wish to ask you to defer your 
decision on this matter pending an opportunity for me and other 
members, if they so wish and desire, to make submissions as to 
why this particular unfortunate matter has affected the 
privileges of each of us individually and the House as a whole.
<P>
<B>(1505 ) </B>
<P>
	As you know, Mr. Speaker, you will be called upon when a 
matter of privilege is raised to simply determine whether it is a 
matter of privilege and whether to allow a motion to go forward 
recommending a particular course of action.
<P>
	I wish to give notice of my intention to move a motion. If you 
so decide there is a breach of privilege, I wish to move a motion 
that the matters affecting the hon. member for 
Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville be referred to the 
elections and privileges standing committee. The committee 
would then have the authority to investigate the allegations 
against the hon. member. The committee would have the 
authority to hear and I would submit-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. Colleagues, I have not yet made a 
decision as to whether our hon. colleague does indeed have a 
prima facie case of privilege.
<P>
	I will probably rule tomorrow but if I deem it necessary it may 
take some extra time. I want to make sure I consider all aspects 
of this submission which have been put forward. When I have 
decided, I will come back to the House and give my ruling at that 
time.
<P>
	Following the ruling we will then proceed in an orderly 
fashion as to whether or not the House indeed wants to consider 
anything further in the matter of privilege.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like the opportunity as a 
member of the House to make submissions in advance of your 
ruling.
<P>
	I believe that members of Parliament have been affected by 
this matter. We have certainly received telephone calls and 
letters. I simply wish and I would like you to confirm that I will 
have the opportunity to make submissions to you in advance of 
your decision.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I take the request under advisement. I will 
make a decision on this request as well as on the question of 
privilege and will come back to the House at the earliest possible 
time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am 
a new member. Would the Speaker please clarify for the House 
whether this would be a question of privilege? I thought a 
question of privilege was regarding a personal matter. This does 
not seem to follow that qualification according to my 
understanding of the standing orders.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The Chair will indeed make a ruling on the 
question of privilege which is before the House at this time. The 
Chair will also consider the request put forward by the member 
for York South-Weston.
<P>
	When I have made that decision on behalf of the House I will 
come back and report to the House at the earliest possible time.

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government believes 
that a healthy economy can and must flow from a healthy 
environment.
<P>
	We owe it to our children to preserve and enhance the 
extraordinary environment with which we have been blessed. In 
doing so we can and must set the foundation for a whole new era 
of economic growth. We owe it to our children to explore the 
competitive advantage which a commitment to the environment 
will bring.
<P>
	All of us have to change our behaviour in big and small ways 
beginning here in government. Individual Canadians have 
already been doing that in their own lives.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1432"> 1432 </A></B>
<P>
	The challenge for us in Parliament is to find means of 
accelerating the move toward sustainable development. That is 
why the government stated in the throne speech that the concept 
of sustainable development will become an integral part of 
government policies.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our Parliament must be a leader when it comes to protecting 
our environment, preventing pollution and promoting 
environmental industries. We must take the lead by making the 
government more ecologically sensitive.
<P>
	We must understand that government policies have an 
important bearing on people's attitude. Depending on the 
approach adopted by Parliament, Canada will or will not become 
a world leader in sustainable development.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The blunt fact is that we can only succeed if we forge a 
partnership with all Canadians. Our government must set an 
example and must show leadership. We cannot do it alone. We 
need to work in partnership and in harmony with the provinces 
and territories, with labour and environmental groups and 
business. Most of all, we have to tap the talent and goodwill of 
individual Canadians.
<P>
	We will only reach our goal of combining a strong economy 
with a strong environment when we include every Canadian in 
that effort.
<P>
	Today, in that spirit of reaching out, in that spirit of inclusion, 
I am pleased to announce that the government will fulfil another 
red book commitment, our decision to proclaim the act to 
establish the national round table on the environment and the 
economy.
<P>
	Parliament voted to establish the round table as a 25-person 
body composed of a broadly representative membership from 
across the country. It must reflect the need for concerted action 
in all areas of Canada if we are to achieve sustainable 
development.
<P>
	The round table's purpose is to act as a catalyst in identifying, 
explaining and promoting the principles and practices we must 
adopt if we are to meet the needs of our generation without 
compromising the ability of future generations to live in a clean 
environment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This round table can do research on critical aspects of 
sustainable development. It will provide useful advice to every 
sector in our country regarding ways to integrate environmental 
and economic considerations into decisions and actions. In my 
opinion, the round table can especially facilitate the creation of 
a partnership to make sustainable development a concrete 
reality in Canada.
<P>
	In order to have this partnership, we must ensure that people 
have confidence in our innovative process, and we must give 
them the opportunity to fully participate. As well, we must take 
into account the opinions and interests of everyone, and a real 
commitment to reach a consensus is also necessary.
<P>
	The round-table process has proven successful in Canada, 
and other countries are also using it. Indeed, a good number of 
provincial and local round tables have managed to solve 
sensitive and contentious issues by way of a consensus.
<P>
	The national round table must have a strong legislative 
mandate to fully play its role of catalyst and promoter regarding 
environmental and economic issues. I am very pleased that the 
Prime Minister himself has agreed to chair this round table.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Membership on the round table on the environment and the 
economy must provide the links we need with communities, 
regions and provinces that are already taking creative ideas and 
translating them into practical solutions. The round table can 
and should involve Canadians at all levels of society, Canadians 
who can contribute to our collective goal of sustainable 
development by reaching out and motivating others to take 
action.
<P>
	Openings on the round table will soon be published in the 
<I>Canada Gazette</I>, but here and now I want to ask interested 
members of Parliament to include applications from interested 
Canadians. In addition, I would be pleased to receive direct 
suggestions from members of Parliament on the balanced 
membership of the round table.
<P>
	Through its unique character and make-up the round table is 
well positioned to seek new and pragmatic solutions to the 
problems facing our country and the world. The national round 
table can play a lead role in the current efforts to develop a 
sustainable framework for Canada.
<P>
	Through this act we are effectively charging the round table 
with becoming a real agent for change in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must find innovative and sensible ways of making Canada 
a leader in sustainable development. Together, we must find 
ways of changing how we think and particularly how we act. 
Sustainable development must become an every day reality. Mr. 
Speaker, I am disturbed when I see that even the Government of 
Canada ignores our own environmental capabilities in its policy. 
What we are doing here in this House should be a signal to all 
Canadian governments to follow suit.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	Each and every one of us is responsible for the prosperity of 
our economy and the cleanness of our environment. All of us, 
federalists as well as separatists, are responsible for our future. 
This is why we must give  all Canadians an opportunity to 
express themselves and to get involved. In this sense, the 
government's decision to table an act creating the national round 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1433"> 1433 </A></B>
<P>
table on the environment and the economy is an important step, 
and I urge hon. members to sit at that table and to get involved.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the Minister of the Environment for giving us the text of 
her minister's statement at around 10 o'clock this morning.
<P>
	The National Round Table on the Environment and the 
Economy Act was finally proclaimed today, after being tabled in 
the House in April 1992 and receiving royal assent in June 1993.
<P>
	This round table, the purpose of which is to merge the 
environment and the economy, was inspired by the concept of 
sustainable development. It is clear that whatever our political 
affiliations, as the minister said earlier, whether we are 
sovereigntists or federalists, we all breathe the same air and 
drink the same water. We are all concerned about the impact 
poor environmental management may have on our quality of 
life. And we are even more aware of the impact our present 
actions and decisions may have on the lives of future 
generations.
<P>
	Not to support this legislation would be a sign of bad faith. 
And I am therefore very pleased, as is the Bloc Quebecois, and 
as were all opposition parties at the time, to see the government 
go ahead with this concept for obtaining intelligent advice from 
various sources.
<P>
	However, as the Liberals and the NDP pointed out at the time, 
some aspects of this legislation are not clear or are at least open 
to question. The corporation's operational structure allows it to 
work with a measure of independence. However, there is always 
the possibility that the table will have ties with the government, 
since its chairperson and members are appointed by the 
Governor in Council.
<P>
	Earlier, the Minister of the Environment announced that the 
Prime Minister had agreed to chair the round table. If the 
minister is considering applications, I would be glad to oblige, if 
you agree, that is-
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Pierre-Marc Johnson is vice-chairperson.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Yes, he is a good choice. He 
would have made a good chairperson.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> We know him.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Yes, I know.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> So the corporation's operational 
structure allows it to work with a measure of independence, but 
there is always the possibility that the table may have ties with 
the government, since its members are appointed by the 
Governor in Council.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	However, I think the government is very much aware of this 
aspect, since it was involved in the debate on this legislation, 
and I am sure it will find a way to deal with this.
<P>
	The government is comfortable with this legislation since 
under the Conservatives, the hon. member for Davenport 
proposed certain amendments that were, in fact, adopted.
<P>
	The Liberal government is well aware that our air, water and 
soil-our physical environment-are very much at risk, to put it 
mildly. In some cases, they have reached the point of no return.
<P>
	We should not focus on one particular form of consultation at 
the expense of the other components of our environment.
<P>
	Often, to show it is environment-conscious, the government 
adopts this kind of legislation while at the same time cutting 
back on related commitments. Take, for instance, the defunct 
Conservative government's green plan. In 1990, the plan's 
initial budget of $3 billion over five years was reduced a few 
months later to $3 billion over six years. This is a reduction of 
20 per cent in the same year, and there were subsequent cuts later 
on.
<P>
	The National Round Table on the Environment and the 
Economy can be an effective tool, provided partisan 
considerations are excluded. No group has the right to use the 
environment to promote partisan interests.
<P>
	Next Tuesday, February 22, the Minister of Finance will bring 
down his first budget. In the section on environment and 
sustainable development, we will see whether the government 
puts its money where its mouth is.
<P>
	Since we know this is one of the first priorities of the Liberal 
government, we can assume that budget allocations for the 
Department of the Environment will help us make up for lost 
time.
<P>
	In concluding, I want to say that we should support this 
initiative for consultation and co-operation. We must take 
advantage of this opportunity to communicate with various 
players in sectors that are in a position to help the environment. 
The Liberal government has chosen this vehicle to get out of its 
ivory tower. The results will be gratifying, provided it does its 
homework.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to commend the hon. minister for this initiative. I believe it 
is the direction we want to go and that most Canadians want to 
go. Most of us feel inside that we are environmentalists and this 
comes from the way we recycle our paper or compost or 
garbage. It is the mood of Canadians to move in this direction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1434"> 1434 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to go back to a little history of where we have 
come from, because I believe the pendulum has swung through 
from the economy versus the environment. It was an either/or 
situation and I believe it was to the detriment of many 
Canadians.
<P>
	That basically was the old way. I believe the new way, the 
integration of the economy and the environment, is the way to go 
because that is sustainable development. I believe that is the 
direction that this legislation is taking.
<P>
	The goal is to combine a strong economy with a strong 
environment. This is basically as the minister has said and I 
believe it is excellent.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	Now to the round table itself. I would hope that their 
perspective is balanced. I believe that balance will come from 
the people who are on this board. I would hope that the make-up 
of the board is not all one side of the equation or all of the other. I 
hope there is a very broad base so that we have the voice of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	I would also hope that there is a national perspective, a 
perspective that comes from coast to coast and including the 
territories. I would be most disappointed to see the make-up of 
this round table from largely central Canada or one point in 
Canada.
<P>
	I would like to move on to the mandate because I am a bit 
unsure, and that is maybe because I am new in the House. Is this 
an advisory body or a legislative body? To whom does it report? 
The minister said that the Prime Minister will be chairing it. 
Does it report to the House, to caucus or to the Prime Minister? I 
see it is to you.
<P>
	Basically those are the points I wanted to address. I would 
hope that the meetings are open and that the public is involved. 
What will be the cost? We need to know where Canada is today, 
which is in a debt hole, and how much this is going to cost.
<P>
	Finally I would hope that this is a meaningful process, that 
three or four years down the road that we have not rehashed what 
we know about sustainable development only to find that we 
have not really moved ahead.

	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway)</B> moved for

Code (aiding suicide).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I have the honour to introduce a bill that 
would amend the Criminal Code to allow terminally ill people 
the right to die with dignity with the assistance of their doctor.
<P>
	People with terminal illnesses, some suffering terrible pain or 
indignity, are now being assisted to die but too often it is being 
done by secret physicians who perform secret acts or, worse yet, 
by family or friends with no safeguards whatsoever in place.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>]

	The current legislation which dates back to 1892 can be 
extremely cruel to those who are dying and to their families.

	Sue Rodriguez, a woman who lived her life and approached 
her death with incredible courage and dignity, urged the

	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Restigouche-Chaleur)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-216, an Act to amend the 
Unemployment Insurance Act (jury service).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the purpose of this bill is to amend the 
Unemployment Insurance Act so that persons serving on juries 
will not be deemed ineligible for benefits simply because they 
are involved in this activity.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The object of this bill is to prevent people who are eligible for 
UI and who are selected for jury duty from being ruled ineligible 
for their unemployment insurance.
<P>
	In a number of cases in the last couple of years nationally, the 
judges have dismissed jurors who were receiving UI on the 
grounds that they may be disqualified for UI. This is to point out 
that problem and rectify it.

again looking forward to that support.

that time who had agreed to move this bill to committee for

If he receives that then he can ask for unanimous consent to send 
it directly to committee.
<P>
	Do members agree to ask for unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is a great number of new 
members in the House. I think it might be proper to follow 
normal procedures and let new members become familiar with 
this legislation before we give unanimous consent.

members. I take it the member for Kindersley-Lloydminster is 
denying unanimous consent. Very well. The Chair will not have 
to put the second question.

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government's inability to re-establish and 
increase budgets for social housing construction programs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of pleasure and 
satisfaction that I rise today to take part in this debate on social 
housing.
<P>
	Since I first rose in this House on January 21 to make a 
member's statement, I have taken every opportunity to remind 
the other members that 1.2 million Canadians have urgent 
housing needs. These people scattered in every one of our 
ridings are facing an intolerable situation. They are living in 
appalling housing conditions and their rents are eating up an 
excessive part of their income.
<P>
	For several years, elected members of the government have 
been claiming left and right that Canada is a highly-rated 
country where living conditions are the best. I sincerely believe 
that we must come down to earth and look at reality. 
Comparisons between countries are no longer valid. They are 
often dangerous because they breed indifference and hamper the 
recognition of real problems. They create false impressions on 
real life.
<P>
	In June 1993, the UN committee on economic, social and 
cultural rights published a report on poverty in Canada. It 
painted an devastating picture of the housing situation and 
expressed surprise that despite the obvious existence of 
homeless people and the inadequate housing conditions, social 
housing expenditures only amounted to 1.3 per cent of public 
spending.
<P>
	So this international, high-profile organization has cut 
government big guns down to size by saying that Canada is not 
meeting one of its first obligations, namely to provide adequate 
and affordable housing for everyone.
<P>
	What is true for Canada is even truer for Quebec as 44.3 per 
cent of Quebec households live in rental housing, compared 
with a Canadian average of 37.1 per cent. So the problem is more 
acute there. The poorest provinces are also confronted with this 
difficult situation.
<P>
	In the face of this strongly denied reality, the government 
must act quickly and responsibly in this regard. It is now putting 
its head in the sand by constantly repeating that it does not have 
the money.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1436"> 1436 </A></B>
<P>
	It recently informed us that it will spend money on residential 
rehabilitation. But this money does not do anything to help the 
homeless because they have no residence to rehabilitate in the 
first place.
<P>
	While this kind of program creates jobs, these jobs too often 
lead to a rise in the cost of private rental housing. By improving 
housing, owners raise rents. This, in turn, makes it worse for 
low-income households who must shell out more money.
<P>
	The Liberal government's declarations clearly show that it is 
moving toward maintaining the policy put in place by the 
Conservatives in this area. The Liberals' first 100 days are 
nothing to reassure poorly housed Canadians. They are 
following in the footsteps of the Conservatives whose policies 
and decisions could be called the ``social housing massacre''.
<P>
	Available figures confirm beyond question that a massacre 
occurred between 1984 and 1994. Until 1984, some 25,000 new 
social housing units were being built in Canada every year. It 
took the Conservatives 10 years to kill that formula so that, 
since January 1, 1994, the federal government no longer 
contributes to the construction of a single social housing unit. It 
is quite a record to go from 25,000 to zero. We can see that their 
decisions helped them to break another record, from 152 to only 
two members in this House.
<P>
	These alarming figures show the abdication of the federal 
government in this area.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	The government also asked the Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation to become more efficient, in other words 
to cut costs. There are worrying indications that CMHC is 
looking for ways to save and is contemplating rent increases in 
social housing to increase its revenues. Basically, they would be 
taking money out of the pockets of the less fortunate, attacking 
their slender income to help other people with housing 
problems. What a shameful thing to do.
<P>
	That is what we are headed for with the government's silence. 
The members opposite are not reacting. It is as if there were no 
housing problems in their ridings, and all their constituents had 
decent housing. I think that is hardly the case. I would ask them 
to go out in their riding and see how things really are. Then come 
back and get in touch with your Minister of Finance to apprise 
him of the situation and urge him to make funds available in his 
next budget, on February 22, to re-establish and increase 
budgets for social housing programs.
<P>
	Of course, the Minister of Finance has been going on and on 
with the same story for weeks. He is putting us to sleep. He is 
trying to make us bite the bullet of austerity. This budget will be 
a tough one, we are told over and over. But the money is there. It 
is only a matter of making the right choices. The government 
must take its responsibilities and act with courage and fairness.
<P>
	We, in the Bloc Quebecois, have suggested that the 
government go over each program, each item of government 
expenditure to cut the fat, the squandering, the costly 
duplication within the federal administration. This process 
could have allowed us to find funds to help provide housing for 
the less fortunate segment of our society. Unfortunately, the 
minister opted for travelling across the country to hold 
meaningless pre-budget consultations instead. During that 
time, public funds are spent lavishly and inefficiently. Year after 
year, the Auditor General has a lot to say on this subject.
<P>
	Here in this House and the Hill, we can see examples of 
squandering of public funds every day. Apparently, the sky is the 
limit. Simplicity and efficiency are not commonplace. Specific 
examples: Public Works are repairing roofs in winter and 
rebuilding stone walls in minus 30 degree Celsius temperatures. 
To carry out summer jobs during the winter comes at a premium 
and certainly does not do much for the productivity of the 
workers. It is shear squandering!
<P>
	Other departments are literally devouring public funds. The 
Department of National Defence for instance, with a $12 billion 
plus annual budget. Piggish! Incredible amounts are swallowed 
up by that department's equipment programs. The Canadian 
patrol frigates will end up costing us $9 billion, while the 
ADATS air defence system initially designed for our military 
bases in Germany, but which will not be used and has been 
classified as non operational, has cost us all of $1 billion.
<P>
	Governments will soon embark upon infrastructure programs 
that will require substantial funding.
<P>
	How can we tell the less fortunate that the government does 
not have any money for social housing when it is spending all 
this public money, often astronomical sums of money?
<P>
	How are we to explain to Mrs. Johanne Lepage from 
Châteauguay who is spending 46 per cent of her monthly income 
of $1,524, or $700 a month, on rent, heat and hydro for herself 
and her four children, how are we to explain to her and her four 
young children that the government spent $1 billion on useless 
radars but does not have money to build decent social housing 
that she could rent for just 25 per cent of her income? This lady 
is not the only one in such dire straits. In Quebec, 404,000 
households spend over 30 per cent of their income on rent and 
there are 273,000 more Canadian households in the same 
situation. And there is worse: 194,000 Quebec households are 
spending over 50 per cent of their income on rent. In Canada, 
there are 584,000 in that situation.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1437"> 1437 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, this situation is scandalous and unacceptable. 
Canada, a supposedly wealthy and developed country, has a poor 
record in this area. The Liberals have no choice but to 
re-establish the budget for social housing.
<P>
	The Minister of Foreign Affairs is very familiar with and has 
always been a staunch advocate of social housing. On May 5, 
1993, the hon. minister rose in the House to call upon the former 
government, and I quote, ``to act as soon as possible to save the 
social housing and co-operative housing program in Canada''. 
Not even a year ago, the minister was claiming that the 
government was trampling the fundamental right of every 
individual to decent housing.
<P>
	I would hope that the Minister of Foreign Affairs will 
continue to champion this cause. I challenge him to press his 
colleague, the Minister of Finance, to untie the purse strings and 
make funds available for social housing. I challenge him to 
make his colleague aware of the plight of the poor in Canada. At 
the time, other ministers, including the Minister of Human 
Resources Development and the Minister of the Environment 
and Deputy Prime Minister, also defended social housing 
programs. I hope that they have not had a change of heart, 
simply because they are in power. I challenge them to prove that 
they are concerned about social housing and to take some 
concrete action!
<P>
	Other options must be explored in order to find the funds to 
help the most disadvantaged in society. The government will 
make major savings by eliminating certain tax shelters. It is 
important, if not essential, that large corporations and the 
wealthy contribute to our society. How can we say to the poorest 
people that the government's coffers are empty when the 
wealthy do not contribute anything?
<P>
	Every month, hundreds of thousands of tenants ask 
themselves the same question. How am I going to pay the rent? 
They wonder how they will manage when their income consists 
of social assistance, unemployment insurance or old age 
benefits, or derives from a precarious, low-paying or part-time 
job. These households are forced to make desperate choices, 
which can mean cutting either their food, clothing, 
transportation or basic care budget.
<P>
	How can we stand by while young people go hungry every 
month? The members opposite and the Minister of Finance 
should give some serious thought to this question. We must 
never lose sight of the fact that these children are the generation 
of the future. We have a responsibility to provide for them. 
Moreover, the government must not shirk its responsibility. It 
must work to eliminate social and economic disparities between 
members of our society.
<P>
	Social housing is the only way to provide affordable housing 
for all Canadians in need. It offers much better housing than the 
private market, housing which can be adapted to specific needs 
and requirements. Co-operative housing, especially, helps 
people pull themselves up and take greater control over their 
living conditions. It helps physically improve old 
neighbourhoods, keep the resident population and generally 
enhance the quality of life.
<P>
	Social housing also creates jobs. According to Clayton 
Research Associates Limited, building 1,000 co-operative or 
social housing units creates 2,000 jobs; renovating them creates 
800. Furthermore, very significant savings on health and social 
services can be made. Families will be better housed, better fed 
and better clothed.
<P>
	Economy and employment-that is what the Liberal platform 
is all about. What are you waiting for to act? We, in the Bloc 
Quebecois, feel that the Government of Quebec should have full 
responsibility for housing. The Société d'habitation du Québec 
should be the only one in charge.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	As along as Quebec is part of the federal system, we will 
demand a major and equitable financial contribution from it.
<P>
	The Liberals, and especially their leader, kept hammering 
away on the theme of dignity and pride before October 25. 
Dignity and pride everywhere and always. Now we need action. 
It is time to prove that you yourselves have pride and dignity.
<P>
	I conclude by telling you about Jacqueline Cayen, a 32-year 
old mother of three children, who lives on $1,442 a month. She 
went back to school recently and intends to obtain a high school 
diploma in January 1995. She says, ``My rent costs me $350 a 
month, and electricity is $150 a month. In winter, it is cold near 
the windows and I heat the shed. To pay $500 on rent, I have to 
cut on food and clothing and especially hope that nothing 
unforeseen will happen''.
<P>
	So it is up to the government to act.

	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development):</B>
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I trust members of the Official 
Opposition will not expect a simultaneous translation of those 
comments. I think the people upstairs are probably wondering 
what to do about it now as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anawak:</B> If I was not wearing my earpiece earlier I 
probably would not have understood a word the hon. member 
was saying.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1438"> 1438 </A></B>
<P>
	I just want to comment on a couple of things that the hon. 
member mentioned or omitted. One point was the fact that 
aboriginal people have the poorest housing. I did not hear the 
word aboriginal once in the whole presentation.
<P>
	The other point was that I did not hear anything, other than 
Canadian or global, about how many houses are needed in 
Northwest Territories or in British Columbia. I just heard the 
statistics in Quebec.
<P>
	I know that the member is a member of Her Majesty's Loyal 
Opposition and I think the member should represent all 
Canadians. I did not hear that.
<P>
	I would like to comment also on her comment about the hon. 
minister for external affairs. She seemed to contradict, telling us 
that we were not aware of all the housing needs and then quoting 
the hon. minister. The minister must have been representing his 
constituents and Canada when he made his concerns known 
about housing and therefore did not need lessons from the hon. 
member about not knowing what was going on in our ridings 
over here. Does the hon. member have any understanding of the 
housing needs of aboriginal people across Canada as well as in 
Quebec? Does she have any statistics about the state of poor 
housing in areas other than Quebec?
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to answer the 
member in English. Maybe he will understand me better and he 
will not need the translation.
<P>
	The hon. member should know it is not the first time I have 
spoken about social housing. I have talked about aboriginal 
people also and their problems. He probably was not here to hear 
it. I always talk about social housing across Canada not only in 
Quebec. I gave statistics about Quebec because we are from 
Quebec. However I always speak for every Canadian in every 
riding everywhere.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank the 
hon. member for putting forward a motion which discusses some 
very substantive issues relating to social housing.
<P>
	I do not wish to be too congratulatory to my colleague 
opposite, however the subject matter before us this afternoon 
can be debated in a very civilized way and perhaps suggestions 
from all quarters can be put on the record. We can then present 
them to the Minister of Finance, who as we all know, is in the 
process of preparing his budget.
<P>
	Although I thank the hon. member for putting the subject 
matter before the House I cannot concur with the way in which 
the motion has been written and placed before the House.
<P>
	I want to assure all hon. members that as the minister 
responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing, I take my 
mandate very seriously, as does the government. We fully 
understand the challenges ahead and we are committed to 
carrying out the government's agenda in the area of housing.
<P>
	Make no mistake about it, the government is committed to 
maintaining a strong role in social housing across the country. 
Our commitment reflects our desire to help the least advantaged 
in our society and we will continue to do just that.
<P>
	In the speech from the throne the government clearly 
signalled its resolve to address the fiscal situation while at the 
same time acknowledging the continuing importance of social 
priorities. The government is respecting its promises within its 
current financial capabilities. I want to underline that because I 
have been asked questions numerous times on the floor of the 
House. I have gone out of my way to make it abundantly clear 
that the fiscal capacity of the Government of Canada is 
somewhat limited as the previous administration basically left 
the cupboard bare. The deficit of the Government of Canada is 
$12 billion over and above what we had anticipated and what we 
had been told during the election campaign. I am sure hon. 
members opposite have concluded that it does limit the fiscal 
capacity of the government to move in all the social areas in 
which we might wish to move.
<P>
	Having said that to the substance of the motion before us, I 
cannot concur with the way in which it has been written, 
although I am happy about the subject being debated just days 
before the budget.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	It should be clearly stated that the government is providing 
close to $2 billion for the direct financing of some 652,000 
households across the country. That is a very substantial amount 
of money which is lent under the auspices of the direct lending 
program, administered by Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation.
<P>
	To suggest otherwise is being totally irresponsible in my 
view. I direct those comments not necessarily to members 
opposite but to those who are outside the Chamber and those 
who may come into the Chamber and speak to the issues, that the 
government is making an important contribution to social 
housing. The hon. member made reference to the fact that this 
administration is the same as the old administration. That is not 
true.
<P>
	The throne speech which was tabled in the other House and 
which has been referred to by the Prime Minister and by myself 
on several occasions, talked about social housing. We have put 
down $100 million over a two-year period for the residential 
rehabilitation assistance program.
<P>
	With a limited fiscal capacity, we are providing $100 million 
to individuals in order to improve the quality of the stock of 
homes. This is a significant contribution in terms of the health 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1439"> 1439 </A></B>
<P>
and safety which will be across the  country, not in one particular 
area but all Canadians in all provinces will have an opportunity 
to benefit.
<P>
	We have embarked on a very ambitious program. I will get to 
it in a little more detail when I talk about the meeting I had with 
provincial ministers of housing. We intend to save through cost 
cutting measures over the next four years a total of $120 million. 
All will be directed for social housing. Those initiatives will be 
in concert with shared objectives and providing those who are in 
need with capacity to move on and to improve their quality of 
life. This is another significant aspect of the social housing 
budget.
<P>
	It should be noted that Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation has forecast for 1994 a modest recovery in new 
housing starts, which is approximately 162,000. If I can use this 
term-hon. members opposite may find it rather amusing-it is 
a conservative figure of 162,000 units.
<P>
	Other forecasting organizations, such as banks and trust 
companies, indicate that those figures are very low and housing 
starts in Canada will be much more significant than that. 
However being the modest type of government that we are, we 
intend to go with the low figure and that is the figure we are 
sharing with our colleagues across the way.
<P>
	Social housing also has implications for other areas and other 
aspects of the housing industry. For instance in the city of 
Toronto the issue is contaminated lands. In my discussions with 
ministers of housing across the country we have put this issue on 
the table for action by ministers and deputy ministers. In fact we 
discussed this when federal, provincial and territorial leaders 
met in Toronto. We agreed that our deputy ministers would 
pursue this vigorously, that we would have several meetings and 
hopefully make decisions on those kinds of issues, which have 
an impact on what the private sector does vis-à-vis social 
housing as well as other types of housing.
<P>
	It should be noted that the theme we use for this issue is one of 
common sense.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	I want to underline that there are numerous individuals who 
think that one cannot build a home anywhere in the country in 
1994 because of environmental concerns. There are others in 
this country who say to hell with environmental concerns, they 
will build the homes regardless.
<P>
	There are two competing views of a problem. I suggest, and 
ministers of the crown both federally and provincially have said, 
that we must have some semblance of common sense to the 
approach that the housing industry must take in the weeks, 
months and years ahead. That is an important aspect to which we 
must give due consideration.
<P>
	Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation is embarking 
upon a comprehensive-I want to underline the 
words-examination of the rental market research. My 
colleague who spoke earlier in the House with regard to the 
motion made reference to the province of Quebec and it having 
more units for the purpose of rental housing. That is very true.
<P>
	However, there are other areas in the country whether in 
Calgary, Edmonton, British Columbia, parts of Atlantic Canada, 
where the rental component is an essential element. We hope 
that in the next couple of months to put together the terms of 
reference for a comprehensive review of rental markets.
<P>
	I would be interested in hearing the views of hon. members on 
that subject as I will be hearing the views of the private sector 
and other stakeholders across the country.
<P>
	Encouraging innovation is another aspect of our policy as it 
relates to housing. It relates directly to social housing in terms 
of the things we might be able to do. I make reference to the 
good work that my colleague, the Minister of Natural 
Resources, has been able to do. I am sure you, Mr. Speaker, have 
followed that quite closely over the years.
<P>
	I refer of course to R-2000 which in my view has provided an 
upgrading of the quality of housing in the country which many 
private stakeholders as well as non-profit stakeholders have 
taken advantage of over the years. Therefore, encouraging 
innovation will be another aspect of our housing policies as we 
approach this fiscal year, 1994-95.
<P>
	I want to talk for a few minutes if I may in the time that I have 
remaining, which I believe is about 15 or 20 minutes-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Three. I do want to say that our commitment to 
housing for Canadians recognizes that there are groups with 
special needs which must be met.
<P>
	Victims of family violence is one such group. It is astounding 
to me that the incidence of family violence continues to 
increase. I look forward to the day when we no longer need to 
build and maintain shelters for women and their children fleeing 
domestic violence.
<P>
	For now we need to address this critical issue in the best way 
we can. We will continue to provide funding for shelters and 
other housing commitments under the family violence 
initiative.
<P>
	Canada Mortgage and Housing provides financial assistance 
for project haven and project next step, two programs that 
provide emergency shelter and long-term housing for victims of 
family violence and their children.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1440"> 1440 </A></B>
<P>
	There are 458 emergency shelter units that have been 
committed under the project haven initiative. Under the second 
phase of the family violence initiative, again a part of the social 
housing objectives of the Government of Canada, and the next 
step program, 150 self-contained units and 100 emergency 
shelter units are planned with a budget of $20.6 million.
<P>
	During the upcoming months Canada Mortgage and Housing 
will be discussing with its counterparts in the family violence 
initiative new opportunities for Canada Mortgage and Housing 
participation in a possible third phase to the family violence 
initiative.
<P>
	This assistance goes a long way to providing much needed 
shelter for women and children. The federal government is also 
committed to improving housing for seniors and persons with 
disabilities. As part of the national strategy for the integration of 
persons with disabilities, Canada Mortgage and Housing has 
been administering a $10 million two-year demonstration 
program called home adaptations for seniors' independence, or 
HASI, to help older seniors make their homes more liveable.
<P>
	In the few moments that I have left-I am sure there will be a 
number of questions that hon. members will want to raise-I 
want to say two final things. One is with regard to housing for 
aboriginals on reserves and housing for aboriginals off reserves 
across the country. My colleague, the Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development, and I have been working jointly on 
these issues and we hope to be able to put a paper before our 
cabinet colleagues to address some of these serious situations.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	I want to assure the House and hon. members that it is 
certainly a priority for me and it is certainly a priority for the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development that we 
will want to pursue this with vigour and creativity. I have spoken 
to a number of aboriginal groups which have come to me, and I 
want to underline this, with some very creative and innovative 
ways in which they as individuals can take control of their own 
destiny and provide the kinds of quality housing that they need.
<P>
	Finally, with regard to the province of Quebec, la belle 
province, I have had several discussions with the minister 
responsible for housing in the province of Quebec whom I am 
sure all members, particularly members opposite, would want to 
congratulate in terms of the new responsibilities he has achieved 
in the recent cabinet shuffle, including those of housing.
<P>
	I am now embarking upon a program with my provincial 
colleague in the province of Quebec, and possibly elsewhere in 
the country as well, in terms of how we as governments can get 
better value for our dollar. The province of Quebec has 
earmarked moneys for housing under the renovation sector. It is 
a very exciting, good and solid program.
<P>
	Through our moneys under the RRAP, the $100 million, and 
the amount of money we would provide for Quebec, we are 
trying to make an arrangement whereby we would lessen the 
administrative nightmares which are associated with the 
delivery of the housing in order to have the one level of 
government deliver that, of course maintaining a federal 
presence and maintaining some degree of credibility for the 
Government of Canada as we make expenditures in that great 
province, but lessening the administration and getting more 
money to the people who are really in need.
<P>
	I want to assure hon. members in my final sentence that we as 
a national government are seized with the issue of social 
housing. We are attempting through a number of vehicles with 
our provincial counterparts to provide the best value at the best 
price for Canadians across the country.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before going to questions and 
comments the hon. minister being a seasoned member will know 
the question of parliamentary language, a four-letter word 
starting with <I>h</I> and rhyming with ``bell''. The eyebrow of one of 
his own members went up when the minister used the word. I see 
in Beauchesne's sixth edition, page 147, that that phrase in 
context has been found to be unparliamentary in the past. I 
wonder if the minister would perhaps reflect on it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will accept your intervention, 
but I hope the Speaker will do the honourable thing post 6.30 
this evening and read the ``blues'' and ascertain that the word 
which he anticipated and thought that I had said was not what he 
has referred to but was a word which is called h-e-c-k, which is 
different from what he had said.
<P>
	However, if the hon. Speaker is not mistaken, I wish to 
withdraw any reference to that particular word. I would hope 
that if the Speaker has made a mistake he will come back to the 
House in due course.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Getting back to the substance of the 
debate, questions or comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the 
member is showing an interest for our belle province, I would 
like to give him a few statistics regarding social housing funding 
in Quebec. I wonder if he is aware of the fact that, from 1986 all 
the way up to 1993, there have been some significant 
discrepancies in the level of federal funding to various 
provinces in Canada, including Ontario.
<P>
	Quebec received between 10 and 13 per cent less from the 
federal government. That is why it is now calling for an 
improvement in the level of government expenditures. We say 
expenditures, but what we are really talking about are job 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1441"> 1441 </A></B>
<P>
creating investments. I am giving this piece of information to 
the minister because I would like him to tell me what his 
government intends to do to improve the social housing program 
in Quebec, in view of the fact  that, for the last ten years, Quebec 
has been short changed compared to other provinces.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Let me explain the criteria used by the federal government to 
allocate funding for housing. Quebec is at a real disadvantage 
because, to determine each province's share of the budget, 
Ottawa grants each province a certain number of units based on 
the real building cost per unit. Yet, we know that the average 
building cost per unit is higher in Ontario. This analysis shows 
how Quebec has always been short-changed by the federal 
government.
<P>
	I would like to add another point. The member mentioned new 
social housing starts by CMHC. There might be new housing 
starts in Ontario and other provinces, but certainly not in 
Quebec. I received a letter from a director in the CMHC 
economic department saying that there was no sign of recovery 
in housing starts in Quebec. I would like the minister to 
comment on that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank and congratulate 
the hon. member because I think those are very appropriate and 
very sound questions that should be raised on the floor of the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	First of all, I agree with my colleague that this should not be 
interpreted as subsidies. We should look at it as investment. I 
could not agree with her more.
<P>
	I cannot and will not try to rewrite history in terms of the 
amount of moneys which has gone to the province of Quebec. 
There are some rationales which have been given to me as to 
why Ontario, for instance, which has a bigger population and 
higher costs in terms of social housing, has received more and 
Quebec has received less.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member, who has raised a fundamental 
question of equity, that under this administration Quebec will 
get its fair share. I can assure the hon. member of that.
<P>
	The hon. member made reference to a number of other issues. 
However, it should be noted that the Government of Canada will 
also be providing $5 million over the next four years in financial 
assistance for unique, non-profit housing co-operatives in the 
southwest of Montreal. The hon. member probably knows that. 
This was done as a pilot project and we are continuing with that 
particular funding.
<P>
	I want the hon. member to know as well that in terms of the 
units in the province of Quebec, she knows and I know that the 
predominance of rental units as opposed to new free standing 
units is greater in the province of Quebec than anywhere else in 
the country. Hence, we will work closely with the Quebec 
government, as I indicated in my earlier remarks, in terms of 
providing moneys for renovations to that social housing stock.
<P>
	We will also work closely with the Government of Quebec and 
stakeholders in that province as well as in other provinces to see 
whether there are creative ways we can put money into projects 
to provide the kinds of new housing or renovated housing to 
house Canadians.
<P>
	I do not want to mislead the hon. member in thinking that 
there is a Santa Claus who sits two seats down from me, the 
Minister of Finance, who will walk in on February 22 and say to 
the people of Canada that he has a bag of goodies and this is what 
he is going to do.
<P>
	It is important to be fiscally responsible federally, 
provincially, municipally, in non-profit organizations and the 
private sector so that we can arrive at expenditures which meet 
our objective which is to provide affordable, reasonable and 
healthy housing for Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
many of my constituents who live in low-cost housing in my 
riding have made representations; they are quite numerous. 
Their income is not high and they are very concerned by a 
possible 25 to 30 per cent rent increase .
<P>
	Could the minister tell us today if I can go back to my riding 
and reassure my constituents by telling them their rent will not 
increase following the next budget?
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has again asked 
a very excellent question.
<P>
	The hon. member cannot have it both ways. One cannot put a 
hand on one's heart and plead for new social housing for 
Canadians across this country and only look at one side of the 
ledger, which is to cut expenditures and duplication, without 
looking at the other aspect in terms of revenue increases.
<P>
	I believe a total of eight provinces across the country have 
moved from the 25 per cent to 30 per cent or are in the process of 
moving in that direction. It is called rent geared to income. That 
is what the hon. member is referring to. It is a good question.
<P>
	I cannot give any assurances until such time as the Minister of 
Finance makes that kind of decision in the budgetary papers 
which are to be available on February 2.
<P>
	Let us not put our heads in the sand and say that we can only 
look on one side of the ledger, but we cannot look on the other 
side of the ledger when we are both saying that we need 
additional moneys for the purposes of creating new social 
housing for Canadians who are in desperate need.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="1442"> 1442 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to ask a question concerning the minister's comments on 
aboriginal housing on and off reserve.
<P>
	The statistical material that I have been able to make available 
indicates to me that housing on and off reserve for aboriginals 
has a habitable life span of some 16 to 25 years as compared with 
35 to 50 years for other housing, for non-aboriginal housing. 
This would indicate to me either there is substandard housing 
being provided in those cases or that housing is not being 
properly maintained and cared for.
<P>
	Has the minister taken into serious consideration those 
statistics in providing the renewal of housing?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not going to comment on the 
efficacy of the statistics that my colleague has used, although 
being in the House for some time I will have to accept them at 
his word.
<P>
	The only thing that I can reply to the question is that in my 
deliberations over the last three months, the last 103 days as a 
minister of the crown, with aboriginal groups across this 
country I have found an attitude among aboriginal leaders that 
they do not want handouts. What they want is an opportunity 
like we have had over the years to be able to have affordable 
housing. They are coming forward with creative, innovative, 
dynamic ideas which will involve the private sector, which will 
involve governments at all levels, and which will involve other 
stakeholders to provide that kind of quality housing.
<P>
	In terms of the substance of the question that the hon. member 
has asked, there is substandard housing on reserves across this 
country. Governments should work with aboriginal people, not 
against them, to provide meaningful solutions to real problems.
<P>
	To quote a friend of mine who shall remain nameless, shelter 
in this country, next to water and land and the air we breath, is 
probably the most important aspect of Canadian life.
<P>
	I hope I can call upon the hon. member for creative ideas, 
creative suggestions and support when we put our money where 
our mouth is.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I believe that the period reserved for 
questions and comments is over.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We will continue debate with the hon. member for Macleod on 
behalf of the Reform Party.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	Do I understand that members of the Reform Party wish to 
divide their time?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, I inform the House that we 
would like to divide our time. Could the member for Calgary 
Southeast speak prior to me?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with keen interest and deep concern that I rise today in the House 
to address the motion put forward by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	Acknowledging the seriousness of our discussions here today 
is more than just debating how to provide more effective and 
efficient support to those in need. It is a challenge most 
fundamental coming to the realization that responsible financial 
management requires thoughtful planning. Nowhere in this 
motion do I sense a strategy or any idea for that matter of where 
that money is going to come from.
<P>
	Spending in the country continues at an alarming rate. Even as 
I speak every minute represents $88,410 in additional debt. The 
jobless, the discouraged, the fearful and the poor are still out 
there. That is very overwhelming. What are we going to do?
<P>
	I believe we have to ask ourselves three things when we 
consider expenditures of any kind, especially in the area of 
social spending. It takes courage to be objective when reviewing 
social reforms because our emotions are involved and that is 
when it is most difficult to make a decision.
<P>
	My questions are what do we want, how do we get there, and 
what will it take?
<P>
	Let us look first at what Canadians want. People are outraged 
that our government has been in an out of control spending mode 
for two decades. Our nation is like a Hollywood front, all glitter 
and glass purchased on borrowed money with nothing of 
substance holding it up.
<P>
	It is a stunning picture on the reality of this House that not 
since the minority Parliament of 1972-74 has Parliament 
directly acted to cut expenditures. Even in that situation in 
which the government lacked a controlling majority, the House 
of Commons achieved two small cuts amounting in total to 
$20,000.
<P>
	To give a sense of proportion, since the current procedure for 
committee review of estimates was initiated in 1969, Parliament 
has authorized about $2 trillion worth of expenditures. This 
means that Parliament has made cuts that represent only one 
millionth of one per cent of total expenditures that it approves.
<P>
	Here we find the Bloc Quebecois having spoken eloquently on 
numerous occasions about deficit control and debt reduction, 
bringing forward a motion to spend money but not explaining 
within that context how that money will be found.
<P>
	If we want to reduce the deficit and begin a meaningful effort 
at getting our economy on track and our social reforms in place, 
the second question I ask is how will we get there? We begin 
with the right people.  We need people who will stand up and say 
this is not good enough, we are not willing to solve tough issues 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1443"> 1443 </A></B>
<P>
by following the easier path. Throwing money at programs is 
easy.
<P>
	I believe the social role of government is determined by 
clarifying priorities, responding to the give and take as 
governments attempt to pay for increasingly costly social 
programs while coping with the ever diminishing economic 
base.
<P>
	However, in the motion before us today there is no appearance 
of a give and take, merely an arbitrary dole, a short sighted, stop 
gap solution.
<P>
	Canadian welfare and social programs were designed on a 
premise of high employment. Therefore, social programs and 
economic policy are mismatched. Given that the overwhelming 
need for social support is the direct result of the poor economic 
health of the country, tinkering with pieces of social policy will 
not help. However, changing our economic policy will help.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	If a room is freezing because of frigid air coming in through a 
broken window, we do not turn up the heat; we fix the window. 
So it is with this motion. We are turning up the heat when we 
need to fix what is broken.
<P>
	It is the unhealthy fiscal policy of this government and that of 
previous governments which are causing such a strain on our 
social programs. As the debt has grown interest payments have 
consumed an increasing proportion of the government's 
spending. They now constitute an enormous strain on the 
treasury. In 1974 they consumed only 11 per cent of the 
government's spending but today they consume 25 per cent. 
That is $40 billion from the treasury which go to interest 
payments on the debt. That, not coincidentally, is about equal to 
the federal deficit.
<P>
	The point I am making is one given to us by the Auditor 
General: ``In 1992 in an age of scarce public resources and 
growing debt, seeking ways to see that things get done by or 
through others rather than spending money to do them becomes 
increasingly important''. Are we not ever going to hear the 
wisdom of those words as we apply mental energy ever seeking 
answers to the pressing social concerns of the day?
<P>
	I ask the question: What will it take? I know courageous 
leadership is part of the answer. A government that listens to its 
people is made stronger and can deal more effectively with 
tough issues.
<P>
	However, the Bloc motion puts more emphasis on spending to 
relieve an overburdened social system. I cannot support that. 
However I support greater financial sustainability over the long 
term. This requires a new commitment to sound, long-term 
financial management.
<P>
	Another important question now needs to be asked: is it better 
to help households obtain adequate housing by directly 
providing the housing or by assisting them to increase their 
incomes? This means fostering an  environment in which people 
are able to work. It is critical that we maintain federal spending 
at current levels for high priority functions, including labour 
force and training and adjustment programs.
<P>
	It is also necessary that provinces have the freedom to 
distribute federal funding and manage their own programs. This 
comes back to my earlier comments about priorities. 
Maintaining federal transfers to provinces remains key in terms 
of preserving those programs targeted to those in need. I believe 
that public money should be regarded by governments as funds 
held in trust and that governments should practise 
responsibility, particularly the responsibility to balance 
expenditures and revenues.
<P>
	We need to see significant spending cuts that are judiciously 
planned for the long term. I applaud those moves by the 
government to withhold funding support for programs for which 
there is no long range plan or strategy for the expenditure.
<P>
	In conclusion the choices and decisions we must make have to 
be so clearly laid out before every Canadian so that all of us 
understand where we are going and what it is going to take to get 
there. This is my challenge to this House and to the Bloc 
Quebecois on its motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her speech, but I must 
admit to having some difficulty understanding the underlying 
logic. I say this in a very cordial way, because I do appreciate her 
input in this debate and I would like to ask her a question.
<P>
	First, I noticed that she makes no difference between social 
programs and housing when, in my opinion, a distinction should 
be made. I will come back to this later in the 20 minutes allotted 
to me. My question is: Does she not feel that when the 
government intervenes in the housing sector, it becomes a 
job-creating sector? It is a sector where, if we invest public 
money, we get an interesting return on our investment.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	I do not know if the hon. member contacted the Co-operative 
Housing Federation of Canada. This organization conducted a 
very extensive and competent review of this issue and came to 
the conclusion-corroborated by American studies-that every 
time the government invests to build a co-op unit, 2.2 jobs are 
created.
<P>
	This example illustrates how social programs reform and 
social housing cannot be put on an equal footing. With all due 
respect, I must tell the hon. member that her speech did not 
reveal a great deal of social understanding, because when we 
discuss public finances, we cannot simply reason like an 
accountant trying to balance revenues and expenditures.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1444"> 1444 </A></B>
<P>
	I come from a riding where there are many social housing 
developments and I can tell the hon. member that families 
living in co-op units do not have to spend as much on housing; 
consequently, they can invest more on food and health care, and 
are therefore more likely to exert less pressure on those social 
programs which she seems to be so concerned about.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, if I may be 
so bold I just have to say that you do have an interesting way 
with your hands. You kept gesturing making me think I was 
running over my time or that I had to wrap up my comments. You 
might want to put your hands in your pockets, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for his question. He has to know how 
difficult this question is for me to address because it is based 
very much on emotion. I would be the last person to look at 
something from an accountant's perspective. When it comes to 
compassion requiring difficult decision making, that is difficult 
because this matter is very much couched in difficulty.
<P>
	I am sorry I did not make the relationship of social reform, 
social programs and expenditure more clear to the member. I am 
committed to an economic agenda. As members of the House of 
Commons during this particular Parliament it is extremely 
important that we get our spending under control. There will be 
a very inefficient and ineffective system for care for everyone if 
we do not get our financial house in order.
<P>
	While I was campaigning I did meet people who had lost their 
homes or who were going to be losing their homes because of the 
very sad condition of our economy. That is the perspective I 
brought to this debate and which I presented to the member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
commend my hon. colleague on her insight in terms of not only 
this debate but some of the comments she has made on a wider 
economic plane as it relates to housing.
<P>
	I have worked in the housing industry. I take exception to one 
of the questions concerning the need for federal government 
funding in the area of social housing as a means of stimulating 
jobs. I can assure the hon. member that in the private sector we 
often found ourselves with private money competing with 
public money. The result was not only waste and duplication, 
but at the end of the day there was lack of housing.
<P>
	I have a very simple question for the hon. member. Would she 
consider looking at housing as a means for the private sector, 
with all that is attached to it, to make a more affordable and 
accessible product in this country through financial 
institutions? That seems to be the real reason many developers 
and builders are not able to bring on a good product at an 
affordable price for the economy and for people to get access to 
quality housing.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for his question. Within the context of my 
presentation I did quote the 1992 Auditor General's report.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	That is exactly the point I was trying to make. We seek other 
ways to get things done in this particular area by approaching 
problems using private sector funding.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to make one brief comment.
<P>
	The hon. member raised a good point when she talked about 
the changes made to the way the estimates were dealt with in 
1969. It seems to me it is at that point that Parliament and the 
House of Commons began to lose control if not necessarily over 
spending, it lost its ability to affect spending, to have a 
committee actually have an effect on estimates. Therefore we 
got into the situation in which estimates are deemed to be passed 
by a certain period of time whether a committee has looked at 
them or not.
<P>
	When I first came here there was at least an effort to question 
the minister and to spend some time on that. However even that 
atrophied after a while because members came to notice that it 
did not really matter what they said and these things got to be 
passed anyway. The minister simply took up the necessary time. 
When it was over it was over and the estimates were passed. The 
point is well taken. No amount of parliamentary reform in the 
last little while has been able to overcome that dilemma.
<P>
	Just for the record much parliamentary reform happened here 
in the 1980s by unanimous consent or with the agreement of all 
parties, although not the reforms in April 1991. However, those 
particular reforms in 1969 were not the result of all-party 
agreement; they were brought in by the use of closure at that 
time by the then Liberal government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to refer 
to the motion the Bloc posed to us:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government's inability to re-establish and 
increase budgets for social housing construction programs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As I looked at this issue I looked at social housing 
construction in an overall sense in an attempt to put it in the 
frame of reference of Canada's needs.
<P>
	I found that this whole program is under the auspices of 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and that CMHC has 
a social housing stock of 650,000 units in our country. There are 
four separate programs: the native housing program; the seniors 
housing program; the next step housing program for women who 
are victims of violence; and the housing program for low income 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1445"> 1445 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians. The total cost of this social housing program in 
Canada is $2 billion per year. This is a net amount incorporating 
received rents as well as the cost.
<P>
	I looked at the statistics to find out the number of current 
housing starts. Because this question came from the Bloc I tried 
to zero in on why the Bloc would be particularly interested in 
this question.
<P>
	I found that in Ontario this year there are some 7,200 starts on 
the go and in Quebec there are some 900 starts on the go. I 
imagined, if I were in Quebec I would look at those figures and 
ask whether somehow that was fair. This probably was the 
reason the Bloc brought this issue to the House. I will not 
comment on whether or not those figures are fair. As a member 
from Alberta I looked down the ledger to see how many housing 
starts there are in Alberta this year. I came to the conclusion that 
there are zero housing starts in Alberta this year under this 
program.
<P>
	I will not go into great detail on whether the statistics tell me 
anything, but I asked myself whether this amount was sufficient 
for social housing in Canada. I am not sure I have the answer to 
that but I pose that as a question for us all.
<P>
	I reflect on a comment made to me not many days ago. I met a 
New Zealand diplomat and said to him: ``I am pretty close to 
Canada's debt situation. I am pretty close to the circumstances 
in our country. Could you make a comment for me, as someone 
from outside who should be unbiased about our situation in this 
country? Could you compare Canada to New Zealand for me?'' 
He did that. As he compared Canada's situation today with that 
of New Zealand not so very many years ago, he said he did not 
think he saw the political will in our country to deal with the 
debt situation we have. I do not think he said that there is the 
political will among the population of Canada to stop 
overspending.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	I looked him in the eye and asked-he had gone through this 
in his country-whether he could tell me what is necessary in 
Canada for us to realize the seriousness of our situation. He 
replied that he thought the International Monetary Fund would 
have to come in and shut us down.
<P>
	I thought about his comments very carefully as I sat on this 
side of the House, trying to say to the Canadian public that our 
debt situation is serious. I am trying to say not directly to the 
Bloc but to every member in this House that our debt situation is 
extremely serious.
<P>
	I wish somehow this message could get out before the IMF 
does have to shut us down because if it has to shut us down we 
will lose not just social housing, but we will lose every single 
social program that we value. If that happens this debate to me 
becomes somewhat inadequate.
<P>
	I tried to priorize what I think are the social programs that 
should be highest on the ladder and priorize them so the House 
could hear what I think is important. Number one is health care. 
Number two is welfare for those in need. Number three is the old 
age supplement for the needy. Number four is unemployment 
insurance for short term unexpected job loss. I would put as 
number five such things as social housing.
<P>
	If I put a different priority on those social programs than 
members opposite I am very willing to listen to their reasons 
where they would change the priorities. I would ask them to 
convince the members of the House that we could in fact change 
those priorities.
<P>
	If the programs are not distributed fairly I would say that the 
Bloc has every reason to complain on the basis of fair 
distribution of the funds. I would support them in doing that 
very thing.
<P>
	I would like to draw an analogy which members may think 
curious, but I have a hobby of racing cars. I have always wanted 
to go to the most famous endurance race in France, Les 24 
heures du Mans. This is 24 hours of racing on a circuit in France. 
I do not think I will ever have the opportunity to go there to 
participate in that race but I did have an opportunity three years 
ago to race in the 24 heures du Daytona. This is the North 
American equivalent. It is a second equivalent but it is the 
equivalent of that race.
<P>
	I found myself at Daytona in international circumstances in a 
race car that would go about 175 miles an hour. The banking at 
Daytona is so steep that if you get out of the car you can hardly 
walk. It is very steep. The car I was in was fast enough to go in 
the middle lane at Daytona and the really fast cars were on the 
top lane at Daytona. They would travel over 200 miles an hour.
<P>
	It was interesting as I sat in the car at the fastest I had ever 
gone with the landscape blurring around me. The cars going by 
in the top lane would go by so fast that they would move my car 
down a couple of feet on the banking. On one lap as I went 
around the corner I looked ahead and I could see a rain cloud. 
The track is big enough so that we were a long way from the rain 
cloud but I was sure that the rain was falling on the track.
<P>
	As I approached the rain I slowed down. A car went by me so 
much faster than I who had not seen the rain and he spun out on 
the track in front of me, smashed into the wall, tore off the front 
of the car and the motor came down. I slid through and luckily 
avoided him.
<P>
	The analogy I am trying to draw is that our country is at 300 
miles an hour on the banking heading for disaster in terms of our 
debt and our deficit.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	I heard the minister say that he is seized with the issue of 
social housing. I say to the minister and to the other members of 
this House. Do not be seized with a narrow issue that is only your 
own issue. The other issue for the country that is seizing us 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1446"> 1446 </A></B>
<P>
around the throat is the deficit  and the debt. I beg members to 
pay attention to that issue and not be narrow in their processes.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I come 
from Vancouver East which has some very poor areas. These 
people cannot afford a racing car. Neither can they afford a 
house or a place to live.
<P>
	I understand there are about 8,000 people that do not have 
proper shelter. Some of these people live in shelters that in fact 
are like pig sties. I would like to add that we have probably the 
largest aboriginal population in my area.
<P>
	We talked about dignity in our red book. There is no dignity 
without an address. It is true that we are in tough economic 
times. I understand that very well, but I feel that it is very 
important that we help those who need help.
<P>
	We have talked about creativity and some very good programs 
that have been put in. I am glad about that. I think that creativity 
is what we have to concentrate on. What is being done by CMHC 
for instance with the aboriginal groups is in fact trying to get 
private capital and working together with governments.
<P>
	We also talked about reallocation of resources. I think we 
have to concentrate on that. What the Liberal Party is trying to 
do now is go through a series of consultations, reviewing all of 
the social programs and I would invite everybody to participate. 
We are asking the people at large to participate, so 
parliamentarians in this House should be the first to participate. 
On that point, we can also establish where the priorities are.
<P>
	It is very important that we look at the whole scene. I have 
different statistics than what the hon. member has just given. I 
have them here with me. If he wants to see them I am prepared to 
share them with him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, there was not really a 
question in the comment, but I would like to say that the racing 
car that I mentioned was not my own. It was a rented car. Four of 
us shared it. I hope the member does not think I am talking from 
a different strata.
<P>
	I noticed that last year there were 427 housing starts in British 
Columbia. That compares very favourably with what that I see 
from Quebec. We might well compare statistics.
<P>
	I am not suggesting for one second that social housing is not 
important. I am suggesting that it be placed on a priority list and 
that is what I ask each member to do.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure 
if, according to parliamentary procedure, I can say that the hon. 
member is dead wrong. You see, the people who have poor 
lodgings cost a lot of money to our society. Their health is bound 
to deteriorate, their children do not do as well in school as they 
should be and, eventually, do not find the jobs they would 
otherwise have been able to get.
<P>
	A society that does not care for the people living in poor 
conditions and those in need gets into debt, because it does not 
tap the human capital and the talent of those people. In fact, if 
we were to follow the suggestion made by the hon. member, not 
only would we be putting the rope around our neck, but we 
would also be pulling on it.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> If my memory serves me right, there 
should not be any problem with the expression ``dead wrong''. 
The hon. member for Macleod has the floor.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand the hon. 
member's passion about this particular issue but I would simply 
ask him and everyone else in the House what they would give up 
so that they could have more social housing. In the light of our 
financial circumstances in our country what would they give up? 
If they would push this priority higher, what would they take 
away?
<P>
	I simply say come and explain to me what they would give up.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time has expired for questions and 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McTeague:</B> I have only a question for the hon. member, 
because like his colleague-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The time has expired for 
questions and comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the United 
Nations have declared 1994 the International Year of the Family. 
We must however admit that the families of Quebec and Canada 
are having a very hard time making ends meet.
<P>
	In such a meaningful year, should a responsible government 
not be preparing a policy on social housing to assist the most 
needy among us in their quest for a reasonable and affordable 
home?
<P>
	The needs in social housing are most strongly felt in urban 
areas. For example, in Limoilou and in the lower town, in my 
riding, there are at least 1,200 households on waiting lists for a 
place in low-cost housing projects and more than 600 
households are waiting for co-operative housing.
<P>
	Nearly half the persons living in downtown neighbourhoods, 
who represent 85 per cent of the total population, live below the 
poverty line. Given such a situation, we believe it is important 
that, through an urban planning policy, we preserve and 
revitalize the life of those neighbourhoods.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1447"> 1447 </A></B>
<P>
	But there is more. Studies show that in the riding of Québec 
alone, 38 per cent of all families in the lower town and Limoilou 
must devote more than 30 per cent of their gross income to 
housing. In the riding, 9,430 households out of a total of 
20,165-that is almost 47 per cent of all families-have a gross 
income of less than $29,999. Forty-seven per cent! Are there 
any members in this House who would not react to such 
statistics?
<P>
	The average income of men in the central neighbourhoods of 
the riding of Quebec was $14,078 in 1986 as compared to an 
average income of $19,440 for the province as a whole. Women 
are always poorer than men, but the gap was not so wide in their 
case. It is easy to understand why: their average income was 
$10,260 compared to $11,884 for the province. According to 
Statistics Canada, out of 21,450 economic families, 29.1 per 
cent were considered to be low-income.
<P>
	Still in my riding of Québec, there are 4,960 single-parent 
families, 86 per cent of which have a woman as head of the 
household, that is 4,260. For the province of Quebec, that figure 
is 81.86 per cent. The equation womanhood=poverty is still 
quite real.
<P>
	Considering that 52.7 per cent of dwellings in downtown 
Quebec were built before 1946 and that another 22.8 per cent 
were built between 1946 and 1960, it is easy understand the 
importance of a renovation assistance program.
<P>
	Furthermore, the 1986 data show a rental occupancy rate of 
79.5 per cent in the old neighbourhoods of the riding while the 
average for the province is 45.1 per cent. The situation of most 
of my constituents is very clear. They are too poor to buy a 
house, therefore they rent in buildings built before 1946 and 
they devote more than 30 per cent of their income to that item 
alone. In fact, in Quebec today, 404,045 households are obliged 
to spend more than 30 per cent of their income on housing. In 
November 1993, the Popular Action Front for Urban 
Redevelopment estimated that 195,000 Quebec households 
spent more than 50 per cent of their income on housing.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	That is what being poor means. In view of these alarming 
figures, the government should make a formal commitment to 
support social housing. Quebec City understands. As I 
mentioned before in the House, on January 10, 1994, the city 
adopted a resolution asking the federal government to review 
the budget for the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. 
The city demanded adequate funding for social housing, 
reinstatement of the co-operative housing program and a new 
program to provide assistance for renovation of rental housing.
<P>
	In this way, the municipal authorities want to ensure that 
families do not pay more than 25 per cent of their income for 
housing. How can we expect families that who have to spend 
more than 30 per cent of their meagre income on housing to 
make ends meet? How can they afford decent food, adequate 
clothing, medicine and a  few much-needed leisure activities? It 
would take more than a degree in economics or home economics 
to accomplish that.
<P>
	Although it may be a cliché, we will keep saying it until we 
get our message across: Let the government put its money where 
its mouth is. The Bloc Quebecois has a mandate to promote 
sovereignty. It also has a mandate to support government action 
that is necessary and socially responsible, while defending the 
interests of Quebec.
<P>
	It is a fact the federal government has imposed standards on 
Quebec that have prevented the latter from adopting a social 
policy that meets its real needs and aspirations. More and more, 
Quebec is losing its ability to control its social development. 
Quebecers are suffering as a result of poor federal management 
of the economy, and they are stuck between reductions in 
transfer payments and the obligation to abide by federal 
standards.
<P>
	There is, however, a commonality of purpose between the 
government and the Bloc Quebecois with respect to the 
challenges facing the government. In fact, we support 
stimulating employment through programs that create real, 
well-paying and long term jobs. We support tax reform to 
relieve the tax burden on families and others in our society.
<P>
	Finally, we support reducing the deficit by putting public 
financing on a sounder footing. However, public spending 
should not be cut at the expense of the neediest in our society. 
There are Quebecers and Canadians who have been left to fend 
for themselves and in recent years have seen these cuts affect the 
bare necessities of their lives.
<P>
	We believe that investing in social housing will be an 
investment in job creation. Every social housing unit built 
means 2.2 jobs. I say this because job creation seems to be this 
government's prime objective, and it was part of its platform in 
the last election campaign.
<P>
Perhaps we could backtrack very briefly. In its well known red 
book, the Liberal Party of Canada said, and I quote: ``In many 
areas and neighbourhoods in Canada, the quality of housing 
needs to be improved in order to achieve adequate standards of 
safety, health and energy efficiency. The recently cancelled 
Residential Rehabilitation Assistance Program, which provided 
a loan or grant for home renovation to people of modest 
incomes, should be revived as a method for investing in the 
physical and social fabric of our communities. A Liberal 
government will make $50 million a year available through the 
RRAP loan program for two years''.
<P>
	Further on, we read: ``We must choose to make our social 
investments where we believe they will do the most good and 
have the greatest effect for the resources spent and for the long 
term future. We will focus our efforts on health care, children's 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1448"> 1448 </A></B>
<P>
needs, safety in our communities and the quality and cultural 
identity of Canadians''.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	On January 18, 1994, the elected government announced with 
great pomp in the throne speech the reintroduction of the 
Residential Rehabilitation Assistance Program. It outlined its 
intention to take measures to combat violence against women 
and children. It also announced the establishment of a centre of 
excellence ``to ensure that women's health issues receive the 
attention they deserve''.
<P>
	On February 13, the Liberals celebrated their first 100 days in 
office. They even published a nice brochure outlining their 
accomplishments. By the way, it would be interesting to know if 
we could have built or rehabilitated one or more housing units 
with the money used to produce this brochure. This pamphlet 
called ``Creating Opportunity: The First 100 Days'' does not say 
anything about social housing.
<P>
	In its February 8, 1994 letter to the Prime Minister, the 
Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women pointed out 
that, in its February 1993 report, the Standing Committee on 
Justice and the Solicitor General said that crime was the 
outcome of the interaction of a constellation of factors. It is a 
social problem with many elements such as poverty, physical 
and sexual abuse, low self-esteem, inadequate housing, school 
failure and unemployment.
<P>
	The council recommended that the Prime Minister take into 
account the committee's conclusions in a multi-faceted 
approach aimed at guaranteeing safe homes and communities.
<P>
	Women's health and safety is largely dependent on access to 
adequate and affordable housing where they can care for their 
children and protect themselves, if necessary, from a violent 
spouse or ex-spouse. It is the same for older women, for 
handicapped women and for so many women who are still 
waiting.
<P>
	Ottawa's gradual pull-out has demonstrated the limits of the 
administrative agreements between Quebec and the federal 
government in cases of unilateral withdrawal. Quebec has been 
caught short by the extent of Ottawa's financial pull-out from 
housing, after following the strong and highly centralized 
leadership of its main financial backer under this agreement.
<P>
	The federal budget allocation criteria for programs that have 
since disappeared have always put Quebec at a disadvantage, 
particularly because of the rigidity of the so-called national 
standards. This situation must cease, and the concept of equity 
must be reintroduced in the management and allocation of funds 
earmarked for these programs.
<P>
	Contrary to the terms of the framework agreement with 
Quebec and as a result of its unilateral pull-out from social and 
co-op housing programs, the federal government is 
destabilizing Quebec's housing programs and affecting the 
planning of such housing by municipal authorities. It is one of 
the major shortcomings of the administrative agreements.
<P>
	Let us take Quebec's current situation as an example. Just two 
weeks ago, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation 
announced that it was granting seven subsidies of $20,000 or 
less for projects aimed at improving the affordability and 
selection of housing. Of the seven groups who received 
subsidies, five Ontario municipalities shared a total of $51,000; 
one Alberta municipality received $18,750; and one 
Saskatchewan municipality got $10,000. There was nothing for 
Quebec. Such figures make comments unnecessary.
<P>
	Of course, when we talk about subsidies, the economic 
situation comes up again.
<P>
	Let me remind the government that Canada's military 
spending is six times what we used to spend on social housing.
<P>
	In conclusion, I hope that, in this International Year of the 
Family, the living and housing conditions of Canadian and 
Quebec families will improve thanks to concerted, adequate and 
equitable government action.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is calling for the immediate 
reintroduction of the co-op housing program, for the creation of 
a rental housing rehabilitation assistance program, for 
assurances that the poor will not have to spend more than 25 per 
cent of their income on housing, and for wider access to home 
ownership through the co-op movement.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	We are asking the Canadian government to embrace the social 
philosophy of other countries such as Great Britain and the 
Netherlands, where social housing accounts for 70 per cent of all 
rental housing, and Sweden, where this proportion is 55 per 
cent. In Canada, in 1991, social housing amounted to 10 per cent 
of all rental housing.
<P>
	It is a question of social justice and not a question of passion 
as Reform members seem to think.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member for her in depth 
remarks on social housing in the province of Quebec and in 
particular on her in depth knowledge of the red book and the 
investigations and recommendations the Liberal Party went to in 
bringing forward its recommendations for social housing across 
Canada.
<P>
	We have that mandate. If the hon. member would look at the 
record it was the Liberal Party that brought in RRAP back in the 
1970s. It will be the Liberal Party that will institute RRAP 
again.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1449"> 1449 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member refers to the special CMHC housing 
projects. The money granted a few weeks ago was for special 
projects that were based on submissions. Perhaps the hon. 
member could inquire if the province of Quebec made any 
submissions for modern day housing, for further insulation, for 
new arrangements and architectural designs that were 
conducive to more efficient housing as we move into the 21st 
century.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon (Québec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for her comments. I will try to find out whether there 
were any submissions from Quebec. What I know is that I 
received at my office a letter from the CMHC saying there were 
no housing starts in Quebec under the program mentioned. I will 
find out more about that.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
not sure what history the hon. member opposite studied when 
she makes her remarks, but I know I am not unfamiliar with the 
history of the province of Quebec.
<P>
	Like all provinces Quebec has benefited enormously from 
being a partner in Confederation. Quebec has certainly 
benefited financially.
<P>
	Is the hon. member not aware that when one considers 
equalization payments, the province of Quebec has seen more 
tax dollars flow to it than have flown out of that province? Is she 
completely unaware of the enormous financial benefit that has 
accrued to the province of Quebec from the other provinces of 
Confederation?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon (Québec):</B> Mr. Speaker, let us say that we do 
not have the same figures. The figures I have on social housing 
show that, since 1986, the difference in grants for social 
housing, between Quebec and other provinces, varies between 
10 and 13 per cent.
<P>
	This is not the only area in which Quebec does not get its fair 
share. There are others. I do not think we have the same book.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, if I might pursue this, I think 
perhaps we are starting to get somewhere. We are hearing a Bloc 
member who is willing to admit, if I heard the hon. member 
correctly, that perhaps she was not looking at the whole picture. 
I would submit it is time that the hon. member did that. It is time 
all members of the Bloc did that. It is time they understood what 
other Canadians understand.
<P>
	Most of us are very pleased to have the province of Quebec as 
part of Canada. Quite frankly we feel that Quebecers will always 
choose to remain a part of Confederation. The statistics are 
unchallengeable. Quebec has benefited far more from taxes 
going to it as a province in this Confederation than it has paid 
out when one considers all fiscal arrangements in its totality. If 
the  hon. member is unaware of that I would be happy to share 
those statistics with her.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon (Québec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe the debate 
today is on social housing. It would take more than two minutes 
to list for the hon. member all the areas were Quebec was 
short-changed. I do not say he is right. I urge all my colleagues 
from the Bloc to give the hon. member the right answers. 
Whether it be research and development or agriculture, we know 
very well that Quebec is not always well served by the federal 
system.
<P>
	Take my riding for instance. I had two giant candidates 
running against me on October 25, but despite all the good 
things they promised would come from the federal system, the 
people of the Quebec riding said: ``No, we do not want to relive 
what we went through all those years''. This is a debate we may 
have some day in the House, but not now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
talking about social housing, we are talking about people in 
need, and it should be clearly understood, contrary to what was 
just said, that Quebec receives as much money as it is putting in, 
around $28 billion. Quebec taxpayers pay $28 billion to Ottawa 
and receive in return $28 billion from Ottawa. It is their money. 
But the way it comes back to them has a direct impact on social 
housing. This money comes back mainly as unemployment 
insurance and transfer payments for public assistance, instead of 
coming back as research and development contracts or other 
types of government contracts which would create jobs, as is the 
case in Ontario and other provinces.
<P>
	We can see, first of all, that there is absolutely no preferential 
treatment for Quebec. It only receives what it puts in. But 
Quebec is treated less fairly because the quality of the money it 
gets back is inferior compared to other provinces, and that has a 
direct impact on social housing.
<P>
	Would my colleague, the member for Québec, care to 
comment?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon (Québec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with these 
comments. Indeed, the facts we are presenting are very 
important. The money the federal government returns to Quebec 
takes the form of unemployment insurance and social housing 
funding, and we do not get our fair share. Therefore, I believe 
that we should ask for a debate, in this House, to see item by 
item, issue by issue, how Quebec feels in this so-called fair 
system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member had the courage, and we must be 
grateful to him for it, of turning the debate to broader 
considerations. I think that we could agree with him, if he wants 
to engage in that exercise-I am inclined to think that he is an 
avid reader-I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1450"> 1450 </A></B>
<P>
might suggest that he refer to two documents which mobilized 
all of Quebec.  These documents were tabled at the 
Bélanger-Campeau commission, of which he is aware. These 
documents give a very accurate picture of the investments made 
not since Confederation, because the comparison would not be 
exact, but in the last 20 years.
<P>
	We referred to experts, not nationalist experts, we studied, we 
surveyed the kinds of investment made by the federal 
government, and I believe that our colleague would find out that 
in many fields, Quebec received less. Where it received more, 
and there are all sorts of variables; we talked about 
demographics, we talked about its strength as a region within 
Canada, and I am sure that if our colleague went through these 
documents, he would recognize their intellectual merit.
<P>
	The conclusion of Bélanger-Campeau may surprise him, but 
it disappointed us. Where Quebec received the most is in 
unemployment insurance. That certainly explains why the 
Conseil du patronat du Québec does not want Quebec to take 
over unemployment insurance. Our colleague will agree that 
unemployment insurance is not what one can call an 
economically productive investment.
<P>
	So if he wants to get into this, I am prepared to cooperate so 
that together we can look at these figures following the work of 
Bélanger-Campeau.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I do believe that the member for 
Québec has no comment to add to what was just said.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon (Québec):</B> Indeed, I have no comment. I just 
would like to say that I agree with my colleague from the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	We should go back and reread certain works which have 
already been published and analysed to see how Quebec often 
finds itself the poor relation in several federal policy areas.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
given that we are just now coming out of the recession, social 
housing has become an important consideration and an ongoing 
concern for the Liberal Party. While housing provides jobs, our 
aims are not economic ones. Rather, they have more to do with 
social awareness.
<P>
	As a physician, I see social housing as much more than 
construction materials and labour. To a large extent, it helps to 
improve the quality of life of the least fortunate members of our 
society, and this is what is important.
<P>
	The federal government's long-standing commitment with its 
provincial and territorial partners to help Canadians in need to 
find decent housing has helped Canada earn a reputation for 
itself as a nation with one of the highest standards of housing in 
the world.
<P>
	The federal government ensures that all Canadians, 
regardless of who they are or where they live, have equal access 
to federal housing resources.
<P>
	Social housing in Canada addresses the needs of specific 
groups, namely senior citizens, single-parent households, 
disabled persons, native communities and low-income earners. 
In short, social housing is inextricably linked to the physical 
structure and social fabric of our communities.
<P>
	The federal government has made a long-standing 
commitment to social housing in this country. It currently 
subsidizes approximately 652,000 units on an ongoing basis. 
More than half of these units also benefit from provincial or 
territorial subsidies.
<P>
	I want to stress again today that the federal government is not 
shirking its responsibility in the field of social housing, as some 
circles would have us believe. We will continue to respect our 
present commitments to social housing.
<P>
	Annual expenditures of roughly $2 billion reflect the federal 
government's fierce determination to help Canadians in need.
<P>
	Moreover, regardless of how much money is allocated to 
social housing in various regions of the country, the quality of 
existing housing must also be improved. No one should have to 
live in substandard housing. No one should have to live in 
housing that fails to provide the basic necessities.
<P>
	Providing decent housing for all Canadians is important to the 
government. That is why the government recently announced in 
the throne speech it was reintroducing the Residential 
Rehabilitation Assistance Program for both owner-occupants 
and disabled persons as well as the Emergency Repair Program 
in rural and isolated areas.
<P>
	This means that the federal government will be spending $50 
million a year for the next two years, that is to say a total amount 
of $100 million, to help low-income households bring their 
dwellings up to safety and sanitation standards.
<P>
	The RRAP is expected to create thousands of direct and 
indirect jobs. Of course, the re-establishment of this program 
will have significant economic spin-offs on the Canadian 
economy, the construction industry, real estate, the 
manufacturing industry and related services.
<P>
	The provinces and territories have been asked to share the 
costs of this established program. The province of Quebec for 
instance recently announced the REPARACTION program, a 
home renovation program for low-income owner-occupants. In 
the light of the reintroduction of the federal RRAP and the new 
provincial home renovation program, the federal government 
will be working in a partnership with the Province of Quebec to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1451"> 1451 </A></B>
<P>
make arrangements regarding how costs should be shared and 
particularly to try and eliminate to some extent duplication of 
services.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	The federal government is doing its best to provide acceptable 
levels of service to Canadians and to do so in the most 
responsible manner, given the present budget restraints.
<P>
	In the same spirit, the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation is offering a direct loan program for all public 
housing to maximize the use of existing resources and cut 
spending.
<P>
	With this program, the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation expects to save approximately $120 million over 
the next four years. Through these measures of effectiveness 
combined with new initiatives like direct funding, the federal 
government will be able to maintain the current housing stock 
and, more importantly, have a certain leeway to implement new 
initiatives in the area of social housing.
<P>
	All levels of government have now recognized the need for 
innovative solutions to promote the production of affordable 
social housing. It will be imperative that the federal government 
work in conjunction with the provinces if we want a global and 
concerted approach to be adopted.
<P>
	Also, the federal government has reiterated that program 
changes and the gains made in terms of efficiency within the 
social housing envelope will serve to create new housing 
initiatives.
<P>
	At a recent meeting of housing ministers, it was agreed to 
pursue joint rather than unilateral efforts in that area.
<P>
	Finally, Mr. Speaker, the ultimate goal of this government is, 
as stated in our red book, to put human dignity back into public 
housing policy.
<P>
	Before closing, I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
publicly the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation for 
its involvement in the funding of homes for battered women. 
Without its support, there could be no such home in 
Pierrefonds-Dollard.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to make sure I understand the hon. member. I 
sensed some enthusiasm, which I do not quite share but which I 
can understand, considering that he is a government member. 
Are we talking about the same thing since, so far as we know on 
this side of the House, the Residential Rehabilitation Assistance 
Program or RRAP, is exclusively for the benefit of 
owner-occupants?
<P>
	Something is provided for aboriginal people but, for the years 
to come, the program's funding is exclusively for 
owner-occupants. In that sense, to refer to it as an income 
maintenance program for the have-nots of our society implies a 
form of generosity which was not intended by the cabinet.
<P>
	If I misunderstood the scope of the program, I will be very 
happy to find out that it will indeed be made available to a larger 
number of people. However, the press release clearly stated that 
the program was exclusively designed for owner-occupants.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patry:</B> I thank the hon. member for his comment. As I 
understand it, the RRAP is designed for owner-occupants. But, 
as we just saw, that government program could be expanded to 
other groups.
<P>
	This program is targeted to owner-occupants, but will it 
become a form of family support? It could be the case, because if 
we help those who have difficulty making ends meet buy 
materials to make their house more comfortable and safer, it 
becomes a form of direct support. However, the goal is really to 
make social housing more accessible to a large number of 
people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> A social housing unit?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patry:</B> It is still a social housing unit occupied by an 
owner-occupant.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	I come from a much more prosperous area than you. Your 
riding of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve is a riding-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Please address your comments to the 
Chair, so as to avoid debates and arguments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patry:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am talking to you, but I 
am looking at the hon. member.
<P>
	In conclusion, this is a program designed for 
owner-occupants, but poor owner-occupants in particular. I 
think this is how we should put it.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Mr. Speaker, I really 
appreciated the speech by the hon. member for 
Pierrefonds-Dollard. I agree with my colleague from the Bloc 
Quebecois, the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, that the 
RRAP program is for homeowners. If you want to buy a home, 
you cannot be poor, you have to have some money. The problem 
today in our major urban centers is that some people cannot get 
clean, decent accommodation. The problem is very serious. 
These people will take whatever they can find. Often, they are 
on welfare and will have to pay steep rent for unhealthy, dirty 
lodgings. We must realize that the RRAP program is not for 
those people.
<P>
	I have been fighting for social housing from the very 
beginning, because these people need help, not the homeowners. 
We can give part of the money to homeowners, but there are still 
a lot of people that we are not helping at all. Often, these people 
are not able to defend themselves, because they are uneducated, 
illiterate and unable to face reality and speak for themselves.
<P>
	These are the people I fight for, these are the people we have 
to help. We cannot do it with such programs as RRAP.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1452"> 1452 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patry:</B> Your comment is 99 per cent accurate since the 
RRAP program is of course for homeowners, but that does not 
mean we cannot care about them. There are a lot of 
homeowners, and I know they are some in the Montreal area 
and in the province of Quebec, who are overtaxed like the rest 
of us and have trouble making ends meet. I understand very 
well the concerns the hon. member has about new programs, 
because we must think about new programs.
<P>
	I decided to go into politics mostly because of social 
considerations and I can assure the hon. member that I will 
support any new social program. All I can say for now is that the 
government has estimated, through the Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation, that it will be able to save about $120 
million which should go, I am told, to new programs. To some 
extent, new programs similar to those we have for homeowners 
will have to be set up for new housing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate the member on his 
comments. I would also like to point out a couple of things 
before coming to a question.
<P>
	I would like to apprise members of a report that was done by 
the committee on aboriginal affairs on aboriginal and northern 
housing. Members might want to read and reflect upon the poor 
state of housing for aboriginal people across the country.
<P>
	As much as my colleagues from the Reform would probably 
like us to go back into tepees and igloos because of the poor state 
of housing, I want to comment that home repairs for rural and 
low income areas are welcome. However this does not 
adequately address the northern and aboriginal communities.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	Some of those houses that are built in the aboriginal and 
northern communities almost do not meet the basic standards. It 
is not necessarily the best idea to repair the homes. It is better to 
replace them.
<P>
	When the government fell on October 25 and social housing 
was cut, Northwest Territories was getting something in the 
neighbourhood of $47 million for social housing. That cut had a 
devastating effect on aboriginal and northern housing because 
although $47 million may not seem all that much, when the total 
population is 55,000 in Northwest Territories and we are already 
short by 3,800 units, $47 million means an awful lot.
<P>
	I know the hon. member supports the resumption of the 
funding for social housing but more from my point of view we 
need the $47 million for the Northwest Territories social 
housing program. As I said, if we do not get the housing our 
alternative is to build igloos in the winter and tents in the 
summer. I do not think that is acceptable today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for 
his question. I will simply tell him that I agree with him and that 
this government is very much aware of the huge housing needs 
of native people, on and off the reserves.
<P>
	In 1993-94, the federal government will spend some $5.4 
billion on native-oriented programs and we will try to do as 
much as possible because this is very important.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank you for leading us during this debate. You have 
been patient. I am sorry I broke the rules so often, and I promise 
I will be more disciplined next time I take part in a debate.
<P>
	I feel the need to recall, for the benefit of listeners who are 
joining us just now, that on this allotted day the official 
Opposition insisted on moving:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government's inability to re-establish and 
increase budgets for social housing construction programs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I thank our critic, the hon. member for Laurentides. You will 
understand that each and every word in this motion is 
meaningful. We decided to address the issue of social housing 
because we feel there is a subtle but nevertheless unquestionable 
correlation between social housing and poverty.
<P>
	The definition of poverty rests in part on statistics. In our 
society people are poor if they have to devote more than 56.2 per 
cent of their income to their essential needs such as clothing, 
housing and food.
<P>
	We are having this debate at a time when large parts of 
Canadian as well as Quebec society have never been so poor.
<P>
	For our part, we are firmly convinced, and this will be a focus 
of commitment for the Official Opposition, that there are ways 
to put an end to that poverty. I must add that the speakers on the 
government side have addressed social housing somewhat in 
isolation, as if this were not related to the issue of poverty. 
Poverty puts on a new face. Being poor in 1994 is not the same as 
being poor in the 1980s. Deep changes have occurred since then. 
In 1994, we do not speak of poverty like the Senate did in the 
1970s when it was mandated to study poverty in Canada. 
Poverty strikes the young and people of my age, in their early 
thirties.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> And not only people of my age, but also women 
and heads of single-parent families. Fortunately, there are less 
and less senior citizens living in poverty.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1453"> 1453 </A></B>
<P>
	Concerning social housing, it seems appropriate to remind 
the House of three facts that were a real trauma for 
parliamentarians. They were largely brought to light by a group 
to which I would like to pay tribute. It is a pressure group called 
FRAPRU that is very well known in Montreal and the 
metropolitan area. It put in a lot of work over the last few years 
to try and convince us that we should make a firm commitment 
to social housing.
<P>
	FRAPRU, which has its head office in the riding of 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie, committed itself in a document in 
which it gives a very detailed profile of social housing in 
Quebec and Canada. FRAPRU, which deserves the admiration 
and support of parliamentarians, reminds us that there are three 
types of data in this document. One of them points very strongly 
to the fact that, in Quebec, never before have so many families 
had to spend so much on social housing-an alarming situation. 
About 40 per cent of families in Quebec are in this situation. 
Never have so many people in Canada, not only in Quebec, had 
to spend so much of their income in order to have a decent home. 
We are talking of about 1.2 million people.
<P>
	It is with these data in mind that we thought it necessary, as 
the Official Opposition, to urge the government to make 
substantial efforts to invest in social housing. Indeed, we are 
worried. I admit that worry is part and parcel of politics, but we 
are nevertheless seriously concerned about the intentions of this 
government. And we are not the only ones, for that matter. May I 
remind you that FRAPRU and other organizations interested in 
housing met the minister last December and that on the basis of 
that meeting, they concluded that the minister had not 
committed himself seriously and strongly enough, to say the 
least, to championing this cause in Cabinet. What we have in 
terms of social housing is far from satisfactory and encouraging.
<P>
	We have little available in terms of social housing. Since in 
politics the ability to remember is a very precious asset, we 
should recall that the member from Papineau-Saint-Michel, 
the present Deputy Prime Minister and other big names of the 
former Official Opposition had passionately called for the 
re-establishment, among other things-and I am giving here a 
very concrete example-of the national co-operative housing 
program that cost only $6 million to the government. It is very 
little compared to overall government spending.
<P>
	Some members in the Official Opposition thundered and 
talked with deep conviction about social housing, but indeed, 
they have quieted down since. I suppose that the fact that they 
have changed sides in the House explains their silence. The only 
thing that we are left with in terms of social housing is a program 
which is, to use parliamentary language, modest but you will 
understand that this is not really the word I would rather use. 
This program which addresses a very small proportion of the 
housing problem deals with renovation but not any kind  of 
renovation since it is open only to homeowners. As if the poor, 
as if people in our community who really need the government's 
assistance were homeowners!
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	I believe that the government must maintain the program 
referred to since the beginning of this debate, but that this is 
largely insufficient. We are entitled, a few days away from the 
tabling of the budget-I hope we will not be disappointed-to 
expect that the government is going to re-establish the budgets 
approved in the past in the three sectors where one could, as a 
less fortunate member of society, expect to get some help in the 
social housing area.
<P>
	What are the three programs which the federal and provincial 
governments jointly administered in the past? First, the 
National Co-operative Housing Program, which was very 
inexpensive for the government and had tremendous 
advantages. I will have an opportunity to come back to that. 
Second, the Income Supplement Program, which was a way to 
intervene on the rental market and to help people. The resources 
there were meagre, but they proved effective. Third, a more 
complex and more expensive low-cost housing program. 
Housing authorities in each municipality operate according to 
very specific rules. When one talks about low-cost housing, we 
all know here-because our television viewers know it-that 
this formula allows them to spend 25 p. 100 of their income in 
order to get a decent housing unit in which to live and to belong 
to a community from whom they are entitled to expect some 
help. And, as a general rule, support is available.
<P>
	At the same time as the low-cost housing program, the federal 
government, with the provinces, had been assisting non-profit 
organizations that were dealing with a very specific clientele, 
mostly handicapped people, people losing their autonomy, 
ex-prisoners or people with AIDS. In the past, there was a 
program that allowed to help a very specific clientele.
<P>
	So, at this time, even if we are being enthusiastic-I am not a 
pessimist by nature-we do not have much indication about the 
will of the government to act and to play a major role in these 
areas, still in co-operation with the provinces. You know that, 
on this side of the House, we will not forget that.
<P>
	Why did we feel, as the Official Opposition, that we needed to 
be insistent? This has to do not only with the poverty issue. 
Indeed, we are concerned with it because we know that more and 
more people are getting poorer, but also because we 
believe-and that is the fundamental difference between us and 
our friends from the Reform Party. There are other differences, 
and I will not mention them, but this is certainly one of them. We 
are convinced that when you act in the social housing area, when 
there are public funds, when you make a budget, when you 
provide money to act in that area, you are being useful and you 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1454"> 1454 </A></B>
<P>
contribute to the revitalization of  the economy, because there is 
a return on your investment.
<P>
	I could give you some compelling examples that would 
convince you. They do not come from me or from some partisan 
groups around the Bloc Quebecois, but from people with 
expertise who know about the reality in the social housing area.
<P>
	I will mention, first, the Co-operative Housing Federation of 
Canada which conducted studies the findings of which I could 
hand out to the parliamentarians who are not yet convinced of 
the merits of government investments in social housing. I know 
I am not allowed to read in this House and I acknowledge having 
circumvented the rules on a number of occasions today, but I just 
want to bring to your attention four lines which clearly reflect 
the spin-offs of government investments in social housing.
<P>
	Building 1,000 co-operative housing units, in terms of 
construction or renovation, would create lots of jobs, especially 
in the construction and manufacturing sectors. In the 
construction sector, over 2,000 jobs would be generated this 
way. Renovation projects generate less jobs, in fact about 800 
jobs for every 1,000 housing units.
<P>
	Therefore, I think it is fair to say that there are very few 
sectors in our society where you can claim that a government 
action would create and generate such great economic spin-offs 
as those identified by the Federation.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	In spite of it all, in spite of the fact that we are aware of those 
figures, in spite of the fact that, since last December, the 
FRAPRU and other pressure groups have continuously been 
making representations to the government, in spite of the fact 
that less than three months after this government came into 
office, stakeholders in social housing were already active, in 
spite of the fact that we made representations, we can see that 
the government, on the social housing issue, is timid, spineless 
and certainly not too daring.
<P>
	It is sad. It is sad, because such an attitude fosters prejudices. 
And as you know, there is a lot of prejudice in our society. Such 
an attitude fosters preconceived ideas to the effect that the best 
government is one which governs little, while we know 
perfectly well that if the government was able to take its 
responsibilities and to allocate money, not necessarily a lot of 
it-some years, 35,000 co-op housing units were built in 
Canada-if only we could have maintained that rate, I think we 
could have built up a strong housing inventory. We could have 
succeeded in revitalizing perhaps not all but some urban areas 
which are deteriorating.
<P>
	It is for that reason that we, in the Bloc Quebecois, are making 
an urgent appeal to the minister. We do not have many 
government members with us today; nonetheless, we are making 
an urgent appeal, and we will not back down; we will keep at it 
and work on all fronts so that this government understands how 
necessary it is to invest in social housing, not in the timid 
renovation  program it is offering. It is an interesting beginning, 
a trial run, but we would be extremely disappointed, together 
with Quebecers and Canadians, if the government was to limit 
its action in the field of social housing to such a timid program.
<P>
	There was talk about the economic spin-offs of social housing 
investments, but I would like to explain, from a social and 
human perspective, why we have to invest in social housing. I 
will start with a reality known to every member, I think, and that 
is the low-cost housing situation. If there is no change in the 
status quo in 1994-95-96, not one low-cost housing unit will be 
built.
<P>
	This afternoon, we witnessed conflicting styles and genres. I 
heard the minister say, and he was quoted several times later, 
that the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation was going 
to invest $35 million; every time a government member uttered 
that number, there was a sense of ecstasy. We must tell people 
who are listening that this $35 million will not be used to build 
new units, if I am wrong I will take it back, but we checked and it 
appears that it will be used to pay the interests on the money 
borrowed to build the existing housing inventory. The basic 
truth that should not be forgotten is that not a single low-cost 
housing unit will be built if the Minister of Finance does not 
change the status quo.
<P>
	Why is it that the low-cost housing units are so important? We 
could very well, you and I, end up in low-cost housing when we 
get to be 60 or 65. Why are they important? Because it is a form 
community life. The people who live in such dwellings are not 
necessarily incapacitated. In any event there is no cafeteria in 
low-cost housing buildings. They are really only apartment 
buildings, but there are community rooms where residents get 
together to play cards or whatever. Any member of Parliament 
who is close to his constituents knows that there is a real 
community life in this type of housing. The lack of low-cost 
housing is sorely felt and we hope the government will be able to 
put the situation to right.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	As far as co-operatives are concerned we know their 
economic significance but we also know that those who are part 
of a co-operative are people who invest in society. Each of them 
has tasks to perform: paint the fence, take the garbage out, take 
charge of public relations with the neighbouring community. 
Those people give and receive and this is why that formula has 
become so popular.
<P>
	In conclusion, we sincerely believe that if the present 
government, which in the past has associated liberalism with 
generosity, is serious and has a social conscience, I believe that 
the Minister of Public Works-we do not even call him Minister 
of Housing since housing is so low on the list of 
priorities-should march to the beat of a different drummer. He 
should be the social conscience of that government. He should 
not be afraid to stand 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1455"> 1455 </A></B>
<P>
apart from his cabinet colleagues because that is what is 
expected of him.
<P>
	Too often we are told that the Minister of Finance will decide. 
I say no. We must be able to count on the Minister of Public 
Works to act as an aggressive and uncompromising champion of 
social housing. Only when the minister, acting as the voice of 
the less privileged in terms of social housing, puts his foot down 
will the Minister of Finance act accordingly in his budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to commend the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve for 
his excellent and brilliant presentation.
<P>
	Given the federal deficit which has now accumulated and 
exceeds $500 billion, do you agree that this House should 
substantially increase the funding of the Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation or other related agencies in order to 
provide more low-income housing?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, as René Lévesque said, facts are 
always more stubborn than the interpretation one gives them. I 
believe so, since the question was put that way; I think it would 
be good for the government to put more money into low-income 
housing. Other possibilities exist, which I did not have time to 
mention because I ran out of time.
<P>
	In Montreal, there are four purchasing corporations. What are 
purchasing corporations? Perhaps the minister should come to 
Montreal and see. These purchasing corporations bring people 
together in a non-profit organization. They have some 
money-of course, they have help. They have been helped by 
the McGill Fund or by the people who probably haunted your 
childhood, the good Sisters of the Holy Cross. With this initial 
funding, they can take housing out of the speculative market, 
renovate it and then make it available to the community.
<P>
	I believe that this is a promising approach for the future. I 
understand that the hon. member also wants to be this 
government's social conscience. Since he is a Montrealer, which 
pleases me, I think that we should convince the minister to come 
to Montreal and try out this approach and use it as a way for 
society to act in the market.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to make a brief comment and perhaps ask the member a 
question.
<P>
	First I want to make it absolutely clear that the New 
Democratic Party supports the notion that more rather than less 
needs to be spent on social housing, not just in Quebec but 
across the country. It is something we have always supported. In 
the past we have pressed previous governments to make a 
greater commitment to social housing and were disturbed by the 
cuts in social housing made by the previous Conservative 
government.
<P>
	I listened earlier to a Reform member of Parliament who 
asked a question of the Bloc Quebecois member about what they 
would be prepared to give up and what would they be prepared to 
not spend money on in return for spending more money on social 
housing.
<P>
	I do not want to presume to answer the question for the hon. 
member, however it seems to me that if we were looking for 
more money for social housing and for other social priorities 
one thing we could look at is the tax system.
<P>
	I am reading an extensive article by Neil Brooks called ``The 
Changing Structure of the Canadian Tax System, 
Accommodating the Rich''. It is a very lengthy article in the 
Osgoode Hall Law Journal in the spring of 1992 and outlines the 
way in which the tax system has been changed over the last 10 
years to accommodate the rich.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	One of the ways we could find that kind of money for social 
housing and for other things is to look at changing the tax 
system. One of the things that has been floated around in the last 
little while is trying to bring down the amount of money that 
people are able to put away to avoid taxation on through the use 
of RRSPs. I wonder what the position of the Bloc is on that.
<P>
	It would seem to me that people who have $13,000 left over to 
put into RRSPs and therefore avoid paying taxes on it are not the 
people who need social housing. Obviously a big gap exists 
between the people who benefit from this particular tax policy 
and the people who are in need of social housing.
<P>
	It certainly would seem to me that some amelioration or a 
reduction of the amount that people are able to hide in this way 
might help to provide money on the other side for social 
purposes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> If the hon. member wishes to answer, 
he still has about four or five minutes left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, you are very generous.
<P>
	In his question, the hon. member suggested an answer with 
which I wholeheartedly agree. I think our leader and my 
colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois made it very clear, from the 
very beginning, that social justice, which is a main goal of ours, 
flows from tax reform, but not just any tax reform, and not 
necessarily one which will affect ordinary Canadians and 
low-income taxpayers. On a corporate level, we know about the 
tax avoidance devices available in Canada and also all the 
measures used by richer taxpayers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1456"> 1456 </A></B>
<P>
	I agree with the hon. member, but I cannot tell him that this 
is the position of my party, since it is the responsibility of our 
finance critic, the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, 
to do so. However, from what I understand, the hon. member 
is absolutely right in saying that RRSPs should be taxed 
according on a progressive scale. We are not talking here about 
a freelancer who puts $1,000 in a RRSP, but rather about rich 
people who use this tax instrument. I would have absolutely no 
hesitation in saying that progressive taxation should apply to 
these rich people.
<P>
	Thus, I do agree with most of what my colleague had to say, 
Mr. Speaker.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
</B><B>Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a working as well as a personal 
interest in the area of housing.
<P>
	For several years I was chairperson of the Metro Toronto 
Housing Authority, MTHA as it is commonly known, the largest 
public housing agency in Canada. We house approximately 
125,000 individuals in rent geared to income facilities. The 
majority of the MTHA stock was built in the 1950s and 1960s 
and was characterized by large scale projects targeted to low 
income households.
<P>
	Through my work in housing and my contact with my 
constituents, I am aware there is a pressing need for affordable 
housing especially in the metropolitan Toronto area and in other 
urban areas. I am also aware of the aboriginal people and the 
pressing and critical need there is for housing in their areas.
<P>
	In the early 1970s the Liberal government introduced 
community based non-profit and co-operative housing 
programs to better integrate socially assisted housing in all 
communities. To this end we took a different route from that 
taken by the United States. These new social housing programs 
were developed in partnership, with municipal, private, 
co-operative and non-profit housing corporations and were 
based on the tenets of self-help and volunteerism.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	I believe this progressive housing initiative by the Liberal 
government of the time greatly contributed to Canada's 
reputation as a country of relatively safe communities. Unlike 
the United States, Canada does not have abandoned inner city 
areas or communities teaming with homeless people. I fear, 
however, that this may change if the short sighted policies of the 
previous government are not reviewed.
<P>
	Poverty in Canada's inner cities is on the rise and hundreds of 
thousands of people are living below the poverty line. The 
greatest proportion of their income goes toward rent, making 
them dependent on food banks and other forms of assistance. 
Since social housing makes up less than 6 per cent of Canada's 
total housing stock, these low income households have no other 
choice but to rent private market housing.
<P>
	The Conservative government had no interest in investing in 
social housing. During its time in office it chipped away at all 
social housing programs. Housing budgets and programs 
underwent drastic cuts and culminated in the cancellation of a 
good many programs.
<P>
	The Conservative government did this despite the knowledge 
that one in eight households, ranging from the working poor to 
those with special needs, cannot afford its housing or is in an 
inadequate or substandard dwelling. The cancellation of social 
housing programs made the chances for these households 
getting housing assistance equivalent to winning a lottery.
<P>
	We have a different scene now. In our red book we said that 
the Liberal government wanted to support local communities as 
the source of social stability and economic strength. Canada's 
social housing programs go a long way in meeting these goals. 
We realize on this side of the House, as does everyone in the 
House, that adequate shelter is a fundamental need of society 
and a prerequisite for community prosperity.
<P>
	Our government is committed to rebuilding community 
well-being and restoring individual dignity. We will do this by 
helping to house Canadians in affordable, suitable and adequate 
shelter. Our commitment in maintaining a strong role in housing 
is clear and we have made this clear. We have expressed this in 
several avenues. We will continue to fund and support the 
652,000 households at approximately $2 billion per year.
<P>
	The need for adequate housing for all Canadians is a very 
serious issue. The federal government recently in the throne 
speech reaffirmed the Residential Rehabilitation Assistance 
Program. A total of $100 million over the next two years will be 
available to help low income households bring their homes up to 
health and safety standards.
<P>
	I know of this concern and this need for government to 
achieve efficiency and savings in delivering an acceptable level 
of service to Canadians. We want to do this in the most cost 
effect manner.
<P>
	I was made to understand that CMHC has already begun to 
discuss direct lending to finance and refinance social housing 
projects as one way of making better use of resources and 
reducing expenditures. We expect to save some $120 million in 
subsidy costs over the next four years, providing scope for new 
housing initiatives.
<P>
	We need to develop additional ideas, invigorating, inspiring 
and creative ideas. Those ideas can come from all sides of the 
House.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	The need to combine cost effectiveness as has been mentioned 
over and over goes along with creativity in our funding 
approaches. We must combine creativity and funding 
approaches 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1457"> 1457 </A></B>
<P>
to meet the theme which is needed and echoed on this side of the 
House.
<P>
	The provinces and the federal government had a meeting. 
They came away with a sense of co-operation and a resolution 
that together they must provide the hard working taxpayer a 
return for the dollar. This is why we must work together to 
achieve efficiencies and savings and to address overlap and 
duplication.
<P>
	The federal and provincial ministers of housing will be 
meeting at a summer conference. It is hoped the co-operation 
we have started in working with our provincial counterparts will 
be exemplified there. They will be working not only on 
strategies as to the cost effectiveness and efficiency of 
administering the existing social housing portfolio but also will 
be discussing the partnership required to meet the needs.
<P>
	Efficiencies can be realized in the operating costs. A few 
examples are: improved energy efficiencies; streamlining the 
professional fees such as audit and legal fees, et cetera, that are 
done in the social housing field; reducing property and liability 
insurance costs; and bulk purchasing of goods and services. All 
those avenues offer excellent opportunities and potential for 
savings.
<P>
	We need to build in a spirit of co-operation and partnership. 
We need to renew our thinking for the nineties, to find new and 
creative ways to meet the need before us as a country, a need 
facing all Canadians but especially those for whom social 
housing is the only answer. We need to consider innovative 
ways. We need to look outside our existing structures.
<P>
	As Canadians we offer much to the world. I have participated 
in international conferences where as Canadians we stood up 
and participated on a level way above what a number of other 
countries presently involved were doing.
<P>
	Partnerships among levels of government in Canada have 
historically worked well. They will continue to work well as 
long as there is co-operation within the federation. With our 
current fiscal reality we need to continue to do this and do it 
even better. Existing partnerships must be reviewed to 
determine how we can put them together to benefit not only the 
housing market but also for the jobs that could be provided in 
that area.
<P>
	Creative new funding opportunities must include the third 
sector contribution, charitable organizations and all those 
involved in the area of meeting the housing needs of Canadians.
<P>
	Housing policy can no longer be considered as something by 
itself isolated in a vacuum, the responsibility of a government 
agency, body or ministry. It cannot simply be measured in terms 
of public expenditures. It must be linked to other public policies 
and co-ordinated with them to get the most from available 
resources.
<P>
	It is very important on this side of the House that as we speak 
about the ideals of what the 21st century offers to us, as we begin 
to review the needs of Canadians, as we begin to look at our 
entire social security system, that we see social housing as a 
very important part of that discussion.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	Today's topic is timely. The input from members today will go 
into the discussion that will and must occur as we move forward. 
This type of thinking reflects what is already occurring in a 
number of provinces.
<P>
	Demonstration projects are now under way in New 
Brunswick, British Columbia and other provinces. They are 
looking at income supplements to enable welfare recipients to 
enter the workforce and become self-sufficient. The emphasis is 
on training and education and finding jobs for those able to 
work.
<P>
	These programs stress enabling individuals to overcome 
barriers to personal development and employment. It enhances 
their dignity and self-reliance to compete in the job market. We 
need to involve others to focus their energies, resources and 
creativity in developing solutions to housing problems.
<P>
	I worked quite closely with individuals in my last occupation 
as chair of metro housing in the empowerment of individuals. 
Residents had a say on the issues that dealt with their quality of 
life in the places in which they lived.
<P>
	I look forward to building on this spirit of co-operation as we 
extend the provision of housing to all Canadians in need, as we 
look at the innovative and cost effective ways in which we can 
provide housing for all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I realize my colleague shares many of our concerns 
about social housing. I praise her for that. It reminds me of a 
debate during the election campaign with, among others, the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and member for 
Papineau-Saint-Michel, a Montreal riding, when we both held 
the same views and criticized the Conservative government 
policies cutting all subsidies for co-operative housing.
<P>
	We had met the same groups between 1990 and 1993 and 
signed the same petitions to support all those who are involved 
in, promote and manage co-operative housing. My question to 
the hon. member is this: Did the government confirm in the 
throne speech, without my knowledge, its promise to reinstate 
the co-operative housing program? I may be wrong, but it was in 
the red book. The throne speech is silent on this matter, although 
both Liberals and Bloc members criticized Conservative poli-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1458"> 1458 </A></B>
<P>
cies. Liberals promised time and again that when they came into 
office they would reinstate the co-operative housing program.
<P>
	Maybe I missed something, but I am sure they will be true to 
their promise and a decision has already been made. I did not see 
it, but I would like my hon. colleague to tell me when that 
decision was made and where it is to be found in the throne 
speech. Maybe it will be announced in the Minister of Finance's 
budget speech next Tuesday. I would really like to be better 
informed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish I knew what was in next 
Tuesday's budget, but in fairness and in response to the 
member's question I just want to confirm what was said earlier.
<P>
	We are committed to job creation. We recognize that housing 
and everything relating to housing is a stimulus to job creation. 
We are committed to ensuring that Canadian society functions. 
We are committed to helping people in needy situations. We are 
committed to responding to the needs of people who find 
themselves in difficult situations especially in our urban areas 
where there are waiting lists of thousands of people who require 
housing. There is a commitment to respond to those needs.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	We have committed timelines and deadlines to some of the 
programs. We have committed to CMHC. We mentioned what 
we will do in the area of the aboriginal and the dollars we will 
spend in that area. We talked about our commitment and support 
to the national strategy for the integration of persons with 
disabilities. It is there. It is within our commitment to ensure our 
support. We will ensure that Canadian society and those who 
require assistance will be so afforded.
<P>
	We have talked about how many dollars, where we are going 
with all of this. We spoke about partnerships. We talked about 
working together. The whole business of the co-operative 
movement is a partnership. There is support for this and I know 
that the minister is committed to ensuring that together with the 
finance minister he can come up with some alternatives.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a fact 
that when the state gets heavily involved in housing there is less 
incentive for private landlords to build housing units. This 
means less housing overall and higher rents, which only hurts 
low income Canadians.
<P>
	Does the government consider these secondary but very real 
effects in considering how to approach this problem?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is full knowledge on the 
part of everyone involved in the housing industry as well as 
everyone on this side of the House. We recognize that we have a 
responsibility and it is a partnership.
<P>
	We are also fully aware of what happens in the market. We 
have seen over the last while with the increase in prices what has 
happened to those that are neediest and those for whom the state 
has to provide some assistance. We have seen the homeless in 
our midst growing. That reality is there in terms of the push and 
the pull in the market and the support that is given.
<P>
	We have again campaigned on job creation. We recognize that 
housing starts and the housing market have to go hand in hand 
with the promise of job creation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, in my riding, 
Bourassa, in Montreal North, the housing situation is tragic: 42 
per cent of tenants spend more than 30 per cent of their income 
on housing; 73 per cent of the 90,000 residents of Montreal 
North are tenants. Of these 90,000 residents, 22 per cent are 
women who spend more than half of their income on housing. 
This is the highest percentage in all of Quebec. The situation is 
alarming.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Organisation populaire des droits sociaux de 
Montréal-Nord and the Front d'action populaire en 
réaménagement urbain gave a press conference. During the 
election campaign, I visited many co-operatives. The people 
were very worried following the subsidy cuts in funding made 
when the Conservative government was in power. There are also 
many minorities in my riding.
<P>
	I would like to ask my hon. friend if special measures are 
planned to protect the right to housing of minorities, 
particularly of visible minorities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Mr. Speaker, the question of protection for 
minority individuals is important. I will say that there is, and I 
am speaking on a personal note, as far as I can see. The co-ops 
and co-op programs through which individuals can put together 
through their community a request and build and house 
themselves as a result of their own activity are parts of the 
continuing program. There are special avenues. I can talk about 
several communities in which efforts are made to empower 
individuals to participate in the communities in which they live 
and to be very much an integrated part of their communities.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	In this country we do not have areas in which minorities or 
various groups take residential patterns because this is the only 
place in which they can live. Therefore all programs are open 
equally to everyone regardless of race, colour, nationality, 
creed, length of stay of Canada, et cetera. The programs for 
those individuals are really empowering programs to help them 
to be partners in programs of co-operation where individuals 
have a sense of belonging, a quality of life, and are able to 
participate freely in society.
<P>

<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
really appreciated the comments of the hon. member for 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore. I understood, from her remarks, that she 
really cares about social housing, all the more so since she was 
director of the largest social housing complex in Toronto for a 
while. She even said, and I quote: ``Adequate shelter is a 
fundamental right''. It is a concern that we share, of course.
<P>
	However, there is a lot of confusion on the government's part 
because, even with all the nice principles being laid out, the 
good intentions and the rhetoric, it seems that we cannot find out 
what the government really thinks about this issue. A while ago, 
someone asked if the government was willing to implement a 
social housing construction program, and we got no answer. 
Also, when I put a question to the Minister of Public Works, he 
could not tell me if he is opposed to rent increases for social 
housing units.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member for Etobicoke-Lakeshore if she 
would agree to rent increases for social housing units in order to 
pay for the construction of more units.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a very legitimate question 
and one that is usually asked. There are several ways, especially 
in the area of public housing, where 20 per cent or 30 per cent is 
used as a ratio and is referred to as meeting the needs of 
individuals who are caught in that socioeconomic situation.
<P>
	The increase in rent in the province of Ontario is an example. 
We know there is some control in that specific area. Are we 
talking about people who are in deep core need? Are we talking 
about people who are paying market rent? Are we talking about 
the present situation of the market as it is today? Are we talking 
about the needs of individuals to get into housing as a result of 
the size of their families?
<P>
	When we ask a question about rent and speak about people in 
social housing there are a number of things it is important to take 
into consideration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will try to make my comments in two minutes and leave one 
minute for a response.
<P>
	I have listened to much of this debate today. I want to make it 
absolutely clear that there are many people in the Reform Party 
who believe strongly in the need for social housing. We 
understand that decent housing is the cornerstone of many 
families. It is the first real step many families take to work 
themselves out of poverty. We have to be thinking in terms of the 
children, not of the adults, in terms of the potential of the 
children to have firm, consistent roots from which they can grow 
into adults.
<P>
	We still have to pay the bills. We as a Parliament have to set 
priorities. We have to decide where we can spend money, where 
we can get money and where we can allocate it. In my view there 
are probably very few areas of spending that we could define 
that should have a higher priority than housing, particularly for 
the poor and also for single parents who are primarily female.
<P>
	The problem is that somehow we have to make these projects 
self-liquidating. We have to ensure that the social housing 
projects do not all gravitate to one geographical area. They need 
to be spread out through the community so that we do not get 
blocks of high income and low income. We should be able to 
spread them out through the community.
<P>
	The co-op programs we have work very well-
<P>
