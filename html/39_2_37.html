    </p><a name="Para840132"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building trades across the country have lobbied successive governments for over 30 years to achieve some basic fairness for their members. They want trades persons and indentured apprentices to be able to deduct travel and accommodation expenses from their taxable incomes, so that they can secure and maintain employment at construction sites that are more than 80 kilometres away from their homes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840133"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes no sense for trades persons to be out of work in one area of the country while another region suffers from temporary skilled trade shortages, simply because the cost of travelling is too high. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840134"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To that end they have gathered hundreds of signatures in support of my private member's bill, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3073321,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3073321&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-390</A>, which would allow for precisely the kind of deductions that their members have been asking for.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840135"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to table this petition on their behalf and share their disappointment that this item was not addressed in the government's mini-budget this fall.</div>

    </p><a name="Para840139"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The topic of post office closures in rural areas has been much discussed in this House. However, closing an urban post office hurts too. Some residents, particularly those in this neighbourhood, have a hard time getting around. They use wheelchairs or walkers to get to the post office. For them, a post office located several kilometres away at the end of the Victoria bridge, an area that is not served by public transportation and that is regularly congested, is just not acceptable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840140"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, between 200 and 300 people use post office boxes at this post office. Some people use them to maintain a permanent address, but now they will have to get new post office boxes. Others, such as victims of domestic violence, use them for reasons of confidentiality. All of these people will have trouble accessing this service in the future. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840141"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to point out that Montreal's Pointe-Saint-Charles neighbourhood is experiencing economic renewal and development. Community members have done a lot of work to attract businesses to the neighbourhood. Canada Post is sending the wrong signal by closing the only post office in the neighbourhood.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840142"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government will have to pay attention to the thousands of people who have signed this petition and who are taking part in a rally about this today. I hope they will be heard, and I hope Canada Post will reverse its decision. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78405,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78405&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Marc-Aurèle-Fortin</A>, I am appealing to you with regard to a decision made by the chair of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security on December 6. The chair deemed that an amendment introduced by my colleague on behalf of the Bloc Québécois was out of order.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840160"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will explain very quickly. This has to do with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076462,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076462&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-3</A> concerning security certificates. The bill already allows an appeal, but only in very restricted circumstances. An appeal can be made only if a judge believes that a serious question of general importance is involved. Only then can the case be re-examined.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840161"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the bill opened the debate on appeals and in light of the serious consequences of security certificates, we amended this appeal process to broaden it. People can be detained for several years on the basis of these security certificates. We therefore wanted the appeal process to go beyond what the bill allowed and be governed by more or less the same provisions as in the Criminal Code. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840162"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78405,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78405&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Marc-Aurèle-Fortin</A> introduced his amendment, which we felt was in order because it amended an existing part of the bill—namely, the appeal process—the amendment was ruled out of order because it was considered to be outside the scope of the law.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to bring to your attention the French and English dictionary definitions of “scope of the law”, which in French is rendered as <i>portée de la loi</i>. The English term is found in the eighth edition of <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i>.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, in our opinion, the amendment introduced by the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78405,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78405&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Marc-Aurèle-Fortin</A> was completely in order because it pertained to an existing clause of the bill.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do have some business to finish up, so I rise today to speak to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3079399,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3079399&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-2</A> at third reading. The passing of this bill, once it receives royal assent, completes Canada's role in the ratification of an agreement to update major elements of the Canada-U.S. tax treaty.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840193"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S., for its part, must also ratify this agreement before it comes into effect. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840194"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the House may know, Canada and the U.S. have had a tax treaty in place since 1980. Since that time, there have been four updates or protocols to this treaty. This is to ensure that our respective tax systems evolve to reflect economic and social changes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840195"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3079399,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3079399&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-2</A> represents the fifth update to the treaty. Canada has numerous tax treaties with other countries as well. However, given the unique relationship we have with the Americans, the Canada-U.S. tax treaty is generally viewed as the one of most importance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840196"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This treaty is part and parcel of the government's plan to create a tax advantage for Canada and we have a long term economic plan for Canada's future called “Advantage Canada”. This plan was designed to improve our quality of life and to make Canada a world leader for today and for future generations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840197"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Advantage Canada” promotes five competitive economic advantages we need to succeed in today's global economy: a fiscal advantage, a tax advantage, a knowledge advantage, an entrepreneurial advantage and an infrastructure advantage. Each of those advantages does not stand alone. Rather, they stand interconnected with each other. In other words, we are creating a Canadian advantage on those five fronts. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840198"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that we are talking about a tax treaty today, it is creating a tax advantage that I would like to highlight today. A Canadian tax advantage will help individuals, families and businesses to get ahead and stay ahead. Moreover, it will reward initiative and make Canada the global investment destination of choice. A tax advantage starts with reducing taxes for Canadians. Of course, taxes pay for Canada's important public services but high taxes limit Canadians' opportunities and choices.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840199"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a more focused government, we can both lower taxes to create better incentives for Canadians to succeed and provide significant funding for priorities. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840200"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tax advantage is about reducing taxes in all areas to stimulate investment and economic growth. This includes reducing personal income taxes to improve rewards from working, from saving and investing in new knowledge and skills. It includes creating a business tax advantage that will encourage businesses to invest in Canada. In turn, this will spur innovation and growth leading to more jobs and higher wages for Canadian workers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840201"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government also continues its commitment to restoring tax fairness. Canadians deserve to know that everyone will pay their fair share of taxes. That is what tax fairness is all about. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840202"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, tax fairness is key to the “Advantage Canada” plan. This plan will make our tax system simpler, fairer and more competitive. This will help us to compete in the global marketplace. We have taken significant action in that direction. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840203"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most recently, this fall's economic statement proposed broad based tax relief of almost $60 billion for individuals, families and businesses over this and the next five fiscal years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840204"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combined with previous relief provided by the government, total tax relief over the same period is almost $190 billion. These dramatic tax reductions and initiatives will benefit families with children, workers, seniors, persons with disabilities and others.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1035"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1035"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1035">(1035)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para840205"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will also strengthen our tax advantage to help all Canadian businesses compete and succeed in the global marketplace. These important initiatives will help attract investment to Canada. Moreover, this action will increase productivity and economic growth and create more and better jobs for Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840206"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, one may ask, does this have to do with tax treaties? Tax treaties and tax fairness are inextricably linked. Our tax treaties help contribute to the growth of the Canadian economy, particularly by encouraging trade. This is principally important because exports account for more than 40% of Canada's annual GDP. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840207"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, tax treaties help attract investment in Canada. This investment means inflows of capital, technology and information, all of which contribute to Canada's economic growth, job creation and the well-being of our citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840208"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, our government must ensure that Canada's system of international taxation is competitive. We have worked to ensure that our network of bilateral tax treaties is up to date in order to help Canadian companies and investors to prosper and succeed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840209"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One important function of tax treaties to keep in mind when considering this bill is that they help eliminate double taxation. I trust that hon. members would agree that there is little that can have more of a negative impact on the expansion of our trade and the movement of capital and labour between countries than double taxation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840210"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potential for double taxation comes about when a taxpayer resides in one country and earns income in another. Without a tax treaty in place, both countries can claim tax on that same income.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840211"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the goals for Canada, therefore, in negotiating its tax treaties, is to remove the potential for double taxation. This not only helps provide incentives for investment, it promotes fairness in our tax system. That is why one of the proposals in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3079399,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3079399&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-2</A> would allow taxpayers to demand that otherwise insoluble tax issues be settled through arbitration, thus ensuring that there is no double taxation of immigrants' gains.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840212"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the special relationship that Canada has with the U.S., it makes sense that our tax treaty would also be special. Indeed, Canada's income tax treaty with the United States is vital. It helps to ensure the efficient flow of trade between our two countries. These changes to the treaty, signed in September, will stimulate further trade and investment and make our tax systems more efficient.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840213"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians and Canadian businesses will benefit from this treaty update in a number of ways. They will see reduced borrowing costs and a more competitive lending market with the elimination of withholding tax on interest paid on all arm's length debt. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840214"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since treaty benefits will be extended to limited liability companies, the protocol in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3079399,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3079399&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-2</A> would provide better access to U.S. capital. With further harmonization of the tax treatment of pension contributions in the two countries and new rules to clarify the treatment of stock options, this proposed legislation would also provide more mobility for Canadians working in the U.S.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840215"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, these changes would, among other benefits, reduce the cost of cross-border financing and would have a positive effect on investment and, above all, simplify the tax system. All of these benefits, in turn, support the competitiveness of Canada's multinational enterprises. These are important considerations that we need to keep in mind when debating this bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840216"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most important aspects of the Canada-U.S. tax treaty is the proposal respecting withholding tax. Reaction from taxpayers to this measure has been particularly positive. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840217"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the signing of the treaty, the director of the C.D. Howe Institute said:</div>
    </p><a name="Para840218"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>And our research suggests that the bilateral elimination of withholding taxes will substantially improve the efficiency of capital markets, attract foreign direct investment to the country, and help Canadians penetrate the North American market on a more competitive basis.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para840219"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reaction from the other side of the border has been equally supportive. Treasury Secretary Paulson, at the signing of the agreement in September, said that updating our treaty enables us “to move even more swiftly in the global economy”.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1040"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1040"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1040">(1040)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para840220"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians will particularly benefit from easier cross-border investment as the withholding tax is removed from interest paid between non-arm's length persons between Canada and the U.S.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840221"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will explain why this is a good thing for Canadians. Canada and most other countries levy a withholding tax on passive forms of income earned by non-residents. This fifth protocol will eliminate the source country tax on cross-border interest paid between unrelated persons and will gradually eliminate the maximum withholding rate for interest payments between related persons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840222"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For unrelated party interests, the withholding tax is zero as soon as the protocol becomes ratified. An example would be in the interest that banks pay to a depositor. For related party or non-arm's length interest, the tax will be eliminated in three stages: from 10% to 7%, then to 4% and finally to zero after three years. This could be, for example, between a Canadian company and its subsidiary in the U.S. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840223"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these important tax reductions for payments to and from the United States, the government is in a position to remove the withholding tax on all arm's length interest payments to non-residents, regardless of where they reside.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840224"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This initiative announced in budget 2007 represents a major step forward in Canada's international tax policy. The legislation to implement this measure contained in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3111148,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3111148&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-28</A> is currently going through the parliamentary process, as we have watched in the last few days. Once passed, this measure will increase access to foreign capital markets. It will reduce costs for Canadians and Canadian businesses that borrow from foreign lenders. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840225"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to point out here that the government had originally planned to tie the effective date of this general tax reduction to the Canada-U.S. tax treaty protocol. However, given the uncertainty of when the protocol will be ratified on both sides of the border, the government proposes to give the domestic rule a fixed start date of January 1, 2008. This will provide certainty for Canadian investors so that after 2007 they will no longer need to withhold interest on tax paid to arm's length persons in any country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840226"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summing up, this tax treaty bill, like others that preceded it, is directly related to international trade and investment. These bills have a significant and a direct benefit to the Canadian economy. This is no small consideration in a world where Canadian exports, as I said earlier, account for more than 40% of our annual GDP.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840227"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, direct foreign investment, as well as inflows of information, capital and technology, represent the lifeblood of Canada's economic wealth. As a result, eliminating tax impediments in these areas, as this bill proposes to do, is of utmost importance, and that is why passing this bill is also of utmost importance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840228"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, encourage the hon. members from all parties to pass this bill into law quickly.</div>

What I do hear is positive comments and that it is very important to investors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840234"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the hon. member's first question about working on one side of the border and living on another, this is one of the most critical improvements that we can make. There are many places in the country, such as in New Brunswick and in the Windsor-Detroit corridor where people are back and forth across the border. On the lower mainland of British Columbia many people live in the U.S. and work on the Canadian side and vice versa.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840235"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the hon. member's question, it does carry on beyond their working days. Many pension contributions have been ineffective or focused on one side of the border. This treaty would allow people, who work for a corporation that has entities on both sides of the border, to continue to contribute to their pension and be able to do that on both sides of the border. That is one very important aspect.</div>

Many employees of the auto industry can be transferred from one entity to the other and so the protection of their pension benefits is one of the important aspects.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840240"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the other important aspects that we do need to remind hon. members about is the arbitration process that this brings into play. We have all heard horror stories of dealing with the tax departments on both the Canadian and the U.S. side. We all would like to think it could work better but when there is an issue this would provide a mandatory process of appeal that was not in place before, which can impact residents on both sides of the border, and this would allow them to have their concerns heard by an independent arbitrator.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840241"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has many important aspects to it and the sharing of making social security benefits taxable only in the recipients country of residence is one of the important aspects.</div>

We are now on third reading, which happened quite rapidly earlier today. I think the cooperation in this House seems to be quite rampant at this time of year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840252"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada-United States Tax Convention Act was last updated in 1997 and, prior to that, in 1995 by the former Liberal government. It is important that these conventions get reviewed and updated regularly. In fact, the former Liberal government had already started negotiating this new tax convention with the U.S. even after the adoption of the last convention.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840253"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like any tax convention or tax treaty, these agreements are important to the economic success of a country and, in particular, under current conditions where countries and all stakeholders need to compete on the international scene.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840254"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This particular convention is important since it is with our largest trading partner, a country with over $50 billion of trade on an annual basis.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840255"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While international tax law, especially in this place, does not always make for the most exciting of debates, its importance is indisputable, especially as we move toward greater globalization and greater free movement of labour and capital across international borders.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840256"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had tax treaties in place with many countries for many years and, as with most laws, there comes a time when they need to be amended in order to reflect the changing times. This is one of those situations where we see a more rapid change in the actual conditions than the actual conventions themselves. Consequently, this bill presents some routine amendments that I believe will help to ensure Canada remains a leading participant in the global economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840257"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International arrangements, such as these, allow for relatively free movement of people and capital across borders, contributing greatly to the rich, multicultural nature of the country.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some members in this House think that tax treaties are signed as a way of avoiding taxes. In fact, if these treaties are well written and properly understood, they make the taxation system more effective and promote trade—the exchange of goods and services—and do not add an administrative burden. Everyone benefits from treaties that are well written and signed in due form. They encourage foreign investment and increase trade, as I was saying.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para840259"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-2, in turn, would also be a valuable tool to help certain industries improve Canadian productivity. Even though the latest Conservative measures, such as reducing the GST, do not improve productivity, nothing is even close to being fair about some of the Conservative latest tax planning or tax initiatives that they have come up with. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840260"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst example in the last couple of weeks is their tax policy or tax system where in the 2006 budget they raised the lowest personal income rate to 15.5% and now have announced that they will bring the rate back down to the original Liberal rate of 15%. People can all try and figure that one out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840261"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another advantage of Bill S-2 is that it would eliminate source country withholding tax on cross-border interest payments. Canadians who borrow money, and I would say mainly large corporations that borrow money from American lenders, would no longer need to withhold and remit Canadian tax on the interest payments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840262"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-2 would also provide an advantage for Canadians to better access the U.S. debt market. Sometimes we see larger corporations having difficulty in accessing capital here in Canada. The Americans have a larger capital base and I think that will help the opening up to the debt market. We will see what happens in the short term with some of the crisis that we are seeing in the U.S. right now. However, this convention should definitely provide an easier flow of obtaining some debt for some of the Canadian companies. It also will be easier for companies to finance their expansion and, hopefully, their expansion into other markets other than here in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840263"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would also allow taxpayers to require otherwise unsolvable double tax issues to be settled through arbitration. This arbitration rule is an important element of the bill because it would increase taxpayers' confidence that the tax treaty will resolve potential double taxation situations. These convention tax treaties, the basic purpose, in normal circumstances, is to avoid double taxation, should solve the fact that no double taxation of gains or even deemed gains of immigrants to Canada will arise.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840264"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would also extend treaty benefits to limited liability companies by removing a potential impediment to cross-border investment which arises from private equity funds and their comings and goings. I will probably address this point later on in my speech because this point was brought up at the finance committee during the prebudget consultations in the past. This would make it easier for companies to bring their products from the research stage to the actual market commercialization phase. Hopefully, this will result in more research and development work to be completed in Canada and potentially for exporting to other markets, in this case the U.S. market.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840265"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more workers are temporarily being reassigned outside the borders and apparently more into the U.S. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840266"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S-2 would give mutual tax recognition to pension contributors. In other words, provided certain conditions are met, cross-border commuters may deduct, for residence country tax purposes, the pension contributions they make to a plan or arrangement in the country where they work. People who move temporarily from one country to the other for work reasons can, subject to certain conditions, get tax recognition in their temporary new home country for pension contributions they continue to make to their original employer's pension plan. This proposal would facilitate the movement of personnel between Canada and the U.S. by removing a possible disincentive for commuters in temporary work assignments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840267"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is definitive a positive step. There is also an advantage for clarifying how stock options are taxed or, in other words, the harmonization of the rules in both countries. There are a whole bunch of other technical amendments in this bill that if we have some additional time I will get into.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840268"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to address the importance of these conventions. These conventions are great, fine and dandy. We can improve them, ratify them and pass them into law in this country, but the fact that they are international tax agreements, we require an entity on the other side to also sign these conventions. These conventions and tax treaties are not worth the paper they are written on if we cannot get the other countries to ratify them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840269"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish that this particular legislation had been brought forward to the finance committee. Instead, the present government decided to bring it before the international trade committee. I am not sure why it went through without too many witnesses. We would have probably looked at ensuring that there was a willingness on the other wide to have this treaty ratified and signed quite rapidly.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some tax treaties that we signed in the past that have yet to be signed by other countries. I know of many in particular that have been negotiated with Italy. I think there are some agreements that are at least five years old that have not been signed by the other country to the agreement, so there are pending issues in terms of double taxation where there are people who are being taxed in Canada and other countries. Again I would caution the present government to make sure that even though we ratify these conventions or enact the legislation, the government make it a priority to have the other country ratify the agreement or convention as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840271"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I have some time, I will explain how some of the amendments got into this bill. I would like to take credit for some of them. I chaired the finance committee in 2004, and we did a very thorough job. There were a lot of presentations made before the committee in terms of what Canadians and Canadian businesses were looking for when doing business in the United States.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840272"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We devoted practically a whole chapter of our report to business growth and prosperity. We included in it some of the testimony given by witnesses. There is one paragraph I would like to read into the record where witnesses urged that changes be made to the non-resident withholding tax regime to ensure that Canada remained competitive. This was in 2004 and three years later we are still at this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840273"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was suggested, for example, that the Department of Finance negotiate a new provision with the U.S. to eliminate withholding tax on all dividends and interest to both related and unrelated parties. They mentioned a recent study which claimed that the elimination of withholding taxes on all dividends and interest would result in increased capital investment in Canada of $28 billion. Even a fraction of that would help certain sectors of this country, especially the manufacturing sector. It would also result in increased income of $7.5 billion annually. It was pointed out that while there would be a federal fiscal cost associated with eliminating withholding tax, the economy would benefit in the long run. Again this was in 2004. The committee also heard that Canada's dividend tax rate is now much higher than that in the U.S., with a 15% federal tax rate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840274"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of that, I am proud to say that in 2004 we made over 30 recommendations. Of those, there were at least five that pertained to items that needed to be addressed when it came to the Canada-U.S. tax treaty. I will read into the record one of the recommendations that I thought was important:</div>

</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para840278"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another recommendation that was applied in the U.S.-Canada convention is that the federal government revise Canada's cost allowance rates such that the Canadian rates are similar to rates for comparable asset classes in the United States and other countries. In fact, this one has not been addressed yet by the current government.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recommendation 24 was that the federal government undertake a comprehensive review of the personal taxation system in Canada, including the value of the basic personal amount and other particular aspects of the Income Tax Act, but always taking into account that the review should be undertaken with a view to ensuring that Canada's personal taxation system is both fair and as competitive as possible with other countries, particularly the United States. </div>

    </p><a name="Para840287"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Standing Committee on Finance spent a great deal of time examining the tax treaty with Barbados. When the current government was in the opposition, it was in favour of rapidly plugging the loopholes that allow people to bring money back to Canada from tax havens without having to pay tax. Now that it is in government, it seems to be well-intentioned, but we are still waiting for results.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840288"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the Liberal Party that was responsible for creating these loopholes in the first place.

I am pleased to see that he wishes this committee to examine this issue once again. An agreement will be reached readily given that the government has already stated that it supports continuing with the review already begun by the Standing Committee on Finance. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840294"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now know that the Liberal Party also supports proceeding and I have no doubt at all that the NDP would also like to examine the issue of companies that use tax havens such as Barbados, the most well known example, to avoid paying their fair share of tax.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840295"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to spend most of my time on this subject. The tax agreement with the United States covered by the bill under consideration is not a problem. We all know that the United States is not a tax haven. The bill gives cross-border workers the same tax benefits as resident workers. It will institute a bipartite tribunal or board to settle tax disputes and to tighten rules for certain types of companies, making it more difficult to use various tax loopholes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840296"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill eliminates certain provisions pertaining to double taxation of capital gains. We support this and I believe it has a great deal of support from parliamentarians. I do not wish to go into too much detail about this matter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840297"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is surprising that the government has time for such matters. That is fine, we are not criticizing them, but we are questioning their unwillingness to shut down tax havens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840298"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to backtrack a bit to have a better understanding of what is at issue. There is a general rule among various countries that sign tax agreements. If tax is paid in one country, it is not paid a second time on the same income when the money is repatriated to the country of origin. According to this principle, the same income is not taxed twice.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840299"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, in order to know whether companies have paid taxes in their country of origin, Canada negotiates tax treaties with other countries. Among other things, these treaties provide for the exchange of information about taxes paid in another country, so that Canada knows whether or not the money should be taxed when it is brought back here. If there is no tax treaty or exchange of information, Canada assumes that taxes were not paid and claims the corresponding taxes when the money is brought back.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840300"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, in the Liberal days, a bill was introduced by the finance minister at the time, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78571,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78571&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">LaSalle—Émard</A>, to establish a tax treaty with Barbados, telling our companies that do business in Barbados and pay taxes there that they should not also pay taxes in Canada. At issue was a famous example of a company doing business in Barbados, Canada Steamship Lines International, which was of course owned by the family of the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78571,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78571&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">LaSalle—Émard</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840301"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to this point, everything is fine and seems to make sense. The problem is that the tax rate for international companies in Barbados is 2%. Obviously, it is rather ridiculous to say that these companies paid taxes in Barbados, since they paid 2%. Really, it was getting a gift. Then, companies such as Canada Steamship Lines are allowed to bring back to Canada the money they had earned from having their head office in Barbados, without having to pay taxes here. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840302"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another loophole in this mechanism that the Liberals themselves introduced. Obviously, the act requires there to be a real place of business in Barbados. It also states that the revenues must genuinely be earned in Barbados, and that they must not simply be a financing scheme to avoid paying taxes.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840303"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will probably remember the very telling report that aired in Quebec, aptly called <i>Les évasions barbares</i>, or The Barbarian Evasions. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1115"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1115"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1115">(1115)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para840304"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A journalist went to Barbados, to the building that is home to the head offices of hundreds of companies that supposedly do business there. The journalist found that the building has about a hundred tiny rooms just big enough to accommodate a secretary and two filing cabinets. Obviously, the journalist demonstrated by this very fact that it would be impossible for a company that generates millions of dollars to really have a head office there, in such a small partitioned office with only a desk, a typist, a computer and two filing cabinets.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840305"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, the decisions made by those companies are made in Canada or elsewhere around the world. Their activities take place in Canada or elsewhere around the world, but their financing is such that all revenue is artificially declared in Barbados and is subject to a ridiculously low tax rate, only 2%. They then send the money back to Canada, maintaining that they have already paid taxes in Barbados and therefore should not have to pay taxes in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840306"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scheme is possible because of the negligence of the Liberal government at the time and we hope that the Conservative government will be proactive in this file, as it claims it will. At the time, the Liberal government was negligent and even had the audacity to adopt retroactive measures with respect to the tax treaty with Barbados. In fact, when the bill was adopted, the provisions were that the treaty would apply retroactively to 1995. By a curious coincidence, that was the same year that Canada Steamship Lines was established in Barbados. That was a rather interesting situation, especially since, when it comes to retroactivity, both the Liberals and the Conservatives seem to adopt a double standard.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840307"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, the guaranteed income supplement is a perfect example. For years, the Bloc Québécois has been fighting for the seniors who have been swindled out of the guaranteed income supplement. They are owed money because they were misinformed and were unable to claim the money at the appropriate time. They must be given full retroactivity, that is, they must be given the money that is owing to them. It is not a gift; they are entitled to this money. Yet, this is not being done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840308"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, when people have to pay taxes because they have forgotten to declare income over the past five or ten years, retroactivity applies. Those at fault cannot tell the tax man that he caught them too late, so they should only have to pay for the past 11 months. If they get caught, they have to pay taxes for the past five or ten years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840309"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same goes for Barbados. New legislation was retroactive. No big deal, it provided tax shelters to companies so they could get off without having to pay any taxes. No big deal, retroactivity applied. In contrast, when it comes to reimbursing seniors, when it is time to give them the money they are entitled to, the government says too bad, it cannot be done. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840310"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals did not want to budge when people were asking them to. We challenged them on the fact that they were offering full retroactivity in terms of tax breaks for the richest companies, but were not doing the same for seniors. During the election campaign, the Conservatives said that they would grant seniors full retroactivity. Now they are refusing to do it because they say they are in charge and things have changed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840311"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does it mean for politics when a member or a minister says that now that he is in government, things have changed? Does it mean that he said whatever he wanted beforehand? Does it mean that the government has the right to withhold the truth and mislead the public? That is a very strange way to operate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840312"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really want to take this opportunity to emphasize something to all parties in this House. Even though the Bloc Québécois supports the bill before us concerning the tax convention with the United States, we want to re-examine issues related to other tax conventions between Canada and other countries, conventions that are designed not to help workers, but to enable companies to pay next to no tax in Canada and opt out of their fair contribution. </div>

Now, I am being told that he had never discussed it with finance department officials. How is it that he introduced a bill in this House containing clauses that were allegedly never discussed and whose legal implications he allegedly never considered?</div>
    </p><a name="Para840322"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either the member is mistaken and the former finance minister, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78571,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78571&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">LaSalle—Émard</A>, did address that issue and did examine the implications of these clauses, contrary to what the member just said, or the member for LaSalle—Émard, who was the finance minister at the time, never considered the impacts of these clauses and was completely unaware of how clauses in a bill he introduced in this House could affect his family company. I have some trouble imagining that. Either way, he acted irresponsibly. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840323"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a well-known fact that he did not run the day-to-day operations of Canada Steamship Lines. However, if someone owns a company, he need not be involved directly in its management to know that if it moved to Barbados in 1995 it might be interesting to make the tax agreement retroactive to 1995.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840324"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last item has to do with the competitiveness of these corporations. Let us be frank. If it were really true, why would there not be a special tax treatment for these corporations in Canada? At least the 2% to 5% in tax that could be collected would be paid in Canada. At present, we lose everything. Are we prepared to accept for all time that the existence of tax havens and corporations without infrastructure to support—these shipping companies use our infrastructure and our ports and the consumer goods are destined for our markets or are being shipped by our producers via these ships—justifies the burden being shouldered by Canadian taxpayers alone?</div>
    </p><a name="Para840325"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to find means of ensuring, among other things, that everyone pays their fair share. The member has just confirmed the Liberal Party's true methods. These companies must be profitable; therefore there is no other option but to be based in a tax haven such as Barbados.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840326"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could make the following argument as I mentioned earlier. Two months ago I became the father of a baby girl. I could say that in order to pay my rent I have no choice but to pay less tax and I will work under the table. It does not work like that. I cannot say that because I need to pay less I have to find a way of not paying my taxes. Everyone has to pay taxes, citizens and corporations alike.</div>

    </p><a name="Para840328"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, under Canadian tax law, if the direction and control of a company emanates from Canada, then its profits are taxable in Canada. If the member would check the records, he would understand that Canada Steamship Lines at that time had international and domestic operations. The international operations were based outside of Canada. If Revenue Canada ever believed that the direction and control of the international operations emanated from Canada Steamship Lines in Montreal, it could have assessed income tax. There was nothing to preclude that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840329"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the member says that the former finance minister must have known what was in the bill. I do not know on what grounds he makes that statement. Again, if he would check the record, he would understand that when the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78571,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78571&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">LaSalle—Émard</A> was finance minister, there was also a secretary of state for finance. That is how these matters were handled under the Liberal government. The secretary of state for finance would deal with any matters that touched on international shipping, and the finance minister was absolutely scrupulous about that.</div>

    </p><a name="Para840331"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the then minister of finance had no idea what impact this bill would have on his family business, if he did not use his influence, then he is unbelievably lucky. Things just happened to work out for him? I have my doubts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840332"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the former finance minister and member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78571,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78571&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">LaSalle—Émard</A> is truly as innocent as the hon. member claims, then he is a very lucky man because the bill truly worked out quite well for his family business.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840333"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for where the international division of Canada Steamship Lines International operates from—I mentioned this in my speech—that was one of the things that was questioned by a Quebec journalist who went to Barbados. He knocked on the door of the Canada Steamship Lines International office, but no one answered. There was just a small sign on the door that said: Canada Steamship Lines International.</div>

Let him invite us to see the Canada Steamship Lines International offices in Barbados. It would be my pleasure to go there and I am sure a number of my colleagues here in this House would be happy to do so as well. A trip like that would leave us with a lot of free time because visiting the offices of Canada Steamship Lines International would take only 30 to 40 seconds since there practically are no offices. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840335"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if the headquarters are truly in Barbados, with hundreds of employees working there and keeping this company in operation, then, when we return from our trip that the hon. member is going to invite us to take, I will say in this House that I was wrong.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to listen to my Liberal colleagues' defence of the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78571,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78571&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">LaSalle—Émard</A> and his tax avoidance scheme in the Barbados.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do want to segue a little into this tax treaty bill.

    </p><a name="Para840339"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are some concerns in this process and in this actual tax treaty that do not resolve significant issues for my riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78884,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78884&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Windsor West</A> as well as Essex County and, greater than that, for individuals living in Quebec, New Brunswick and other places, where significant numbers of pensioners collecting U.S. social security and making contributions in the United States had the tax treaty changed on them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840340"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process still leaves them in limbo and is actually still counter to the private member's bill of the government's own member, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78898,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78898&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Essex</A>. The government has made sure that the bill is basically squirreled away at the finance committee. It has not resurfaced, despite it having one hearing in the last session of Parliament, in which I participated. It has not seen the light of day. Jimmy Hoffa has probably seen more light of day than this bill in the last number of years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840341"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very disturbing, because some seniors are being taxed extra. That is different to what they expected. They have had their lives put on hold. They have suffered significant consequences. In fact, some of them are dying. This is very shameful. We should be addressing it. However, this bill will only add an arbitration element for those particular victims of poor taxation policy. The shift happened and they got whacked twice. The private member's bill would rectify that by allowing the taxation system to be for only 50%. Without getting into technical details, it would have provided some equity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840342"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do want to touch on process, because I think it is important. I know that right now probably only a handful of Canadians are watching this as opposed to the Mulroney-Schreiber affair and the meeting going on right now, but this does affect people. It is important to set out for the record the concerns that we in the New Democratic Party have about why the Liberals and the Conservatives have rammed this through so quickly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840343"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, it is important to recognize that the bill originated in the unelected Senate. Senators are not elected. They are appointed by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, and in fact were by the former prime minister, who is having to explain right now how many bags of cash he took and why. If members recall, he actually loaded up the Senate at one particular point to force through the GST. The party that created the GST needed the Senate to push it forward. It is ironic that he is here today. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840344"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have this bill today coming from an unelected house. Our side of the House, the New Democratic Party, has a concern about that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840345"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened subsequently is really troubling. When the bill went to the international trade committee, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78654,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78654&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Burnaby—New Westminster</A>, who represents our caucus, asked for witnesses to be brought forth and for some type of study related to the bill, which is normally what would happen on most committees.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840346"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been part of a number of different committees where we have moved quickly through clause by clause and so forth when there was a will and the support to do so, but when we have witnesses requested, we almost always have that consultation. That never happened. The Liberals joined with the Conservatives to block that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840347"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government does have some issues with regard to the tax treaty and we do want to have some of those things improved here, but there are some major unknowns and questions out there. I want to read from a communication I received. It was sent in confidence to me, so I cannot say from which legal firm it came, but it is a reputable Canadian legal firm that is giving its opinion on the tax treaty. I want to read what it has provided me in terms of the new protocol:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, what we have here is the situation of a service industry that could have new taxation added to it through this process. We know that right now there are some concerns with the service sector and the economy and we do not have a full economic analysis of it.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There could be some very valuable elements to the treaty. I think there are.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to touch on the issue of social security and Canadians who have paid in the U.S., are doing so now and face extra taxation. I am going to read another very important letter that talks about the history of this change.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840357"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, this bill is not going to address the issue of those Canadians who had the tax treaty altered on them. The government is going to send them to some arbitration process, which is not even described. It could take literally years. We have no idea. And that is if they win, let alone having to go through that and relive the whole situation. That is a real concern, because the government has a private member's bill from its own member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78898,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78898&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Essex</A>, who has been pushing that issue, and the government has not even listened to him.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why the government is not adjusting that specifically in the bill, I do not know. Why it is turning its back on many residents of Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick, I cannot understand. I want to read the letter for members because it describes, for the record, what has been happening to these ordinary Canadians. It describes what took place with the tax treaty and how it affects them and their lives. The letter comes from Mr. Craig Ridsdale and is entitled “Unfair Tax Laws Burden Seniors”. It states:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again we are talking about pensioners, seniors, who are living in Canada. They worked abroad, they paid their taxes there and they paid their taxes at home, but when they actually got their social security benefits things changed and they now get taxed even more on those benefits. That is why the private member's bill to correct this would have been a more equitable situation. Why the government has not done that is unacceptable. This is a real hardship for many people.</div>

He used the back door and walked through the kitchen to go to the event as opposed to meeting with the individuals who were affected by this taxation policy that had been changed.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many statements made by Liberals and Conservatives both, who are fighting over this. Members of the NDP have been consistent on it.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not know whether the banks are going to enjoy that money. We do not know who is going to be the real net beneficiary of that arrangement.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, we have $1 billion for that sector, which we do not even have a prescribed analysis from. The department said it would come back with more information. At the same time, it would cost around $60 million if we did not tax at an increased rate seniors who paid their social security in the United States. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840372"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is bizarre, because we know from the evidence presented to us that those individuals are going to spend that money in this country. They are going to use it to get by. They are going to continue to renovate homes and to be in our communities more, and they are going to be able to pay off some of their debts.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not know why they are motivated to move in this direction. In conclusion, I find it really frustrating that the Liberals have joined with the Conservatives on this issue to prevent debate, analysis and full due diligence. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840375"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do want to see our tax treaties updated. We are not opposed to that. They are very beneficial in many respects. Living on the Canada-U.S. border as I do, I have spoken at length in the House of Commons about the Windsor-Detroit border and its importance. We are not opposed to going forward on this, but why, for heaven's sake, are we not doing it properly? Why is it so convenient to let this group of seniors be basically thrust to the side, forgotten and left out of the whole picture? Why is that being contemplated? Why is that being allowed?</div>
    </p><a name="Para840376"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why have the Liberals joined with the Conservatives to prevent the debate about this to even take place? I do not understand that logic. I do not understand why they could not at least have some hearings to get to the root of this structure or maybe move an amendment to fix the situation.</div>

When they have a tax treaty this significant and an issue that has been a thorn in the side of the Liberals because they broke promise after promise on it, an issue that has been politically manipulated over the years, they have chosen not to do anything on it in this bill. That is remarkable in itself. It speaks to why the ineffective Conservative caucus of southern Ontario is basically being swallowed up by the oil companies, because the petroleum club is served only by the government.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives could not even get a minor tax treaty agreement passed to protect seniors as they had promised in their campaign. This shows disinterest.

There is a serious ethical challenge with the Senate in terms of its own conflict of interest guidelines and its ability to ensure that any of its legislation has not been unduly influenced by people with pecuniary interests. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840381"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am referring to a very fascinating discussion I entered into with Mr. Jean Fournier of the Senate Ethics Office about the fact that the accountability gaps in its offices are so wide one could drive Mack trucks through. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840382"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 15.(1) of the Senate's own written accountability code says that senators can participate in debate on matters where they have financial interests, provided an oral declaration is made on the record prior to each intervention.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840383"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 15.(2) says senators can participate in debate on a matter where a family member has an interest, provided a declaration is first made orally on the record. Family members do not have to declare any kind of financial interests unless they have a direct contract with the government. Senators can sit as directors of boards of all major corporations and still participate in debates. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840384"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another fascinating loophole that senators have written for themselves. They can participate and influence any kind of financial interests as long as they declare it behind closed doors. Unless their cronies disagree, it does not have to be declared to the public. Most Canadians would find that quite shocking.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840385"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a school board trustee on a small town school board. Our conflict of interest guidelines were much more stringent. For example, it was impossible for any trustee to be part of any debate that had to do with any contract if we had any relative living anywhere in the province of Ontario involved in education, regardless of whether it was post-secondary or kindergarten. That was the standard we met as small town school board trustees. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840386"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our friends in the Senate obviously have a problem writing accountability guidelines for themselves.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840387"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the House wants me to table the letter that I am referring to, I would be more than happy to put it on the public record because people need to see that our friends in the Senate need basic remedial help in reforming themselves. They seem incapable of doing it on their own. The more light we shine on these grievous ethical lapses perhaps the better served we will be as a 21st century democracy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840388"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask my hon. colleague, does he believe that any time the Senate gives us a bill that we should give it a bit of extra scrutiny to ensure that it passes the ethical standards test? Obviously, because the ethical bar is abysmally low in the Senate, questions are raised.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when we apply what has happened in this particular case to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3079399,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3079399&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-2</A> and the rhetoric of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> on wanting to actually reform the Senate, it does not match up. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840393"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can have his tirades here in the House all he wants about the Senate, but it does not really apply to actual practical work taking place here. What is really frustrating about this is that we do not have that level of accountability that we should on this tax treaty bill. It does not matter who gets caught in the crossfire; it is just a matter of expediency to get this off the table and to move it forward. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840394"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what is really unacceptable. We have a small group of citizens in particular who are really getting hammered by this not addressing the social security issue and the double taxation, and sending them to some arbitration system. Many Canadians out there are thinking that it is great. They get to go to some government arbitrations to fight for something that should have been fixed for them. That is actually terrible. On top of that is the fact that these are seniors. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840395"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives are going to create a whole new system. It is ironic. They are creating a whole new system as opposed to just fixing a simple problem. Why are they doing it? Their motivation is hard to believe. We know the bill is going to cost around $500 million in three years. That is the estimate from the department. We know that to fix a simple problem for seniors would cost $60 million but the government refuses. I do not understand that logic.</div>

    </p><a name="Para840420"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A>, quite frankly, fixes a problem incurred with voting. To provide a bit of context and a brief history of the reason for Bill C-18 coming before the House, it was because the House originally passed Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> which basically dealt with voter identification. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840421"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intent of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> was so that individuals who wished to cast ballots in federal elections would be required to produce identification showing their name and residency. This seemed to me to be a common sense provision because, as we all know, though Canadians have the right to vote, they have to be, number one, Canadian citizens and, number two, reside in the riding in which they wish to cast their ballot. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840422"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wanted to put provisions in place that required individuals to produce identification, verifying that they lived in the ridings in which they wished to cast ballots. That was the genesis of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>. However, there was a problem. Bill C-31 stated that in determining proof of residency, voters had to prove their residential addresses. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840423"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, of course, was debated in committee. The Chief Electoral Officer of Canada came before committee to analyze the bill. No one in the committee nor the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada recognized the fact that the term “residential address” or “civic address” would in fact exclude a great many Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840424"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately one million Canadians, in fact, do not have residential or civic addresses. These are primarily rural Canadians living in ridings in Canada who would normally be allowed to vote, but instead of having residential addresses have post office boxes or rural route numbers or a land description, which would be their identification of residency.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840425"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> inadvertently excluded everyone who did not have a residential address. As I said just a few moments ago, approximately one million rural Canadians were in that category. If people lived in rural Canada, whether it be Saskatchewan, Ontario, British Columbia or Quebec, and had rural route numbers or post office box numbers instead of street addresses, with the passage of Bill C-31 they would be denied their right or ability to vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840426"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This flaw in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> was first discovered in late September, early October, by the office of the Chief Electoral Officer. Following three byelections held in September in Quebec, the Chief Electoral Officer did a review of the voting practices in Quebec during those three byelections and during that examination discovered this flaw in Bill C-31 dealing with residential addresses. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840427"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately informed the government, which, in turn, immediately took corrective action and the result is what we have before us today, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A>. It very simply remedies the glitch found in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> by stating that any individual who produces proper identification and whose residency information on that identification is consistent with the information on the electoral lists will then be eligible to vote. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840428"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, to put it very clearly and graphically, if an individual has a driver's licence that says he or she resides at post office box 123 anywhere in Canada and the electoral list confirms that this individual resides at post office box 123 anywhere in Canada, or to put it another way, if the driver's licence information and the information on the electoral list are consistent, that individual can then vote and that remedied the situation. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we introduced the bill, that is why the bill is before us today and that is why we wish, as a government, to ensure the bill passes and is delivered to the Senate today. We hope then that our friends in the Senate will pass it quickly and give it royal assent before the end of this calendar year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840430"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The urgency is that there may be byelections or a general election very soon in the new year. No one knows the certainty of a general election, but we do know byelections will have to be called before the end of this month. We want to ensure that all Canadians in rural Canada, who had been disenfranchised inadvertently, are now back on the voters list, that they have the eligibility requirements correct and that they will be able to cast ballots.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840431"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know almost all parties in the House, almost all members in the House, support this legislation. The exception being some members of the New Democratic Party. I find it interesting that their opposition is not really with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A>, but with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840432"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During debate and during committee examination of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3138582,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3138582&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, the NDP primarily was concerned that many Canadians could potentially be disenfranchised because of the identification requirements contained in the bill. Specifically, the NDP was concerned because of the homeless. Many homeless people, perhaps the vast majority of them, do not possess identification. This was a legitimate concern raised by the members of the NDP. Their solution to that was quite simply that identification requirements contained in Bill C-31 should be eliminated, that people who did not possess proper identification as to proof of identity and residence should still be allowed to vote if they signed an oath or some kind of a declaration at a various polling station on voting day.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840433"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I recognize there will be some individuals in the category of the homeless or maybe other transient individuals who do not have proper identification, the committee determined in its wisdom, and I supported this decision, that the public interest was best served if individuals were required to produce identification.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840434"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it is a common sense approach. After all, if people cannot identify themselves, if they cannot prove they actually live in a particular riding, why then should they be allowed to vote? We were concerned about voter fraud. In fact, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3138582,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3138582&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> was called the voter integrity bill. It was merely intended to ensure the integrity of the voting system, so everyone who wished to vote in a particular riding across Canada would have to demonstrate they actually resided in that riding. I think that is a reasonable approach to take. Hence, Bill C-31 was passed.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A> from my colleagues in the NDP has really nothing to do with Bill C-18.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am very pleased to see Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A> before us today. I believe we will see passage of this very important bill later today. I also hope, as I mentioned a few moments ago, that our friends and colleagues in the Senate, in their wisdom, will give speedy passage to Bill C-18.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will reiterate that the bill was brought forward as a corrective measure to ensure that rural Canadians, who had been inadvertently disenfranchised by the provisions contained in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3138582,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3138582&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, were dealt with in an appropriate manner to ensure they would have the ability to vote in the next general election.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840438"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing more complicated than that. There is nothing more detailed than that. It is merely a simple bill designed to correct an inequity that occurred.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840439"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dealing with the bill in an expeditious manner, as we have, we have demonstrated that Parliament and the committee system within Parliament can work when all members determine that partisan interests should be set aside and the greater good be addressed. Even though there have been disagreements at committee, and I am sure we will still see disagreements to some extent in the debate today, at the end of the day objections will have been duly noted but the bill will pass and for good reason.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840440"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to stand in the House and say that a wrong was not corrected. We have the ability to correct, but we chose not to for whatever reasons. I believe most Canadians would vehemently disagree with that.</div>

    </p><a name="Para840443"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past several years, the federal government's way of holding elections made it practically impossible to guarantee beyond a reasonable doubt that voters were who they claimed to be. That is why we needed Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, which was passed in February 2007. I will summarize the bill because that is what gave rise to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A>. Sometimes, the government comes up with solutions to problems that have been around for decades. Sometimes there are little problems with those solutions. The problem we are trying to fix with Bill C-18 is one of the little problems caused by Bill C-31.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840444"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did we want to adopt Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, and what was its purpose? From now on, people wishing to vote in a federal election will have to show government-issued photo identification, such as a driver's license, that shows their name and home address. Voters who do not have photo identification will have to provide two acceptable pieces of identification to establish their identity and their home address. The Chief Electoral Officer is responsible for publishing a list of acceptable pieces of identification that voters can show at the polling station.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840445"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will read that list out shortly. The Chief Electoral Officer released it for the byelections that took place this fall in a number of places, including Quebec. Several types of identification may be used by individuals who do not have government-issued photo identification, such as a driver's license. As I said, voters can present two pieces of identification that appear on the published list.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840446"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potential voters who do not have two acceptable pieces of identification will be required to declare under oath that they are the person they claim to be. They must also be vouched for by a registered elector. The objective of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> was simple. It required a government-issued piece of photo ID, such as a driver's licence. Failing that, it required two pieces of ID from the list supplied by the chief electoral officer—I discussed this earlier—which was published during the byelections in Quebec this fall. If a person could not establish his identity, he had to take an oath in the presence of a person who was eligible to vote, who had a piece of ID and who knew the potential voter.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840447"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We thought this seemed appropriate and perfectly enforceable. We did not see a problem with doing things this way. Once again, I will provide the list of original pieces of identification that could be presented:</div>
    </p><a name="Para840448"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health card, social insurance number card, birth certificate, driver’s licence, Canadian passport, certificate of Indian status, certificate of Canadian citizenship or citizenship card, credit/debit card with elector name, Canadian Forces identity card, Veterans Affairs Canada health card, employee card issued by employer, old age security identification card, public transportation card, student ID card, library card, liquor identification card, Canadian Blood Services/Héma-Québec card, hospital card, fishing licence, wildlife identification card, hunting licence, firearm acquisition card/firearm possession card, outdoors card and licences, provincial/territorial identification card, Local Community Service Centre card (CLSC).</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1215"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1215"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1215">(1215)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para840449"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other original documents can also be produced, for example, a credit card statement or bank statement, a utility bill such as a residential telephone or cable television bill or an electricity, gas or water bill, a local property tax assessment, a school, college or university report card or transcript, a residential lease, a residential mortgage statement or agreement, a Canada Child Tax Benefit statement, an income statement or income tax assessment notice, an insurance policy, a government cheque or government cheque stub with the elector’s name, a T4E statement of employment insurance benefits, a Canada Pension Plan statement of contributions or old age security statement, a statement of benefits from a provincial workplace health and safety board, a statement of direct deposit for a provincial occupational injury or disability support program, a vehicle ownership or vehicle insurance card, or an attestation of residence issued by the responsible authorities such as shelters, soup kitchens, student or senior residences, long-term care facilities, aboriginal reserves or work camps. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840450"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The list of pieces of identification is very long, therefore, and a person must produce two of them if he does not have a government-issued piece of photo ID. It enables electors to find supporting documents almost anywhere, but if they still cannot, they can go to a polling station and take an oath in the presence of someone who knows the person, has met the requirements and already voted. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840451"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We thought, therefore, that we had covered everything when Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> passed. However, there was one little problem. The pieces of identification had to contain the elector’s residential address, and that was the problem. Almost all of us have addresses with a street name and number. However, there is still one situation that I myself saw when I was the mayor of a small town. It was only in the late 1990s that my town, Notre-Dame-de-la-Paix, got street names in order to have numbers. This was a requirement of the Government of Quebec, which was forcing most of the towns and small communities to have street names. It was expensive because we had to get names through the Commission de toponymie, prepare announcements, make poles and signs and so forth. That is why it had never been done. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840452"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the municipalities of Quebec all entered the modern age. However, in a few of them and in some other regions of Canada, there are still no street names. As a result, the residential address of some people is just Rural Route 1, for example, without any street number or anything because there is none. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840453"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was at the time of the byelections in Quebec, if not before, that we noticed that some electors had this kind of address. Although there were not very many, there could be a problem because they did not have a residential address in the prescribed form. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840454"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A>, which we are debating today, is simply to allow a person to vote if he or she has two pieces of identification with the same information on them, such as Rural Route 1 or Rural Route 2. The purpose of the bill is simply to take this reality in a number of communities all across Canada into account. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840455"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have some figures here. Elections Canada tells us that there are about 1,012,989 electors who do not have a residential address that meets the requirements of the Canada Elections Act as set forth in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840456"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The list of electors is compiled by the Chief Electoral Officer, who is certainly well aware that some people have always provided an address that consists of a rural route. When the census is taken, people provide addresses which indicate “rural route 1” or “rural route 2,” and the name of municipality. The chief electoral officer has reported that some 1,012,989 electors have such an address.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840457"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Nunavut, for example, 80% of residents do not have a personal address that conforms to the provisions of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> that was adopted in February 2007. In Saskatchewan, some 189,000 electors are in that position, which is 27% of all electors; a significant proportion. In Ontario, this condition affects about 150,000 electors. In Newfoundland and Labrador, it amounts to 23% of the electors. In Quebec, the number is 15,836 electors, or 0.27% of the population, who could be faced with this same problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840458"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the chief electoral officer recognized this problem, he drew it to attention of the various political parties. The purpose of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A> is to correct this anomaly. In doing so, those people who live on rural routes or who only have access to postal boxes—whose address might be “post office box 36” or “post office box 267” and the name of the municipality—which is not a residential address under the requirements of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, that is to say, including a street number and street name and the rest, may in future present to Elections Canada workers two pieces of identification that prove their address is the same as the address that appears on the list of electors.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220">(1220)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para840459"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That will finally correct the situation of those 1,012,989 electors and it will conform to the new Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840460"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is difficult to understand is the position of the other parties. I say the other parties but there is one party that is opposed to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A>, the New Democratic Party, which was also opposed to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>. The argument advanced by the NDP is that we should preserve the traditional practice where there was practically no requirement for any piece of identification. In fact, a person did not need any identification in order to vote. It was enough to make a declaration under oath. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840461"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, there have been complaints for decades. Among others, in Quebec, for a long time there has been an angry outcry over this manner of voting in federal elections. In Quebec—I am referring to the province—a bill almost identical in every detail to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> was introduced in the National Assembly in February 2007. Quebec had already decided to deal with this voting issue in order to ensure that the people who vote are the people who are entitled to vote. That is simply what it amounts to. It is a case of avoiding electoral fraud and underhanded practices. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840462"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to understand how the parties of this House did not see this. Indeed, it is possible some people might have some minor problems. We talked about homeless people. We would like to work with all parties to resolve the problem facing people with no address. This is one way of proceeding. One way of resolving this for such individuals involves having them go to vote with another eligible voter, someone who knows them and can vouch for them. We would like to work to resolve this problem, but we cannot throw away an entire system that has been established to prevent fraud, toss it all away and return to archaic voting procedures that made it nearly impossible to confirm the identity of most voters.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840463"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not tackle a specific problem that affects perhaps a few thousand voters, without returning to the previous system, which, after all, does not guarantee any security, provides many opportunities for fraud against a vast majority of voters, and focus instead on solving a problem that affects a small number of voters? </div>
    </p><a name="Para840464"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, we are resolving a problem that affects a million voters. That is a significant number. We do not understand why the NDP will not support this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840465"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> was drafted, no one, not even the legislative staff who prepared it for the government, saw the problem posed by rural addresses and post office boxes. It only became apparent in practice. At that time, a bill was introduced to resolve the problem facing people who do not have a residential address that complies with the provisions of Bill C-31.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840466"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like those citizens listening to us to realize that their address is not the issue. They all have a residential address, whether it is a post office box, rural route or other, even though they may not have a street number. In Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, for the purposes of the Election Act, the residential address had to indicate a street number with a street name, rural route, or concession for it to be recognized as a personal address. When we refer to number 2 or 200 or 2250 on a street or concession, we are speaking of a personal address. When we refer to rural route 2 or a post office box, then it is much more difficult to locate the individual. It is not a personal address. In the case of a post office box, the mail is addressed directly to the post office or to a post office box, which is not necessarily located at the property address. The purpose of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A> was to correct that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840467"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois will support this bill. We are on the eve of a federal election, which will probably take place in the spring. We do not want citizens to be denied the right to vote. When voters arrive with their identification, election workers may not allow them to vote because the address on their identification—even if the same as the address recorded on the electoral lists—would not be recognized as a personal address since it does not contain a street number. They could be refused the right to vote under the pretext that the election workers are not sure that they are who they say they are and they would be asked to swear an oath.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a problem, however, and the Chief Electoral Officer has pointed it out very clearly. It is all very well that someone who has a residential address can vouch for them. However, when someone lives in an area, such as Nunavut, where 80% of the territory has no addresses in the required format, even our neighbour cannot vouch for us, because our neighbour also cannot vote because his or her address does not meet the requirements of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840469"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a fairly significant problem for part of Quebec, where It affects 15,836 electors, but even more so, for 1,019,000 electors across Canada. That is quite a large number. We hope that this bill will pass as quickly as possible. That should be done before the end of this session, if possible, so that the Senate can give it royal assent. That will allow the bill to come into force for the next federal election, which, as I was saying, will not be called much later than the spring budget, in my opinion. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840470"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, given that situation, there is some real urgency. Our electors should not have to face problems when they go to vote. We saw this to a very small extent, and forgive me for repeating myself, in the byelections in Quebec. As I said, those 15,000 electors throughout Quebec who were affected in the byelections held in Quebec this fall, do not amount to very many people. In a general election, however, the problem would affect a million electors, or nearly 4% of the population. That could cause a bit of anxiety in some communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840471"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We would not want things to be difficult for election workers. It is already not easy to find election workers. They are often people who are donating their time. Although the government may view the remuneration as generous, when we look at the number of hours they spend getting training and working on election day, the money the Chief Electoral Officer pays does not amount to a lot. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840472"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As well, if the voters are putting additional pressure on the election workers because they are unhappy that their address, the one they have always had and use every day, does not let them vote because it does not comply with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, their wrath is going to be directed at the entire voting system and the entire electoral system, but in particular the election workers. Those workers do not deserve to have problems with electors who might—quite justifiably—complain. They have all their pieces of identification and their bills. We heard the list that I read out earlier. They have always received their hydro bills, their public utility bills or whatever at that address. But when an elector goes to the polling station, they are told that they do not have a individual street number, no personal address, and that, therefore, they have to find some other way of proving that they are in fact the right person. Everyone understands the issue and can probably imagine what this will look like on the ground. I would not want election workers to be put into this situation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840473"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, I hope that all the parties, including the NDP, will appreciate the urgency, given that a federal election could be triggered as soon as the next budget is brought down. We need to act fast and call on Parliament to pass this bill by the end of the session, so that the Senate can give it royal assent. Then, this bill will be in effect when the next election campaign takes place. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840474"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who may be wondering whether the Chief Electoral Officer will have enough time to act, I say that there will be no problem, because the addresses are already on the voters lists. These addresses consist of a post office box number in a municipality or a rural route without a house number. Consequently, the Chief Electoral Officer simply has to tell election officials that when someone provides photo identification or two other pieces of identification with an address that matches the address on the voters list, the officials can assume it is the right person.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840475"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will prevent 1,019,000 voters from having problems, causing congestion at some polling stations and making scenes for election officials. I repeat, these election officials are not paid well enough for what they do. Some will say people are never paid well enough. We have to consider the number of hours they put in, all the time they spend on site. They have to arrive early, before the polls open. Now, the polls are open for 12 hours. When the polls close, they have to put in as much time as is needed, because in some places, the election results are close.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840476"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, this will not be the case in Quebec, because the Bloc Québécois is going to sweep the province. But I hope the other areas of Canada do not have to deal with close results.</div>

    </p><a name="Para840478"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He indicated that the New Democrats were opposed to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3138582,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3138582&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>. As it turns out, it was with very good reason. The bill had some serious problems and now we have Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A> in order to fix the problems in Bill C-31. Part of the solution simply does not address some of the concerns that we raised in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3138582,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3138582&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840479"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution around having the ability to have one person vouch for one potential voter is just not workable. We talked about this in the past. There are a number of homeless people who often have contact with a street worker or case worker and that person will know 10, 15, or 20 people. If those 10, 15, or 20 people have to go out and find 10, 15 or 20 individuals to vouch for them, they simply will lose their opportunity to vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840480"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent report, Miloon Kothari indicated that the Government of Canada and provincial governments keep very poor statistics on homeless people. His estimate, and many academics feel that this is grossly underrepresented, is that there are least 150,000 homeless people on the streets of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840481"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the member saying that 150,000 people in this country simply should not have the right to vote because they cannot find 150,000 people to vouch for them if they do not have appropriate ID? </div>
    </p><a name="Para840482"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue that has come up regards first nations. The member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78395,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78395&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Timmins—James Bay</A> has raised this issue. Many first nations communities are remote and rural communities. Many first nations do not have the required identification. Some band members do not have status cards. There is a long convoluted process. If they lose their status card, they have to reapply to the Department of Indian Affairs to replace it. Sometimes a band council could provide a letter to vouch for someone, but in many cases it is very difficult for people to get the required identification.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840483"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the member saying it is okay for a minimum of 150,000 people to potentially lose their right to vote? Is he saying it is okay for first nations, who only in the 1960s gained the right to vote in Canada, to be shut out from voting?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If my colleague had bothered to inform herself of the identification allowed by the Chief Electoral Officer, she would know that the list includes, among other things, an attestation of residence issued by the responsible authorities, such as shelters, soup kitchens, student or senior residences, long-term care facilities, aboriginal reserves, work camps, and so forth.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840486"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not rocket science. Out of the 150,000 people the hon. member is referring to, most have some form of documentation that they present at soup kitchens. As for the rest, I agree with her, they will need someone to vouch for them. One thing is certain, for anyone, homeless or not, living in a remote area, there are not as many polling stations as there are in Montreal, where there are thousands. If the person votes at the polling station nearest to where they usually live, there will be someone who knows them who would be more than happy to vouch for them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840487"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP wants us to go back to the way things were before, when, in order to vote, one simply had to swear their identity under oath. That was the whole point of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3138582,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3138582&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> and everything Quebec has done in the past decade or so to deal with electoral fraud. If the NDP wants to go back to the days of electoral fraud, that is up to them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should do something about the 150,000 people for whom this causes a problem. We have to have a more thorough look at how we can get them to vote. They all should have a chance to vote. The fact remains that a person without identification, whether they are homeless or not and living near a polling station, can still swear an oath in front of someone who knows them. I am sure that many people know those who stay in a certain sector, even if they are homeless.</div>

    </p><a name="Para840501"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When someone does a job badly, and it is found out that the person has done it badly, it is incumbent upon the person to fix it. I have done many different jobs over the years and I have been proud of all of them. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was a dishwasher, if the cook did not like the way I washed the dishes, they came back to me right away and I would do them again, otherwise I was not going to hold that job. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A house builder would not get away with putting up a wall wrong. The foreman would come in and determine whether the wall was built right or wrong. If it was built wrong, it would be torn down and rebuilt. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a musician, boy oh boy, musicians know what would happen if they did not satisfy the crowd on a Saturday night. They would hear about it right then and there and if they were going to keep those gigs, they had to improve.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840505"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is our job here in Ottawa? Our job is to bring forth legislation. We have to do due diligence on legislation. It is incumbent upon all of us at a certain point to check our partisan hats. We need to examine proposed legislation and bring perspectives from our regions. Each of us represents different areas of the country. There are many different political and cultural points of view. We have to look at legislation and determine its efficacy, because at the end of the day, it will become the law of the land. That is our foremost job in the House, and it has to be undertaken with the utmost seriousness.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840506"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we deliver a law that has failed badly, it is incumbent upon all of us in the House to see what went wrong, to step back and see how the mistake happened in order that we can rectify it and take pride in our work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840507"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, as I said, this is becoming an increasingly dismal trade because it seems that when a mistake is made, we do not look at what went wrong. We turn it over to our spin-meisters and our wedge issue people to try to re-write history and what happened. The path to understand how the mistake was made becomes deliberately obscured. When it becomes deliberately obscured, we are doing a disservice, because our fundamental job is to represent the best interests of this country in terms of bringing forward legislation that is applicable, that is just, and that in the field will actually help our citizens.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A>, I set out with some high hopes that we would rectify the problems of a badly flawed bill, Bill<A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>. My colleagues from the Bloc say that Bill C-31 was brought in to escape issues of widespread fraud. The committee examined issues of fraud because fraud is a very serious threat to the health of democracy. Fraud has to be sought out wherever it exists. It cannot be sought out with vague old wives' tales or writing on the bathroom wall. It has to be proven. It is incumbent upon the Chief Electoral Officer to hunt down any cases of fraud.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840509"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee looked at the issue of fraud and found one case which occurred in 2006. There were no cases in 2004. There were three cases in 2000. That is not to make light of electoral fraud. We trusted the Chief Electoral Officer to investigate and study any allegations out there. We came back with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, New Democrats were concerned that people would be disenfranchised. At the end of the day, regardless of what my colleagues in the Bloc say, the right to vote is an inalienable right in Canada. It is enshrined in the charter as one of our fundamental rights. We have to ensure that when people have the right to vote, they are not blocked from voting.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840511"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> came out, lo and behold, we found there were not one but two major problems with it. A million rural residents were not going to be able to vote, thanks to a lack of due diligence in the committee's work. Then there was the issue of the wearing of veils when voting. Now we have Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3083651,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3083651&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-6</A>. We have a bill that became law and within a few months we already have to have two other band-aid laws to repair the fundamental flaws in the first bill. When we look at Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A>, we have to ask ourselves whether it will fix the problem and if it will do it right.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As referred to many times, the discussion on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A>, is to fix a problem for rural residents. When anyone raises the issue of homeless people, there seems to be a fundamental balancing act. Do we worry about a few thousand homeless people in Vancouver or do we worry about a million residents in rural Canada? </div>
    </p><a name="Para840513"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, nowhere in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A> does it speak to the issue of rural residents. It speaks to an act to amend the Canada Elections Act, the verification of residents. The verification of residents is the key element that leads to the potential disenfranchisement, as the electoral officer said in one case, of a million rural Canadians, including urban Canadians, first nations Canadians and then homeless people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840514"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not to focus too much on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, but we need to know where we came from in order to know why we still have a fundamental problem. I know members of the House who were on the committee voted for it, but after questioned how this happened, that they must have missed a translation at third reading.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840515"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did not miss it. They were not interested. We spoke about it. We brought forward witnesses who said that there would be problems with the ability of people to meet the onerous requirements of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840516"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>. I am not patting myself on the back, but perhaps I was just too lazy to get the records of what everyone else said. However, I know what I said, so I will bring it up, and it is fairly straightforward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840517"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we discussed Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>, I spoke of the problems we had in the rural parts of my riding and in other communities with mailboxes and the difficulties people would have in voting. That was on the record for many people. I spoke of the issues of photo IDs and the fact that on the James Bay coast, an area I represent, up to 30% of the communities did not even have health cards.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840518"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We help them fill out the health cards. The Ontario government does not even bother to do photographs for first nations people. It sends them little trillium stickers because it is cheaper than getting photo IDs. Therefore, we had raised the issue of the problems of identification in these isolated areas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840519"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had said at that time that I would invite anybody to go into Fort Albany and ask people their addresses. People do not have street addresses and that is how they get by. We find in many of our communities, they simply do not even have the most basic registration that is being required.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840520"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were bringing forward the perspective of our regions and our constituents to bring a sense of reality to the debate. At the time, I remember it was ignored and overlooked. In fact, there was a fair amount of snickering. The old NDP was standing in the way of progress again.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840521"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will refer to evidence at committee at the time from the Nishnawbe-Aski Nation, which was ignored. Witnesses said that the voting changes to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A> were:</div>

    </p><a name="Para840524"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly now we have a situation where there is an embarrassment that the bill has failed. Therefore, we were all called together to try to fix it. The issue of fixing it is paramount, but again we have to do due diligence. How do we do due diligence? We have to bring forward witnesses. This is not stalling. This is ensuring that we do not fall into the same mistakes that were made.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840525"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process we went through with the bill was a very dismal, petty process. The Liberal whip tried to push the vote through without any witnesses. How can we go through with no witnesses when 80% of the people in Nunavut have been told they are not enfranchised to vote? Would we not think it would be incumbent upon us in the House, after having made such a colossal error, to at least have a witness who can speak to the bill and say whether or not it addresses the problem? However, no, it was a desire to get this thing done and out of the road by Christmas.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I brought forward four witnesses to speak to the bill because I felt the issue was whether the vouching system would work with what we had to address. There is no problem with the rest of the amendments to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A>. We support the need to get this thing fixed, but the issue is whether vouching, in the way it is laid out, will be a practical, realistic solution to the problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840527"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had four credible witnesses. There was a fifth witness, and I do not know where he had come from, but he was allowed to speak as well. They were given two minutes each to give their perspective on the bill. They were interrupted many times. They were cut off at the end. At the end of the day the chair basically told them they did not know what they were talking about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840528"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found that quite a shocking and sad testimony. Whether we agree with witnesses in committee or not, they come forward so they can given us a perspective and we can test their points of view. We are legislators, so when a witnesses come, whether they represent what we think is the most far out solution, our role is to test them, to ask them the fundamental questions to see if what they have brought forward to us stands the test of reason. That is how we make legislation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840529"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian Boyko, from the Canadian Federation of Students, came forward. In his testimony, he said that to have only two minutes to address the problems with the bill and the vouching for ten of thousands of students who would be disenfranchised, he could not even begin to do it. He said that he would take questions, but nobody asked him a one.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840530"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have never seen anything like this. I have never seen such a lack of interest. The head of the Canadian Federal of Students came to a committee and stated that tens of thousands of university students would be ineligible to vote because Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A> would not address the issues they faced and nobody asked questions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840531"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a funny situation when we sit in our committee and talk about encouraging young people to vote and how we can find ways to do that. Yet when they came to speak to us, nobody even had a question for them. They wanted it through.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840532"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another astounding statement was from Jim Quail from the British Columbia Public Interest Advocacy Centre. He said that even if the changes went in, the changes that will address some of the issues we face, 700,000 urban residents would still not possibly meet the test. This is based on what the electoral officer had provided previously, and this does not include the other million people. That is based on 5% who would not meet those requirements because they have moved or whatever.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840533"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard in our committee on a previous bill that 12% to 15% of the voters in Australia now voted by declaration because of the continual movement in urban areas of people moving in and out or people who do not know anyone. Anyone who has an urban riding is well used to this. Even in the urban part of some of my communities, when I go into a neighbourhood six months after an election, it is almost like a completely different group of people in there. Sometimes I wonder if I am walking down the wrong street. However, a major mobility is happening across the western world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840534"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Australia has identified that 15% of the people now vote by declaration. In declaration voting they swear and oath. There is no way to get them on the voters list. We do not have the old style days when we went out and updated the voting list so we ensured people were on there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840535"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when we have the voting list, it is not up to date. Some people have tried to do a mail-out and have received calls from people, cranky as all heck, because the person no longer lives at that address or they have been divorced for years so why would a Christmas card be sent that address. We know the problems with the electoral list.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840536"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw that recently in Ontario. My wife and I went to vote and, lo and behold, she was not on the electoral list, and the house is in her name. I do not know how that happened, but people who trusts the computers that generate the Elections Canada lists put themselves in much higher hands than I would.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1255"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255">(1255)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para840537"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we see is a problem of people who go to vote and are suddenly not on the list, or people who have moved to places where they do not know people. At the end of the day, they have a right to vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840538"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jim Quail said that there would be 700,000 based on what the Elections Canada officer said. He could have been blowing smoke with these claims, but our job as legislators is to test him, question him and engage him. If we think these numbers are wrong, we have to test them. That is the only way we can bring forward legislation. Nobody was interested in what he had to say because members wanted the vote to be over.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840539"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the same pattern that happened with the previous bill. We end up in a situation where we have not done the due diligence, where we have not answered the fundamental question of whether this will work. That is what the legislation has to be able to prove. It has to prove it will work and ensure that the people, who have a right to vote, are able to vote. If we have not answered those questions satisfactorily, then we have failed in our jobs. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840540"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We certainly failed the job on Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2413948,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2413948&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-31</A>. The problem with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3091718,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3091718&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-18</A> is this. Having not answered the questions of why students will be disenfranchised, or will 700,000 urban residents be affected and how many of the 150,000 homeless people may not be able to vote, we have a serious problem. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840541"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution being offered is a one voucher system. At face value, it seems a reasonable solution to have someone vouch for another person. I do not have a problem with the concept, but when we make legislation, we have to establish laws that are applicable in the field. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840542"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They always say that the camel was a horse designed by a committee. We have had three and four hump camels coming out of our committees because there is such a distinct lack of reality between what we talk about in committee, which is the reality of politics, and what we see in the field. We are all in this business of politics, so we know what the reality is when we go to the voting booths and how the individual poll clerks identify what is acceptable and what is not.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840543"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know a man in Ontario who has lived in the same rural route his whole life. When he went to vote, he was told he was not on the list. He produced his passport and was told a passport was not an acceptable piece of identification. It would get him into Saudi Arabia, but it would not allow him to vote in Ontario. Is this part of the Ontario elections act or is this how they interpret the act? We see the problems in each of these areas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840544"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, the question is whether it works as a piece of legislation. Say I am a student who leaves Timmins—James Bay to go school at the University of Ottawa. After arriving there, I want to vote because the election is on September 15. When I go to vote, I am told I have to have a person vouch for me. What if my neighbour is not there that day or has already voted, then I have to wait on him or I cannot vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840545"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The example in a rural area is what if I know two people who moved in, but I am only allowed to vouch for one of them? Vouching, at the end of the day, is not practical so we have to go back to the issue of a declaration. Otherwise, people will continue to be disenfranchised. That is why I believe we have failed to do our job with this bill.</div>

I was at some of those committee meetings where we asked questions on whether there was voter fraud going on across the country. Elections Canada told us that there were only isolated incidents and yet that original bill was brought in to a crushing effect. Hundreds of thousands of people, including in my own community of East Vancouver, are now disenfranchised as a result of the original bill and would still be disenfranchised as a result of Bill C-18 that is before us today.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we found that there was not that much interest in addressing the issues we were raising, the fact that numerous people would not meet this new requirement and we needed to fix the problem, we ended up voting against that bill because we felt that it would come back to haunt us.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We put forward amendments to make sure that every Canadian who is eligible could vote. We put forward the idea of universal suffrage.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of those ideas that we put forward were rejected. It is our submission that we do that first before we meddle with things like putting birth dates on voter's lists and sharing them with political parties so that they can use them for their own purposes.</div>

Number one, when we bring forward legislation and we look to new laws, we have to bring forward witnesses, listen to witnesses, question witnesses on the veracity of their viewpoints, and we have to show basic respect for the fact that these witnesses have come forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840590"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to speak about Ms. Tina Bradford who is a labour lawyer who tried to speak to the committee and she got all of 11 sentences in her statement. She was told by the chair that the committee was running out of time and that was the end of it. This is about whether or not someone should be allowed to vote and she was cut off after 11 sentences. This was an embarrassment. It was like a kangaroo court.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840591"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked her in questioning because I was the only one asking questions of witnesses who had taken the time to prepare briefs and the time to study. These were people who had come from the legal profession to provide the numbskulls that were looking at this legislation with answers. I cannot say it is anything else but numbskulls. If people are not going to do their homework, if they are not going to ask questions, then how can they say that they know what they are talking about?</div>
    </p><a name="Para840592"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked her specifically about the issue of voter fraud and enfranchisement. I asked, “Is what we're suggesting in Bill C-18 workable?” She told me that from her experience with working on enfranchising voters, that it was a ridiculous provision. That was her word. She said, “I've only been able to use this vouching system on one occasion and it's a ridiculous provision. It provides nothing to people who vote”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked her again about the issue of voter fraud from her experience as a lawyer working on the street. She said, “In all my time volunteering at polling stations I've never experienced any voter fraud. What I do experience is that people are turned away voting for the first time in their lives, people who really want to vote and they are often being turned away”. That is what she gave us as testimony.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840594"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If people disagreed with it, they should have asked her questions. They should have had it on the record. To allow her 11 sentences, as a statement, shows that we simply are failing in this role in Parliament. As I said, I think it is a very dismal trade when such events are allowed to take place.</div>

I am actually delighted that we are getting it before the break because it is a bit disappointing in a way that, as the chair of rural caucus, it is an amendment that is specifically for rural Canadians and is coming so late in the game. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840596"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, I am delighted that the entire House is cooperating to ensure that this important amendment gets through, so that rural Canadians are not disenfranchised through some administrative mistake. If not, then somehow we would all have been involved in making something that would have disenfranchised a majority of the voters in the next byelection in the prairies. A majority of voters north of 60 could easily not have been able to vote if we did not make this important amendment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840597"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of other election provisions that I will speak to today, a few that should and could be made, but of course that is not the topic. The topic today is to primarily deal with these rural Canadians who otherwise could not have a vote. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840598"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we have to make these administrative amendments. These provisions are to ensure that these Canadians will again be able to vote in a coming election, which could be soon, and certainly in the event of byelections.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840599"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to reassure rural Canadians that if for some reason this did not pass, they would still be able to vote because the Chief Electoral Officer has the authority to deal with such a crisis as this and to enfranchise people through whatever mechanisms are necessary. However, that is not really the way to run a navy, it is not the best way to solve this. We in Parliament who create these laws should, when we make an error, make these amendments even if it is an administrative error and fix the law so that all Canadians have the appropriate ability to vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840600"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why during the process of this bill I, too, as some others have mentioned, have urged the committee, Elections Canada and the department drafting the bill, to ensure that homeless people could vote. There are a number of homeless people across the country and we have to ensure that there are enough people who can vouch for them, and people working in the shelters who might know of their locations. There should not be a limit on the number who can sign for these people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840601"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the best solution is to get these people out of poverty. That is why I am very excited that a few weeks ago our leader made a great announcement for a first-ever comprehensive anti-poverty strategy in Canada that would take 30% of these people off the poverty list in the next five years. It would certainly reduce the problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840602"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have other efforts related to homelessness. We have one of the most successful social programs in history, I think, the SCPI program, which everyone I think in the House has eventually championed after seeing its results. It puts these homeless people in specific good shelters for a time until we solve the ultimate problem. Of course, we should be dealing with the root problems and hopefully getting them back into proper affordable housing, and regular housing, as they again get jobs et cetera.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840603"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, until that time if they are in good shelters, we will have them with workers who can then enfranchise them and get them to vote. In particular in my area, I urge the government on this, we need a shelter for teenagers. We have one under that SCIPI program that we put in place for adults. There were none at all before that, particularly for men. We would want one for teenagers, so that we could segregate them. It would be much safer for them. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840604"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the north homelessness is also a particular issue in that we do not want people lying in the streets at 60 below. They have to go somewhere and unfortunately, they are going into places where they should not be, where they have to offer sexual favours for shelter or they are crowded in, impugning on children where they should not necessarily be crowded in. All these things could be solved and hopefully some of it will be solved with this anti-poverty strategy that we have announced.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are talking about the disenfranchisement of rural voters. I cannot imagine anyone in the House being against a provision that would ensure all rural Canadians are not stuck with this mistake. It should be fixed, so they can vote under the normal process as they did before.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840606"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am talking particularly about individuals with no street address. Those of us who live in rural areas know many people who do not have a street address. We also know that there are entire communities without street addresses. When I lived in the north I did not have a specific street address. It was R.R. #1, Site 2, Comp 3. Some people live near the highway. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840607"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provinces, territories and municipalities are trying to legislate an end to this problem because street addresses are needed for the fire department and for 911, so people can be found in an emergency. Thousands of people still do not fall into that category. That correction has not been made, and unless we amend the provisions in this bill today, they will not be able to vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840608"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Santa Claus and I visited a small community in my area on the weekend. This community is spread out along the highway and in rural bush areas where there are no addresses. Many people just have general delivery. A truck goes to the community every couple of days and drops all the mail at the post office. This legislation would not solve this problem.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my community there are many people who live out in the bush. I remember going down roads in the middle of virtually nowhere and coming upon cabins. These people do not have a particular street address. Some of them have to fly in like they do in Nunavut. All sorts of people only have access to their communities by air and not by road. This may be a surprise to a number of southern Canadians, but there are many areas where there is no road access. In these cases it would be very difficult to have a defined street address as we in southern Canada understand it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840610"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other people who could also be affected, such as first nations. I have urged in previous speeches that we make sure these people are not disenfranchised either through this bill or through further amendments to the Canada Elections Act. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840611"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many first nations are in fly-in communities or they live on reserve. They may not have the same type of street numbering system that we are traditionally accustomed to. It is important that these people are not disenfranchised.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840612"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourteen first nations live in Yukon and a number of these are traditionally nomadic. They do not stay in one area for an entire year. They move around because of the various types of game harvesting or plant harvesting they need to do during various times of the year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840613"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we take into account the nature of all Canadian lifestyles when we are developing an electoral system. This is not impossible to do. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Mongolian delegation recently visited here. The Mongolian people, unlike Canadians, have many herds, many cattle, sheep, horses and goats, but they do not have fences or private property the way we do here in Canada. When they need to rest an area for the environment, they simply move their herds over to another steppe, or another mountain, or another valley. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, they do not have specific street addresses while they are moving around. I questioned them when they were here a couple of weeks ago and they said they had no problem in coming up with solutions to enumerating all their people and making sure that they have a very high percentage of voting, I believe higher than we do. That is great for a country in that part of Asia where democracies are not prevalent, particularly with the sad situation today in Burma.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840616"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions were put in with the best intent. There are people who have come to members of Parliament with numerous examples suggesting the occurrence of fraud when identification is not available. Not very many cases could be prosecuted or taken to the final stages. Various people have alluded to many problems that would not be in the existing system if we changed the provisions so that they were similar to the provisions in a number of other countries.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840617"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think anyone in the House would be against improving the integrity of the voting system in Canada. Certainly the hallmark of our democracy is one person, one vote. That people would try to circumvent that really strikes at the heart of our democracy, but in that sense, as I urged earlier in my speech, we have to make sure that in doing this, we do not disenfranchise people. That principle must apply to everyone.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840618"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have mentioned several groups, such as the homeless, first nations people, and people in the rural areas who do not have a street address, but there are other groups in my constituency that I have mentioned in previous speeches on this bill, for example, students.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840619"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North of 60, there are no universities, so all our students make a grand migration to universities or colleges in the south. We do have excellent colleges in the north, such as Yukon College, which has some university credit courses, but many of the students in the three territories go to the south. I can say that as the northern critic. The students would be away at election time and would not be residing at their permanent street address. If for some reason they were not properly enumerated, they could fall into the trap of being disenfranchised.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840620"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds me that I wanted to speak about the enumeration lists, as I am speaking about things that need to be corrected. I am speaking now to Elections Canada. I do not imagine there is a member of Parliament here who would not suggest that there have been some disastrous situations with the present idea of the permanent enumeration list.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840621"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally I am quite supportive of a permanent enumeration list, if it is kept up to date. I am sure all members of Parliament have gone to houses in recent elections where 20 or 30 people lived in the house according to the enumeration list. After people moved from the house, they were still listed as living in the house. The list had not been updated.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840622"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my riding, there is a relatively high degree of mobility. There are all sorts of people who change their address, such as students and young people who move in and out with other people. Somehow they just do not show up on the enumeration lists and are therefore lost, or there are too many eligible voters. I am sure that accounts for part of the low degree of voting in Canada. If there are 20 people listed at one address where only three people live, that is going to show up as 17 people who did not vote. It will make it look like Canadians do not vote. Of course, they are not people who really live at the address; they are phantom residents. They have moved somewhere else and are double listed. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1355"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1355"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1355">(1355)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para840623"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage Elections Canada to modernize the enumeration lists to solve that problem. It is a good system to have a permanent list, but Elections Canada has to get a handle on who lives where so that when enumerators go door to door, the list is relatively accurate and the number of people who are enfranchised is more realistic, so we do not have to make amendments and we can spend our time debating ideas and policies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840624"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other groups that we want to ensure are not disenfranchised. One of them is not specific to the north and that is the military. It has to do with the street address requirement for people who move around. The military has a unique way of voting. As I said in previous speeches, I want to make sure that members of the military are in no way disenfranchised by the amendments to improve the integrity of the voting system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840625"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two other groups in my area. One is what we call snowbirds. A number of northerners, mostly retired people, go south for the winter, where there are lower heating costs and they can enjoy their retirement in a warmer climate. If they do not have an official street address and cannot vote, they would be unduly disenfranchised. I would urge the people in committee, in the department and in Elections Canada who are studying and improving the elections process to make sure they do not disenfranchise those people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840626"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another group is people who have to move quickly because of a medical emergency. I visited a hospital in the last election and there were people who had been brought to the hospital from out of town. Therefore, they were not in their poll and they could not vote. I want to make sure that in those cases, people can vote.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840627"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, since we are breaking for the holidays, I would like to say meilleurs voeux, seasons greetings, <i>auguri di buone feste</i>, <i>felices fiestas</i>, peace, pax, <i>paz</i>, <i>mir</i>, <i>mira poki</i>, <i>frieden</i>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840628"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please support this bill so that rural Canadians are not disenfranchised. Let us get this bill through as quickly as possible.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born in St. John, he chose the community of Dartmouth as his adopted home.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was elected to town council and in 1963 was elected mayor of Dartmouth. He is our only Jewish mayor and is widely regarded as one of the best mayors in Dartmouth's proud history.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840658"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His most significant achievement, and also the most significant in Dartmouth's development, was his leadership in the birth and growth of Burnside Industrial Park. It was his project, his success and his legacy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840659"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His post-mayoralty life continued to be one of achievement and recognition.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he lost some zeal for life after the death of his beloved Leah, he continued to be one of our most respected and beloved citizens until his death this week.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our whole community feels his loss. To his family, including my friend, his son Michael, we offer our condolences on the loss of a man whose beliefs were simple--faith, family, and community--but whose achievements were remarkable.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the press conference, the unelected minister put on a shameful display of partisanship unworthy of his position.

    </p><a name="Para840669"></a><p>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming from someone who was not elected, this contempt for the democratic process is not only unacceptable, but I think it is safe to bet that Montrealers will not soon forget it.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said: Mr. Speaker, I have been waiting for this moment for over 14 years. Those members who have been in the House frequently have heard me say, during private members' business, that I have never been drawn. That was true until now, just as I am about ready to leave the place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840948"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very honoured to have this extraordinary privilege of bringing forward a very important piece of legislation. It is especially important because it will be the last piece of legislation debated here in this fall term.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840949"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to begin by putting forward some background. I have to do this on a very personal and somewhat emotional basis because what we are dealing with here is crime. We are dealing with vicious criminal attacks against pregnant women and we are dealing specifically with addressing the issue of grief for the families who are left behind. Grief is always extremely sad.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840950"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember some five years ago when my father died. He was almost 91 and everybody said that he had a good life. However, I still distinctly remember how sad I was. He had been my dad all my life and now he was gone and it seemed so brief. There was sadness but it was somewhat softened by the fact that indeed he had had a good long life.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840951"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a couple of months ago, my wife's only brother passed away. The grief was also great there. He was a younger man. He succumbed to cancer but there had been a little warning because his fight with cancer extended about three years. As he was gradually losing this battle, people in the family were being prepared to deal with that grief. When he finally passed away on September 1 of this year, there was both relief, because he was no longer suffering, but also grief.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840952"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also had a very sad event in January of this year when my first niece passed away. The grief there was notched up from the previous two that I mentioned because Sherry died suddenly. She started her life on Friday morning, as normally as we did this morning, but she had an aneurysm and died instantly, totally unexpectedly. She was only 47. She left her loving husband, her children and the rest of the family. There was tremendous grief. I cannot express the sadness that a family goes through when dealing with such a death.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840953"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was a very bad accident this past summer in British Columbia on Canada's Highway No. 1. Some distant relatives of ours were travelling along the road and as they were going along a gravel truck came around the corner. He was going too fast for that corner. The pup trailer that he was pulling, which was also full of gravel, lost its position and rolled onto the car an instantly killed a young man in his late twenties.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840954"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an added notch to the grief there because, like my niece, the death was sudden but there was another element and that is that it was due to the truck driver's carelessness. The family is anguished. Why did the truck driver not pay attention? Why did he not drive properly? </div>
    </p><a name="Para840955"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the normal grief of the loss of a loved one but now there is also that element of grief that is added because it could have been prevented.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840956"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I mention those examples is because this bill is about helping the families of people who have been murdered, and that is a whole compounding of grief yet again. Unlike the accident, where it was somebody's negligence, the truck driver, I do not think, could ever be accused of saying that he was going to go out and kill someone today with his truck. It was an accident. It was a misjudgment. It was not planned.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1515"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1515"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1510"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1515">(1515)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para840957"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when a family experiences the murder of a loved one, we have another level of emotion and grief and that is a level of anger. Why would someone deliberately kill my loved one and take away that life so unnecessarily?</div>
    </p><a name="Para840958"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3097460,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3097460&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-484</A> deals with the death as a result of a criminal act against a pregnant mother. Now the grief for the family is compounded yet again, because not only have they suffered the maximum level of grief by having their loved one murdered, but they are also suffering the loss of that wanted and anticipated child, that nephew, niece or grandchild. In a very real sense, they are suffering and grieving a loss under the most egregious of circumstances and the loss of the unborn child. This is what my bill addresses. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840959"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will try to build a case here for support of this bill from all people, regardless of their views on other issues. I want to ensure we all know what the bill deals with. It deals specifically with the death or injury of a mother and/or her unborn child, where that mother has made the choice to have that child. It is a wanted child, an anticipated child.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840960"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can tell members from my own experience, I am getting old but my memory is still good, I remember when my wife and I were having babies. It was almost as much fun as having grandchildren. In each case, when the anticipated birth was there, everyone got excited. This is very personal, but my wife used to invite me to put my hand on her abdomen to feel the movement of that baby. I think we have all experienced that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840961"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When that is happening, both the mother and the father, and other members of the family, especially little brothers or sisters, are building an emotional attachment to a wanted child. They are anticipating its birth and welcoming it into the family. My bill deals specifically with when that desire, that decision is taken away from that family, from that mother against her will, against her choice, not of her choosing, without her consent and, in this bill, always in a criminal way, because charges will only be laid if the individual was committing an act of crime against the child's mother.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840962"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very specific, focused bill. It deals with no other issues. It deals with this issue, the unborn victim of a crime.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840963"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to give a few examples. One of the most well-known cases for this happened in the United States when Laci and Conner Peterson were killed in California. California is a state that has had for many years an act similar to this. As a result, Scott, who was convicted of the crime, was in fact charged and convicted of two crimes. There were two offences to which he was found guilty. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840964"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another case that comes to mind was in a city that is real close to my riding. It happened in Edmonton in 2005 and it is the case of Liana White, a young pregnant mother. She was a mother because she already had a three year old daughter, Ashley. Liana was stabbed to death by her husband, Michael. He was later convicted of the crime of assault and murder of the mother but there were no charges for the death of the unborn child. At the time, Liana was four months pregnant. The family grieved over the fact that the child was not recognized.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is of Olivia Talbot in Edmonton, a tremendously sad case. She was a 19 year old girl who had some youthful troubles but she was working her way out of it and making progress. She was seven months pregnant when a childhood friend shot her. He first shot her three times in the abdomen. His target was the unborn child. He then went ahead and shot her twice in the head to make sure that she also was dead.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840966"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can members imagine the family's grief? Olivia's mother, Mary, has been and is on a crusade to this very day and probably will be for years until a bill such as this is enacted. She said that it grieved them tremendously because Olivia was seven months pregnant and they were anticipating the birth and the welcoming of the new child. The mother was, as I said, making huge progress and putting the troubles of her past behind her, and then suddenly she is brutally murdered and her unborn child with her.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840967"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am appealing to my fellow colleagues in the House of Commons to support this bill because we are dealing explicitly with cases where women have been injured or killed and their unborn children, who they wanted to bring to term and to give life, have been taken away from them. In a way, somebody else forcibly made the decision for them and the woman's choice was totally negated.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840968"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can think of another case in Surrey. I will not go into all of these in detail because it would take too long. We have the case of a 38 year old mother in Surrey who was four months pregnant. She disappeared. The police looked for her. A week or so later they found her charred body. She had been burned, killed by her husband because she was pregnant.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840969"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We just heard a very sad story recently in Toronto about the case of Aysun Sesen, a 25-year-old who was seven months pregnant. She was killed by her boyfriend. He killed her by repeatedly stabbing her in the abdomen with a knife until both she and the child were dead.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840970"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what my bill is about. It is about a woman being the victim of the most egregious crime, her own death and the death of her child.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840971"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, if I dare do this, the biggest case was in the United States, the case of Tracy Marciniak. She was only about a week or so away from the baby's due date. She was pummeled in the abdomen until her child was killed but she survived. The only charge laid against the father was assault. The life was not recognized.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840972"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am saying is that this bill, which I hope all members have read, provides for a separate offence in the death or injury of an unborn child. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840973"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to assure all members present that those issues about constitutionality and some of the things that were raised in the previous debate on this issue when my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78705,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78705&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vegreville—Wainwright</A> raised it, have all been addressed. As I said at the beginning, we threaded the needle on the wording. People who have other concerns do not need to worry. This was all done. I have had the legal opinions of a noted constitutional lawyer. I simply urge all members to support this bill because it is right.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840974"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge all members to vote on what the bill says, not on what it does not say. I urge every member of the House to take the time to read and study the four-page missive I have sent to every member of Parliament where all of those issues are addressed in detail. I thank the members for their support.</div>

    </p><a name="Para840976"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to say it was a bit difficult when I thought about some of the cases. My wife is about eight months pregnant now with our fifth child, and in thinking about the state of some of the women in these very high profile cases that we are talking about here, and anticipating a child and waiting for a child, I could not imagine if a crime like that were ever committed against her. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840977"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The context of the bill is appropriate. This is a criminal justice issue. It is an assault against women issue. I certainly commend the member.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840978"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like him to hone in on the importance of this being a bill that is in support of women. That is an important component of what we are doing here. I think all members in this House are seized with the importance of sanctions for these kinds of acts of violence against women and against unborn children as well. I wonder if the member would comment on that.</div>

    </p><a name="Para840980"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to point out that the general public understands the necessity for this kind of legislation. In a recent Environics poll it was shown that 72% of Canadians support such legislation. That is tremendously high. I would venture to say that is well above the support of any political party in this country right now. Canadians support it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840981"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a couple of other things that are amazing. Women supported it at a higher level, which is not surprising I guess, but what I found surprising is that among the youth ages up to 30, the support was up at 79%. I think that is a feather in the hat of our youth. They think about these things and they realize that this is a very important issue and one to be clearly differentiated.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840982"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to assure the member that yes, this is a very important issue. It has widespread support. Definitely, to vote for it is to vote for what is right.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that individual charged with theft or murder? In fact, the person intended to commit theft, not murder. Can my colleague respond to this question? I wanted to ask him another question, but it will have to wait until later.</div>

I urge the member to actually read the bill. It says specifically in the bill that the attacker must have intent. He must know that the woman is pregnant. He must intend to injure the child. Remember that this is a separate offence. The offence against the woman would be there in any case in terms of charges being laid. But if the attacker intends to harm the child and he knows, or ought to have known, that the woman was pregnant, then there is room for a second offence to be laid because he harmed the child. That is not available in the present law.</div>

I should point out just for the record that getting private members' bills into the House is not a question simply of merit. There is a bit of mathematical chance involved so all of us are treated fairly equally, but I am sorry the member had to wait so long to get a bill in front of us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840987"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also note that the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78705,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78705&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Vegreville—Wainwright</A> had a bill similar to this one but not identical before the House in a previous Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840988"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member opposite speaks of the grief that accompanies death or serious injury as a result of a criminal act. I have often found it difficult in the House and the justice committee to import that element of grief. It is very real for all of the victims, their families and friends and for Canadians. I often find that the analysis of our laws around here is pretty clinical and academic at times, pretty legalistic, so I thank the member for putting on the record the emotional and the grief components that accompany this area of law.</div>

One might ask why it has been a gap or why we have failed to note the protection that should be accorded to a pregnant woman and her child. We certainly afford protection to the woman. </div>
    </p><a name="Para840990"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is perhaps the long national debate over the termination of pregnancies, that whole field, that has obscured this particular piece, and I am pleased that the House now has an opportunity to deal with it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840991"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, it is important to note that this bill meticulously imports the element of mens rea, the element of intention into the bill. It makes sure that the perpetrator, in order to be charged and convicted, has to know that there is a woman who was pregnant and victimized by a criminal act. That is a very important component linking the perpetrator to the wrongdoing involved. If we were not to do that, there could be a scenario where the perpetrator of a crime might not be aware of the pregnancy, and in our criminal law we almost never convict people in law unless they know the consequence of what they are doing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840992"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a section of the Criminal Code that now partially, some will say very partially, protects the unborn child, the fetus. Section 238 makes it an offence to cause death during the act of birth, causing death to the child being born in the act of birth. That is a very narrow window of time. Of course, this bill looks well in advance of the time of birth.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840993"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am advised that according to the National Conference of State Legislatures in the U.S.A., our neighbour to the south, some 37 states have fetal homicide laws, in other words, laws that protect the unborn child, the fetus. Two of those 37 states have developed their law, not by passing laws in their legislatures, but by judicial case decisions, by judicial case law.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840994"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each state in the U.S. develops its own criminal law in this field. In Canada we do it cross-country. We have one Criminal Code. I say that to signal that Canada would not be alone in this. In fact, we are not even near the front of the pack on this, as my friend earlier pointed out.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other thing I want to mention is that the bill explicitly by its own terms does not deal with the lawful termination of a pregnancy consented to by the mother. It does not deal with that category of action, but it does very much deal with protecting an unborn child during a criminal act directed at the mother knowing that the mother is pregnant.</div>
    </p><a name="Para840996"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In layman's terms, I ask myself the question, who could reasonably deny to a child prior to birth during an assault or another criminal attack on the mother, knowing that the mother is pregnant, the protection of the Criminal Code that that child deserves? I could not deny that. It sounds so very reasonable. Admittedly the circumstances where it might occur are not going to be too common but it just takes one instance.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend has pointed out that according to some polling, 75% of Canadians agree some form of law would be appropriate. I am one of those 75%. I think my constituents would support me in that. I will be supporting this bill.</div>

I will start by saying that, as a woman, I would have never believed that I would still be here fighting for the rights of women. It has been a fierce battle, waged by so many women before me.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841006"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives, with this bill, are implicitly trying to achieve an objective, that is, restrict the right to abortion. I will explain.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841007"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this bill, the Conservatives hope to add a new offence to the Criminal Code. This bill proposes that an individual who directly or indirectly, causes the death of a child during birth or at any stage of development before birth while committing or attempting to commit an offence against the mother of the child, who the person knows or ought to know is pregnant—is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of 10 years if the person means to cause the child’s death...</div>
    </p><a name="Para841008"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, a person who assaults a pregnant woman and causes the death of the fetus could be charged with murder. As the member said, this bill would introduce a new offence. The text of the bill provides that the pregnant woman herself can be charged with causing the death of the fetus inside her. Clearly, the battle for women's rights is not yet won. The bill clearly states that in cases of a crime committed against an unborn child, a fetus, a person cannot use the defence that the child was not a human being.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841009"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gestation of the unborn child begins with conception and ends with birth. Case law has confirmed that an unborn child is not a legal person. I understand that such a clause can apply at the moment of birth, when the fetus becomes a human being. It is something else entirely to grant these rights to an unborn child, a fetus, when it is not a separate entity from its mother. </div>
    </p><a name="Para841010"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives are trying to make substantial changes to the Criminal Code's definition of a child, which is quite specific. Section 223 of the Criminal Code states that:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure you will agree that the government is making a surreptitious attempt to deprive women of their freedom of choice regarding abortion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841016"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After attacking the right to abortion by questioning the medical necessity of that procedure, the government is now attacking that right by attempting to recognize the rights of the fetus. It seems that this bill was devised to set a precedent for recognizing the fetus' right to life and thereby restrict the right to abortion and perhaps even abolish it completely.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841017"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is up to women to decide. They have their own reasons for their choices. This is a pro-life bill that is trying to hide behind the concept of the unborn child. This bill opens the door to limiting women's power to be free and to make the choices they have the right to make. </div>
    </p><a name="Para841018"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was recently reading some surveys and responses to surveys. We learned that the Conservative member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Edmonton—Sherwood Park</A>, who describes himself as pro-life, had said in response to a survey conducted by the Campaign Life Coalition for the 2006 federal election that he considered that human life began at conception. In 1997, he responded that if he was elected, he would work to remove abortion from the services covered by the Canada Health Act. He is not the first Conservative member to have said that. There are also rumours going around about a committee being formed here in the House with both Conservative and Liberal members.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841019"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous bill the Conservatives introduced was similar, but was deemed unconstitutional. A few changes have been made to it, but the objective is the same. The Conservatives' determination is an indirect threat to women's rights, and that threat is evident in the member's remarks.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1545"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1545"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1545">(1545)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para841020"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is trying to do indirectly what he would like to do directly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841021"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is happy about an abortion. It is not something anyone wishes for. But women must be able to make that choice, for any number of reasons. Women are entitled to have their decision honoured. It is a difficult decision they do not take lightly. Women fought long and hard to win the right to abortion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841022"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this bill, the Conservatives are trying, in a roundabout way, to attack those rights by making dangerous statements or by attempting to give legal personality to the fetus. They are separating the fetus from the mother and rewriting the legal definition of the child. That is what they are trying to do with this bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841023"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women have a fundamental right to interrupt a pregnancy. It is a way of exerting control over their lives and their living conditions. This bill challenges women's rights. The courts have repeatedly had to rule on the right of the fetus and the possibility of restraining the conduct of the mother in order to protect the child's right to be born. In every case, the Supreme Court has refused to invade the privacy of pregnant women and limit their right to freedom and independence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841024"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the case in <i>Tremblay v. Daigle</i>, in which a father sought an injunction to prevent the mother from having an abortion, claiming that the fetus had a right to life. The Supreme Court once again ruled that only human beings have constitutional rights and that these rights start at the time of live birth. The Court also rejected the father's claim that he had rights over the fetus as a father. The Court determined that the father could not obtain an injunction to prevent the pregnant mother from exercising her constitutional right to choose to have an abortion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841025"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all due respect to the members, the consensus in society is clear and was evident during the last election campaign. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Leader of the Conservative Party</A> himself made a commitment not to reopen the abortion debate. The measure proposed in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3097460,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3097460&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-484</A> goes against that commitment. The House will obviously have to look at this issue and women will have a decision to make come election time. It is clear that the lobbies who subscribe to moral and social conservatism are hard at work in the back rooms of Ottawa. We need to be vigilant. Putting an initial restriction on abortion opens the door to a whole series of other restrictions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841026"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the rights of the fetus, there is already a large body of case law arguing that the fetus is not a human being. I think that the mistake in this bill is to try to change the definition of a child. The law is clear on the definition of a human being.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841027"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the House not to support this bill, which opens the door to the criminalization of abortion. There is a hidden objective in this bill to prevent a woman from choosing whether or not to have a child.</div>

    </p><a name="Para841029"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having reviewed this private member's bill, and even before hearing the speech of the member who has introduced it, I came to the conclusion that there were some major concerns about it. They have lead me to indicate that I am unable to support such a bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841030"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a private member's bill and it is important to remember that. Every member has the opportunity to consider where he or she stands on the bill. However, a brief discussion among my colleagues does not lead to the conclusion that there is a great deal of support or enthusiasm for the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841031"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset, I do not doubt for a moment the sincerity of the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Edmonton—Sherwood Park</A>. I listened to his comments, which came after my having read the bill. Therefore, I was even more intent on listening to what he would say in introducing the bill, to determine whether he would dispel some of the very uncomfortable concerns I had about the possible implications of the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841032"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He devoted a considerable part of his speech in the House this afternoon to the victims of families that have lost a wanted child, the successful outcome of a pregnancy through a violent attack on a pregnant women.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841033"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think there is a single member here, regardless of where they stand on this bill, who cannot empathize 100% with the grief that such a loss would cause an individual and their loved ones. However, it has reminded me that there is a good reason why we do not turn over the drafting, or the crafting or the adoption of laws in a democratic and diverse society to people who are singled out for being grief-stricken by personal tragedy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841034"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not expect to say this until I listened to the amount of focus on the issue of grief, but I returned briefly in my own life experience to my period of time as a psychiatric social worker. Grief is a very normal human emotion, and it is something around which we comfort people and support them. However, we also know that grief is almost always accompanied by feelings of anger, despair, rage and quite often revenge.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841035"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our democratic society, we have long decided that revenge is not a proper basis for drafting or adopting our laws. A great deal of psychiatric evidence indicates that if there is a great deal of reinforcement for the notion of revenge, when someone has suffered a loss through a violent, unacceptable act, it impairs the emotional healing process.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841036"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to go further down that road, but my discomfort with the bill, before hearing the comments of the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Edmonton—Sherwood Park</A>, has been deepened and intensified by the amount of emphasis he placed on the issue of grief, anger and rage. I do not question his sincerity about identifying and empathizing with the grief, but I think it is a very questionable basis for introducing such a law.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1550"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550">(1550)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para841037"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that I also heard many comments about how this is something that women very much want and need, and he even referred to some polling. I have to say I would need to be convinced based on a great deal more information than he shared, but if he wanted to share the basis for a claim that there is a very high percentage of women who are really looking for this, I would give it my consideration.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841038"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would find it extremely surprising, because I have to say that in my almost 40 years of involvement in the women's movement, and my 28 years in public life, where it has been well known that I very much see the responsibility of myself and every other woman in public life to be responsive to women's concerns, I have never had a single woman, a single advocate, a single representative of a single organization, or an individual family member come to me and say that this is a law they would like to see implemented.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841039"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That does not mean it is not worthy of introduction and consideration, I want to say that, but to cite it as something that large numbers of women want and need, I find surprising. Maybe I am a little bit suspicious about that, when I would think that if this was something widely felt and wanted by women there might be some indication in the House and there would be a good number of women here for this debate and wanting to put forward their views. </div>
    </p><a name="Para841040"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I am a little unfair in saying this, but in regard to coming from the caucus with by far the least number of women in the House, then one wonders whether it is really an authoritative basis for the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Edmonton—Sherwood Park</A> to talk about how much women want and need this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841041"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will speak from my own personal experience. In my region of Atlantic, the government party has run 32 men for Parliament in the 32 seats in Atlantic Canada, so I am not sure about the authoritativeness of speaking on behalf of women's pressing needs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841042"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say, however, that there are a lot of things women desperately need that have been ignored by the government. Not one of them that has ever come to my attention is a call for this kind of bill. Women certainly need a lot more protection against domestic violence and violence that is visited on them in far too many communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841043"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would say that at the heart of my concern about the bill is that it does indeed arouse considerable concern, real apprehension, about whether it is in fact a thinly veiled step in the direction of recriminalizing abortion in our country. I am sure there are going to be protestations, with people saying, no, no, that was made clear, the language was made clear and all the rest of it, but let me say that it further made me uncomfortable to hear several references, both from the Conservative sponsor of the bill and from the Liberal who spoke in support of it, to a number of American states, mostly southern U.S. states, and in particular, South Carolina, as one of the states that has had considerable experience with this bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841044"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me say the evidence is very clear that the bill not only could become a thin edge of the wedge in the direction of recriminalizing abortion, but actually identified as one of the benefits of the bill is that to adopt such a bill could in fact accomplish that very objective that sponsors of the bill in South Carolina have cited as the reason for their introduction of the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841045"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many more things I could say, but I think that in the final analysis the point is that women need to be protected far more effectively and aggressively against violence, and that is the best way to protect vulnerable fetuses. If that were the objective, then we would be very much wanting to support such a bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841046"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not, however, feel persuaded. As I say, it is a private member's bill. I do not want to speak for others in my caucus, but I, for one, am very uncomfortable with where the bill is intended to go and what its real purpose is. I want to say that those concerns have already been expressed by a good many of my colleagues, so I think members have gotten the impression: I will not be supporting this private member's bill.</div>

I commend my colleague, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78339,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78339&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Edmonton—Sherwood Park</A>, who proposes the creation of new offences and penalties where an unborn child is injured or killed when an offence is committed against the mother.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841048"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the majority of the members in the House agree with the intent of my colleague's bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841049"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a personal note, his heartfelt passion to ensure that violence against women and children does not occur is very compelling. I have looked at all his notes and the bill very carefully I support 100% the intent of the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841050"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely a criminal assault that seeks to involve or harm an expected child is deserving of a sanction. However, I am not yet convinced that the private member's bill in this form is the best way to proceed without a bit of further examination. I have some concerns that the bill may reduce rather than increase the actual penalty for causing harm or death to an unborn child, and I will tell members why. </div>
    </p><a name="Para841051"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection 223(2) and section 238 of the Criminal Code currently provides some protection to the unborn child by stating that a person commits homicide by killing an unborn child in the act of birth, under certain conditions. Both offences carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841052"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Criminal Code also contains comprehensive assault and homicide offences, which apply to violent acts against pregnant women. Under the accumulated common law, resulting harm to unborn children is considered an aggravating factor for sentencing purposes and the offender is punished severely.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841053"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the code permit two charges to be laid in such cases, as proposed by Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3097460,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3097460&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-484</A>, it is likely that the two sentences would be served concurrently. Pregnancy, as an aggravating factor, could no longer be taken into account and, therefore, the end result ultimately could be a shorter sentence than is currently provided for in the law.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841054"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not believe this is the intent of this important bill, but we have to realize that it could be the result and we have to guard against that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841055"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would respectfully suggest that perhaps what is most needed is a Criminal Code amendment to allow for consecutive sentences for offences of this nature, as well as other serious personal injury offences.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841056"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last election campaign, our government proposed that sentences for multiple convictions be served consecutively. I have spoken with the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105824,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105824&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">justice minister</A> and I am confident he will introduce legislation early in the new year to address this deficiency in the law. </div>

It includes mandatory minimum penalties for firearm offences, age of protection, dangerous offenders, impaired driving and reverse onus on bail for firearm offence.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841059"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed reforms to deal with dangerous and repeat violent offenders are of particular importance to this dialogue today to address a concern that I believe needs to be looked at today in the context of this very important debate, which is violence against women and children in general.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841060"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dangerous offender proposals are designed to address concerns with respect to the ability of police, crown prosecutors and the courts to sentence and manage the threat posed to the general public by individuals who are at very high risk to reoffend sexually and violently. The victims of sexual and violent assaults are all too often women.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to go over my time and I want to make sure that I get everything that I wanted to say said. The approach our government has taken has been a step in the right direction to bring law and order to our country. We are all familiar with Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3076458,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3076458&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-2</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841065"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early last month the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',111556,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=111556&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Canadian Heritage</A> acknowledged woman abuse prevention month in Ontario. Members were talking about combating violence against women and women abuse, and these are common threads in legislation here in Parliament. In Winnipeg several projects were announced recently, one of which is to combat violence against women with intellectual disabilities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841066"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to applaud our government for its efforts to recognize and prevent violence against women. I want to particularly applaud the member for bringing this bill forward. I reiterate my support for the intent of this private member's bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841067"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do question its effectiveness in its present form in actually providing lengthier jail terms for the offence of injuring or causing the death of an unborn child while committing an assault against the mother. This type of horrendous, abhorrent crime must be addressed. Having said that, all these issues should be taken into consideration so that this bill achieves its intended objective. </div>

I was listening before to the speech by the NDP member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78793,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78793&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Halifax</A> and I agree with what she said.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841069"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Catholic priest, I find it somewhat difficult to relate to this bill quite simply because the member who tabled it belongs to a pro-life group, the Campaign Life Coalition, which, in my humble opinion, is a fairly extremist and fanatical group. I am pro-life, but I do not belong to that group.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841070"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, this bill will open the door to recriminalizing women who have an abortion, and that is not a good thing. I am against abortion, but I do not believe that is how we will deal with the problem of abortion. I have always stated that we need education, support and assistance for women dealing with unwanted pregnancy. In my opinion, the problem of abortion will be solved with these types of measures and not by recriminalizing abortion. I absolutely do not want that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para841071"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a pregnant woman is assaulted or killed and her fetus is killed at the same time, I agree completely that it is an abominable crime. It is revolting, but at the same time I believe that when the fetus is in its mother's womb, they are one being. Only when it leaves her womb does it become a child. I believe that is the Supreme Court definition of 1969.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841072"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that killing a pregnant woman, like any murder, is a serious matter. However, I believe it is dangerous to establish a new law that would treat the murder of the fetus and of the mother as a double murder. I believe that it is dangerous and that is not how we will put an end to abortion. Not in this way.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841073"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I just said, it is more through education, support, love and understanding. There are any numbers of things we can do to reduce the abortion rate in this country. As long as we fail to take control of the situation and we fail to be there to help these pregnant women, who are often facing financial difficulties or problems in their relationship, until we resolve those problems, there will always be abortions. That is what is needed, rather than—through new legislation, that is Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',3097460,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=3097460&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-484</A>—recriminalizing the murder of a pregnant woman.</div>
    </p><a name="Para841074"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also mentioned that pro-life group, Campaign Life Coalition. I know that the president of the Quebec group is Luc Gagnon. That group's journal is always full of condemnations and rejections, and there is never any love or compassion in their journal. In my view, what is needed is compassion when a woman is dealing with a pregnancy caused by rape or any unwanted pregnancy. I do not feel there is any compassion within that group. I therefore oppose that pro-life group, just I oppose the pro-choice group, whose views are, in my opinion, too exaggerated, too unrealistic. </div>
    </p><a name="Para841075"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying, I think a moderate approach is needed. It is not by creating new legislation that we will successfully reduce the number of abortions and creating new committees, if we can say—</div>
