<BLOCKQUOTE>That, notwithstanding any standing order, at the conclusion of Private

the report stage and the third reading stage of Bill C-77, an act to provide for the 
maintenance of railway operations and subsidiary services; that, for the 
purposes of this order, notice of any report stage amendments may be submitted 
to the Clerk no later than 5.00 p.m.;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That during the consideration of the aforementioned business no divisions 
may be deferred to another sitting day; that immediately after disposing of the 
third reading stage of the said bill the sitting shall be suspended to the call of the 
Chair, when it shall be reconvened for the sole purpose of a royal assent;</BLOCKQUOTE>

until the next sitting day, provided that if a royal assent has not taken place by 
9.00 a.m. on March 24, 1995, the House shall be reconvened for the sole 
purpose of being adjourned until 10.00 a.m. on that day.</BLOCKQUOTE>

to make it clear that in view of the changes made by the 
government to the legislation in committee last night in 
response to suggestions I made during question period 
yesterday, the NDP would like to go on record as giving 
unanimous consent this morning to the request by the 
government.

<P>

face-saving, but this is not a point of order.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Madam Speaker, I will try something else 
which might be more acceptable to members of the House. If 
they do not wish to sit late tonight to deal with the bill, I am 
going to seek now by way of a motion that we deal with the bill 
tomorrow. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, notwithstanding any standing order, the report stage and third reading 
stage of Bill C-77, an act to provide for the maintenance of railway operations

	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Madam Speaker, we have already told the 
government that we are prepared to settle this matter very 
quickly. In this case, as far as parliamentary procedure is 
concerned, if the government had the decency to consult us 
beforehand, we could talk about it. Since it did not, for the time 
being, the answer is no.

I urge the Bloc to reconsider its position.

	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Madam Speaker, I will try another technique. 
If members do not wish to deal with this bill tomorrow, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, notwithstanding any standing order, the House shall sit at 9.00 a.m. on 
March 25, 1995 and at 1.00 p.m. on March 26, 1995 for the purpose of

<P>
	The petitioners request that Parliament not amend the

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Madam

	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn, Lib.):</B> Madam

request that Parliament ensure that the present provisions of the 
Criminal Code prohibiting assisted suicide be enforced 
vigorously and that Parliament make no changes in the law 
which would sanction or allow the aiding or abetting of suicide 
or active or passive euthanasia.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have two petitions to present today pursuant to 
Standing Order 36.
<P>
	The first petition is from a number of residents in my 
constituency of Regina-Lumsden and pertains to the Criminal 
Code of Canada, section 241, which states ``everyone who 
counsels a person to commit suicide or (b) aids or abets a person 
to commit suicide, whether suicide ensues or not, is guilty of an 
indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not 
exceeding 14 years''.
<P>
	The petitioners request that Parliament not repeal or amend 
section 241 of the Criminal Code in any way and to uphold the 
Supreme Court of Canada decision of September 30, 1993 to 
disallow assisted suicide and euthanasia.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THESENATE">THE SENATE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Madam 
Speaker, my second petition is signed by a number of 
constituents as well as people from Quill Lake, Saskatoon, and 
parts of Regina, Saskatchewan. This pertains to the Senate.
<P>
	The petitioners do not believe the Senate is accountable, is not 
elected, has become the home of patronage appointments of 
Liberal and Conservative Prime Ministers and it costs the 
taxpayers about $60 million each year. They request that 
Parliament abolish this institution which they feel does not 
provide Canadians with anything.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HUMANRIGHTS">HUMAN RIGHTS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I have three petitions to present, pursuant to 
Standing Order 36. The certifiers must be very busy because 
they have just listed the pages and not the total number of 
signatories.
<P>
	The first petition says that because of the inclusion of sexual 
orientation in the Canadian Human Rights Act it will provide 
certain groups with special status, rights and privileges; and 
because these special rights and privileges would be granted 
solely on the basis of sexual behaviour; and because inclusion 
would infringe on the historic rights of Canadians such as 
freedom of religion, conscience, expression and association, the 
petitioners  call on Parliament to oppose any amendments to the 
Canadian Human Rights Act or the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms which would provide for the inclusion of the 
phrase sexual orientation.
<P>
	The signatories come basically from the Langham, Asquith 
and Saskatoon area.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INCOMETAX">INCOME TAX</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the second petition is signed by people in the 
Unity-Lloydminster area.
<P>
	The petitioners state that as citizens of Canada they wish to 
bring to the attention of the House that Canadians are already 
overburdened with taxation due to high government spending 
and that the federal government is considering high tax 
increases in the next federal budget, which of course has already 
passed.
<P>
	They pray and request that Parliament reduce government 
spending instead of increasing taxes and implement a taxpayer 
protection act to limit federal spending. Of course that part or 
the petition still applies.
<P>
	There are 24 pages of signatures on this petition.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
The third petition, Madam Speaker, is from the 
Kindersley-Luseland area in my constituency but also from 
parts of Manitoba.
<P>
	The petitioners request Parliament to consider that Robert 
Latimer was sentenced to life imprisonment for second degree 
murder with no chance of parole for 10 years. They state the law 
should be flexible and based on the individual. They further 
state his sentence is unfair and out of proportion and petition 
Parliament to grant Robert Latimer of Wilkie, Saskatchewan a 
pardon conditionally or unconditionally for his conviction of 
second degree murder in the death of Tracy Latimer, his 
daughter.

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I have five petitions to present on various subjects. The first 
petition is signed by 318 residents of the city of Calgary. I 
understand it is part of a much larger petition involving the 
signatures of 64,000 Albertans.
<P>
	It calls for changes to the Young Offenders Act. The 
petitioners want an act serious enough to deter young people 
from committing crimes and tough enough to provide real 
justice. They ask Parliament to amend the Criminal Code of 
Canada and the Young Offenders Act accordingly.

the second petition is signed by 50 residents of the city of

<P>
	The petitioners pray that Parliament ensure that the present 
provisions of the Criminal Code of Canada prohibiting assisted 
suicide be enforced vigorously and that Parliament make no 
changes in the law which would sanction or allow the aiding or 
abetting of suicide or active or passive euthanasia.

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the third petition is signed by 50 residents, principally of the city 
of Calgary.
<P>
	The petitioners call on Parliament to act quickly to amend the 
Canadian Human Rights Act to prohibit discrimination on the 
basis of sexual orientation, and to adopt all necessary measures 
to recognize the full equality of same sex relationships in 
federal law.
<P>
	I have also received a petition on the same subject matter from 
37 residents of the city of Calgary that asks that Parliament not 
extend spousal benefits to homosexuals living together as a 
couple in order to prevent further damage to our already

equality and personal freedom of all Canadian citizens and in 
order to safeguard the economy of our country.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government for failing to commission a broad 
and public inquiry with a mandate to investigate the government's failure to 
hold senior officials at the Department of National Defence accountable for 
command and control shortcomings, deteriorating morale, and decisions which 
diminished or have failed to improve Canada's defence posture.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Since today is the final 
allotted day for the supply period ending March 31, 1995, the 
House will go through the usual procedures to consider and 
dispose of the supply bill. In view of recent practices, do hon. 
members agree that the bill be distributed now?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> Madam Speaker, Canada has a glorious history 
of defence matters starting with the Boer war, the first world 
war, the second world war and Korea. Now I think the tradition 
continues in our commitment to UN obligations in several parts 
of the world.
<P>
	People have very mixed views when it comes to matters of 
defence. In the defence committee and our travels around the 
country, we had representations from groups which called for a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10863"> 10863 </A></B>
<P>
very strong or strengthened defence position. We also heard 
from others who said that there is no threat and no need for the 
armed forces, so let us do away with the defence department.
<P>
	The defence department is much like an insurance corporation 
in that we do not really want to pay the cost of its protection but 
we recognize that there comes a time when we may need it. It is 
like a fire department or a police department. It is obvious to 
anyone who thinks about it that a country that does not have the 
ability to control its boundaries, its sea approaches, its air and 
its interior territory cannot really call itself a sovereign country. 
Therefore, without question, there is a need for defence.
<P>
	The problem is that in our current fiscal constraints, Canada 
must get the very best value for each dollar that is spent on 
defence. That is really the purpose of the motion this morning.
<P>
	What I would like to do is provide an overview of happenings 
in the defence realm since the government assumed power in 
October 1993 and then deal with some of the perceived 
shortcomings that we see. I will then leave it up to my 
colleagues to expand on specific areas within that group.
<P>
	I will start with October 23 when the government was elected. 
Shortly thereafter, it fulfilled a red book promise and cancelled 
the purchase of the EH-101 helicopter. In February, it brought 
down a budget which downsized the regular forces from 74,900 
to 66,700, the reserves of 29,400 people remained at 29,400 
until 1998, and the civilian component was downsized from 
32,500 to 25,200.
<P>
	The government closed bases at Cornwallis, Chatham, 
Moncton, Calgary and Langley. It closed the Collège militaire 
royal at Saint-Jean and Royal Roads Military College in 
Victoria.
<P>
	There was an announcement of a peacekeeping school to be 
formed at Cornwallis. The government commissioned the 
special joint committee on defence and the special joint 
committee on foreign affairs. In March, the government 
renewed the commitments for the Canadian forces to remain in 
Bosnia and Croatia. It also announced that Canadians would 
provide assistance to Haiti.
<P>
	In September 1994 came the release of the Lagueux report. In 
response to queries requiring an inquiry into the incidents in 
Somalia, the minister refused, saying that the investigations to 
date had been adequate.
<P>
	Again in September, the commitments to Bosnia and Croatia 
were renewed.
<P>
	At the end of October the government received the defence 
review report. In November, Major Armstrong, the surgeon who 
was in Somalia, brought forward evidence that finally 
compelled the minister to say: ``Yes, there would be a full public 
and open inquiry into events in and surrounding the Somalia 
issue''.
<P>
	On December 1 the minister presented the defence white 
paper. Four days later in that same month the Colonel Oehring 
report was made public.
<P>
	Moving into January, the airborne videos, first and second, 
emerged. In February we saw the airborne video plus naval 
hazing videos. In that same month the minister announced the 
disbandment of the airborne regiment.
<P>
	The 1995-96 budget was introduced in February. It further 
reduced the forces, regulars to 60,000, the reserves to 23,000, 
and the civilian component to 20,000 to be achieved by 1999.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	The budget closed Chilliwack, Jericho, Calgary, Air 
Command Winnipeg, Toronto, London, Land Force Command 
St. Hubert, Moncton, and Maritime Command Halifax. It 
reduced Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake, National Defence 
Headquarters and Canadian Forces Base Bagotville. Also, the 
government announced a forthcoming study on reserves.
<P>
	In March of this year the airborne regiment was formally 
disbanded. A couple of days later the Jeffries report was made 
public.
<P>
	To return to discuss some of the issues that were forthcoming 
in the area of defence, the cancellation of the EH-101 was a 
promise made by the government and it fulfilled that promise. I 
question whether sufficient in depth study had been given to the 
prospect of what should have been done. Unquestionably, the 
search and rescue helicopters and the shipborne helicopters had 
to be replaced; they were experiencing further and further 
fatigue. Although I think they are quite safe to fly, they 
definitely need replacement.
<P>
	The cost of the EH-101 was misrepresented, initially by the 
media, but it was then picked up by the Liberal Party in its 
election campaign. The actual cost of $4.3 billion was 
transposed into the inflated cost at the end the cycle to $5.8 
billion. It was always this $5.8 billion that was quoted as 
opposed to the appropriate $4.3 billion which was the real 
figure.
<P>
	The EH-101, granted, was an expensive helicopter, but it also 
incorporated components that enabled it to interface with the 
frigates. The judgment of the defence committee and of anybody 
in the defence department has been that the frigates are basically 
severely constrained and in fact, much reduced in their usage 
unless they have a helicopter aboard.
<P>
	Whatever helicopter the government eventually decides to 
buy to replace the EH-101, it will have to be able to interface 
with a frigate. I will be watching very carefully to see what the 
final price tag on that acquisition will be.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10864"> 10864 </A></B>
<P>
	The additional thing to the EH-101 cancellation is that it 
basically did away with a whole lot of very high tech jobs. For a 
government that proposes jobs, jobs, jobs, this was an area 
where Canada had really forgone the ability to become more 
deeply involved in the high tech area.
<P>
	Of the EH-101s to be built worldwide, 10 per cent of each one 
would have been built in Canada. Of the initial buy for Canada is 
that more than half would have been built in this country. The 
benefits of that would spread from coast to coast. It seems to me 
the government may have been very short-sighted in deciding to 
do away with that helicopter without adequate study.
<P>
	In the February 1994-95 budget the government also reduced 
the size of the forces to 60,000 permanent people. This is 6,700 
below the actual minimum the review committee had 
ascertained was the required number. The review committee 
basically said that if you go below that number, you must 
identify some capability you want to give up. The government 
has not as yet recognized which capability will be forgone.
<P>
	The decision to place the Lester B. Pearson peacekeeping 
school at Cornwallis is, I think, a purely political one based on a 
promise made by the Liberal Party during the election 
campaign. The location is rather questionable as is the plant on 
the base. It is going to require a substantial upgrading of 
facilities. I believe better alternatives were available to the 
government which could have been pursued at a far better 
service to the country and also at less cost to the country.
<P>
	The formation of the special joint committee on defence and 
the special joint committee on foreign affairs was again a 
promise made by the government that was fulfilled. I commend 
the government on that.
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
	However, it is obvious to anyone that the committee on 
foreign affairs should have been given a mandate which required 
its report to be tabled at least three months prior to the tabling of 
the defence report. As it was, they ran concurrently. There was 
some consolidation of the reports, but it would have been far 
better for the defence review committee if it had been able to see 
exactly where the foreign affairs committee said Canada should 
be going before the decision was made to table the defence 
report.
<P>
	The white paper of December 1994 said that the report of the 
special joint committee played an integral role in shaping 
Canada's new defence policy. Virtually all its recommendations 
are reflected in the white paper. I would like to question this by 
pointing out those recommendations of the report which the 
government did not institute.
<P>
	First is that Canada retain enough military personnel to do the 
job Canadians expect of their military, a force of sufficient size 
to cope with eventualities that cannot be predicted.
<P>
	As I said a few moments ago, the cut from the defence 
committee's recommended absolute minimum of 66,700 was 
violated to the tune of 6,700 personnel. The question is: Does 
Canada now have sufficient forces to fulfil the recommendation 
of the report? I do not think so.
<P>
	The white paper said that the committee's recommendation 
concerning the size of the regular forces was judged to be 
inconsistent with the financial parameters within which the 
Department of National Defence must operate. Of course, 
defence was cut to $10.5 billion in 1994 dollars, which was the 
recommendation of the committee as a minimum. The white 
paper stated that cuts to the defence budget deeper than those 
envisioned by the committee would be required to meet the 
government's deficit reduction targets.
<P>
	The Reform Party is on record as recommending and insisting 
on fiscal responsibility. We do not question this. We just think 
that if the government is going to cut, it should identify where 
those cuts will take place and what effect they will have on the 
outcome.
<P>
	At the same time the government was reducing funding in 
these areas, the white paper also committed Canada to expand 
the program of exchanges and extended scope to other countries. 
It stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To this end, we will increase substantially the budget devoted to the Military 
Training Assistance Program to build up contact programs with Central and 
Eastern Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Asia, Latin 
America, and Africa.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Also the Department government will sponsor peacekeeping training at the 
Centre for military personnel from countries participating in NATO's 
Partnership for Peace and developing countries under the Military Training 
Assistance Program.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I have had personal experience with the military training 
assistance program. It is a good program. It results in people 
from other countries being exposed to Canadian standards in 
military training. However, the results of the military training 
assistance program come down to assisting the relationship 
between Canada and the other country. I saw it in Tanzania 
where as a result of Canada training Tanzanian officers there 
was a very warm feeling for Canada. That affected the relations 
between our countries dramatically. Therefore, I would 
recommend that the military training assistance program, rather 
than being in the defence budget, be in another place, preferably 
in foreign affairs.
<P>
	The defence review report recommended that headquarters 
strength be reduced by one-third, that is, from 37 to 25 and that 
personnel be reduced by 50 per cent, that is, 4,000. The white 
paper stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The command of military operations will continue to be exercised by the 
Chief of the Defence Staff-normally through a designated operational 
commander-and one layer of headquarters will be eliminated.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The intent of the defence review was to reduce the 
proliferation of headquarters across the country. The 
recommendation was that there be one joint headquarters in the 
west, one located 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10865"> 10865 </A></B>
<P>
centrally, and one in the east.  This would have enabled the 
command and control to have been effective and would have 
done away with a proliferation of unneeded headquarters staff.
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
	The defence report also recommended that National Defence 
Headquarters be studied to determine if it should be returned to 
separate military and civilian headquarters. The white paper 
says: ``The government can see no compelling reason that would 
justify reversing the civilian-military integration of National 
Defence Headquarters''. Yet in testimony, the defence 
committee heard much from many people saying that there were 
crossed lines of command. There was blurred judgment. There 
were concerns about who was really in charge.
<P>
	We did not say that NDHQ should be done away with and 
separated into Canadians forces headquarters and National 
Defence Headquarters. We said to look at it and study it. The 
government refused to do this.
<P>
	The committee recommended that the government create a 
standing joint committee of the Senate and the House of 
Commons on defence with appropriate regional representation. 
The government has been silent on this one. The aim of the game 
here was to give Parliament some ability to monitor and control 
what went on in the defence department. The government when 
in opposition was in favour of this, but apparently when in 
power it does not seem to see the need for it. I contend this 
should happen.
<P>
	We think DND's annual capital plan should be tabled with the 
new joint committee. If the government in its wisdom should 
say that a standing joint committee is not required, we think that 
capital plan should be tabled with the Standing Committee on 
National Defence and Veterans Affairs.
<P>
	We asked that the committee be informed when all capital 
products over $30 million pass defence program management 
milestones so it can examine cases it considers significant. The 
government has again been silent on this. Once again, we are 
looking for Parliament to be able to have a little more 
knowledge and control over what goes on.
<P>
	We asked that the Minister of National Defence deliver a 
comprehensive annual defence review and assessment by the 
minister. It would set out the minister's view of the global 
security environment and within it the specific challenges to 
Canadian policy and interests, issues that the minister believes 
will require parliamentary attention or a government decision 
over the coming months. This report would also be referred to 
the standing joint committee. Once again, there has been silence 
on this, although it may be the government's intention to do so. I 
would be delighted to hear that is its intention.
<P>
	We also asked for an annual debate on defence policy. This is 
vital if Canadians, the public and parliamentarians, are to be 
aware of what is going on in defence.
<P>
	Finally and perhaps most important, we said that full 
parliamentary debate should be invoked before any deployment 
of Canadian forces abroad. We now have commitment. I 
understand they are going to renew our commitment in Bosnia 
and Croatia. We have not been informed formally yet, but the 
time is getting fast to the point where it must have been made. 
We have deployed troops to Haiti and there has been no 
parliamentary debate on that. I think this is a shortcoming.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> We are having it now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> I appreciate the member's intervention. He will 
note undoubtedly this debate is prompted by the opposition, not 
by the government where it should have originated.
<P>
	The Lagueux report, while confined to a relatively narrow 
area within the defence department, revealed that there are very 
great discrepancies in the command and control over there. It 
revealed there was harassment, there was misappropriation or 
questionable use of funds, that projects were hidden or appeared 
to be unrelated. Yet the government has not seen any 
requirement to intervene, to have a look at what is going on in 
the defence department and ascertain what can be done to 
correct it.
<P>
	To conclude, without question we have to commend the 
government on doing some good things. It inherited many 
problems. There is no doubt in my mind-and I question the 
minister when he continually says he trusts his leadership, he 
trusts everything that is going on-there are obvious errors and 
problems within the Department of National Defence.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	We believe an inquiry must be called to examine and 
hopefully recommend solutions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from Saanich-Gulf 
Islands if not commend him for the motion and the debate on 
defence today. I always welcome a debate on defence, as I think 
all members of the House do. He raised a number of questions. 
He gave some credit and I thank him for it. He also raised some 
areas that are worthy of discussion and debate somewhat later 
on.
<P>
	I want to bring forward two matters in the question and 
comment period. I will try to do it as quickly as possible. I have 
to remind the hon. member that things have changed since 1990. 
He alluded to it at the end of his presentation. He recognizes it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10866"> 10866 </A></B>
<P>
	In the less than 18 months since the government has come to 
power we have had more debates in the House of Commons than 
took place in the preceding five years and in the four years 
before that. We have done more in 18 months than the previous 
government had done in nine years. I do not think that is a big 
issue because we should be debating defence. Defence is more 
of an issue today than it has been in the past.
<P>
	For the first time in recent history the government undertook 
to have a standing joint committee of the House of Commons 
and the other place look at, from the bottom up, the requirements 
of defence and what Canadians wanted their Canadian forces 
and their young men and women in uniform to do.
<P>
	I consider that was a successful debate. It was a successful 
report. The hon. member knows that as he was a very valuable 
part of it. His expertise and distinguished career in the Canadian 
forces allowed him to have an input and a credibility that were 
most valuable to the report.
<P>
	The fact that the report took place and the discussion took 
place at a very conscious level in Canada and with our allies is 
something that cannot be forgotten and cannot be minimized in 
the House. The fact that less than two months later it resulted in 
the white paper on defence is also something that should be 
noted.
<P>
	On my first point I find it very difficult to understand why the 
hon. member is complaining that the Minister of National 
Defence has not come forward with an annual report on defence 
when we have just actually come out with a white paper. Perhaps 
next year his criticism will strike home a bit more.
<P>
	On the second and more substantive point I am almost 
incredulous that the motion today condemns the government for 
failing to commission a broad and public inquiry. The Minister 
of National Defence tabled on Tuesday, two days ago, a report 
into the Somalia business, the Somalia inquiry. It is the broadest 
commission ever commissioned in the last 50 years. To my 
knowledge the last similar commission was the Mainguy 
commission which I believe goes back to 1949.
<P>
	The opposition complains that we are not having a broad and 
public inquiry. It could not be broader and it could not be more 
public. The three commissioners are outstanding Canadians. 
Not one of them is a serving member of the Canadian forces. 
They have 19 points which allows them basically the broadest of 
the broad. I find it inconsistent, untimely and somewhat 
confusing that the main motion is what is sparking the debate 
today. We will be voting on it later, I understand.
<P>
	Why did the hon. member not address this aspect in his 
presentation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> Madam Speaker, the question of debates to 
which the hon. member has referred is interesting. I recognize 
quite freely that there have been far more debates in the House 
of Commons on defence than in the previous nine years or ten 
years or twelve years, for that matter.
<P>
	The problem with the opposition parties is that the debates are 
a foregone conclusion. The decisions have already been taken. 
Yes, we are debating so we are able to say something, but we are 
not impacting or affecting the decisions that are taken. I believe 
that is not only frustrating but it is not right.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Again I recognize that the Minister of National Defence 
responded quite rapidly to the receipt of the special joint 
committee's report. That of course implies that he had 
reasonably good information as to what was coming in the 
report. That was inevitable and it was good. He did respond 
quickly. As I pointed out, though, there are many 
recommendations made within the report which he did not see 
fit to include.
<P>
	My problem is that I believe very many Canadians do not 
appreciate or conceive of the commitment that Canadian forces 
personnel make when they sign on the dotted line. They are the 
only Canadians who commit themselves to put their life on the 
line at order. The fireman, yes, he can get himself involved in a 
problem but he does it voluntarily. A policeman is the same. If 
he involves himself he does it because it is his job and because 
he personally chooses it. A serviceman does not have that 
choice. If his or her superior says ``you go there'', regardless of 
the situation that requires he or she to put themselves in they are 
required to go without question.
<P>
	Because of this commitment we owe it to our servicemen to 
provide them with the very best possible leadership and 
concern. That is my concern here. The inquiry that the hon. 
member has referred to as broad is really constrained to talking 
about the airborne deployment before, during and after. It has to 
do with the command and control that went into that. However it 
does not branch into the areas that we have talked about: the 
overall command and control in National Defence 
Headquarters. Should it be civilian? Should it be separated into 
civilian and military? Are the young officers and young 
non-commissioned members being adequately trained?
<P>
	We have reports from Colonel Oehring and from General 
Jeffries, both of whom point out that there is a shortfall in 
confidence in Canadian servicemen. They question whether 
their officers are really concerned with them or whether they are 
concerned with their own careers and they are looking up rather 
than down.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10867"> 10867 </A></B>
<P>
	We owe it to our service people to give them the very best 
leadership, command and control that we can possibly provide.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to take part in this debate this morning. I 
think this is a good opportunity to discuss all aspects of national 
defence policy.
<P>
	I notice the hon. member asked why there had been no debate 
on our future commitment in the former Yugoslavia. Quite 
frankly, we did intend to have a debate on the future of our 
commitment in the former Yugoslavia, but it does not really 
make sense to have a debate initiated by the government, since 
the opposition gives us a chance to discuss the matter today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In other words, the hon. member has berated us for not 
providing opportunity to talk about future Canadian forces 
engagements in the next few weeks. It has been our intention to 
have that dialogue with the House, but given the fact that the 
opposition has culled today with defence as the subject matter, 
the government will consider today's debate, the opposition 
motion, as an occasion for all members to express their views 
not just generally on defence policy on the Somali inquiry but 
also on the future engagements of the Canadian forces.
<P>
	I beg to differ with the hon. member. The decision to redeploy 
for a further six months has not been taken by the government 
and therefore what is said in the House today will be very useful 
for the cabinet when it makes up its mind.
<P>
	I share the concerns of my colleague, the parliamentary 
secretary, who did such a terrific job for me in the special joint 
committee and was really one of the reasons that we were able to 
meet our deadlines and get a white paper out. The whole process 
was managed very well. Members should recognize the 
contribution my parliamentary secretary made to the process.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary raised a point that the motion 
today condemning the government ``for failing to commission a 
broad and public inquiry with a mandate to investigate the 
government's failure to hold senior officials at the Department 
of National Defence accountable'', et cetera, was put on the 
Order Paper. However, the hon. member did not really address 
the subject matter.
<P>
	I was rather amused yesterday evening when I read the 
opposition motion because I wondered why on earth such a 
motion would be put down, given the fact that two days ago I 
announced a full public inquiry under part I of the Inquiries Act 
to look into all aspects of the Canadian forces deployment in 
Somalia in 1992.
<P>
	When we talk about the pre-deployment phase and the 
post-deployment phase going back to November 28, 1994, that 
is a period of almost two years when perhaps one of the most 
important missions every undertaken by the Canadian forces 
will be examined by an independent inquiry, headed by a Federal 
Court judge.
<P>
	The inquiry is not solely restricted to what was actually in the 
order in council. We made it broad. We included a clause at the 
beginning which gave the commissioners great latitude. If the 
hon. member looked at that he would know that all aspects of 
command and control as they relate to the Somalia deployment 
will be subject to the inquiry. If one is examining that particular 
deployment, one can also draw conclusions on the general state 
of command and control within the Canadian Armed Forces. I 
am sorry he did not really address the matter in detail.
<P>
	I am very grateful that he agrees with the government that the 
inquiry should have been under part I of the Inquiries Act rather 
than the National Defence Act. As I explained in my press 
conference the other day, it was our intention to have the inquiry 
under the NDA originally but we felt that we were somewhat 
constrained especially with the rules of evidence and the 
compelling of witnesses. Therefore it will be held under part I. I 
note that both opposition parties and people in the country 
generally have advocated that type of inquiry. We are providing 
the vehicle with three prominent Canadians to lead that 
discussion. We have put a time limit on it, not for any nefarious 
reason but simply to get the job done.
<P>
	We have been somewhat constrained. Judicial proceedings 
have gone on for the last year and we have been unable to 
convene the inquiry. Now the inquiry is under way and will look 
into all aspects of the deployment to Somalia. In doing its work 
it will also reflect upon the general state of command and 
control within the armed forces, the leadership, the 
effectiveness of decision making and so forth.
<P>
	It has not been an easy 18 months since I took over this 
portfolio. One thing that has troubled me as Minister of National 
Defence is how an institution such as the armed forces, which 
has an enviable and wonderful reputation that Canadians have 
admired for years and years and which has served us so well, has 
come under such negative public scrutiny.
<P>
	The hon. member opposite for Saanich-Gulf Islands is a 
former member of the Canadian forces, but I invite other 
members who have not been in the forces to come with me some 
day to defence and go through a normal day or visit a base such 
as the one I visited last Friday at Val Cartier, Quebec; I am going 
to Borden on Friday. They would see an incredible dedication.
<P>
	These men and women are prepared to serve their country. 
Contrary to what the hon. member says, when they join the 
armed forces they sign on for any conceivable duty. They know 
they may have to go to some of the world's most dangerous 
zones. They know  that the job is not simply pushing pencils. 
There is humanitarian work and work helping Canadians cope 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10868"> 10868 </A></B>
<P>
with natural disasters. At the request of a local community last 
week we sent the army to a village in Quebec to help with 
problems resulting from an avalanche.
<P>
<B>(1100 ) </B>
<P>
	The armed forces are available at any time. Domestically, it is 
available at any time to go abroad.
<P>
	Tragically last weekend a number of young people went 
missing on Lake Ontario. The Canadian Armed Forces out of 
Trenton, the search and rescue helicopters and the Hercules 
planes led the search.
<P>
	Those people who serve in the armed forces are prepared to do 
the rewarding domestic work in terms of search and rescue, 
helping communities that have problems such as the one in 
Quebec with the avalanche. They are also prepared to go to 
places like Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia and Croatia, the Golan 
Heights, Cambodia, everywhere else to serve their country's 
interests. Canada's interests are ones the United Nations 
articulates in terms of bringing peace and civility to various 
parts of the world.
<P>
	The dedication in the armed forces is second to none. I am 
amazed given the fact that we have now had about six successive 
budget cutbacks. I am glad the Minister of Finance left before 
my speech because he would not welcome some of the things I 
say. He has a tough job to do and we are solidly behind him.
<P>
	The armed forces has had to go through about six successive 
budgetary cutbacks. During the 18 months we have been in 
office we have cut about $10 billion in projected and actual 
expenditures from the budget. That is tough to manage.
<P>
	There was a wage freeze on for all public employees. The 
armed forces has traditionally lagged. I find that unacceptable 
and I am trying to find ways with my colleague, the President of 
the Treasury Board, to see if we can address the compensation 
problem within national defence and within the armed forces 
without undermining the program of financial restrain of the 
government in general. We are working to do that.
<P>
	We recently put in motion a means by which privates can be 
accelerated into the corporal rank and therefore by about six 
months gain some kind of advantage in terms of getting to the 
next salary rung.
<P>
	We have a group of people who had to move around as bases 
closed and have had to serve in difficult parts of the world and 
had to do their jobs at a time of profound social change.
<P>
	In the last number of years the charter of rights has been 
enacted, the Privacy Act and human rights legislation. The 
armed forces, like all other government departments, is under 
the microscope on a daily basis.
<P>
	When we compare the Canadian Armed Forces and the way it 
is dealing with these challenges of being deployed in some of the 
world's hot spots, of having to deal with budget cuts, of having 
to be under public scrutiny with respect to changing social 
mores, and the expectation the forces must at least try to 
accommodate changing social mores, we find the Canadian 
Armed Forces is second to none.
<P>
	Take for example the very controversial issue of sexual 
preference within the armed forces. The President of the United 
States must wonder in amazement how the Canadian armed 
forces changed its policy and allowed people of various sexual 
preferences to work openly and with dignity within the 
Canadian Armed Forces and integrate this within our 
operations.
<P>
	In trying to get the United States armed forces to accept the 
same changes, he found out there was such incredible resistance 
it really has been one of the things that has helped to undermine 
his presidency in his early years. How could Canada do it and 
not the U.S.?
<P>
	I have had these discussions with my counterpart Bill Perry 
and some of the others in Europe, Malcolm Rifkind and François 
Léotard and Volker Ruer. They are amazed at the adaptability of 
the Canadian Armed Forces, the flexibility, the willingness to 
accommodate ideas and changes in very difficult circumstances.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	One of the frustrations I have had is we have had some people 
who have left the Ministry of National Defence and have not 
been happy. They have taken certain information away with 
them and they have grievances. Some would say they are 
seeking retribution. Against whom, I do not know.
<P>
	They were not employed there since this government has been 
in office. Maybe they want retribution against senior officials or 
the chief of defence staff. I do not know.
<P>
	This information is being leaked to the opposition and to the 
media. It is publicized and it gives the impression the armed 
forces is in a state of chaos. The armed forces is not in a state of 
chaos.
<P>
	I will do anything possible to walk my colleagues through the 
lives of men and women in the armed forces on a daily basis. We 
will take members of Parliament to bases. We will have brief-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10869"> 10869 </A></B>
<P>
ings. We will let them find out once and for all that the armed 
forces is in pretty good shape. There are some morale problems 
and they have surfaced in certain memoranda. They have to do 
with financial restraint, with budget cutbacks, with the changing 
role of defence in the post cold war era and adapting to changing 
social mores.
<P>
	There will always be personality differences in any 
organization. Do all the generals like each other? I hope so. I am 
sure there are rivalries. Does everybody in the House of 
Commons like each other? I am sure we all do, although from 
time to time we may have some rivalry.
<P>
	We are looking at the largest quasi-corporate organization in 
the country, an organization that at a moment's notice can 
deploy troops anywhere in the world. It can discharge its 
obligations with such quality that our allies, even our opponents 
such as the three factions in the former Yugoslavia, say 
Canadians are the best.
<P>
	Ask the Serbs, ask the Croats and ask the Muslims who are the 
best. They will say the Canadians. They do not want us to leave 
because they know we are fair, we are impartial and we are 
tough. We are professionals.
<P>
	We are that way because it is a reflection of Canadian society 
and it is also a reflection of the cumulative leadership in the 
organization over decades. It goes back to the Boer war, to the 
first world war, to the second world war. The military tradition 
in this country is rich. It is alive. It is going to continue to stay 
rich and alive even in a changing world.
<P>
	It is my job to answer the hon. member's criticisms and to 
assure Canadians the tax dollars being spent on defence are done 
so effectively and that operations are conducted properly. I will 
do that every day of the week. However, I get frustrated because 
many of the points raised are not thought through properly. They 
come from disgruntled people. They come from people with a 
lack of information, people who do not have full knowledge of 
the institution or know the full scope of the department's 
activities. These events are magnified on a daily basis.
<P>
	The chain of command as it pertains to the deployment in 
Somalia will be looked at by the inquiry. In principle I want to 
assure my colleagues in the House and all Canadians that we 
have outstanding leadership in the Canadian Armed Forces. We 
have men and women who have gone through rigorous training, 
who are well educated, who have served in many different 
theatres of conflict. These people are true professionals.
<P>
	As the Prime Minister and I have said, we have full 
confidence in the chief of defence staff, John de Chastelain. We 
have full confidence in the other members of the high command 
of the Canadian Armed Forces. We have full confidence in the 
institution. That does not mean to say the institution should not 
and cannot be changed. Sometimes there is resistance.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	After all, I am a Liberal. We look at the political perspective 
through certain lenses. The opposition has different views. That 
is what democracy is all about. It may very well be that the 
course of action the government wishes to follow will not be 
accepted by everyone within the department or within the 
forces. They are loyal Canadians and they recognize that the 
government is elected to direct the affairs of the state and they 
obviously will follow and implement the policy decisions of the 
government.
<P>
	When we disbanded the airborne, General Reay, the head of 
land forces, and General de Chastelain, chief of defence staff, 
said to me: ``You have our recommendations. You might not 
wish to follow our recommendations''. We did not. We 
disbanded the airborne They said: ``Whatever you decide, we as 
loyal members of the armed forces will implement that decision 
faithfully and honestly''. To their credit they have done that.
<P>
	General Jeffries, the brigade commander at Petawawa, and Lt. 
Col. Kenward, the former commanding officer of the airborne 
regiment, did an outstanding job in difficult circumstances when 
we made a decision for which I will not apologize and which I 
will defend from now on. They did an admirable job in 
explaining this decision to their colleagues. As the chief of 
defence staff said, the airborne had achieved much over 25 years 
and had to be disbanded with dignity. It was disbanded with 
dignity.
<P>
	We do not have a problem in the Canadian Armed Forces. Like 
all organizations, difficulties arise from time to time. I urge 
members when they stand in their place to give criticism, which 
is their due, they should also try to stand back and look at the 
reputation, the integrity, the experience Canada has had with the 
best armed forces in the world today. Let Canadians know they 
are behind the men and women who serve them so well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank the minister for his very illuminating remarks.
<P>
	Everything he said good about the performance of the 
Canadian Armed Forces I would back in spades. They are 
tremendous bunch of people. They put up with an awful lot of 
discomfort, danger and they perform superbly in very instance.
<P>
	The minister talked about this being a debate on Bosnia. 
Obviously it is not a debate on Bosnia, because that is not the 
subject that we are dealing with. We may hit it peripherally, but 
there is no opportunity here. I would also point out to the 
minister that this is March 23. Unless I remember incorrectly, 
the mandate for our commitment in Bosnia runs out on March 
31, eight days from now. Is this the time for us to debate or 
should it have been done in December or perhaps January, so 
that we could have had some impact on whether or not we are 
going to renew our commitment in Bosnia? I think this istoo late.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10870"> 10870 </A></B>
<P>
	Also, if this debate were to be on Bosnia, it should have been 
instigated by the other side.
<P>
	The airborne inquiry I think has been well laid out. The 
minister has elected to stop the inquiry proceedings as of 
November 28. In keeping with his remarks about standing by his 
decision to disband the airborne, I suggest that he should have 
extended the mandate of that inquiry to March 6, when the 
airborne was disbanded and thereby allow the inquiry to 
determine whether or not he was justified in so doing.
<P>
	Also I question whether the airborne inquiry is related to the 
forces as a whole. It will of necessity confine itself to incidents 
around the airborne itself. I question whether that is in fact 
relatable to the whole armed forces.
<P>
	The minister talked about the prevailing negative scrutiny on 
the armed forces. I very much regret that.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	As he said, I have spent many years in the forces. I think they 
do good work. It is unfortunate that they come under adverse 
publicity.
<P>
	However, in the case of Shidane Arone who was tortured and 
murdered in Somalia, this individual was under that torture and 
hollering his lungs out for the better part of six hours. I would 
say he would have been shouting for two of those hours. Where 
was the commanding officer when that was taking place? Where 
was the company commander, the platoon commander? Where 
were the senior NCOs who were allowing this to happen? They 
could not have avoided knowing that something was going on 
but they did not intervene.
<P>
	It will obviously come out in the inquiry that the leadership 
was not there. Why was it not there? It is because it had not been 
instilled somewhere else. That is the concern I have when the 
minister says that everything is great in the armed forces. I do 
not believe it is great. There are a lot of problems.
<P>
	The minister mentioned the matter of compensation for the 
forces and I laud him on that. When we have sailors on welfare 
there is something wrong in the armed forces.
<P>
	The minister, basically though, talked about the personnel in 
the forces and I support him 100 per cent on that. The problem is 
he did not address the command and control problem which is 
the one at which this motion is aimed.
<P>
	The reports from Colonel Oehring and Brigadier-General 
Jeffries point out very plainly that there is a command and 
control problem and a morale problem but the minister has not 
dealt with that. He said that anything is possible. If anything is 
possible how about commissioning an inquiry to have a look at 
the overall thing outside the Somalian inquiry. If it is good, 
congratulations, but if it is not good then let us do something 
about it because our people are in jeopardy.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> How many inquiries do you want?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands):</B> In response to the 
member's question, I would like to see two inquiries at the 
moment, one on Somalia and one on the command and control in 
the armed forces.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I would request that the 
hon. member address his questions to the previous speaker. 
Comments on the floor are not heard by the public.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to comment on 
one point. The hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands berates 
me for saying that this is not a place to debate our 
re-engagement in Bosnia and Croatia.
<P>
	I want to emphasize that although we are prepared and all is in 
motion to send people to those two countries, the final decision 
by cabinet has not been taken. He said it was not the place to 
debate that. However, he spent most of his speech not addressing 
his own motion. He talked about everything but defence policy. 
What is good for the goose is good for the gander. If he can talk 
about anything to do with defence policy then any other member 
can and that includes whether or not we should re-engage in 
Bosnia and Croatia.
<P>
	Another point is that the hon. member did not look at the text 
of the remarks I made the other day on establishing the inquiry. 
November 28, 1994 was the date chosen because that was the 
last date a member of the chain of command caused anything to 
happen with respect to the Somalia deployment. That was 
putting in train the court martial process for Captain Sox which 
was completed this week. It is why November 28, 1994 was 
chosen, because it dealt with the last action of a member of the 
chain of command.
<P>
	The inquiry will answer a lot of the concerns that Canadians 
have had with respect to the operations of the armed forces. Hon. 
members would be wise to let the commissioners do their jobs. 
They have the right to subpoena witnesses and to hear all kinds 
of evidence. At national defence we will make everything 
available to them: military police reports and all other kinds of 
investigations. Members of the forces and civil servants may be 
called on to testify. We will co-operate in every way.
<P>
	For the good of the forces and the good of the country, why 
can we not let the inquiry do its job? We will not have much 
longer to wait. I ask the hon. member, please, to consider that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to ask the minister a couple of 
questions. The motion today deals with the public inquiry.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10871"> 10871 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	That public inquiry will be centred on something that went 
wrong. As a result, the entire Canadian forces will be aimed at 
that during the course of the inquiry and that is sad for the forces 
as a whole.
<P>
	I ask the minister today if he could explain to the House in 
very brief, general terms at least some of the positive things that 
went on in Somalia. I have a whole sheaf here listing things that 
the Canadian forces and the Canadian Airborne Regiment did 
during their posting in Somalia.
<P>
	When the incident that received so much publicity happened 
in Somalia, in my opinion whether rightly or wrongly our own 
defence headquarters at the time handled it very poorly. The 
minister was not around. He was off enjoying a much more 
leisurely type of life in those days. However, he is here to see the 
end of this difficult era for the Canadian forces.
<P>
	I am glad he mentioned General Jeffries and Colonel Peter 
Kenward. They are tremendous people. The forces have done a 
great job of coming back and correcting things that were wrong. 
However, in all this there has to be something positive.
<P>
	I wonder if the minister would explain the role of the forces in 
Somalia; in schools, on roads, on helping them to build up their 
own police and their own security within their community. As he 
knows, his department has received many letters complimenting 
them on that very thing-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry. I want to 
give the minister time to respond.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> Madam Speaker, I am glad the hon. member 
raised it. He has Petawawa in his constituency and he is a very 
knowledgeable individual.
<P>
	I am sorry that time did not permit me to talk about the good 
that was achieved in our deployment to Somalia. I will leave it to 
him and to other members to talk about it. He is absolutely right. 
While there were incidents that occurred that have brought some 
cloud over the Canadian Armed Forces, let us not forget that our 
participation there was very beneficial to the United Nations' 
mission. There were a lot of accomplishments. Those 
accomplishments will be recognized by those people who 
served. We are in the process of preparing a medal for the people 
who participated in Somalia.
<P>
	Let us not judge the whole of the mission by the troubling 
incidents that occurred. They will be investigated.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, from the outset, I want to say that I will keep to the 
motion tabled by the hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands. I 
intend to support this motion so long as it meets the demands of 
the Bloc Quebecois. In this regard, I indicated my approval at 
the Minister of Defence's announcement of the establishment of 
the commission of  inquiry and I congratulate him for setting it 
up. I also congratulate him on his choice of commissioners.
<P>
	However, as I indicated to the press, I find the mandate of the 
commission relatively limited and I will explain why. We would 
clearly tend to support a request by the hon. member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands to broaden the commission of inquiry's 
mandate. However, before I go on to explain, I would mention 
that I was listening earlier to the Minister of Defence praising 
and very clearly applauding the fine actions of the Canadian 
military over the years. He expressed surprise that members of 
this House tended to frequently criticize the army and find fault 
with it without perhaps knowing much about it.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	I would like to respond to the Minister of Defence by saying 
that, unfortunately, at times, the better one knows a subject, the 
more one tends to criticize. The reason is that, like everyone 
who has spoken on this matter, I believe the armed forces have 
performed courageous feats of arms and have a reputation for 
pride and courage earned on a number of occasions.
<P>
	However, some people try to hide behind the fine reputation 
of the armed forces. In my opinion, they must be weeded out, 
like bad apples.
<P>
	For a number of months, I believed that the Minister of 
Defence really intended carrying out what we might call a purge 
at the Department of National Defence. But when I heard him 
talk this morning, I was a little less sure and was disappointed to 
see that he does not intend to take the issue any further than he 
has.
<P>
	To prove my point, I traced back the development of the 
Airborne Regiment in Petawawa since it was founded in 1968. 
From the very beginning, it has welcomed infantry soldiers from 
three other regiments. Now I will get into how military tradition 
and reputation shaped the regiment.
<P>
	Normally, it is the officers and commanding officers who 
mold a regiment to their image for a specific mission. One of the 
Airborne Regiment's first commanders was General Vernon, 
who served in the years 1975, 1977 and 1978.
<P>
	In the early 1980s, many problems were reported around the 
base at Petawawa. I regret, by the way, that the hon. member 
who represents the base did not give us any examples. In fact, 
police reports show that many brawls and fights were caused by 
members of the Airborne while they were under the influence of 
drugs or alcohol.
<P>
	I will continue reciting the regiment's evolution. The pranks 
and escapades which have occurred there from day one were 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10872"> 10872 </A></B>
<P>
never any secret. By the way, on a few occasions, they were even 
brought to the minister's attention here in the House.
<P>
	The Petawawa base is not only home to the Airborne 
Regiment, but also to other members of the military and other 
soldiers who are not necessarily part of the Airborne's second 
commando. On this base, people have been seen marching 
around carrying white supremacist flags or wearing Ku Klux 
Klan armbands and there have even been disgraceful scenes, 
skirmishes and fist fights, in the officers' mess, to the full 
knowledge of the commanding officers of this base. I found no 
evidence whatsoever that anyone of rank was ever reprimanded.
<P>
	For the sake of troop morale, it would be a little difficult for 
officers to lay blame on one soldier in particular when they 
themselves were not always innocent. As I said earlier, and I 
stress, a regiment generally is the reflection of the officers who 
command the soldiers and who train them for certain operations 
or missions.
<P>
	In light of the mission it was to undertake, the Airborne 
Regiment is an elite, overtrained regiment with superior 
physical and mental endurance.
<P>
	When we learn of incidents like those that occurred in 
Somalia-it is important to underline that some events occurred 
before the Airborne was deployed-, what I find disturbing 
about the board of inquiry set up by the minister is that these 
events will probably be overlooked, as I understood from the 
board of inquiry's terms of reference.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	The board's mandate is limited to the deployment of the 
regiment in Somalia, before departure, during the mission and 
afterwards. But the regiment did not spring up overnight. It 
evolved over the years.
<P>
	I wish to remind you that one of the individuals accused of 
misconduct in Somalia, Captain Rainville, had previously been 
responsible for an incident at the Citadelle in Quebec City, 
which had been reported by that city's municipal police. He held 
a command post in Somalia, and after he returned, there was a 
military police investigation, weapons were found at his home, 
and he was fined. When he appeared before a court-martial, the 
Citadelle incidents, which demonstrate this individual's violent 
and aggressive behaviour, were never brought up.
<P>
	I think that these things should not be forgotten. When the 
regiment was deployed in Somalia, it was under the command of 
Colonel Morneault. Again, some documents show that Colonel 
Morneault recommended that the Airborne not be sent to 
Somalia because it was not yet ready. According to Colonel 
Morneault, the regiment's training and its moral or 
psychological strength were such that it was not yet fit to 
participate in such a mission.
<P>
	What did they do for Colonel Morneault? They dismissed 
him. They went ahead and sent the regiment to Somalia. One of 
the first incidents in Somalia occurred in early January 1993. In 
January 1993, the military hierarchy was notified of leadership 
problems and of cases of misconduct within 2 Commando in 
Somalia. In particular, Major Seward, who was first fined for 
accidentally discharging his weapon and later served a written 
reprimand for promoting too aggressive action against the 
Somali.
<P>
	Curiously enough, when HQ officials tour Somalia with 
former deputy minister Fowler a month or two later, in February 
or March of 1993, no problem was found, in terms of leadership 
or misconduct. On March 4, five or six days after HQ officials 
left, the famous video of a Somali man being killed and another 
one tortured was shot.
<P>
	I have great trouble understanding that seasoned individuals 
in a position of authority, such as generals and deputy ministers, 
never realized there was something wrong with these regiments. 
It might be very difficult to admit that the very people who 
command and give our troops a sense of what is expected of 
them were unable to detect the problem, although it had been 
pointed out to them prior to their visit. The incidents occurred 
one week after their visit.
<P>
	My point is that all that the Airborne's history says is that 
every commanding officer of the regiment was a good officer. 
The minister mentioned earlier that Lieutenant-Colonel 
Kenward, recipient of the Order of Merit, was among those who 
commanded the platoon, at the very time of the unfortunate 
incidents.
<P>
	I find it strange that the commission of inquiry is limited to 
specific events and not allowed to investigate the actions of the 
officers who shaped this regiment and were followed.
<P>
	It is also unfortunate that ultimately the only ones penalized 
by the dismantling of the Airborne are the soldiers sent back to 
other regiments, while the commanding officers have been 
reassigned to headquarters here, in Ottawa, with more or less 
unspecified duties.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	This is why I support the motion tabled by the hon. member 
for Saanich-Gulf Islands. The minister should act, considering 
the many instances of spending-which could almost be 
qualified as ridiculous-within the Department of National 
Defence. Let me just give you the example of General Mike 
Vernon, the force commander in Ontario, who spent something 
like $562,000 on furniture for his office. Again, his superior 
officer covered up the whole thing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10873"> 10873 </A></B>
<P>
	We find out such things when members of the armed forces 
write to the official opposition critic for national defence issues, 
such as this corporal who wrote: ``Be careful not to confuse the 
effect and the cause. All these stories of suicide in the armed 
forces, crimes in Somalia and hazing in the Airborne Regiment 
are only the symptoms of a greater problem. The reality is that 
the Canadian Forces, and particularly the combat units, are 
demoralized''. There have been references to the poor 
leadership displayed by some commanders, etc., 2 Commando 
in Somalia, and 1 Commando.
<P>
	When, within an army which a majority of people respect as a 
whole, non-commissioned officers point out very obvious 
problems, it is because a real malaise exists. There has been a lot 
of talk about the morale of the troops. I am trying to put myself 
in the shoes of a private. Several of them told me that it is 
difficult for them to accept the fact that an officer lives in a 
house valued at $650,000, and that the minister tells me that it is 
because this officer must act as a host for foreign visitors or 
generals. But generals here in Ottawa live in smaller houses than 
the one Lieutenant General Scott Clements lives in, in 
Winnipeg. The discrepancy between the treatment of combat 
troops and that of senior officers is probably one of the major 
causes of low morale in the armed forces.
<P>
	When we consider, as the hon. member for Saanich-Gulf 
Islands pointed out, that some seamen tried to go on welfare 
because they had trouble making ends meet, and when we hear 
some officers say that you do not join the army to get rich, and 
we then look at the behaviour of senior officers and the way they 
sometimes waste money, it is easy to understand why the morale 
of the military is very difficult to maintain and why these people 
have lost all motivation. If the department will not or cannot 
clean up its act and get rid of some of its people, I do not think 
the situation can improve.
<P>
	To continue my speech, it is very often said, and the hon. 
member for Saanich-Gulf Islands and the minister mentioned 
this as well, that the Department of National Defence has 
suffered many successive budget cuts. This is followed by some 
obvious questions: How are they going to play their role? How 
are they going to get equipment? How will they be able to carry 
out their mission?
<P>
	Initially, I found these arguments persuasive, but when we 
examined the National Defence budget, the Auditor General 
pointed out several items-infrastructure management, for 
instance-where the Department of National Defence could 
easily have saved between 100 and 125 million dollars through 
better management. If we look at communications, between 325 
and 400 million dollars could have been saved on total 
procurement over a period of three years. Almost every time the 
Department of National Defence orders or draws up an estimate 
for the purchase of materiel or equipment or labour, there is 
always a cost overrun.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	Two days ago, we were talking about the CSE in the House, 
and I gave examples of estimates where the cost overrun had 
been as much as 120 per cent on equipment purchased by the 
Department of National Defence. I think the department should 
start by cleaning up its management procedures and eliminating 
certain individuals who are no longer performing as they should.
<P>
	I may add that in the Canadian Forces, there are senior 
officers and non-commissioned officers who would gladly see 
the end of the situation that exists within the forces and get rid of 
certain individuals they have identified, but not publicly, 
because it would hurt their careers. I think it is very sad that 
some people will not take this responsibility because it might 
have an impact on their careers. I would say that the Canadian 
Forces suffer from two evils that are eroding them from within. 
First, the military bureaucracy. Nearly one half of the forces are 
in their offices from 9 to 5 and must be paid a premium when 
they are on a mission. Are they still soldiers?
<P>
	Second,-and this is not flattering for politicians-the 
politicization of the Defence Staff. Because it would hurt their 
careers, they make no major decisions and will not criticize one 
of their colleagues or subordinates because that might hurt the 
individual or his or her career. When we have reached that stage, 
I think the rot is widespread, but there are still some very good 
people in the armed forces.
<P>
	A recent poll conducted nation-wide revealed that 48 per cent 
of Canadians are starting to have doubts about the quality and 
value of our armed forces, since the latest revelations 
concerning national defence. I think it is up to the government to 
improve the self-esteem of the Canadian Forces by extending 
the mandate of the commission of inquiry to cover all 
individuals who in some way have tarnished the reputation of 
the Canadian military.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for his 
contribution to this important debate. I have a question which 
really is for clarification.
<P>
	A few moments before his conclusion the hon. member talked 
about the civilianization and bureaucratization of the Canadian 
forces. It is on this issue that I want clarification. I think the hon. 
member used the expression of people working from nine to five 
and asked whether they were really members of the Canadian 
forces or whether they were really in the army. I am not sure 
what he meant by that.
<P>
	I am not sure this is what he meant, but if his suggestion is that 
there are soldiers, sailors and airmen who punch clocks from 
nine to five, I want to tell him that is not the case. I think he 
knows it is not the case. He and I shared a tent in Bosnia. It is 
very much a 24-hour a  day operation, weekends and evenings. I 
know very few members of the Canadian forces, those in 
uniform and indeed many civilians in the civil service of the 
Department of National Defence, who operate on a nine to five 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10874"> 10874 </A></B>
<P>
basis. It is very much a 24-hour a day operation, particularly for 
those in uniform.
<P>
	Therefore, I really am quite insistent on seeking clarification 
for that aspect of his presentation. Otherwise I think it was 
generally positive.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jacob:</B> Madam Speaker, I said civilianization and not 
civilization. I will explain what I meant. When I talk of 
civilianization, I mean that there are civilians working at 
National Defence, but there are also members of the military 
who work from 9 to 5. I have nothing against that.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	I would like to remind the parliamentary secretary that 
Canada's peace missions, generally brilliantly conducted, use 
less than 10 per cent of the total potential of our armed forces. 
We did indeed go to the former Yugoslavia with the 
parliamentary secretary and we saw soldiers working 24 hours a 
day. They did an excellent job, and I congratulate them on it.
<P>
	However, we must remember that, within the Canadian 
Armed Forces, there are barely 9,000 privates and more than 
32,000 corporals and sergeants. I will spare you the number of 
colonels, lieutenant colonels and generals. Only privates, 
corporals and sergeants go out in the field. These people, I grant 
you, do excellent work, and I admire them. I have been able to 
see this for myself, on site.
<P>
	What I would like to say, however, is that, when people do 
civilian work from 9 to 5, whether they push pencils or complete 
forms,-I might make an aside here to point out that the Auditor 
General said the army should remodel its administration due to 
the many forms required for a decision to be made-this is what 
I meant when I said that, when pencil pushers or 9 to 5 civil 
servants are sent on a mission, on the seas, in the air or 
elsewhere, they should be paid a bonus, because they have lost, 
if you will, all their training, since they have become clerks and 
not soldiers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened very carefully and with great interest to the 
remarks of the hon. member for Charlesbourg.
<P>
	I think I heard correctly but I ask for confirmation that he was 
speaking about overcommitment in the armed forces and about 
bureaucracy. I wanted to ask him if in the bureaucracy he was 
speaking of he included the head man in the shop, the minister.
<P>
	Does the member for Charlesbourg see the minister being 
responsible for some of the bureaucracy and some of the 
problems that are created for the armed forces? In  other words, 
does the overcommitment result from decisions taken from the 
top?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jacob:</B> Madam Speaker, I will answer the hon. member 
for Saanich-Gulf Islands, perhaps with a grin. I do not claim 
that the minister can be lumped in with the bureaucracy of the 
Canadian Armed Forces, except on a level of responsibility, 
because everyone and anyone knows that ministers are 
responsible for the decisions made in their departments. 
Regarding this issue, I would like to refer you to the Auditor 
General's 1992 report, which pointed out several administrative 
problems and bureaucratic shortcomings in his critique of the 
national defence administration.
<P>
	The Auditor General repeated the exercise in November 1994, 
pointing out several shortcomings in the Canadian army. In this 
sense, I think that the minister should be held responsible for not 
having trimmed the bureaucracy enough and fixed the 
administrative problems at National Defence, and for having 
missed out on potential savings in his last budget. Instead, he 
went full tilt in the direction of closing or reducing bases, but 
nowhere is there any evidence that he really intends to address 
the problems within the administration, which employs 
approximately 70,000 military staff with 30,000 civilian 
support staff to back them up at the Department of National 
Defence.
<P>
	When I see a member of the armed forces getting paid more to 
do the same job as a civilian, I wonder about the administration, 
or, rather, its efficiency. That is why I was saying that there are 
many problems with the administration of the Canadian Armed 
Forces and they are brought up very rarely. Very often, we hear 
members of the government say that all is well in the army, that 
there is no problem and they never criticize the army.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	In closing, I would just like to quote an English newspaper 
article on the armed forces, which was run about four or five 
months ago. The journalist said that ``armed forces know no 
master''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I thank both members who contributed to the 
debate.
<P>
	I mention one point by way of a comment to which the 
minister's presentation alluded. We are talking about 
bureaucratisation. I remind the House that in the last 10 years 
the Canadian forces have been subjected to a number of very 
dramatic changes that have been fundamental to their 
organization. I believe the hon. member for Saanich-Gulf 
Islands will agree because he and I both went through it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10875"> 10875 </A></B>
<P>
	First there was the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. 
There was the Privacy Act and there was the Canadian Human 
Rights Act. They are all great acts, but they are legislation which 
required a fundamental change in the way the Canadian forces 
did things. That caused a tremendous amount of 
bureaucratisation and reporting by military and civilian people 
up the chain of command about how changes were to be made to 
the Canadian forces and how they responded to these items. I 
underscore the sometimes traumatic experience this caused 
people whose main job was to be prepared to fight for Canada.
<P>
	I say this by way of comment. Perhaps I will include more of it 
in a general sense in my presentation later this morning.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jacob:</B> Just a short comment, Madam Speaker. There has 
indeed been much restructuring within the Canadian Forces. I 
wish to point out to the parliamentary secretary that in 
December 1994, the Auditor General and a few generals 
appeared before the supply and services committee-on which I 
sat-to talk about the awarding of certain contracts. I asked then 
Auditor General Peter Kasurak, who deals with national defence 
data, if it was conceivable that better management could save 
close to $1 billion. I asked him to give me a yes or no answer. He 
said yes.
<P>
	Therefore, I think that there are still improvements to be made 
and that is what the departments should try to do.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a real honour for me to rise to speak to the motion 
today. I state at the outset that my comments will reflect a 
contribution to the debate in a reasoned manner. We all come 
from different ideologies and perspectives on the issues and I 
believe my remarks reflect that.
<P>
	As I speak today I will be considering what I see as a lack of 
strategic planning from the government regarding its 
management and administration of the Canadian forces. The 
government perhaps has let partisan politics interfere with the 
operations of our military.
<P>
	Our national defence force is the guardian of our freedoms 
and a reflection of our values. It is being neglected by a 
government that does not appear to understand the meaning of 
an overall strategic plan for military operations in Canada and 
abroad.
<P>
	Many examples come to mind. The disbandment of the 
Canadian airborne regiment for political expediency, base 
closures, relocations and open-ended peacekeeping missions 
are stark evidence of what it means to have no plan. I will be 
referring to these examples to demonstrate my point that the 
government has an obligation to the armed forces which 
includes accountability for planning and expenditure of tax 
dollars.
<P>
	The decision to disband the airborne regiment seems to have 
been an overreaction on the part of government for politically 
expedient reasons. There is no question that the videos were 
disturbing. Many Canadians felt as I did, but I question whether 
the actions of a few individual soldiers merit the elimination of 
an entire regiment.
<P>
	The airborne had a long and distinguished history. Airborne 
soldiers served gallantly in many of the world's most troubled 
areas in military and peacekeeping capacities. This fact should 
not be overlooked. Judging the airborne on its long and valued 
service, disbandment because of the actions of a few hardly 
seems rational. To add insult to injury, I have learned that the 
soldiers serving in the airborne regiment in Somalia, who for the 
most part performed brilliantly, have not yet received their 
medals.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	A quick reaction force which the airborne represents is still 
needed in Canada. At this point the Minister of National 
Defence acknowledges but has yet to propose a replacement for 
the airborne. His lack of action leaves Canada without an 
important and necessary element to our national defence. This is 
an unacceptable situation for Canada.
<P>
	One wonders what the long awaited public inquiry will 
uncover. By disbanding the airborne perhaps the government 
hoped to avoid answering some of the more troubling questions 
that have been raised with regard to high level cover-ups 
resulting from Canadian conduct in Somalia.
<P>
	How readily will lower ranked soldiers come forward and tell 
what they know? What effect could such actions have on their 
future careers? Could they be subject to later intimidation by 
higher ranking officers?
<P>
	The decision to close down and relocate CFB Calgary to 
Edmonton is another example of where our military needs have 
not received the highest priority. Is Calgary being punished 
because it elected only reform MPs in 1993? There have been 
allusions to this very point.
<P>
	Calgary <I>Herald</I> columnist Don Braid wrote on Tuesday, 
February 28: ``Documents obtained through access to 
information show that there are no sound economic or military 
reasons for this move''. He went on to express the opinion of 
many others that closing CFB Edmonton may be less costly than 
the closure of the Calgary base.
<P>
	Cost benefit analysis would be useful to determine the 
wisdom of the decision. However without any analysis available 
I for one remain skeptical of the motive. Past experience has 
demonstrated that predicted relocation costs have proven to be 
wrong.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10876"> 10876 </A></B>
<P>
	In last year's budget the Harvey barracks which housed the 
Lord Strathcona's Horse, the Royal Canadian, was slated to 
move to Edmonton. At the time of last year's budget the defence 
minister estimated that the cost of the move would be roughly 
$23 million. He has since admitted that the cost will be nearer 
$70 million with some speculating that the final amount could 
reach $150 million.
<P>
	These high costs for the relocation of one part of the base lead 
me to wonder how much the final tally will be to relocate the 
entire base to Edmonton. The lingering impression is that of 
political expediency.
<P>
	I do not want to leave the impression that the Reform Party is 
against the reorganization of our military forces. However the 
reorganization must be done for the right reasons, namely cost 
efficiency within our forces while maintaining effective 
military capability. Strategic necessity dictates that government 
cease using the Canadian forces as the political football.
<P>
	Calgarians will accept the base closing if it can be proven that 
the $300 million cost of consolidating the bases in Edmonton 
will save money in the long run. However if no true economic 
savings results in the consolidation, Calgarians, those from my 
riding of Calgary Southeast and all other Albertans will 
remember. The national energy program disaster has not been 
forgotten in the west.
<P>
	Any base relocation should be undertaken on the basis of 
planning and efficiencies. Detailed cost analysis studies should 
be completed to determine what bases should be kept open and 
which should be closed.
<P>
	Another point is directed to our peacekeeping commitments 
around the globe. In my maiden speech in the House I spoke of 
the tragic conflict in Bosnia and the involvement of our 
Canadian soldiers in a war without end. My fear at the time was 
that the Canadian presence in Bosnia was not lessening the 
fighting but sustaining it. The aid we were providing was often 
stolen by the warring factions thus feeding the fighting that 
Canadians were trying to end. A bottomless IV bag sustaining a 
killing machine was my expression of the problem at the time. I 
still hold the same opinion today.
<P>
	Canadian soldiers remain in a war zone with no peace to keep 
nor make. We have committed a Canadian presence in the region 
for an indefinite period of time and for an indefinite 
expenditure. Our cash strapped government has yet to 
implement a long range plan for such open-ended 
commitments.
<P>
	Canada needs a clear set of guidelines for foreign 
intervention. We must continue our longstanding tradition of 
keeping peace in the world's troubled spots but after a conflict 
has been resolved. Canada's contributions to sustaining peace in 
the world's conflicts have been second to none. However, in a 
time of budgetary restraint, open ended missions costing 
staggering sums of money should be carefully reviewed.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	Since the end of World War II Canada has spent tens of 
billions of dollars on peacekeeping. Logically questions arise 
for all of us to consider. What is our role in the volatile area? 
What is the potential length of the mission? What will such 
undertakings cost?
<P>
	I do not want to leave the impression that I do not salute or 
acknowledge the valuable endeavours of our military the world 
over. However, we cannot conceivably embark on missions 
which last for decades at a time. Canadians were in Cyprus for 
30 years. Our soldiers had been keeping peace between India 
and Pakistan for 45 years. Recently more Canadians have been 
sent to Haiti.
<P>
	Members might argue all of these tours of duty are necessary. 
If that is so, how do they suggest we finance these commitments 
when we have no military plan?
<P>
	We have a responsibility to all Canadians to spend their 
money wisely. Therefore, the missions Canada undertakes must 
be planned according to cost, in those places where Canadians 
can securely and effectively keep the peace within a timeframe 
for withdrawal.
<P>
	I impress on all members that in a still dangerous world where 
governments have less and less money Canada's armed forces 
must adapt to fulfil its basic responsibilities in Canada and 
abroad. For this to happen government must manage the forces 
in a strictly professional manner, free of political manipulation.
<P>
	The government must develop new operational techniques to 
ensure the military uses its financial resources in the most 
efficient way possible. This fits into the larger context of 
strategic planning which should be incorporated into all aspects 
of military activity so that our honourable military tradition 
continues untarnished.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member for Calgary Southeast made allusion 
to the disbanding of the airborne regiment which I would like to 
comment on. The member connected the disbanding with the 
hazing videos and suggested the videos were the reason the 
regiment was dismantled.
<P>
	I cannot speak for the Minister of National Defence or his 
parliamentary secretary on this issue but it was not the hazing 
videos that led to the disbanding of airborne regiment. It was the 
killings in Somalia.
<P>
	When we look at this issue we have to remember, just as the 
member for Calgary Southeast said, that Canada's military has a 
role in sustaining peace worldwide. The image of our 
peacekeepers abroad is vital. What happened in Somalia led to a 
situation in which the airborne regiment will be forever haunted 
by that incident and would never get away from it and that 
incidents such as the hazing videos would turn up time and time 
again and bring back the memory of what happened in Somalia.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10877"> 10877 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not think the government had much choice with respect to 
the airborne, tragic as it was. What happened in Somalia 
involving the airborne is like losing a major land battle as far as 
our national image is concerned. I do not think we had much 
choice on that.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank 
the hon. member for his comments. Are the videos a mere 
coincidence?
<P>
	I have a constituent who was part of the airborne regiment. He 
has called me a number of times. He is heart sick over the events 
of the disbanding of the airborne regiment. He said to me: ``You 
cannot imagine how it feels to know that with a tradition that has 
lasted for decades, I am one of the members of the airborne 
regiment which in a sense has been dishonoured in the Canadian 
context of the military tradition. I have to live with that 
always''. It is a very unfortunate and tragic result.
<P>
<B>(1205 ) </B>
<P>
	In the year between these events and now much happened 
within the airborne regiment to clean it up. It is unfortunate that 
was not acknowledge or recognized as the decision was 
undertaken.
<P>
	I raise the issue on behalf of the constituent who was part of 
the airborne regiment and because of the military tradition for 
which Calgary is noted. I hope the Minister of National Defence, 
as he prepares another reaction force and a ready force to protect 
Canadian soil, will acknowledge the tremendous contributions 
and traditions of the airborne regiment. It is an absolute 
sacrilege that it was disbanded.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
some of the member's statements are right about the great 
history the regiment has had and there is no doubt about it.
<P>
	During the consultations we had last year from April through 
to the end of October on the defence review I suggested, as had 
other members as we talked about Canada's shrinking budgets 
or shrinking military, that it was possible to do other things. We 
do not have a huge sealift or airlift capability. We suggested that 
maybe we could use the airborne regiment to go into certain 
areas. They tell us they do not like to use that in peacekeeping 
operations.
<P>
	I asked them why we needed an airborne regiment at this time. 
If we ever need one there are a lot of people out there who are 
very capable and who would come back in and form a regiment.
<P>
	If that is the case, why do we need one?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to clarify something once again for the member. I do thank 
him for his question.
<P>
	The focus of my presentation today was on strategic military 
planning for the Canadian Armed Forces. That included 
examples of the airborne, the open ended peacekeeping 
missions and the closure of Calgary CFB. Those examples were 
drawn specifically to demonstrate the lack of and the need for 
long term strategic planning within the military.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am rising today to speak on the motion concerning the 
Department of National Defence and the problems of 
accountability in it. I want to especially thank the member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands for having raised this motion today.
<P>
	I have raised a number of issues regarding things that have 
transpired in the Department of National Defence; whether they 
were the problems that came out of the airborne's service in 
Somalia or events in Bosnia and Croatia, CFB Calgary, 
problems of command and control, general morale problems. I 
have raised all of these issues.
<P>
	To government members who have touched upon this, these 
questions have not come from opposition research. These 
questions did not come from the media. In most cases these 
stories and these concerns came to us from active military 
people of all ranks who are very concerned about what is 
occurring in the Department of National Defence.
<P>
	I want to spend my time mainly on the issue of the 
infrastructure rationalization and Calgary's role in that. In doing 
so I do not intend to dispute in any way the need for defence cuts 
and the need for government spending cuts in general. All 
parties in the House have recognized that, although the Bloc 
Quebecois is very open to defence cuts as long as not a penny of 
it is in Quebec. I do not share that view. I do not share a not in my 
backyard approach to government spending reductions.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	I am concerned in terms of infrastructure about the decision 
making process behind these cuts and specifically that 
application in the Calgary case. The base in my constituency, 
CFB Calgary, is going to be closed along with the base in 
Chilliwack. The member for Fraser Valley East is going to 
address that later. The plan is apparently to save infrastructure 
costs by centralizing and consolidating the forces in Edmonton.
<P>
	The history of defence consolidation and centralization over 
the past generation has not been efficiency or cost saving. It has 
created probably the most top heavy armed forces in the western 
world.
<P>
	In looking at the announcement of the closure of CFB 
Calgary, in the 1994 budget it was announced that eventually the 
Harvey barracks, one of the two major portions of the base, 
would be closed. The Lord Strathcona's Horse and most of the 1 
Service Battalion were to be moved to CFB Edmonton in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10878"> 10878 </A></B>
<P>
1996-97. The  regional medical depot there was to be relocated 
within the city of Calgary.
<P>
	Originally, as the member for Calgary Southeast mentioned, 
the cost for this move was estimated by DND at $23 million. Six 
months later the official cost estimates had escalated to $44 
million and sometime after that they escalated to nearly $70 
million.
<P>
	As little as a few weeks before the budget letters were going 
out from the Department of Finance assuring local taxpayers in 
Calgary the cost of the move was only $23 million. External cost 
estimates, which frankly were much more detailed and credible 
than those released by the department, placed the cost for this 
move at about $142 million.
<P>
	It is true that in the year 2005 leases for some parts of the 
Harvey barracks will begin to expire but it is also true that 
portions of this land have very favourable leases running to the 
year 2050. I have trouble believing a compromise was not 
possible. It would have compared favourably to moving men 
and equipment and constructing facilities to house them at CFB 
Edmonton.
<P>
	Let us say that we can even for a minute accept the 
department's own revised figure of $44 million and a projected 
savings of $6 million annually. Considering the time value of 
money it would take over 12 years for taxpayers to break even on 
the cost of this move. Obviously that cannot be justified as a cost 
saving.
<P>
	We have to ask what is the real motivation for the move. 
According to documents we obtained through access to 
information the primary justification was to compensate 
Edmonton for the decision to move that city's air squadrons to 
Winnipeg, which in and of itself is probably worth investigating, 
when these inconsistencies are examined on a case by case basis. 
I called for an impartial review in the case of CFB Calgary. If we 
look at these moves across the country in combination with the 
obvious leadership deficit in the department, the review is more 
imperative.
<P>
	There were 30 such changes announced alone in the 1994 
budget. My guess is that if each of these cost saving measures is 
as expensive as the changes to CFB Calgary, we will have a very 
serious problem.
<P>
	In the 1995 budget it was additionally announced that the rest 
of the base, Currie barracks, the 1st Battalion Princess Patricia's 
Canadian Light Infantry, the 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade 
Group headquarters and Signal Squadron, the 1 Field 
Ambulance, the 1 Military Police Platoon and the 1 Intelligence 
Platoon will also move from Calgary to Edmonton. Additionally 
the medical depot, which last year was to be relocated within 
Calgary, will now also be moving to Edmonton.
<P>
	In the budget there are no cost estimates available at all, not 
even the bad ones we had last year. We have since the budget 
seen media reports that say the base move will cost about $300 
million now that the government is closing the entire base. 
Other reports quote defence officials as saying they have no idea 
of what the cost will  be, that the cost analysis will not even be 
completed until later this summer.
<P>
	Again, this lack of financial information must lead to the 
conclusion that the decision was not based on cost criteria.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	One wonders whether this two stage announcement means 
that the defence minister's cuts have no focus and no strategy, or 
whether really he has a political strategy rather than a military 
strategy. We know there is something going on. The minister 
himself was quoted on March 6 in the Calgary <I>Herald</I> as saying: 
``In the long run, we were going to close Calgary anyway. We 
did not really say that last year because we did not want to upset 
people any more than we had to''.
<P>
	This is very distressing in light of the calls my office is now 
receiving, calls about expensive upgrades to the base facilities 
over the last year and even calls about ongoing work. More than 
a week after the base closure was announced these renovations 
were still proceeding. New siding was put on some of the 
buildings and the Currie barracks received new 
water-conserving toilets.
<P>
	I should mention that the minister said they had already made 
this decision a year ago. About a year ago I attended the opening 
of a brand spanking new headquarters building, the Waters 
building on the Currie barracks at CFB Calgary. Maybe that 
explains why the announcement was not made last year. It is 
pretty hard to announce the closure of a base when opening a 
brand new headquarters building on it.
<P>
	I have asked for the following minimum information on this 
decision: How much will it cost to clean up the entire base? How 
much have similar clean-ups cost in the past? I want realistic 
projections. I have asked for an accounting of all the renovations 
and improvements done over the last year. How much, in effect, 
did we pay for the minister's decision not to release his 
announcement one year ago?
<P>
	I have also asked the government for a complete breakdown of 
the costs to move equipment and personnel from CFB Calgary to 
Edmonton and for estimates for the subsequent construction that 
will be needed at CFB Edmonton. I also want to know what other 
renovations and maintenance costs are likely at CFB Edmonton 
since saving these kinds of dollars was cited as part of the reason 
for the move from Calgary.
<P>
	I also note a number of issues have not even been addressed 
yet. CFB Calgary remains the marshalling point for emergency 
operations to the province of B.C. in the event of an earthquake 
or some other catastrophe. Those kinds of problems have to be 
addressed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10879"> 10879 </A></B>
<P>
	I would point out in closing that Calgary is not a government 
town; it is a town of entrepreneurs and business people. Calgary 
will survive this loss but not without pain and regret, in 
particular, not without some regret on the loss of a valuable and 
longstanding military tradition.
<P>
	Contrary to some mythology, Calgary was not founded by the 
guns of outlaws, nor was it founded by the guns of private 
citizens enforcing their own laws. Calgary was founded by a 
police detachment of the North-West Mounted Police, then a 
paramilitary force. A year after Calgary was officially 
incorporated, the Alberta Field Force was formed at CFB 
Calgary to help provide units in the Riel rebellion. In 1900 the 
Lord Strathcona's Horse was founded to serve in the South 
African war. Since then, various regiments have trained in both 
world wars. Calgary has been one of the most popular sites for 
garrison posting.
<P>
	I end by saying that I have invited the minister to come to 
Calgary not just to meet privately with officials to discuss land 
but to meet publicly with concerned citizens from all walks of 
life on the base. He would be able to discuss this decision and to 
reveal fully to them the costs and the reasons for the decision, 
both economic and military.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to comment on what the hon. member for 
Calgary West said.
<P>
	He indicated in his remarks that the Bloc Quebecois was very 
open to defence cuts as long as there are not made in Quebec's 
back yard. I would like to tell him that for nearly 15 years, 
Quebec has been hit by every new set of defence cuts. I would 
also like to point out that a study commissioned by Canadian 
Forces General Addy at National Defence Headquarters and just 
released in December 1994 shows Quebec's distinct 
disadvantage over the past 15 years.
<P>
	Even a 20 per cent reduction in overall DND infrastructures, 
except in Quebec, would not correspond to Quebec's population 
or contribution to the budget. I have had enough of this ``not in 
our back yard'' business, because we have been at a 
disadvantage for 15 years.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Madam Speaker, it is not true 
that all defence cuts were made in Quebec in the past. Cuts were 
made in Summerside, for example, as well as in Penhold. 
Several Canadian provinces were affected.
<P>
	I generally agree with my colleague that while DND spends 
less in Quebec and in western Canada than elsewhere in Canada, 
cuts were steeper in that province. Note in this respect the 
results of the last election. In Ontario and Altantic Canada, 
where Liberals were elected, you have higher defence spending 
and lesser  cuts. This is a problem, I agree. But it was the Bloc 
Quebecois that requested a 25 per cent reduction in defence 
spending. It is hard to carry out a reduction of this magnitude 
without making any cuts in Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I will make a brief comment and then ask a 
question.
<P>
	As regards cuts in Quebec, we have indeed been penalized in 
recent years, particularly since these cuts were not only 
budgetary ones. Just think of the closure of the only 
French-language military college in Canada. The impact is not 
strictly financial, as shown by the drastic reduction in the 
enrolment of French-speaking aspiring officer cadets since that 
decision was made. Canada cannot be proud of that decision.
<P>
	My question is as follows: Has he met, in his region, people 
from the armed forces reserve who want the situation to be 
cleared up because they feel that the things for which certain 
elements are being blamed, as well as the fact that no light is 
being shed on the issue, are hurting everyone? The result is that 
people who were once very proud to be members of the reserve 
or of the Canadian Forces now feel rather uncomfortable.
<P>
	These people feel that things should be made very clear. We 
support the Reform Party's motion because it asks that light be 
shed on this issue. Can the hon. member tell us if members of the 
reserve forces in his region feel the same way? Do these people 
feel that the bad apples should be expelled, to avoid letting the 
situation deteriorate even more?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Generally speaking, military 
personnel are very concerned just now. They do not believe in 
the government's ability to make cuts in a proper manner. It is 
my view that, at present, the government does not care about the 
problems confronting military personnel.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, as I said earlier in my question and comment, I 
am pleased to participate in this debate. It is an important debate 
and I welcome it.
<P>
	In my presentation I am going to relate to the main purpose of 
the motion. It essentially addresses morale and leadership, and 
also concerns by its very nature the ambience of the times, the 
kind of times we are in and how they develop.
<P>
	Since this is the 50th anniversary of the victory over in Europe 
by the allied forces, it is appropriate to go back to look at a 
50-year parallel. I am not a military historian. I have not been 
around long enough to be able to give firsthand 50 years of 
military evolution. However I have studied the business and I 
have been part of it for a long time, as have other members in the 
House.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10880"> 10880 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	I would like to share with the House a parallel which I believe 
we are seeing now in this day and age. Again, if I could take 
some licence, I am more familiar with the naval aspect, but I 
think what I say for the navy could also apply to the army and the 
air force.
<P>
	Let me take the House back to 1945, when we had the third 
largest allied force. How that developed is important as well. Let 
me take it from the navy perspective.
<P>
	Canada started into World War II in 1939 with 10 ships and 
2,000 people. By the end of the war, which for the sake of rough 
calculation was close to 2,000 days if we take the lead up to the 
beginning and the aftermath at the end, the navy finished up 
from those 10 ships and 2,000 people with 400 ships and 
100,000 people. That is 50 people a day and one ship every five 
days. A tremendous expansion.
<P>
	At the end of the war there was a demobilization. Those 
people who joined to serve their country in many cases had no 
intention of staying in and were quite happy to demobilize.
<P>
	Another important aspect of this should not be lost. Between 
1945 and the early 1950s history was in the making. The 
strategic planners had run amock. It was not their fault. There 
was no route; the hot war was over. Between the hot war in 1945 
and the cold war in 1951, defence planners were in great 
difficulty in providing direction to people in uniform.
<P>
	To use a navy example, in 1949 a series of undesirable 
incidents occurred on our capital ships of the day. This resulted 
in the three man Mainguy inquiry. The inquiry was designed, 
developed and commissioned purely to investigate the 
undesirable specific incidents. The findings of that inquiry led 
to a fundamental change in the way the navy went about its 
business in the late 1940s, the early 1950s and on.
<P>
	The difficulty in planning and in providing direction led to 
some perturbations in the naval service and perhaps in the army 
and air force as well. It led to an inquiry, which led to better 
working conditions, better leadership and better direction. It 
also happened that in 1951 we had what was called the cold war.
<P>
	Since that time Canadian forces have been reducing in size, 
reducing in mobility, and reducing in posturing in bases abroad. 
The funding has been reduced as well. Is that surprising? It may 
be undesirable for those who want to see more military 
expenditures, and I happen to be one of those from time to time. 
The whole world is reducing. We are now going from a cold war 
to what perhaps is developing into a hot peace.
<P>
	With the exception of the interregnum in the Korean days 
from the early 1950s until about the mid-1950s, the forces 
continued to decrease. I have a certain amount of sympathy for 
the defence planners of those days, but we  did have a recognized 
enemy. We did have a recognized capabilities and intentions 
method of defence planning.
<P>
	In 1987 the government of the day provided a white paper 
which was hailed to be the be all and end all. It was lauded by 
those in the military, by defence planners and other defence 
organizations, both allied and the other side. It provided things 
like nuclear submarines for the navy, more aircraft for the air 
force, more soldiers for the army, a completely new command 
structure for the army, more reserves, and a further 
determination to make the total force concept, that is the 
amalgamation of the regulars and the reserves into one force.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	That document lasted three years. We all know the cold war 
finished in 1990. We ran into the problem in the standing 
committee on defence. We ran into it in the joint committee. It is 
not as simple as perceiving an enemy, deciding what that enemy 
may do and then planning a force structure to counter it.
<P>
	Who is the enemy today? I am not sure who my enemy is. 
What are its plans? If you do not know who the enemy is, it is 
very difficult to figure out what its plans are. What do you do? 
You do not stop planning. I disagree very strongly with my hon. 
colleague from Calgary Southeast who says there is no plan.
<P>
	There was no plan from 1987. I cannot blame that on the 
government. It did not cause the cold war to stop. From 1990 
until 1993 the Canadian forces were essentially without a white 
paper. That was very serious, considering the tremendous 
changes that had taken place in those years.
<P>
	Every year there was an effort to reduce the budget and to 
reduce the people. This was even accentuated after 1990 when 
peace groups start asking Canada, where is your peace dividend? 
A lot of us would say that we had our peace dividend when we 
were paying 2 per cent of our gross national product for defence 
in the last 20 years of the cold war, 1970 to 1990, when most of 
our NATO allies were paying 5 per cent. I am not blaming that on 
anybody. We happen to be in a very unique geo-strategic 
position and perhaps we should not have been spending more 
than 2 per cent.
<P>
	In the years 1987 to 1993, the cry was that we should have a 
good planning base. In that way deputy ministers, chiefs of 
defence staffs, commanders and senior planners would know 
what was in the budget and what was in the defence program, not 
next year but five years from now. How can you plan for a force 
when you do not know how much money is going to be there?
<P>
	We are five years into this hot peace, as I like to call it. A little 
over two years ago we had 4,700 peacekeepers committed in a 
force that was shrinking. Since 1987 the Canadian forces have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10881"> 10881 </A></B>
<P>
gone through a reduction of $21 billion, in capital expenditure 
mostly, a reduction of 26,000 people in uniform and 16,500 
civilians. The reserve force that had such grandiose plans in 
1987 will be reduced to a lot less than was planned, to 23,000. In  
any organization you cannot have such a shrinking philosophy 
without it causing an effect on those people who serve.
<P>
	I recognize there are difficulties. The minister recognizes 
there are difficulties. There are always going to be difficulties in 
an organization of 60,000 or 70,000 or 80,000 people. If you 
have 10 people you are bound to have a problem with one or two. 
That should not be surprising.
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence announced the broadest 
inquiry, certainly since the Mainguy commission in 1949. I want 
to dwell on that for a few minutes. That commission was set out 
to look at specific incidents in the navy, but it resulted in a 
fundamental change in how the navy did its business.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	While in no way, shape or form would I preclude what kind of 
findings the commission of inquiry into the Somalia affair will 
conclude, the calibre of the people and their backgrounds would 
lead me to believe that any of the recommendations and findings 
of the commission certainly would have application not just to 
the Somalia inquiry but to the downstream leadership, modus 
operandi and maybe even the structure of the Canadian forces.
<P>
	There is not much we can do after the fact but we can learn 
lessons. I am not going to get specific about the inquiry, but 
having read the 19 specific subparagraphs, it is very clear to me 
that the whole range has been covered. It states in the preamble 
that notwithstanding what is said in the general sense and what 
is said in the specific sense, the inquiry has a pretty broad range 
of matters it can look at. I take some comfort from the fact that 
the problems are being addressed.
<P>
	The hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands and I, with other 
members, addressed in the joint committee on defence the issue 
of morale. It was not an issue because members of the Canadian 
forces were not appreciated by their fellow Canadians. It was 
not an issue because members of the Canadian forces were 
dissatisfied with the military reaction to the way of life. That is 
in the report. More specifically, they were not dissatisfied and 
morale we felt was not an issue not because of poor leadership 
specifically. As the report went on to say, the excellence of the 
senior ranks was evident as we went from bases to stations to 
ships, operational forces, logistic forces and administrative 
forces. That conclusion was reached on October 31.
<P>
	I have difficulty understanding what could have changed so 
drastically to lead one to conclude that we have command and 
control shortcomings, deteriorating morale, poor leadership and 
that kind of thing.
<P>
	The chain of command is fundamental to any organization. 
We all agree on that. I can assure the House that from my 
knowledge of the hearings the last 10 months and my subsequent 
involvement with the Department of National Defence, the 
chain of command is there. However, it is like all chains, some 
links are stronger than others. We have had incidents and 
happenings in the last two months that indicate that.
<P>
	On the business of leadership, I have talked about the 
shrinking force. It started in 1945 and is still going on. What 
kind of leadership does it take to keep the Canadian forces in a 
good state of morale with all the things that are happening that 
we have discussed here today: reduction in capital programs, 
reduction in the size of the force?
<P>
	For the last 10 years the Canadian forces have acted in many 
ways like the social laboratory for some of the things that have 
been happening, for the good of the country, but it is the law of 
the land. I mentioned the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and 
the Privacy Act earlier in my comments. All these things have 
happened in less than a decade. If there was not good leadership 
what would have happened to the Canadian forces?
<P>
	One of the things we discovered in our deliberations was that 
members of the Canadian forces were held in the highest 
respect. That was not yesterday, that is today, last year and the 
year before. Notwithstanding the shrinking size of the Canadian 
forces, notwithstanding the tremendous pressure on the senior 
and junior members of the Canadian forces, the unpredictability 
of budgets and not knowing from year to year what is really 
going to happen, and notwithstanding the tremendous 
complexity of equipment in the last decade, the Canadian forces 
continue to operate with the highest esteem of their allies and 
their compatriots in other countries. On top of all this, I do not 
know of any time in the history of the Canadian forces where the 
people who serve in uniform have been under such scrutiny from 
the media.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	I wonder if I could be permitted perhaps a minute or so on this 
perspective. We recently had a program on our new Halifax class 
ships. It was an investigative type of presentation. The tenor of 
the program was to castigate in every way a ship that is 
considered to be one of the best in the world.
<P>
	I will take a personal side. One of the questions that was asked 
of one of those who was castigating this class of ship and how it 
was being brought into service, was asked by one of the 
commentators: ``Would you send you son to sea in one of these 
ships?'' He said no. If I had been asked the same question I 
would have said yes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10882"> 10882 </A></B>
<P>
	I have a son who has served and is still serving in one of those 
ships. He left in August of last year and spent five months in the 
Adriatic in HMCS <I>Toronto</I> as the combat systems engineer in an 
organization that was enforcing the arms embargo in a 21-ship 
organization representing 15 countries.
<P>
	One of the commanders of that group, the commander of the 
standing naval force, Rear Admiral Jim Stark, U.S. Navy, spent 
a lot of time in HMCS <I>Toronto</I>, not just to visit but as his 
command ship. The facilities of that ship allowed him an ease in 
command and control that is a matter of public record for the 
navy. In the five months that <I>Toronto</I> was in the Adriatic Sea she 
was involved in 370 hailings of ships and 56 boardings. We have 
seen what sort of traumatic experience is involved in boardings 
in the recent capture and arrest of the Spanish vessel <I>Estai</I> on the 
ninth of this month. They had one of those every three days as 
well as other sightings and deflections.
<P>
	I use this example to add to the kind of scrutiny that members 
of the Canadian forces are under. I hope they are in the process 
of being addressed. I am not going to repeat what I said about the 
inquiry. I take comfort from knowing that the inquiry is under 
way, who is serving on it and its terms of reference. I take 
comfort from the fact that after six years of not knowing what is 
happening for members in the Canadian forces, there is now a 
bottom up study, that has been referred to many times here this 
morning, in the standing joint committee and a white paper 
which gives in output terms what the Canadian forces are 
expected to do.
<P>
	We have to look at this debate in the context of our own 
society, in the changing times. We have been living too rich for 
our own good. We are all cutting back. The Canadian forces are 
no different. All government departments are cutting back.
<P>
	We have gone from a hot war to a cold war, from a cold war to 
a hot peace. We have more Canadian people, young men and 
women, in the line of fire than we have had any time since the 
Korean war and World War II, yet our young Canadian men and 
women continue to provide the very best. They honour us every 
day by their actions as peacekeepers. So do their regimental 
sergeant-majors and their commanders and their admirals and 
generals by their leadership.
<P>
	It should not be surprising that a senior officer in a base that 
has been targeted with the kind of scrutiny and difficulties that 
they have had would comment on morale. He would be expected 
to do that but twice in his internal letter, which was meant 
essentially for the chief of the army, he said morale was good. 
That is a reflection of his leadership and the leadership of others.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	There is need to look at morale. These issues are being 
addressed and debates of this nature will lead to the resolution of 
some of the difficulties we recognized in the report and which 
the minister recognizes. Hopefully when these things are put 
together everybody will be better off as a result.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I want to thank the parliamentary secretary for his very 
interesting remarks; a lot of history that perhaps was not exactly 
on the subject of the motion this morning but certainly of 
relevance.
<P>
	I also would like to recognize the remarks made by the 
parliamentary secretary that in fact the Liberal government has 
introduced a white paper which I think was vital. It is not that I 
agree with everything that is in it, but it is certainly a step in the 
right direction.
<P>
	I want to address the remarks he made with regard to the 
change of mind I have had since the conclusion of the defence 
review. Obviously I was a signatory to the report which said that 
senior leadership in the armed forces is excellent. I do not doubt 
that it is excellent in a lot of cases.
<P>
	However, I have since been made privy to not one but two 
reports from senior officers, one of them a gentleman we met in 
Bosnia when he was the deputy commander down there, Colonel 
Oehring. He makes it very clear that the problem with the 
morale of our soldiers can be summed up in one short phrase, a 
loss of confidence and trust. In a second report, from General 
Jeffries, whom the parliamentary secretary has referred to, he 
said referring to morale: ``While this side of the problem is 
serious, it pales in comparison with the evolving lack of 
confidence in the chain of command which every commanding 
officer has identified. This confidence is the foundation of our 
military system. If it is weakening, let alone in danger of 
disappearing, it needs immediate attention''.
<P>
	Basically this is what the motion is all about. It also involves 
decisions that have been taken by the government which may 
either diminish or not adequately address Canada's defence 
needs. I believe the parliamentary secretary may have 
overlooked that in some of his comments.
<P>
	It is also worthwhile commenting that the chief of defence 
staff has mentioned that he will be cutting 24 generals from the 
senior ranks of the Canadian Armed Forces. This will still leave 
well in excess of 70 generals to command an eventual force of 
60,000 people. That is more than one general per thousand 
people and I think that is excessive. I am not saying for a 
moment that we do not have requirements to serve overseas in 
NATO and NORAD where there is a requirement for a certain 
rank level, but that can be addressed without the overabundance 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10883"> 10883 </A></B>
<P>
of senior ranks we presently have in the armed forces. That was 
addressed in my remarks with regard to headquarters things.
<P>
	I would say to the parliamentary secretary that I agree, 
unquestionably, that things which come out of the inquiry on 
Somalia will impact on other areas of defence. There is no 
question about that. I ask him why, when we know there is a 
distinct problem with morale and loss of confidence in the 
leadership of the Canadian Armed Forces, is the minister so 
unwilling to institute an inquiry to find out what is the problem. 
Either there is a problem or there is not a problem. If there is 
one, let us address it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased by the comments 
by colleague from Saanich-Gulf Islands. I know where he is 
coming from.
<P>
	There is no intention to hide either the first letter in December 
from Colonel Oehring, whom he and I both met in the former 
Yugoslavia, or the rather thorough letter from General Jeffries.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	We have close to 100 generals and admirals in the Canadian 
forces. We heard from one in a base that has been beset with 
problems for the last two years. That should not surprise 
anybody. If this is Canadian forces-wide, what is Vice-Admiral 
Murray saying about this kind of thing in the navy? What is 
Lieutenant-General Clements saying about this kind of thing in 
the air force? What is the chief of reserves saying about this kind 
of thing in the reserves?
<P>
	I am not trying to be smart about this, but the hon. member is 
very much aware morale is the first and foremost issue of any 
military commander. If there is a smattering, if there is a smell, 
if there is any indication that morale is not the best they can 
make it, they are charged with the responsibility of doing 
something about it. These are the examples seen in the two cases 
mentioned.
<P>
	I am trying to decry it. I am not trying to minimize it. I am not 
saying what they are saying is not right. They are military 
commanders. Clearly they know their system. One would have 
to accept what they say has meaning.
<P>
	However, do two letters meant for internal consumption 
which were not leaked but given to the public set up cause for 
inquiry into the whole outfit? Do we want to look at the navy, the 
air force and other aspects of the army? I do not think so.
<P>
	He asked me why the minister has not done it. I do not think 
there is enough evidence to indicate that we have a forces-wide 
problem. The hon. member has commanded units, as I have. If 
one commands more than ten units, one will have a difficult 
problem with at least one. In a force of this size with so many 
units, so many generals, so many operational tasks, while I am 
not trying to minimize it, some of the problems are already 
known. There are some difficulties in the areas that were 
discussed and we would expect the commanders to talk about 
this and try to rectify the difficulty.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about another inquiry. There were 
complaints by the speakers this morning about 
bureaucratization and encumbrances of the Canadian forces. We 
must remember the purpose of the Canadian forces is to be 
prepared to fight for the country. If we load down generals, 
admirals and senior NCOs with inquiry after inquiry, what will 
they be doing when they are supposed to be doing what they 
were basically designed to do?
<P>
	Let us do this inquiry. Let us find out what we get from this. 
Let us move on to where we need to go in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank the parliamentary secretary for his remarks 
which I listened to very intently and enjoyed very much.
<P>
	I have a concern in this debate that part of the reason for the 
lack of morale is perhaps due to the failure to communicate 
adequately with the armed forces how we as parliamentarians 
and Canadians feel about it.
<P>
	It is the question of the soldier who always like to have a letter 
from home. In this day and age the media can no longer afford to 
follow the activities of our peacekeepers abroad. Having heard 
his eloquent remarks, is there any provision to his knowledge for 
actually distributing the contents of this debate to the Canadian 
forces both at home and abroad? I am sure it would love to hear 
what we are saying.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate that question. It 
was not planted. It is a good question.
<P>
	The last part of the special joint committee's report talked 
about the need for the Department of National Defence to reach 
out to Canadians more. There is a need for better 
communication. I think that is the word my hon. colleague used. 
It was a fair comment. The department is in the process of 
working on this. When do we know if communications are good? 
It is a judgmental thing. A better job can be done.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	I enjoin every member of Parliament to take the <I>Hansard</I> of 
this debate and send it to each constituent serving in the 
Canadian forces. I have about 700 and every time there is a 
major debate I send them copies of the debate with some 
comments.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for his question. It gives me an 
opportunity to encourage all members of the House to 
participate in this communications and information exercise.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I do not usually speak on the subject of defence 
but I thought it was important for me to take part in this debate.
<P>
	I grew up in a home where during my early years my father 
was away at war. He fought in four wars; World War I, the 
Palestinian uprising, the Irish rebellion and World War II.
<P>
	It was a great honour and pleasure to grow up in a family that 
believed in peace and knew how necessary it was to fight so 
others could enjoy peace in the world. My father was extremely 
proud of his military career. However, I have often heard it said 
that those who are involved in and see the terrible tragedies of 
war rarely want to talk about it. Such a man was my father. He 
had seen too much suffering.
<P>
	After World War II when my father returned to us in 1945 he 
became a member of the Canadian Legion, an organization 
which has worked very hard and established a place for 
ex-service men and women to meet and remember those who 
did not return, their fallen comrades.
<P>
	Later in the 1970s when my father passed away in a military 
hospital in British Columbia, once again the Canadian Legion 
came to serve our family. The Legion members provided Legion 
ex-servicemen as pall bearers out of respect for my father's 
position and rank while he served in the armed forces.
<P>
	I was younger then and did not become involved with the 
Legion and its activities at that time. However, since I have been 
elected as an MP I was asked to become an honorary member of 
the Legion out of respect for my father. I have come to see first 
hand the wonderful programs and initiatives given by Legion 
members to my community for everyone in the community to 
enjoy.
<P>
	Last year I spoke at the opening of a beautiful band shell in the 
centre of the lovely town of Maple Ridge. Legion members 
enlisted the help of the community to construct this band shell. 
Those who supported the enterprise paid for it.
<P>
	Legion members also run the annual Remembrance Day 
ceremonies as well as the Canada Remembers program. We 
planted thousands of tulips in the riding last fall. I am looking 
forward to May this year when we acknowledge the freedom of 
Holland on May 6 with all those wonderful tulips in bloom in my 
community.
<P>
	Last weekend once again I attended legion ceremonies being 
held to honour two very special young cadets from Maple Ridge. 
Cadet flight Sergeant Lesley Reitel received congratulations for 
the top music award in Canada for her performance in a military 
band. Flight Sergeant Andraena Tilgner received the award of 
excellence for an all round outstanding performance as a cadet. 
She was one of 12 recipients in all of Canada. Both were 
students at Maple Ridge high school.
<P>
	This recognition given to young people across Canada is yet 
another service given by our legionaries, our ex-servicemen and 
ex-service women, present and past members of the military 
who encourage our young people in the highest schools of 
achievement and work ethics.
<P>
	Fortunately these legionaries did not have a government 
disgrace their battalions, dismissing them as though they never 
were. These ex-service personnel have a pride in their war 
service to their country. It is a pride that develops because you 
are giving to your country. You are defending a way of life we all 
hold dear. You are following in the footsteps of brave men and 
brave women who have gone before you, many who have given 
their lives.
<P>
	In World War I and World War II we had a large regular force 
and a large vibrant reserve force. What has happened since that 
time? Why the necessity for the debate today? Why have we put 
ourselves in the position where Canada's military with its proud 
traditions of courage and intervention on all fronts has to be 
defended and lifted up, not by the government, not by the 
recognized opposition party, but by the third party, the newest 
party in the Chamber, the Reform Party?
<P>
	Let us look to the history since 1945. Slowly but surely the 
world changed. We had the cold war when were were dependent 
on the United States for our protection should there be a nuclear 
war. Fortunately that never came to pass. During the cold war 
period it became evident that Canada could not defend its land 
mass on its own without help from the United States.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	Having come to this conclusion there were only three other 
uses for our military: serve with the new peacekeeping ventures 
organized under the auspices of the United Nations, give support 
to the civil power within our borders and be ready to support our 
NATO allies.
<P>
	This could then lead to the decision to start to cut military 
budgets. This was especially true during the Trudeau era. The 
military budgets began to be cut as money was needed to keep 
the deficit as low as possible. Government funds were being 
used for extra social programs.
<P>
	During the Conservative years the budget of the Canadian 
forces was cut so severely that it became evident that our 
military policy was actually being set by the Department of 
Finance. However during this period our military maintained its 
commitment to world peace. We sent peacekeepers whenever, 
wherever asked. When a real war was imminent and finally 
broke out in the Persian gulf our ships were there right behind 
the United States navy.
<P>
	All this is to the credit of Canada's armed forces. It really did 
manage to do more with less. However in 1993 after the general 
election it looked like things would change for the Department 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10885"> 10885 </A></B>
<P>
of National Defence. The  government mounted two studies, 
both carried out by special joint committees: one on defence and 
one on foreign policy. We in the Reform Party participated in 
both. Why wouldn't we? What an opportunity. After years of 
being ignored members of Parliament were actually being asked 
for their input on defence and foreign policy.
<P>
	The committees met, held hearings and reported. In the case 
of the defence committee we supported the majority view. One 
of the main conditions we set forth for the report was that the 
defence budget would not be cut any more than it was in the 1994 
budget. Having drawn this line in the sand we compromised 
even further. We decided to go along with the cuts in spending 
which would total $1 billion over three years. This was our last 
line in the sand. We even incorporated defence cuts into our 
taxpayers budget.
<P>
	Why do we believe the cuts should go no further than outlined 
by the special joint committee on defence policy? Quite simply 
we believe Canada should have a combat capable multi-purpose 
armed forces.
<P>
	With a budget lower than that recommended by the Senate 
joint committee we will have to start cutting capabilities. We 
will not be able to continue to meet our international 
commitments. We will have to start saying no when the nations 
of the world come calling for help. We will have to start picking 
and choosing when new peacekeeping and peace building 
requests come from the United Nations. In the event of another 
gulf war we could join in but only if the war lasted for a 
considerable period of time; it will take us a while to get ready.
<P>
	Let us look within the country to see the effects of the cuts. It 
is difficult to explain the anger and alienation felt in certain 
parts of the west over the treatment by government which has its 
heart and soul in central Canada. The government has taught the 
west another lesson with the last two budgets. It is a lesson 
westerners learned well during the Trudeau years. The lesson is 
simply that Liberals do not understand the west. They play old 
style politics with us. ``If you didn't return any Liberals to 
Ottawa we will get even with you'', say the Liberals. ``In this 
case we will close your bases''. Witness Calgary, Chilliwack, 
Cold Lake, Jericho Beach and added to last year's closures 
especially Royal Roads. The government has decimated the 
military in the west.
<P>
	Land forces for western Canada will now be located in 
Edmonton. That will certainly teach all westerners a lesson: 
vote Liberal or a Liberal government will hurt them severely.
<P>
	The closure of the bases will mean hardships for many living 
in the communities, but in the cases of Chilliwack and Calgary it 
makes little economic sense. It will cost millions and millions of 
dollars to move the two bases to Edmonton. In my opinion 
money will not be saved.
<P>
	The problems between the government and the military go 
much deeper than budget cuts. They go to the very core of the 
problems with the Prime Minister's government. The 
government does not understand the military. I am referring to 
the disgraceful treatment of Canada's airborne regiment at the 
hands of the Prime Minister and the Minister of National 
Defence.
<P>
	No one condones the killing of the Somali youth. No one 
condones the hazing rituals shown so graphically on our 
television sets. However, why punish the entire Canadian 
military by disbanding the regiment? The young men and 
women who thought their futures were with the regiment have 
had their dreams dashed, have been uprooted and moved away 
all because the government was too weak kneed to deal 
appropriately with superior officers, those in the senior ranks 
who because of their very position are supposed to pay the price 
if something goes wrong in the trenches. It is not supposed to be 
the other way around. Then we have the spectacle of the 
Minister of National Defence stating daily as soon as the courts 
martial are over that he will establish an independent inquiry.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	The minister disbanded the regiment and is to hold an inquiry 
into what? It does not exist any more. It is interesting to 
speculate on what would happen if the inquiry results in the 
finding that a few highly placed officers were to blame but the 
regiment was fundamentally sound. Will the minister breathe 
life into the airborne, bring it back? If not, why not?
<P>
	The government does not understand the military. We in the 
Reform Party understand and we will fight hard to ensure there 
are no more cuts.
<P>
	I am proud to be a Canadian and I am proud of the country's 
military heritage. I would have thought the Prime Minister, with 
his years of experience, could have fought hard to keep our 
military a multi-purpose combat capable force.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, as a matter 
of introduction I feel it is important for us as members of 
Parliament to scrutinize our federal bureaucracy.
<P>
	Just two days ago the foreign affairs committee tried to 
examine former deputy minister Bob Fowler. I did a lot of 
research and checked out a lot of information about the matter. 
One area we wanted to examine in detail was management skills, 
fiscal restraint, organizational abilities and morale building. 
These major issues should be discussed when we look at the 
organization of a particular department.
<P>
	I found many media allegations about Mr. Fowler and his 
management of DND. As I did more and more research starting 
in the early part of January, I found the disturbing clouds of five 
and a half years as deputy minister certainly brought forward a 
lot of concerns I know Canadians would like to hear about.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10886"> 10886 </A></B>
<P>
	Most of the problems were fairly obvious and had been dealt 
with in detail. I felt it was very important to show that there was 
no problem and there must appear to be no problem. Perception 
is everything in this area and is vital to the public's 
understanding of what is happening.
<P>
	What perceptions concerned us? If we look at the appointment 
that had taken place and the very rapid departure of the Mr. 
Fowler on December 23, that was a concern. It was a concern 
that our committee was examining Mr. Fowler on the last day 
possible. It was a concern that the minister chose that time, the 
middle of that examination, to announce the Somali affair. It 
was a very poor perception when the press had to be called out of 
the hearing so they could meet with the minister.
<P>
	What about the research? What happened? There were 
shocking and surprising revelations. There were many media 
stories. Another concern, and it is still ongoing today, is the 
number of people coming forward who are saying that there is 
something wrong with DND, that there has been something 
wrong for a long time with the management. That is why we are 
having such morale problems. That is why we are having the 
public problems of which most Canadians are aware now.
<P>
	We need to look at the issue. We need to get into more detail. 
We need to look at the management skills involved and the cut in 
the size of DND that is occurring. The rising debt and deficit 
have made that necessary. All of us would agree that we must do 
more with less. That is the reality.
<P>
	In 1984 the debt was under $200 billion. It increased until 
1993 to $489 billion and today to $550 billion. As it escalates 
out of control we must look at all departments including DND. 
DND was cut from 87,000 soldiers, 34,000 civilians and a $12 
billion budget a few years ago to new targets of 60,000 soldiers, 
20,000 civilians and less than a $10 billion budget.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	We also have to look at what was happening in the 
management of DND for the last five and a half years. We came 
up with a number of very interesting points that should be 
emphasized.
<P>
	We came up with the deputy minister's office that has been 
totally renovated. Its size was increased by more than 65 per 
cent. The renovations were $250,000 plus, ranging upward to 
estimates of $500,000. When some of the troops in the field did 
not even have helmets to wear and had 30 to 40 year old 
equipment this kind of spending was going on at management 
level in Ottawa.
<P>
	While some privates were reported in the media to be going to 
food banks, which may or may not be true, the deputy minister's 
salary went from $145,000 per year to $170,000 per year. The 
senior bureaucracy ballooned. DND went from four ADMs to 
eight ADMs, a doubling of the amount of senior bureaucracy at 
that level.
<P>
	There are other items we should look at in terms of 
management such as real estate deals. In 1991, DND entered 
into a 25-year lease on the Louis St. Laurent Building in Hull. 
The annual payments were based on negotiated value of the 
property at $73 million. Two separate appraisals were done on 
the building which came in at $62 million and $65 million. The 
Auditor General said that DND insisted on a long term lease 
which public works then negotiated. Six months after the lease 
was signed DND decided it did not need the space for 25 years. 
The Auditor General called this a lack of due regard for the 
economy. I call it a scandal and a loss of $8 million to $11 
million.
<P>
	Basically we have to question that kind of decision from the 
top of DND. We have questions about the decommissioning of 
bases. We have questions about moving expenses, which I know 
will come out later today. The biggest question most of us will 
ask about is the airborne, a proud regiment. It is a glaring 
example of management gone wrong.
<P>
	If we would have acted sooner, if the guys at the top would 
have known there were discipline problems and would have 
acted on them, I do not think we would have had what we are all 
ashamed of. If the information had not been covered up and had 
been opened to the public, the public would have forgiven and 
would have understood. However, because of the way it was 
handled it did not and the airborne does not exist today.
<P>
	We need to talk about the deputy minister's rich lifestyle. We 
need to talk about a $60,000 per year chauffeur. We need to talk 
about flowers for generals' wives. We need to talk about lunches 
twice a week paid for by the taxpayer. We need to talk about 
extensive travel and overseas military operations done by the 
deputy minister's office. We need to look at these concerns but 
as those who attended the hearings will know none of them were 
answered.
<P>
	We have to look at the controversy and ask who is responsible 
for much of it. We had a deputy minister who was prepared to 
say: ``None of it was my responsibility. It was totally that of the 
politicians''. He made none of those decisions even though in 
the five and half years he went through six ministers. If he was 
not the guy in charge I do not really know how the six ministers 
could be held responsible for everything. If the top dog will not 
accept any responsibility, it is no wonder we have problems 
today.
<P>
	We have other examples. Micheline Clairoux was hired as the 
director of facilities management. She has been a very 
controversial person in her office. We could talk more and more 
about that.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10887"> 10887 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	Let us end on morale and where that is at. In 1993 a survey of 
DND employees found sufficient widespread dissatisfaction to 
warrant immediate corrective action. One pollster said that if 
DND were a private corporation, it would have been bankrupt 
long ago.
<P>
	In December 1994 Colonel Oehring wrote a report revealing 
just how desperate and abandoned Canadian troops feel. A 
report written by Brigadier General Jeffries recently surfaced 
saying much the same thing. Both blamed the problem on a 
deterioration of senior leadership. Jeffries was blunt. He said 
that political agendas and careerism have replaced leadership in 
the defence hierarchy. He warned about a rapidly developing 
crisis in confidence in the ability of the chain of command to do 
its job. I would say that those are fairly condemning comments 
made by reputable people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the hon. member for Red Deer was somewhat 
repetitive in reciting a litany of media reports of which all of us 
are aware. I will not grace that with any comment.
<P>
	I am very disappointed that he would use the opportunity of 
this debate to castigate in the House a public servant whose 
reputation and ability are outstanding. I do not think there is any 
place for that in this debate. The actions of all people involved in 
the Somalia affair will be looked at in great detail by the inquiry. 
The hon. member knows that and I regret he has used this debate 
for that reason.
<P>
	Also, the third party cannot have it both ways. It cannot all of 
a sudden change its mind on the things it wants. It wants to 
reduce the deficit to zero, but it does not want the defence 
department to be cut.
<P>
	The Reform Party wants to have an inquiry after the last court 
martial. When the minister of defence called a press conference 
the day after the sentencing, the member complained that the 
minister did it because it was the same day the deputy minister 
of defence, who is now our United Nations ambassador, 
happened to be in front of the foreign affairs committee.
<P>
	The third party cannot have it both ways. If it asks for 
something and the government responds, then it has done a good 
job in opposition, but do not ask for more. It should not castigate 
the government for doing what it has asked the government to 
do.
<P>
	The Reform Party asked for an inquiry into the Somalia affair; 
an inquiry as broad as it could get, with three outstanding 
Canadians and a broad mandate. Now it wants more. Then it 
complains about bureaucracy and morale. Inquiries are great. 
They do wonderful things. However, they do not do a great deal 
for morale when they are ongoing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Madam Speaker, if everything was so 
honourable, as was mentioned with the deputy minister, I think 
there is a fair amount of disagreement about that. That was 
proven because this investigation is needed.
<P>
	As far as the day it was announced, I find it a little hard to 
understand why it had to be at 10.00 a.m., at the very same time 
that the cross-examination was occurring. Why would it not be 
at three o'clock right after question period? It is the appearance; 
it has to appear to be above board.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Madam Speaker, it was because the minister was 
anxious to respond to the opposition parties.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order. The questions and comments are directed to the 
speaker, not to a questioner or commenter. If there is additional 
time, I would ask that you allow additional questions and 
comments to the hon. member for Red Deer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> That is what this is about. I would like to address 
the comment of my hon. colleague from Red Deer.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	It was tabled at 10 o'clock because it was the earliest possible 
time the minister could table the inquiry after the courts martial 
were finished. The press conference was held immediately after 
so it could be done in response to what the opposition and the 
third party wanted. That is the answer to the question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Madam Speaker, I would just like to 
say that many times after question period is when press 
conferences are held. I do not understand why it had to be at 10 
o'clock in the morning of the very day that the deputy minister 
was to appear before the committee. To me the perception of that 
is totally wrong. The point I am trying to make is that the 
perception is wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to say to the hon. member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands who introduced this motion today that it 
reminds me of a number of years ago when, as part of a NATO 
parliamentary committee, I went to Europe. We visited 
Baden-Baden and the hon. member was base commander there 
and would you believe that he briefed us. I must say that the shoe 
has dropped today because this is the day I want to brief the hon. 
member and former commander of Baden-Baden.
<P>
	The motion he has brought before this House today is all 
inclusive. Having read all the material on the inquiry that is 
coming up, it too is in depth. Today we have to keep our minds 
on the issues here and on the fallout from these issues.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10888"> 10888 </A></B>
<P>
	I have been a strong supporter of the Canadian military 
community all my political life and before that because I was an 
educator on a DND base. I knew the families. Today some of my 
former students visit me with their children. They even visit me 
at times with their grandchildren, which sends a message of 
sorts.
<P>
	The motion about the inquiry also brings to my mind the hype 
that was in the media about the Somalia incident and also the 
recent media hype regarding the airborne regiment. It also 
brings to my mind the very questionable handling by defence 
headquarters of the Somalia issue when it occurred.
<P>
	Exactly two years ago today I had open heart surgery. Two 
years ago I did not know what was going on but I can say that I do 
know what is going on today. The situation is that Canada's 
military community is being hammered for particular incidents. 
The entire role the military community has played for years and 
is playing today is being ignored, not only to its detriment but to 
the detriment of this entire nation.
<P>
	It is time that each and every one of us in this House and 
across Canada, yes including the national media, remembered 
what the Canadian military community has meant to Canada and 
to the world. We have not been the powerbrokers, but we have 
certainly been the diplomatic brokers, we have certainly been 
the communicators on the international scene. If we, as 
Canadians or the media, continue to downgrade and slam the 
military community of this country, this nation is going to lose 
an asset that will take years to rebuild.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	Canada has put a positive step forward in many crises around 
the world. At this time military personnel are being tried in 
courts and they were tried by the mass media of this country. I 
must say that it is a time for us to take a look at the flip side of the 
coin as to what this really means to us as a nation and to each of 
us as Canadians.
<P>
	The minister mentioned chain of command on many 
occasions. I want to see the chain of command totally included 
in the upcoming investigation. I want to see senior people in the 
defence department take a seat and answer questions.
<P>
	I remember watching television in my hospital room two 
years ago and being so frustrated because I could not be in the 
House of Commons to defend those people I knew deserved to 
be defended. They are the mass numbers of people in our 
Canadian forces who did no wrong, who simply performed their 
duties and became victims of the desecration. That is what I fear 
is happening to our military community today.
<P>
	The defence review committee did address some of the issues 
that are mentioned in this motion today. We addressed the 
discipline. We talked about morale. We talked about defence 
headquarters. I think we were dead-on with the issues we 
discussed in the defence review committee. Some of those have 
been addressed in  the white paper. I expect they will continue to 
receive serious investigation and attention.
<P>
	I mentioned the world image. I would also like to mention that 
Canada is not a military minded state. All of us know that and 
many Canadians express it. However, it can be when it must be, 
and it has been when it had to be.
<P>
	I want to say something about the airborne regiment. There 
are many people in that regiment who are not to blame for what 
occurred. It was a handful of people. Massive destruction was 
caused by information in the media across this country which 
stressed the negative aspects while ignoring any positive 
aspects. That is what really started the whole ball rolling.
<P>
	Let us go back to 1974 when the Canadian airborne regiment 
was in Cyprus on peacekeeping duty. Things were very tense 
over there at that time. The airborne regiment played a vital role 
in the following actions.
<P>
	It successfully evacuated 386 tourists from the Ledra Palace 
Hotel under sporadic fire, and subsequently occupied the hotel 
and caused its neutralization in the conflict. It successfully 
evacuated 50 residents of the United Kingdom High 
Commission area under fire at that time. It preserved the 
integrity of the green line confrontation area under heavy fire. 
That is the line between the two combatants.
<P>
	It assisted the contingent commander of DCOS and United 
Nations forces in Cyprus in arranging a ceasefire at Nicosia 
airport, subsequently occupied the airport and caused its 
neutralization. This was done by the Canadian airborne 
regiment, by the Canadian forces. It stopped the Turks at that 
time, as my hon. friend has said. During the protection of the UN 
base camp Kronborg, it saved the lives of two Canadians while 
under fire. It provided relief assistance to 600 refugees at the 
blue beret camp. It helped locate and recover 86 Canadians who 
were stranded in various parts of the island.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	It assisted general relief and security of 200,000 refugees as 
part of the total United Nations forces in Cyprus effort.
<P>
	Canadian casualties during the period from July 15, 1974 to 
the September 10, 1974 were 2 killed and 19 wounded.
<P>
	In humanitarian operations it came to the relief of the United 
Kingdom High Commission and United States embassy. It went 
to the United States embassy on two occasion to help it out. The 
United States ambassador in 1974 was killed at his embassy in 
that local conflict. All other staff members were saved by the 
Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10889"> 10889 </A></B>
<P>
	There are many other incidents too numerous to list which 
characterize an outstanding performance by the airborne 
regiment in Cyprus. Most of these actions were conducted under 
fire, most often while caught in a crossfire.
<P>
	I want to bring other examples to the attention of the House 
that the Canadian forces have accomplished. This is what we are 
discussing today. That is why I am putting the emphasis on these 
things today. Let us in our discussions not destroy. Let us correct 
and get on with the useful and positive things our Canadian 
forces have been known to do and will continue to do in years to 
come.
<P>
	There is a letter to the commander of the Canadian forces in 
Somalia:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On behalf of the members and the supporters of the United Somali Congress in 
general and the people of Hiran region in Somalia in particular and on my own 
behalf, I would like to extend to you and through you to members of your forces 
that have operated generally in Somalia and particularly to those troops of yours 
who have operated in Hiran region, our cordial thanks and gratitude for the 
humanitarian services you have rendered to the people of that region.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Please also convey my personal thanks and that of the people of Hiran region 
to the government and to the great people of Canada for what their forces have 
done here. As a matter of fact, the people of Hiran region did not know anything 
about Canada before your forces arrived in the city of Baledweine, and I want 
you to know that all the children of Hiran region are writing on the walls of the 
city the name of Canada with the charcoal.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In addition, we have received countless appeals from people of the region to 
ensure your stay. This shows how the people of Hiran were truly satisfied with 
your stay in the region and humanitarian assistance you extended to them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the other parts of Somalia where the ex-UNITAF and now UNOSOM 
troops of other nationalities were operating we did not receive from the natives 
anything rather than complaints.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Canada more than carried its load. I have a letter from a 
school system in the region which is really forward in its thanks 
to the Canadians for what they did with building elementary 
schools, high schools, helping teachers, helping people to farm. 
It is all here, written by Somalians to Canadians. It is not some 
press clipping that has been taken and written up today for 
today's consumption only.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	The Hiran education committee states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Really, we cannot forget the Canadian forces who came from far country to 
assist our people as humanitarian relief and security basis. The Canadian forces, 
besides the school repairing, are handling now the security problem in Hiran.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We are limitlessly grateful to how much Canadian forces have done to restore 
hope with responsibilities sharing our community, especially the students and 
teachers, endless jobs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I remind the House and all Canadians that as the courts 
martial went on in Canada, as the inquiry now goes on in 
Canada, for heaven's sake remember what our forces did in their 
commitments to humanitarian measures and of peace in the 
world. Do not take the  negative message that everyone is going 
to hear day in and day out. Let us act very responsible in this 
matter.
<P>
	I want to quote partly from a letter by Gen. Johnston, 
commander of the U.S. Marine Corps in Somalia:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In those early days the Canadian forces had few vehicles and conducted many 
of their operations on foot under very trying climatic conditions. The 
temperatures were most often 100 degrees Fahrenheit and the constant blowing 
dust was a challenge to the best of soldiers. I was impressed then by the high level 
of motivation and professionalism exhibited during those early operations. Once 
the Canadian vehicles arrived, the regiment began widely expanding operations 
to the far reaches of the HRS boundary combining aggressive long range patrols 
observation posts and helicopter RECCE.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As an infantry officer, I had considerable appreciation for the skill with which 
they conducted business. The HRS Belet Ven has been a challenging operating 
area in part because of the close proximity of major militia formations of three of 
the most powerful faction leaders and because of its proximity to the Ethiopian 
border.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We have to remember what was there as their challenge at that 
time.
<P>
	Our military community and capabilities are some of the 
greatest assets the country possesses. There will be, as in any 
organization, corrective steps from time to time. Do not throw 
the proverbial baby out with the bath water. Let us not destroy 
our past history. These people have been strong underpinnings 
in our image around the world and at home.
<P>
	I talked about the good relationships when the issue of the 
airborne regiment was on. I was interviewed on ``Newsworld'' 
by Norm Perry. Everyone knows Norm Perry. I talked about the 
great relationships that existed in my home community of 
Petawawa between the civilian community and the military 
community and how that worked in recreation, in business and 
in many ways.
<P>
	He said: ``Are you trying to tell us the people of Petawawa 
believe in the incident that went on in Somalia? Are you telling 
us the people of Petawawa believed in the hazing incident?'' I 
almost said to Norm Perry, an experienced reporter who should 
know better, that is the stupidest question I have been asked in 
my 30 years in public life.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	The people of Petawawa do not agree with what went on any 
more than any other Canadian. I do not want my home 
community targeted by the incident. I want it to be targeted as a 
community which supports the military community in the good 
things that it does around the world, in the hours its people put in 
training and in the hours spent learning discipline. Discipline is 
very important in the forces. It is part of the important training. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10890"> 10890 </A></B>
<P>
We must remember those people are there to be assigned to 
difficult situations around the world when they arise.
<P>
	Let the inquiry take its course but let us have the inquiry going 
into the headquarters of the military community, hauling those 
people out for questioning as well. We talk about the chain of 
command. Let us take the chain of command from top to bottom. 
Let us use that as a corrective measure. Let us get on with the 
positive things and remember that Canadians have done great 
things in the past. Let us encourage them to continue to do so in 
the future, not destroy them over one incident.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for his 
comments. He has always been an impassioned and fervent 
advocator of the military and once again I support his contention 
that our military people are doing excellent work.
<P>
	I did want to point out to the hon. member that while media 
condemnation has undoubtedly played a part in the downfall of 
the airborne regiment, the reports that I referred to do not come 
from the media. They come from commanders, good 
commanders. I refer to General Jeffries, who said that not only 
he but all of his commanders were unanimous in reflecting that 
leadership was a problem, that the lack of apparent concern for 
leaders in their troops was a problem.
<P>
	In the instance of the report from Colonel Oehring at land 
forces headquarters, this is not a narrowly based report. This 
report covers the army from coast to coast. He too identified a 
leadership shortfall. While the media impacts, the media is not 
the total cause of the problem.
<P>
	With regard to the airborne regiment, I would also point out to 
the hon. member that it was not the media which disbanded the 
regiment. That was done by the Liberal Minister of National 
Defence.
<P>
	When the member referred to throwing the baby out with the 
bath water, I would like to suggest that he consider that in this 
light. I must say that if I had been the Minister of National 
Defence I would have waited until I had the facts before acting.
<P>
	He pointed out that some of the recommendations of the 
special joint committee had been adopted by the government. I 
agree with that. However, a number of what I consider to be 
excellent suggestions have not been acknowledged.
<P>
	If the aim of the game is to correct faults, as he pointed out, 
does he not agree that is the point of this motion? We are trying 
to establish that there is a need for an ongoing, in depth, open 
investigation of what is wrong with the Department of National 
Defence. If there is nothing wrong, let us put it out there and let 
the media present that. However, if there is something wrong, let 
us find it and fix it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hopkins:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not know why the hon. 
member mentioned General Jeffries' report. I did not refer to it 
and I certainly did not talk about it in any of my comments. I am 
sorry if he had a misconception of my comments in that case.
<P>
	As I said during the course of my speech, there are always 
corrective measures to be taken. Corrective measures have been 
taken and they are ongoing. That is the course. Any organization 
that does not continually correct itself when problems arise is 
destined to failure. There is no question in my mind that these 
questions will be addressed. I would like to see the defence 
committee continue to work on this. There is a role for 
well-informed members of the House to do that sort of thing.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	Let me clarify something for the hon. member. On the 
television show ``Shirley'' out of Toronto, people were invited 
to attend during the airborne issue. When they were on the 
program they felt as if they were in the middle of a military 
bashing show. The program was such that the person in charge of 
the show said that the military had been invited to appear on the 
show but obviously had not accepted the invitation because they 
are not present.
<P>
	That is totally unfair to the military community because as 
everybody in the House knows, and Canadians know, military 
people in uniform cannot go on TV shows to talk about their 
views on military matters. That is not the Canadian tradition nor 
is it the rules of the game.
<P>
	This person was doing a great injustice to our military, as was 
Norm Perry when he asked me that question about my home 
community of Petawawa. I am not going to let him forget it. I am 
not going to let the CBC forget it. Politicians are sometimes 
accused of not defending themselves and not speaking up. When 
we see something wrong, regardless of whether it will hurt our 
image from time to time, we have a responsibility to tell it as it 
is, whether they are the Norm Perrys or the Shirleys or whoever 
they are. Fairness is fairness and that is what must be built into 
the system.
<P>
	They did not get a licence from the CRTC to convey 
unfairness and misinformation to the Canadian public. They 
should be talking about both sides of the issue. That is where the 
train went off the tracks. In Somalia the positive side was 
forgotten. All that mattered to the media was the issue that took 
place there. That is what I am emphasizing. I know the hon. 
member is very fair-minded and he will accept that explanation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I want to put a question to my hon. colleague. I 
knew the member for Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke long 
before I became a politician. While I do not know every member 
in the House, I have to say that he is one of the strongest 
defenders of members of the Canadian forces and has been 
consistently known for that. The House in general would do well 
to pay attention to his words of wisdom.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10891"> 10891 </A></B>
<P>
	It is because of that view that I would like to ask the hon. 
member a question. As we did the special joint committee on 
defence, what was his view on the state of morale and the state of 
leadership in the Canadian forces?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hopkins:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for 
the question and for his very kind comments. As he knows, it is 
not every day that one gets a kind comment around here. So I 
will take it while it is coming.
<P>
	When we were sitting as the defence review committee, the 
hon. member and I, we did look at morale in the forces. I think 
the state of morale was partly caused by economic 
circumstances. Particularly, we heard about problems in the 
lower ranks because of the pay structure. We heard about a lot of 
real problems because of lack of equipment. I can tell the hon. 
member and all members that practically as long as I have been 
in the House that has been a complaint from the military; they do 
not have enough equipment or the right equipment.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	Today that is changing somewhat because the new ships, 
which we had a chance to visit and to have a good briefing on, 
are state of the art. We learned in Bosnia, that our armoured 
personnel carriers needed upgrading. We need new ones. The 
committee, as the hon. member knows, was very supportive of 
that.
<P>
	We were very supportive about other items such as helmets 
and flak jackets. We took into consideration all the things that 
we heard from the people in the field, not someone coming in to 
brief the committee sitting on Parliament Hill. We travelled 
with our military for four days. We slept in the same quarters 
with them. We ate with them. We travelled in the personnel 
carriers. Members from both sides of the House had that 
opportunity.
<P>
	It was very important because it impacted on the minds of 
committee members that if we are going to ask our troops to go 
abroad into difficult positions, whether it be cultural 
difficulties, the hatefulness that you run into in UN 
peacekeeping duties, that those people have to have equipment 
in order to perform their duties.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. parliamentary secretary will agree with me 
that by and large on the committee we had unanimous support 
for this type of thing. The members worked very well together. 
The report is certainly one of the best reports that has been 
brought into the House on defence matters, not only in our time 
but certainly in years past.
<P>
	I encourage the members of the committee to be very positive 
in the future in holding more committee meetings because, as I 
said in my remarks, we must continue to discuss the problems 
that arise, to take corrective measures and to make 
recommendations. We made many recommendations in that 
report. Many of them are already included in the white paper 
that was brought in by the government.
<P>
	I want to point out to the hon. member who brought the motion 
before the House today that this is all part of the ongoing 
scenario. A committee brings in a report, we meet people 
firsthand and we agree they do have problems. Together we sit 
down, write a report and make recommendations and the 
government accepts those recommendations. Also, I am sure 
that more of them will be studied and taken into consideration in 
the future.
<P>
	I want to thank the hon. parliamentary secretary who was very 
good to deal with on that report. He is well informed. We were 
very fortunate to have him as he is a retired admiral. The hon. 
member for Saanich-Gulf Islands is a retired colonel. I must 
say to the hon. parliamentary secretary that I was-

member for Shefford.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, if I am 
not mistaken, I will be able to finish my speech after Question 
Period.
<P>
	Today, as always when I rise in the House, I think of the 
people in the riding of Shefford who elected me. In fact, these 
people put their trust in us, and when we speak in this chamber, 
we do so on behalf of those who elected us.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	On March 21, the Minister of National Defence announced 
that he was establishing a commission that will investigate and 
report on the functioning of the chain of command, the 
leadership, discipline, operations and decisions of the Canadian 
Forces, and the actions and decisions of the Department of 
National Defence, as to the deployment of the Canadian Forces 
to Somalia.
<P>
	Today, the debate in this House is on a motion introduced by 
the hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands, and I will read it to 
you:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><A NAME="10892"> 10892 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government for failing to commission a broad and 
public inquiry with a mandate to investigate the government's failure to hold senior 
officials at the Department of National Defence accountable for command and control 
shortcomings, deteriorating morale, and decisions which diminished or have failed to 
improve Canada's defence posture.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The average person will want to know the difference between 
these two positions. The minister announced he was establishing 
a commission that will examine the problem of Somalia and the 
Second Airborne Regiment, while the motion introduced by my 
colleague wants to expand the scope of the commission to 
include the entire department and gives us an opportunity to 
discuss these problems here in the House. As you know, morale 
in the Canadian military has reached a new low, and that is 
because Canadians are increasingly reluctant to trust the people 
at National Defence.
<P>
	When we refer to the people who run National Defence, we 
are not talking about the average soldier. They do not make the 
decisions. We are referring to the people who make the 
decisions, to the top level officials.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, you will have the floor 
again at 3 p.m., after Oral Question Period. Since it is now 2 
p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the House will now 
proceed with statements by members pursuant to Standing 
Order 31.

	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
1992, the general assembly of the United Nations proclaimed 
March 22 World Day for Water, an annual event to remind us of 
the importance and value of water in our daily lives.
<P>
	Canadians could easily reduce their water consumption by a

most vital to our health and economic prosperity.

	Water efficiency requires the full commitment and

activities and by raising the public's awareness to use water 
wisely.

packages. That saying is certainly true in my riding.
<P>
	Salmo, a community of 1,300 enthusiastic people, wants to 
give Canada a special present on its birthday. Noting that the 
mint spends over $10 million a year replacing hoarded pennies, 
Salmo hit on the idea of challenging communities and service 
clubs across the country to gather in more pounds of pennies on 
a per capita basis than it does.

	Penny drops are now set up throughout the province and will 
soon be in other provinces as well. It proposes that all pennies 
collected will then be shipped to Ottawa to be applied against 
the national debt on Canada Day. This project has caught the 
interest of people all over B.C. and it is still growing.
<P>
	Salmo challenges all hon. members to dig into their jars, 
dressers, drawers and penny banks to collect more pennies on a

of pennies, it will also save a substantial portion of the $10

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, 50 years ago tomorrow morning, on March 24, 1945, 
the first Canadian parachute battalion made its last wartime 
strike from the skies into enemy territory in a major allied attack 
across the heavily defended Rhine River. The battalion had first 
jumped into battle on D-Day in Normandy as part of the 6th 
British Airborne Division.
<P>
	Its air assault over the Rhine, which saw one of its members, 
Corporal George Topham, win the Victoria Cross, was once 
again marked by success.
<P>
	The bravery of this hard-hitting unit, dropped in the midst of 
a desperate enemy defending their homeland, should never be 
forgotten.
<P>
	Our Canadian airborne won the respect and hearts of their 
comrades, joining an airborne brotherhood which transcended 
all borders of the Commonwealth.

	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Bloc Quebecois' continuing blockage of legislation that would 
put Canada's rail network back to work is clear evidence that the 
official opposition cares little about Canada's economy or the 
impact this strike is having on working men and women across 
this country.
<P>
	Each day this strike continues costs the Canadian economy 
tens of millions of dollars. The port of Halifax alone has already 
lost millions as ships are diverted to American ports such as 
New York. The Bloc's actions are causing layoffs, shutdowns 
and misery from sea to sea, including the province of Quebec. 
This must not and cannot continue.
<P>
	I urge Bloc members to recognize the impact their actions are 
having on the Canadian economy. Their continued blockage of 
the return to work legislation is just the latest example of how 
truly out of touch they are with the desires of Canadians, 
including the good people of the province of Quebec.

They have seen fit to allow the people of Canada to be 
economically devastated as a direct result of their unwillingness 
to co-operate with the government and its attempts to end the 
crippling effects of a national rail strike.
<P>
	It is estimated that the national rail strike could end up costing 
Canada $3 billion to $5 billion.
<P>
	Certainly members can appreciate the necessity of the back to 
work legislation tabled by the Minister of Labour on Tuesday. 
Even the president of the Canadian Auto Workers Union states 
that there is ``absolutely no advantage or reason for them''-the 
opposition-``to delay the legislation''.
<P>
	Given the economic harm this strike has already brought to 
the people of Canada and in particular the good people of 
Ontario, Quebec and the western provinces, I implore members 
opposite to set aside their petty politics long enough to act in the 
public interest for their constituents and to put an immediate end 
to the chaos caused by the national rail strike.

Mr. Speaker, it is with great relief that the official opposition 
learned that the mediator had managed to bring the parties close 
enough to allow workers to return to work in the port of 
Montreal. This is an encouraging sign that it will be possible to 
solve that conflict through negotiations.
<P>
	If the Minister of Labour had appointed the mediator earlier, 
the strike might have been avoided or, at the very least, been 
considerably shorter. The slowness of the minister in this 
conflict clearly shows that the government neglects the 
economic interests of Montreal. The success of the mediator 
should be an inspiration to the Minister of Labour.
<P>
<B>(1410) </B>
<P>
	Mediation can work when the parties can truly negotiate. It is

arbitration so quickly in the rail strike and in the Vancouver port 
conflict, without first giving mediation a chance.

very concerned about the effects of the rail strike on their ability

claim to represent, when they did not give their consent to fast 
track Bill C-77 on Monday.
<P>
	As for members of the BQ, farmers are not surprised that the 
Bloc would stoop to such tactics. No doubt they have realized 
that the strong economic growth and the excellent government 
provided by the Liberal Party are convincing Quebecers to 
remain in Canada. Then the rail strike came and they realized 
they could damage the economy of Canada.

Canada's St. Thomas, Ontario plant who have been sent home

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am convinced that all members of the House are 
glad to see that the appointment of a mediator in the Port of 
Montreal dispute has paid off by allowing the employees to go 
back to work this morning while leaving the door open to a 
negotiated settlement.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Labour. Given the success 
of mediation in the Port of Montreal dispute, where talks had 
dragged on for 25 months, why is the government stubbornly 
rejecting mediation combined with a return to work for the 
railways, as the official opposition has been proposing since 
Monday?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as Minister of Labour, I am very happy to see that the 
mediator in the Port of Montreal dispute has succeeded in 
bringing the parties to agree to a voluntary resumption of work, 
without any act of Parliament. I hope that the mediator will also 
help the parties negotiate a collective agreement and that we 
will not experience another work stoppage at the Port of 
Montreal.
<P>
	As far as the railways are concerned, that phase is already 
over. We have already tried to reach an agreement with the 
parties. We went through several phases involving conciliation, 
a conciliation commissioner, Department of Labour officials 
and even the minister herself to help the parties reach an 
agreement. Unfortunately, this did not happen and we must now 
take action.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I must remind you that the minister forgot to tell us 
that there was no mediation in the rail dispute and that mediation 
at the Port of Montreal did wonders. The government should 
apply the same approach to the railways, thus avoiding a 
bludgeon law.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> The federal government can settle the dispute 
in the next hour by being flexible and agreeing to mediation.
<P>
	In this context, how does the Minister of Labour explain her 
refusal to make any concession, when the Canadian 
Manufacturers' Association begs her to be flexible and settle the 
rail dispute immediately? Does the government want to settle 
this dispute in the next hour, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I hope that both parties want to settle this dispute in the 
next hour. It is up to them to settle this dispute in the short term, 
thus precluding government action. However, if they cannot do 
so, we will have to assume our responsibility. This has enormous 
economic consequences from coast to coast; jobs are being lost 
across the country. It is our duty to act.
<P>
	I urge the Bloc Quebecois to take a very realistic look at the 
situation and the jobs that are being lost.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	Everyone knows that the only reason why the federal 
government refuses to allow mediation for rail workers, as it did 
in the Port of Montreal dispute, is that it intends to break the 
unions so that it can sell CN for more money.
<P>
	Does the minister not see that CN will be much harder to sell 
if it is hampered by a rotten labour relations climate resulting 
from a bludgeon law?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. Leader of the Opposition seems to be 
operating under a certain misunderstanding of the situation.
<P>
	When we commercialize the operations and the assets of 
Canadian National I will not be selling CN. The taxpayers of 
Canada will be the ones who benefit from the commercialization 
of CN.
<P>
<B>(1420 ) </B>
<P>
	That is why efforts are being put forward to make sure that CN 
is viable and competitive and that it survives as a railroad from 
coast to coast. I know the hon. Leader of the Opposition is not 
very interested in what happens in Canada from coast to coast.

reprehensible actions by this NATO military ally of Canada?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence

absence of the Minister of Foreign Affairs I should like to 
inform the House that Canada views the ongoing developments 
in Turkey with some degree of concern.
<P>
	We believe that all our NATO allies, as with all countries, 
should respect normal international rights, procedures and 
respect of others. The minister is actively pursuing the matter. I 
believe these views have been made known to our NATO allies. 
It is subject to further discussion.

Turkish attacks on Kurdish minorities?

Turkey indeed received.
<P>
	Obviously Turkey has defence requirements and it shops 
around quite frequently. It understands that we have surplus 
CF-5 fighter planes and has made inquiries of Canada. However 
no deal has been arranged. No agreement has been concluded.
<P>
	In any sale of surplus military equipment we have made quite 
clear that the purchasing countries have to give us certain 
undertakings on the use of the equipment so that it does not 
infringe in any way upon the rights of others or the equipment is 
not used in ways that Canada would not approve of.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since the February budget the President of the Treasury 
Board, the Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal and 
officials of the finance department have all predicted that the 
federal deficit would be eliminated by the year 2000.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has yet to deny or confirm the 
predictions publicly so I ask him if in his meetings with 
Moody's yesterday, the bond rating agency, he gave a target date 
for the elimination of the federal deficit.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what I said to 
Moody's in the meeting yesterday was what I said I would say in 
response to the leader of the third party's question yesterday, in 
fact in response to same question the day before, and I believe in 
response to the same question a week before.
<P>
	I set out our very clear intention to balance the books. I also 
said we would do so through a series of short term targets that 
would keep pressure on the government which was by far the 
best way of controlling our spending.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister can keep talking about rolling targets all 
he wants, but the fact of the matter is that if all the minister told 
Moody's yesterday was what he said in the House or told 
Canadians, he is simply inviting a downgrade of the credit of the 
country.
<P>
	Even today Dominion Bond Rating Service, a Canadian 
agency, has reviewed its outlook on Canada's credit rating from 
stable to negative.
<P>
	I have a supplementary question. Is the finance minister 
prepared to take responsibility for any downgrading of the 
country's credit rating and all the negative effects that will flow 
from that?
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the leader of the 
third party quotes DBRS. In fact the statement from DBRS is: 
``We expect to be releasing something in the very near future, a 
couple of day to a week or so. We have not made a decision on 
the rating of the federal budget yet but we will be doing so 
shortly''.
<P>
	In fact it is not Moody's, not DBRS, not Standard and Poors; 
the only person who keeps talking about downgrading the 
country's credit is the leader of the third party.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister gets cheers in the Chamber for that type of 
statement, but every time we stand in the House and demand 
deficit elimination rather than deficit reduction it is investors, 
lenders and rating agencies that cheer when we make those types 
of statements.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10898"> 10898 </A></B>
<P>
	This is very straightforward. If Moody's does not downgrade 
it is because the finance minister told it something he has not 
told the House or Canadians. If Moody's does downgrade it is 
because the minister's budget does not go far enough fast 
enough to restore lender confidence.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has one way out of this box. Will the 
minister end the secrecy and uncertainty and tell Canadians how 
and when he intends to eliminate, not just reduce, the Canadian 
federal deficit?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what I told 
Moody's is contained in the document I tabled in the House 
when I presented the budget. It is called the budget.
<P>
	I can understand that the leader of the third party has not read 
it because when I presented it in the House he was not here. He 
was out trolling for media clips.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday, Dominion Bond Rating Service confirmed 
the misgivings the official opposition and the Quebec 
government had about Quebec and Ontario being hit hardest by 
most of the cuts in transfer payments announced by the federal 
government in its last budget.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Will the minister 
confirm the Dominion Bond Rating estimate that Ontario and 
Quebec will have to absorb 71 per cent of the reductions in 
transfers announced in the last federal budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, first of all, the 
DBRS analysis did not take into account tax points, which play a 
very important role in our transfers. Second, their projections 
for 1997-98 are nothing but pure speculation because, as you 
know, we did not indicate in the budget how the cuts would be 
apportioned.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, be that as it may, can the Minister of Finance deny that, 
to preserve his own image as a good manager and his own credit 
rating, he knowingly and deliberately jeopardized the credit 
ratings of Quebec and Ontario by transferring his budget 
problems to these provinces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, perhaps I should 
quote from the DBRS report-I will translate for you. 
According to DBRS, justice, equity and improved efficiency are 
the guiding principles of our reform, as far as transfers to the 
provinces are concerned. In other words, DBRS is saying that 
what we have done in fact is follow the principles of equity and 
good management.

<P>
	In light of the fact that the government was reminded time and

aboriginal people is, how can the Minister of Indian Affairs 
explain that, 16 months into his mandate, he still has not done 
anything to remedy the situation, forcing the commission to take 
him to task once more?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr.

communities on the very serious problems that plague some of 
them.
<P>
	Let me remind the hon. member that despite some of the 
communities we hear about there are many others functioning 
very well. Health Canada has set up a number of initiatives to 
address the very serious problem of aboriginal suicide in some 
communities.

alone, out of a total population of 1,600, 50 young people aged 
15 to 24 attempted to take their own lives and, sadly, five others 
succeeded.
<P>
	In the face of this tragedy, how does the minister explain his 
stubborn persistence in uprooting young aboriginal people at a 
cost of thousands of dollars instead of building a local assistance 
centre, as requested by the community?

these sites selected by early this spring so that construction can 
begin.

opposition is very concerned about this and has asked the 
government several times to take the steps required to prevent 
such a massacre.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Foreign Affairs reconcile his

this week on CBC by his representative in Bujumbura, who said 
that everything was going well in Burundi?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I wish to remind the hon. member of what I said 
before in this House, namely that Canada, too, was concerned 
about what is happening in Burundi. In addition, I would like to 
correct the hon. member, who attributes to our representative in 
Burundi an assessment of the situation which is not the one he 
gave.
<P>
	On the contrary, he explained that the situation was difficult 
but that, despite these difficulties, it should not be compared to 
the situation that existed in the days preceding the massacre in 
Rwanda. I think that, objectively, she should not ascribe to our 
representative comments he has not made.

commission on the October 1993 events, as the participants in 
the regional conference on Burundi requested last month?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, again, I think it is important to remind you that the 
government did not wait for the opposition to ask us a question 
in this House before taking action. My colleague, the Secretary 
of State, travelled to Burundi to attend a conference with 
officials from other countries concerned about this matter and 
about Rwanda.
<P>
	Several weeks ago, we appointed a special roving ambassador 
on these issues, Ambassador Dusseault, who, week after week, 
visits Burundi, Zaire, Rwanda and other countries interested in 
what is happening over there.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	Of course, Canada wants to avoid a bloodbath. Of course, 
these ethnic conflicts are reprehensible, but I will remind the 
hon. member that the representations we have made at both the 
UN and the Organization of African Unity to try to convince 
other countries to join Canada in taking action cannot be 
attributed to Canada's lack of interest. On the contrary, we are 
very interested, very concerned, but Canada alone cannot 
resolve this persistent ethnic problem in Africa.

Defence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In previous years his department has been contracting 
seasonal work to retired military personnel receiving a pension, 
thus double dipping and leaving in the cold many Canadians

retired military personnel or will civilians have a fair 
opportunity to work at these seasonal jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence 
and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to remind the House that retired military personnel have the 
same rights and privileges as all Canadians.
<P>
	One set of guidelines we follow is federal legislation. All 
Canadians have an opportunity to compete for these jobs. We are 
monitoring the situation to see that there are no instances in 
which people are being favoured because of their former 
involvement in the armed forces. It is of great concern to us.

Jaw show 95 per cent of the city police are opposed to this bill.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

information that derives from the gun lobby, I urge the hon.

<P>
	Let us determine first of all how many officers in those 
departments participated in the so-called vote. Let us find out 
what they were asked and the reason for the meeting being called 
in the first place.
<P>
	The Saskatchewan Federation of Police Officers intends to 
conduct its own poll and we shall see what happens when all the 
police in the province are asked the full question.
<P>
	There is no doubt there are individual police officers, 
individual police chiefs, who do not agree with all parts of the 
firearms bill. However, while it is not unanimous, we continue 
to believe this bill has the support of the vast majority of 
Canadians and police officers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have also had many chiefs of police contacting us, 
vehemently opposed to more gun controls. The Saskatchewan 
Association of Rural Municipalities is overwhelmingly 
opposed. It had over 600 members at the meeting. The 
Saskatchewan legislature is unanimously opposed to C-68 and 
wants it withdrawn.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister's claim is true that registering guns is no 
different than registering cars, will the minister allow the 
province of Saskatchewan to establish its own gun control laws?

<P>
	A report from the Department of Indian Affairs on the 
transport of food to the far north links the health problems of 
aboriginal people to the lack of affordable nutritious food.
<P>
	How does the minister explain that the millions of dollars

higher in these regions than in the south?

recognized. The hon. member for Saint-Jean repeatedly brings 
it to the attention of the House.
<P>
	We are trying to break up the food into a more definitive 
process: perishable and non-perishable. It will continue to be a 
problem. I can only commit to the member that my ministry will 
be there. We will be lobbying governments and, hopefully, the 
province of Quebec, which has a responsibility. The people 
living there are not only citizens of Canada, they are also 
citizens of Quebec. I would like to work co-operatively with Mr.

	In the last four years, over 400 pages of studies and reports 
have been produced by that department on the Omnibus air

of food remains so high, in spite of substantial subsidies?

	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

It is distance. It costs money to send food that far.

	The alternative to living as Canadians in their environment is 
to move everybody to Montreal, which we do not want. We want 
them to live there. We want them to live peacefully in our

<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board

one of the reasons we need this information is to do a thorough

performing government work. But without the proper

Act. The minister's record as far as his department's services in 
French are concerned is pretty shaky, since the air navigation 
system still does not to provide services in French throughout 
Quebec's air space.
<P>
	Could the minister let us know the results of his enquiries with 
respect to Air Canada and could he give us the assurance that the 
future privatization of CN and the air navigation system will not 
be used as an excuse for lax implementation of the Official 
Languages Act?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when another hon. member raised the question with 
respect to ads placed by Air Canada looking for qualified 
personnel, the ads clearly stated that bilingualism in one case 
was required, a third language was an advantage to anybody 
applying, especially for cabin crew. There is no doubt the 
application of the Official Languages Act is essential to the 
operation of Air Canada. It is part of its mandate.
<P>
	I want to assure my hon. friend the obligation extends to being 
able to provide service in both official languages on the flights 
of Air Canada and we expect that will continue.
<P>
	With respect to the second part of his question concerning the 
commercialization of the air navigation system and the 
commercialization of CN, we will undertake to ensure 
Canadians who speak both official languages will continue to be 
served in the language of their choice anywhere in the country.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said 
earlier, the debate is on a motion, introduced by the third party, 
in which the Minister of National Defence is asked to extend the 
mandate of the commission of inquiry to cover all armed forces 
and not only the military unit in Somalia.
<P>
	I would like to explain the situation and the position taken by 
the Bloc. For several months we have been asking the 
government to consider the importance of establishing a 
commission that would investigate the situation prevailing in 
the forces at this time. The government, however, has decided to 
establish a commission that will cover only part of what we see 
as the real problem.
<P>
	This is a very serious matter, and Canadians and Quebecers 
have doubts about the credibility of those in charge of the 
Canadian Forces and whether they are doing their job, and they 
wonder whether all this could be improved. I worked in 
education for more than 21 years. In my riding, we had four 
cadet corps, two army and two navy, and I think the people who 
are involved in these projects do a good job.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	Now, however, people are not so sure, but I think we should 
not blame the entire military. As I said before Question Period, 
it is likely that only some of the people who make the decisions 
should perhaps change the way they do that. The Bloc Quebecois 
supports the motion of the hon. member for Saanich-Gulf 
Islands, and we think it would be useful for the government or 
the Department of National Defence to expand the scope of the 
study so that all this could be cleared up.
<P>
	I think Canadians are now asking questions about the quality 
of Canada's defence. As you know, this year Canada has 
projected a deficit of $33.5 billion. On the Standing Committee 
on National Defence, the Bloc Quebecois suggested cuts that 
would trim the Defence budget to $10 billion, but the 
government refused.
<P>
	The government is going to make cuts. It will cut $1.6 billion 
over three years, while we requested a cut of $4.8 billion over 
three years. Right now, the Government of Quebec is about to 
bring down its own budget. In that budget, ministers will each 
receive an envelope, and they will have to operate their 
departments with the funding provided in that envelope.
<P>
	I think the Canadian government could have done the same 
thing. When we sat on the joint committee with the senators, we 
were told that Canada was going to buy submarines. Fortunately, 
this is no longer the case. This is not a time of expansion, but 
rather of reduction. This is a time of streamlining and of making 
what we have as effective as possible.
<P>
	In the spring I had the honour and the opportunity to visit our 
forces in Bosnia-Hercegovina. We were able to visit Canadians 
stationed in Gorazde and another group in Visoko. We were able 
on site to see that the Canadian forces were doing a good job 
there. Now what people want is an investigation to see what 
could be improved. We are told that morale in the military is low 
at the moment. Therefore would this not be a good time for the 
government to set up a commission to look into all of this?
<P>
	As I was saying, I am on the Standing Committee on National 
Defence. Since becoming a member, I have noticed that the 
committees-there are 22 of them-sit a lot during the week. 
What is the real role of the committees? Is it not time in Canada 
for us to review the role of our House committees? The 
committees sit several hours a week and simply make 
recommendations. Unlike in the American system, our 
committees prepare documents, and often these documents, 
after having been produced at great cost, are simply shelved and 
never heard of again. It is as if the committees were used to 
assess popular opinion and to find out what people were 
thinking. However, the people on these committees, whether in 
government or in opposition, work very hard. We have people 
from Canada and Quebec appearing before us to express their 
points of view. Very often, however, these committees have no 
real power unfortunately. The power lies in the hands of the 
ministers and cabinet. I think it would be a good idea, as we 
suggested in our committee, for committees to have more power 
so that the government and the opposition could together 
develop a coherent Canadian policy.

<P>
	In the past 15 years in Quebec, military investment has been 
insufficient. There has been a shortfall in Quebec of $650 
million a year. Quebec is not receiving its fair share. They say 
that 23.5 per cent of Canada's defence budget comes from 
Quebec. But only 17.4 per cent of the total budget for defence 
and defence research goes to Quebec. As a direct result of this 
budget, Quebec will lose 15,000 military and civilian jobs. And 
this will create a spin-off and an indirect job loss of 25,000, in 
addition to the 40,000 other jobs lost each year, a 40,000 job 
shortfall for the past 15 years. While Ontario gets 73 per cent of 
the defence research budget, Quebec must be happy with a 
meagre 12.4 per cent. That is unacceptable, 12.45 per cent of 
research spending for Quebec when 73 per cent goes to Ontario.
<P>
	Only 15 per cent of all of Canada's military facilities are in 
Quebec. The closure of the Saint-Hubert base, which was 
announced in the last budget, will cause a loss of 600 jobs. Six 
hundred people are going to be out of work. The total number of 
casualties from the staffing cuts in Bagotville is 285 employees.
<P>
	We cannot help but notice that, despite commissions, despite 
studies, despite committees which try to strike a balance, 
Quebec is getting less and less, and that is unacceptable.
<P>
	Last year, the Government of Canada made probably the worst 
decision it will make during its four year mandate, and that was 
to close the Saint-Jean military college. And I must say that I 
have often encountered senior departmental officials who tell 
me in private and who will continue to tell me that it should not 
have been done. But they did it anyway. They closed the military 
college. I am telling you this not to reopen the debate, but to 
make the point that there are 13,000 bilingual positions in the 
armed forces, of which 7,000 are filled by unilingual 
anglophones. Of the 13,000 bilingual positions, only 6,000 are 
filled by Quebecers or others, and because we do not have 
enough bilingual members of the armed forces, the 7,000 other 
positions are filled by anglophones.
<P>
	They talk about having a bilingual policy, but it is just a ploy. 
If they ever were really serious about it, they never would have 
closed the Saint-Jean military college because that was really 
where they trained bilingual members of the armed forces. We 
will see, but I do not think that Kingston will be able to fill this 
need.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	I would also like to discuss defence conversion, because the 
budget makes no mention of it. There are more than 650 defence 
conversion businesses in Quebec, of all sizes. Quebec has lost 
10,000 jobs since 1987 due to defence conversion. Between 
1990 and 1994, 7,391 industry jobs were lost. It is unacceptable 
that a government which claims to be responsible, as this one 
does, has neglected to develop a policy on defence conversion.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois will support the motion put forward by 
our hon. opposition colleague because it is consistent with the 
official opposition's repeated requests to broaden the mandate 
of the inquiry on the deployment of Canadian troops in Somalia.
<P>
	Both the official opposition and the third party have asked 
questions many times, but we never received any answers. In our 
opinion, this commission should have been mandated to also 
look into all the other disturbing events not only in the 
disbanded Airborne Regiment but also on the base at Petawawa 
and everywhere else in the armed forces.
<P>
	According to rumours, which are confirmed by videos and 
other evidence, some members of the military go around their 
bases displaying white supremacist flags and wearing Ku Klux 
Klan armbands. This is totally unacceptable. If ordinary soldiers 
behave in this way, it is because they are allowed to do so. Their 
behaviour is accepted and may even be encouraged.
<P>
	I think it is important to find out if our military bases and what 
they teach our young people encourage racism, because if such 
is the case, it is unacceptable. That is why the Bloc will support 
my hon. colleague's motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to say that, to have a precise idea of how much the 
Department of National Defence spends in Quebec, you have to 
look at the facts carefully. It is obvious to me that my colleague 
opposite does not have all the facts.
<P>
	It is true that defense expenditures will be cut in Quebec like 
in every other province over a period of four years, and not one 
year, as this was suggested.
<P>
	At any rate, I would like to point out that defence spending in 
Quebec, including salaries, operations and maintenance, 
presently accounts for 22.2 per cent of overall defence spending 
and that, after four years of cuts, this percentage will only have 
been reduced to 21.5 per cent. This means that Quebec is being 
treated equitably.
<P>
	As far as capital expenditures are concerned, Quebec always 
benefited from the larger share in Canada on account of its 
industry.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I completely disagree 
with my colleague.
<P>
	A recent study by a Quebec university says that for the last 15 
years, Quebec's military budget is missing $650 million every 
year. I think no one in this House is refuting that. It is important 
to say that Quebec has never really received its share. All the 
documents we have received prove that.
<P>

	The Liberal government had one chance to promote 
bilingualism in Canada and it did not do it. It decided to close 
the only francophone and bilingual school in Canada, which was 
Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean. The Liberals decided to 
do that. I am sure that is the worst decision the government will 
take in the four years it will be in government, if it ever goes to 
four years. Who knows?
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would have appreciated that my colleagues opposite on the 
defence committee ask me questions on the importance, for 
example, of having committees of this House that are effective, 
committees with decision making authority. It is not the case, at 
present, in Ottawa. We have committees that sit, gather 
evidence, do all sorts of things, but when it comes to making any 
real decision, any major decision, it is then up to the ministers 
and the system. Ministers make decision and, often, all the work 
done in committee is ignored. It is a shame. I wish the 
government would take good note of that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the hon. member 
for Shefford. It is easy when you want to pick a target. It is like a 
child with a bowl of candy wanting to get the best one out.
<P>
	The reality is for those of us in Ontario, particularly those in 
Toronto, there is no federal government presence in the city of 
Toronto. There are 24 federal headquarters in the city of 
Montreal. I have never heard the city of Toronto or the province 
of Ontario make a big claim about that imbalance.
<P>
	The argument that because a college is in Ontario it is not 
bilingual, but if it is in Quebec it is bilingual does not wash. That 
supercilious sort of sham reasoning has been given the lie direct. 
They are working to have it work in Kingston. Further to that, a 
kind of insidious logic is taking place here. It has no place in the 
national assembly because it is being divisive.
<P>
	We have had excellent and outstanding generals from the 
province of Quebec, some of the very best and the finest both 
during the war and after the war. Some of the the very best and 
the finest of soldiers are from the Royal 22nd Regiment, and 
from the artillery, from the 12e Régiment blindé du Canada, le 
régiment de Trois-Rivières, l'autre facilité. Il y aura moins 
d'argent pour la défense, but it is made up elsewhere year after 
year with those 24 headquarters, the CBC, et cetera, in 
Montreal. Nobody is asking that 12 of them be given to Toronto, 
Vancouver or elsewhere. That kind of argument does not carry.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will simply answer 
that, in the current system, if you are a francophone and you 
want to get on in the Canadian Forces, you have to become 
anglicized. You do not have a choice.
<P>
	I will not mention by name the many generals I met who are 
francophones but, as far as I am concerned, have become 
anglicized because they had no other choice. If you look at the 
composition of the Canadian Forces, francophones can be found 
in numbers in the lower echelons, but there are fewer and fewer 
as you move towards the top. Take Canadian generals for 
example. Among the 136 general we have in Canada-by the 
way it is inadmissible to have enough generals to lead 250,000 
men when all we have is a small army-there is only a handful of 
francophones. And these francophones had to be twice as good 
as their anglophone counterparts to make general. And that is 
unacceptable.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	It is true that we have more francophone generals in the army. 
On the other hand, you will notice that there are very few 
francophones among the top brass in the air force and the navy, 
and that is a shame. Someone mentioned earlier that only in 
Quebec can bilingual schools be set up. That is not true. We can 
see what is going on in Kingston; it has received much media 
coverage recently and the press does report hard facts. Kingston 
is a city where it is difficult for francophones to live. It is so.
<P>
	By contrast-I would like to point out to my colleagues who 
may not be aware of this-in Quebec, the minority, which 
accounts for approximately 20 per cent of the total population, 
has its own elementary and secondary school system, its owns 
hospitals, two major universities in Montreal, namely McGill 
University and Concordia University. This minority also has a 
university of its own in the Eastern Townships. There is no 
comparison between the way Quebec has traditionally treated its 
minorities and how the rest of Canada does.
<P>
	The rest of Canada has a long way to go to catch up to 
Quebec's way of treating its minorities since the beginning of 
the Canadian Confederation. I think that the military college in 
Saint-Jean is important as a symbol and, as such, if we are 
serious about Canadian bilingualism, it should have been 
preserved. I think it should have remained open. It was decided 
to abolish it, to do away with it. I maintain that this may be the 
worst decision made by this government. It could make even 
worse ones; its mandate is not over yet. But this far, this is 
certainly the worst. And the worst of it all is that they know it. 
They know that this was a bad decision and they have to live 
with it.

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to join in the debate. The 
motion of the hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands contains a 
lot of credible and worthwhile information.
<P>
	Two days ago the minister tabled an inquiry on the 
deployment of Canadian forces in Somalia that had broad terms 
of reference including many of the valid and strong concerns the 
hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands has put forward. The 
terms of reference will allow the inquiry to go beyond what 
happened in the Somalia incident and what took place in the 
armed forces before and after the incident. It will go from the 
highest to lowest levels in its questioning. I hope the inquiry will 
exploit to the fullest its commission and will incorporate some 
of the concerns voiced by the hon. member.
<P>
	At times when the armed forces go through very wrenching 
changes in life, changes in direction and changes in purpose, the 
cement that keeps them focused is no longer present.
<P>
	At one time the newspapers were full of the cold war. The 
threat was present. It was real. It was easy to motivate, to 
stimulate and to activate personnel in the forces. The reality 
today is that with the disintegration of the Berlin wall, within the 
partners for peace and throughout the world there is not the 
tension that bonds, motivates and focuses the armed forces.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	One thing that causes that is the professionalism of senior 
leaders, officers and non-commissioned officers who serve 
their country through the armed forces of Canada. In my opinion 
there tend to be weaknesses when there is no stress to hold it 
together. The weaknesses become magnified because the press 
has time to focus on incidents. As a consequence they are 
sometimes overmagnified.
<P>
	We have the responsibility to execute and examine errors 
when they occur or flaws when they are found. The commission 
has the right, the full support of Parliament and the ability under 
the Inquiries Act to go beyond the defence act. It has the right to 
bring in witnesses from outside government and outside the 
Department of National Defence. It has the right to bring in 
civilian witnesses as well. That is what we have within the 
commission tabled by the minister in the House two days ago.
<P>
	The constant moving of families and postings that come about 
with a small army, navy and air force put pressure on families 
that we do not see in civilian life, except maybe at one time when 
the banks had frequent postings. They have been reduced 
considerably for a number of reasons, mainly costs. It puts 
pressure on families. It puts pressure on children when they 
move from school to school. It puts pressure on wives when they 
are at home a long time and their husbands are away  on 
peacekeeping missions or at sea on manoeuvres. It is one stress 
that is not found in a civilian occupation.
<P>
	The stress was focused when the threat was meaningful and 
ever present. People will often question why something is being 
done and the stress is put on the family. As a consequence it is 
difficult to maintain morale under those conditions.
<P>
	The lack of threat sometimes makes it difficult for 
governments to maintain levels of spending. Therefore 
governments turn to the armed forces and begin to cut, 
reasonably so because the hackneyed phrase, the peace 
dividend, is there. Past and present governments have been 
pushing back funds for defence, again putting stress on the 
forces in terms of concerns about job security, their future 
progress in the forces, et cetera.
<P>
	Under stressful situations people begin to look at the 
weaknesses in the system and speak out about them. The flaws 
become magnified. The press picks up on it because it is the only 
news in town. Then it becomes overmagnified. Those who are 
disenchanted and slipping information out in brown envelopes 
are those who are under stress or disenchanted. This is how the 
leaks take place.
<P>
	We have in this minister a minister who has exercised 
executive quickness and has reacted with a great sense of 
urgency and fairness. He has looked for and sought advice. 
When he received the information and made his assessment he 
made quick decisions in the best interest of the government and 
the people of Canada. I cannot think of a minister in the last 25 
years who has had more things tumble down on his portfolio 
than this minister has had over the last 15 months. He has 
continued to show fair-mindedness and good sense in his 
judgments on behalf of the Canadian people and in his decisions 
on behalf of the Department of National Defence.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	The minister saw that it was necessary to come clean and have 
a full and thorough investigation through the commission he 
established, based originally on the selection of the airborne 
regiment to go to Somalia, its actions in Somalia, and the actions 
thereafter. He is now free to let the commission loose with a 
broad ranging mandate to seek answers to those and other 
questions incorporated in the motion of the hon. member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands.
<P>
	A broad ranging mandate has been given to the commission to 
investigate the matter although its real purpose is to investigate 
the airborne regiment in its preparedness, its selection and its 
actions in Somalia, the actions thereafter, the actions at National 
Defence Headquarters, the actions of politicians and all things 
that go into training, morale building and genuine good 
leadership within the forces.

<P>
	The government tabled a report on defence in the House 
entitled ``Security in the Changing World'' which called for a 
number of things. We would like to see one of them, an annual 
debate in Parliament in both the Senate and the House of 
Commons on defence. It would provide an opportunity to put 
forward thoughts on defence. It would be important for it to be 
held as quickly as possible after the defence estimates were 
tabled so that it would be relevant, current and not at arm's 
length or distanced from the realities of the budget at hand.
<P>
	The report also requested that there be an ongoing standing 
committee to review matters directly involving national defence 
issues and that the committee report back to the House. As I 
have said, the recommendations were clear. The annual defence 
review and assessment would be one mandate that could be 
given to the standing committee on defence, making it 
meaningful and giving it purpose.
<P>
	The report indicated that there was a role for the standing 
committee to investigate and oversee the defence budget and 
major procurement by the government dealing with defence 
capital expenditures. The committee would be able to bring 
forward expert witnesses. It could call upon the Auditor 
General. It could call upon other learned persons within 
government ranks for their expertise. Then the committee could 
report to Parliament in a meaningful and forceful manner about 
its findings.
<P>
	I am very pleased to have joined in the debate today. The hon. 
member for Saanich-Gulf Islands made some very valid 
points.

<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	Many of the points he wishes to see covered could be tumbled 
into the commission that has been established by the Minister of 
National Defence and picked up and reviewed as part of that 
mandate.
<P>
	The minister has been most energetic, forthright and 
insightful in terms of the judgment he brings to the House. On 
behalf of all Canadians he has worked on behalf of the armed 
forces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened very carefully to the member for 
Perth-Wellington-Waterloo. I agree with many of his 
comments. I am concerned with the repeated suggestion in the 
House today from the government that the inquiry is broadly 
based.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, if I may I would like to quote from the 
committee directive:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-to inquire into and report on the chain of command system, leadership 
within the chain of command, discipline, operations, actions and decisions of 
the Canadian forces and the actions and decisions of the Department of National 
Defence in respect to the Canadian forces deployment to Somalia and without 
restricting the generality of the foregoing, the following matters related to the 
pre-deployment, in theatre and post-deployment phases of the Somalia 
deployment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Unquestionably I agree that fallout from the report will 
extend far beyond the Somalia commitment. I do believe that the 
Somalia investigation will concentrate primarily on that and 
will not expand its base to encompass the things I would like to 
see and which the motion we have made goes to.
<P>
	The problem I see is that I am not sure the Minister of 
National Defence really appreciates he has problem. That is my 
concern. The member mentioned the minister has been very 
good at seeking advice. He has not sought advice from our party 
on our commitment to Bosnia nor to Croatia. He has not sought 
advice about committing 474 members of the Canadian forces to 
Haiti. I suspect that he has not approached the members of the 
official opposition either. Is this the way the minister consults, 
gets input and appreciates the situation? I do not think so.
<P>
	We are sitting right now with eight days to go before the end 
of our current mandate in Bosnia-Croatia. The minister has not 
consulted us about this. Are we going to extend or not? We are 
told they do not know yet. Surely this cannot be the case. If it is, 
it is a dismal failure on the part of the government.
<P>
	Does the member think the minister of defence has really 
consulted adequately? Does he think the minister has taken 
every opportunity to allow parliamentarians to have input into 
commitments which put the lives of our forces at risk?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richardson:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a question of whether the 
glass is half full or half empty. The government made a 
commitment that before it would commit Canadian forces in a 
foreign country and under the auspices of the United Nations the 
House of Commons would be consulted. It was consulted. We 
had debates and on that. That is a step forward and it could be 
expanded.
<P>
	When we commit our soldiers, our sailors and our air men 
offshore in harms way, that kind of debate should be public and 
in the House.
<P>
	I do believe consultation can be improved. I also believe the 
minister is genuinely concerned about receiving that type of 
contact. I do not think he has been able to get off his bicycle 
since the day he sat in the chair and he has been pumping hard 
ever since.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	I cannot remember when such a tumultuous number of serious 
issues has down in such rapid action as has happened while 
during his tour. He has handled them well. I am proud of him.
<P>
	If the hon. member seeks more consultation I am certainly one 
in favour of seeing more consultation and I am sure he is. The 
private member's bill which was drawn up before he brought in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10910"> 10910 </A></B>
<P>
his bill is not uncomplementary because of the nature and 
broadness of this bill.
<P>
	In my discussions with the House leader he said this bill for a 
commission inquiry is in the broadest sense the House can give a 
commission. It can do more. It can call on anyone. It was given 
the broadest sense of opportunity to interrogate and call 
witnesses under this broad terms of reference. We can always 
improve on advice from all sides.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the comments of the member. For the most part they 
were a rational analysis of our military commitments and 
responsibilities.
<P>
	I would like to get his opinion on one other subject. In the next 
couple of weeks or so a peacekeeping act I hope to introduce as 
private member's legislation will be asking the government to 
make some decisions on how we can commit peacekeeping 
troops overseas.
<P>
	The thrust of my argument in the bill I will introduce asks that 
the government before we commit troops ask for authorization 
for the specific mission of the peacekeeping service; to specify 
the objectives, duties and role of the mission; to define the state 
or area in which the mission is to operate; specify the date on 
which that authority is to expire; specify the maximum planned 
expenditure for the mission. It is to do all this before we commit 
troops, especially overseas into some very dangerous venues.
<P>
	Does the member think we should debate these subjects and 
those kinds of details before we commit the troops? Sometimes 
it becomes cynical when the debate takes place after the 
commitment has already been made.
<P>
	Should we debate those kinds of issues or at least debate them 
before a commitment or after the minister has already made the 
decision?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richardson:</B> Mr. Speaker, it would be a sham if we 
debated after they were committed. It is then just an information 
giving session.
<P>
	I do not think that is the intention of the government. The 
government is committed to having a debate in the House before 
committing troops, as the hon. member has suggested.
<P>
	We are looking very carefully at costs. In some of those 
situations, for example in the former Yugoslavia at the moment, 
the UN underwrites a considerable amount of the cost and in 
others there is hardly any underwriting. It is only fair since it is 
the public's purse that these things be discussed.
<P>
	The minister is prepared to do that. It is all part of what has 
been happening, to get this going so there is more transparency 
and more input. I cannot fault the minister. He has made the 
point and he will continue to make the point that he will listen to 
that. The hon. member's point is well taken.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to compliment my hon. colleague from 
Perth-Wellington-Waterloo for an excellent explanation of 
aspects of this subject which I am sure all members of the House 
found illuminating.
<P>
	I still have difficulty understanding why members of the third 
party are so insistent on broadening terms. We have now in our 
possession and under way the broadest investigation and inquiry 
in the public inquiries act which has been conducted in the 
Canadian forces, if not in my lifetime certainly in 50 years. 
What more can they ask? They have said morale is an issue. 
They gave the reasons for the issue. They talked about the 
excellent leadership.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Any critic in any organization is expected to criticize. That is 
the job of the opposition. I find it interesting that a critic would 
make a comment that a minister may have problems that he is 
not aware of when that a minister is with his department 24 
hours a day. This minister has shown his acumen, his 
preparedness to act and the tremendous ability he has in 
controlling his department, notwithstanding the difficulties 
which have occurred since he has been minister. That point was 
made very well by my colleague from 
Perth-Wellington-Waterloo.
<P>
	How the opposition could say the minister may have problems 
that he is not aware of when it relies on brown envelopes from 
the media and the odd telephone call is difficult for me to 
understand.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richardson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have no more to say. I am not 
going to fill the Chamber with hot air. I did welcome the 
questions from the hon. member on peacekeeping and I thank 
the House very much for the opportunity to participate in the 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to raise defence issues which 
are vitally important to our national security.
<P>
	The issue which affects me personally is the closure of CFB 
Chilliwack. The closure is symptomatic of a greater problem 
within the military, that of the subordination of military 
interests to political concerns. Our military is becoming a blunt 
political tool rather than a sharply honed fighting and 
peacekeeping force that follows the dictates of strategic 
efficiency and combat readiness.
<P>
	The morale of the armed forces is being sapped by obvious 
problems such as the burden of top heaviness where the top man 
in the military collects $140,000 a year while the privates are 
applying for welfare. The gap between the general and the front 
line soldier is enormous. It speaks to me of diminishing 
accountability and slackening military ideals.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10911"> 10911 </A></B>
<P>
	We have a problem with our peacekeeping forces where 
political decisions replace military ones. Soldiers are put into 
dangerous places for undefined periods where they are 
sometimes, and have been recently, humiliated, held hostage 
and left to deal with inadequate equipment so Canada's 
politicians can save face on the international stage.
<P>
	I have offered a rational solution to this problem in my 
peacekeeping bill, which may soon be debated in the House. It 
would help Parliament decide the parameters of peacekeeping 
missions by requiring that members deliberate strategic military 
considerations before plunging into these war torn areas.
<P>
	There are so many problems in our military. No wonder a 
nine-page memo from Brigadier General Jeffries surfaced last 
week talking about the deterioration of the armed forces. 
Soldiers are frustrated. Allow me to quote from it:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My commanding officers are unanimous in reporting widespread 
dissatisfaction at virtually all rank levels. The bottom line appears to be a rapidly 
developing crisis in confidence in the ability of the chain of command to do its 
job.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The problem is leadership:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There is widespread belief that political agendas and careerism have replaced 
leadership in the defence hierarchy. The loyalty and focus of senior military 
leaders is directed upwards and not down, and that political expediency has led 
to a reactive rather than a proactive posture.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Can we think of a possible reason the loyalty of senior 
generals appears to be shifting toward careers and politics? 
Could it have something to do with the salaries, the office 
renovations, the houses, the perks, the golf vacations in Florida?
<P>
	Another example of political interference was the disbanding 
of the first airborne regiment. Because of some objectionable 
hazing rituals and some racists in the military an entire regiment 
was disbanded. I am the first to agree that the problems should 
have been rooted out. Instead, the minister shut down the whole 
regiment. The action was publicly opposed by the chief of 
defence staff. Did he resign when the minister refused his 
advice? He sat, tight lipped and accepted the humiliation of an 
entire regiment; a regiment which had an illustrious history. It 
was disgraced by politicians because of the actions of a few.
<P>
	A new regiment will have to be created, probably at the cost of 
millions of dollars, probably with most of the same personnel. 
The decision to disband the first airborne was driven not by 
political efficiency but by the dictates of political correctness. 
This appears to be okay with the minister and the generals.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	Another political decision has been taken by the minister and 
that is the decision to close CFB Chilliwack. I have publicly 
objected to this decision, knowing that I would be criticized for 
taking this not in my own backyard attitude. I want the public to 
know that I have  never opposed cutbacks. CFB Chilliwack 
could be significantly scaled down without any protest from me. 
I maintain that to close the base entirely is a strategic and 
military error. It will reduce the capacity of our nation to 
respond to various situations. Allow me to explain.
<P>
	There is no other base in Canada in which the military can 
train all year around. The topography is perfectly suited to the 
varied training requirements of engineers as well as combat 
troops. Part of the base is now moving to Gagetown, New 
Brunswick. The military considered this option in 1956 but 
considered it would be too costly and that Gagetown was simply 
too cold in the winter for these activities that the engineers are 
engaged in.
<P>
	We have 105,000 acres of training range at CFB Chilliwack. 
In Edmonton, where much of the base will be moving, there are 
no ranges at all. The closest range is at Wainright, 150 miles 
away, where troops and equipment will have to be regularly 
transported at great cost. The logic of this escapes me.
<P>
	CFB Chilliwack boasts 487 buildings worth $517 million, 
with $40 million spent on upgrading over the last five years 
alone. The minister hopes to save $300 million over the next five 
years by the closure, but he has admitted that it will cost almost 
that much to enlarge the base at Edmonton. I do not see where 
the savings or the logic is in that.
<P>
	CFB Chilliwack has not opened all the new buildings yet. It is 
preparing to open a brand new $10 million training centre in 
July, while at the same time other bases in Canada are spending 
tens of millions of dollars to upgrade training facilities at others. 
Obviously defence dollars are not being wisely spent when we 
are still putting the paint on the walls in some buildings and yet 
we are going to build others as well.
<P>
	I have other concerns. CFB Chilliwack is situated 60 miles 
from a population of three million people, sitting on a high risk 
earthquake zone. In the case of an earthquake, troops and 
equipment would have to be flown in from Edmonton, but to 
what airport? The area could well be inaccessible by air, so they 
say.
<P>
	A California company, Risk Management Solutions, has 
studied the seismisity of the Vancouver area and says the 
probability of an earthquake there with a magnitude of 7.0 or 
greater is 48 per cent within the next 30 years. This is only 
slightly less than the risk in Los Angeles and San Francisco. It 
would be devastating. An extraordinary response would be 
required, but the loss of the base would be one less resource to 
draw on.
<P>
	The emergency preparedness people in Vancouver are 
concerned about the base closing because of the engineering 
capacity there and also because of the stockpile of medical 
supplies. There are six 200-bed mobile hospitals housed there, 
which would be vital in the event of an earthquake or other civil 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10912"> 10912 </A></B>
<P>
disorder, as well as other medical supplies. Vancouver would 
have to go cap in hand to the Americans if the base closed.
<P>
	We have a national defence force with installations in every 
province. In B.C. we have developed a versatile base with 
excellent facilities built over a 50-year period and located near a 
major city and port. Now Canada's fastest growing province will 
no longer enjoy any land force presence west of the Rockies. 
This is an important issue of strategic concern to the former base 
commanders I have consulted.
<P>
	The military takes 50 years to develop a base and politicians 
can throw it away in one term of political office. What if a 
military problem should arise that requires the defence of our 
western seaboard? Will the government then re-purchase new 
land at astronomical expense in the same area to re-establish a 
new base? It does not make sense when the installations are all 
in place.
<P>
	It appears that strategic important considerations are not in 
parallel. Maybe there are other reasons. Perhaps the government 
says B.C. is a wealthy province and it will not feel the effects too 
much. I would counter that B.C., by proportion, already receives 
$700 million a year less in defence spending than it should. 
Closure will only heighten that regional disparity.
<P>
	A cynical politician might say if we want to close down a base 
why not close it down in an area where we have nothing to lose? 
The Reform Party did well in the last election in B.C., so let's hit 
them hard because we will suffer no political consequences. If 
that was true it would be sad. Yet the government seems 
reluctant to answer the questions which would put these rumours 
to rest.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	On March 2, I wrote a detailed letter to the minister asking 
him to respond to the concerns of British Columbians about cost 
efficiency, emergency preparedness and military reasoning. It is 
telling that the past five base commanders from CFB Chilliwack 
have also raised their concerned voices from a military side. 
They remain unconvinced, and have written letters to the 
minister, that it is in the best interests of the military to close 
CFB Chilliwack and leave British Columbia without a land force 
presence.
<P>
	It is clear that the decision to close CFB Chilliwack was one in 
which politics outweighed strategic military considerations. As 
a result, the capacity of Canada's armed forces to defend our 
country and assist in situations of emergency will be 
significantly reduced.
<P>
	The minister is coming to visit our base on April 3 and I will 
be there to greet him. It is an honourable thing for him to come to 
the base at this time and explain to the military personnel and the 
people of B.C. why he feels the base should be closed down.
<P>
	I hope the minister also brings with him the top decision 
makers in the military so they can perhaps inspect the facilities 
at CFB Chilliwack, and even at this late hour, consider other 
money saving and military options that would meet the concerns 
of the civilian and military personnel that have contacted me and 
meet the minister's own criteria for coming in under budget. If 
he can do that, then the Canadian forces personnel, especially 
those affected by the closure, will begin to be satisfied that they 
are not being manipulated. That is another reason why the 
minister should come post haste, make the explanations and 
listen again to the concerns of the people of CFB Chilliwack.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity this afternoon to speak about defence 
department policy and priority.
<P>
	I have risen in the House before to talk about defence 
department household moves. Somewhere with the bowels of 
the defence department there are some 200 military men and 
women who are performing a function that has absolutely 
nothing to do with their training. They are not peacekeepers, not 
ace pilots or tank mechanics. They are not sophisticated radar 
specialists. These fine men and women are immersed in the 
management details of packing dishes, moving couches and not 
scratching the coffee tables.
<P>
	Is this what Canadians want their military to be doing? Is this 
a function the government should be handling because the 
private sector cannot or will not handle without government 
handouts? The answer is no. The private sector has been crying 
out to get a crack at managing the household moves of Canada's 
military.
<P>
	Newspaper reporters have written about the horrendous waste 
of taxpayers' money. At least $10 million occurs because these 
military men and women are not much good at managing 
household moves. Television crews have documented the gross 
inefficiencies and ridiculous regulations that hamper the smooth 
move from one home to another. Even the government's own 
Competition Bureau has warned against the dubious tendering 
practices which could cause the major van lines to breach their 
1983 prohibition order against collusion.
<P>
	It is not that no one has heeded all these cries. The last 
government finally got its act together and disbanded the 
interdepartmental committee responsible for all this waste. It 
timidly agreed to try a pilot project to see whether the private 
sector could, in fact, manage household moves better than this 
decorated bunch of brass.
<P>
	The interdepartmental committee for household goods 
removal services to which I am referring, the IDC, has 
representatives from the RCMP, public works, government 
services and defence. Together they preside over all government 
funded moves.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10913"> 10913 </A></B>
<P>
	Did this project ever get off the ground? Did the private sector 
have a chance to prove it can move the military pots and pans 
cheaper and in a more timely fashion than a group of war heroes? 
The answer is no. When the government changed hands these 
heroes did an end run and somehow convinced the minister of 
defence that it had been beyond the previous government's 
competence to approve the project.
<P>
	The United States military has announced that it is turning its 
moves of over 200,000 households per year over to the private 
sector. Why is it that Canada, with 20,000 military household 
moves, cannot do the same?
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	The time is more than right. The finance minister has stated 
that the government should only do what government does best. 
The private sector has already shown that it was good enough to 
move the MPs when the government changed hands a year and a 
half ago. Savings of at least 20 per cent to 30 per cent can be 
achieved for the military as well. Does it really cost 
three-quarters of a million dollars to move military family pets? 
That is the number. The last time I checked it cost $50 to fly a cat 
from Halifax to Vancouver. How are we running up these 
horrendous costs?
<P>
	Here is another item. Does interim lodging and meals really 
need to cost $28 million? When the private sector manages a 
move it asks its clients being moved what day is convenient to 
load and what day is convenient to deliver. That is the criteria 
used when a private moving company is phoned.
<P>
	Anyone who has taken the morning off from work to wait for a 
delivery or a repairman knows how frustrating and costly 
inexact timetables are. If we know our household effects are 
being delivered on Tuesday we do not need a two-week vacation 
at the Hilton to accommodate it. On the other hand, if we are told 
that packing will occur sometime during the first week of June 
and delivery will happen sometime in the third week, as happens 
with defence department moves, then maybe it makes sense to 
plan a nice taxpayer subsidized vacation around a vaguely timed 
disappearance of our television set and slippers. It is a practice 
we simply cannot condone.
<P>
	These inefficiencies end up costing all of us more. 
Government is by far the largest household mover client. 
Government makes up to 30 per cent to 35 per cent of all of the 
household moves in Canada per year. When poor management 
permeates that large a portion of an industry, the effects pervade 
the entire industry.
<P>
	I call on the government to finally end this practice and to 
stand up to this little empire of colonels. When the Minister of 
National Defence is deciding where to make cuts in his 
department he should start with the IDC. I would not be at all 
surprised if he is fed up with that little bunch over there anyway.
<P>
	The minister should then move to privatize the management 
of all military and all other government household moves. 
Consulting and Audit Canada, along with the Competitions 
Bureau and Public Works and Government Services should be 
asked to prepare a tender according to treasury board guidelines.
<P>
	By acting this way, the minister will be doing the taxpayer and 
himself a big favour. He will be stating forcefully that no longer 
will move management operate outside the normal parameters 
of government. No longer will move managers thumb their 
noses at elected officials and no longer will move managers be 
accountable to no one.
<P>
	The taxpayer will save between $10 million and $25 million. 
The Reform Party will support the government for a wise and 
excellent decision. As a matter of fact, even a lot of Liberals will 
applaud this long overdue move. At a time when we cannot even 
afford decent peacekeeping equipment for our peacekeepers, it 
is appalling that we are wasting taxpayers' money in this 
fashion.
<P>
	Our peacekeepers in Bosnia could have used better land 
vehicles. It is also well known that our <I>Sea King</I> helicopters and 
our submarines are in desperate need of replacement. We know 
this will not provide too many, but it is an example of 
government waste that has to be cleaned up.
<P>
	I call on the government to act now and quickly to privatize 
the household moves that the IDC is currently conducting.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for his brilliant speech. He raises a point which I 
noticed on a number of occasions. I live in the riding of Chambly 
which, as you know, is adjacent to the riding of Saint-Hubert, 
where the base of the same name is located, and where, each 
spring, some 75 to 100 members of the armed forces would be 
transferred from the base to another location, and vice versa.
<P>
	There is one aspect of the costs which the member did not 
mention, but I essentially agree with his comments. In a given 
year, some 20 colonels and majors posted to Saint-Hubert would 
buy houses in Saint-Bruno, which is in the riding of Chambly, 
and borrow perhaps $100,000 from some bank for that purpose.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	The following year, these same people would be transferred 
elsewhere in Canada. It would cost them some $5,000 in penalty 
to liquidate their mortgage. They also had to pay $3,000, $4,000, 
$5,000 and sometimes even $8,000 or $10,000 in commission, 
depending on the value of their house, to sell that house. Since 
these people would often not manage to sell their house, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10914"> 10914 </A></B>
<P>
government relocation services would take the house back and 
support it for quite a while.
<P>
	These people would then relocate in another Canadian city. I 
know that, in Ontario, members of the armed forces currently 
enjoy mutation rights on property transfers, for amounts of 
$1,000, $1,200 or $1,500 spent by the government as refunds. 
All these benefits were in addition to those related to the move 
and which the hon. member who spoke before me just 
mentioned.
<P>
	Consequently, the transfer of military personnel from 
Saint-Hubert to Petawawa, and vice versa, involved huge 
amounts of money.
<P>
	I would probably be stunned to hear the actual cost of this 
musical chair exercise within the armed forces. However, I will 
admit that this was not necessarily a bad thing for those who 
benefitted from it, including myself as a lawyer. Still, we could 
not help but wonder how a country that claims to be orderly and 
one of the best as a member of the G7 group-at least this is 
what we are told by the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Finance-could manage in such a way.
<P>
	I want to ask the hon. member if he had an opportunity to look 
at this aspect of military transfers in Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for that 
excellent question. What it does is it raises a concern. It is 
another area I was not aware of. I think it is symptomatic of the 
serious problems that exist at DND. If the hon. member's 
example of these household moves with the transfers and the 
cost of mortgages is symptomatic of what goes on in the defence 
department, we have bigger problems than this $10 million to 
$25 million.
<P>
	This is a time when we cannot afford these kinds of excesses 
any more. Even if money were to be had, it could be better 
allocated in areas such as in peacekeeping to give our 
peacekeepers better equipment. We simply have to cut out this 
kind of waste. I do know whether we could ever afford it, but we 
certainly cannot afford it now. The Canadian public does not 
have patience with this any longer. It needs to be cleaned up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened intently to the member for Peace River.
<P>
	I have worked in this area almost from the first day I arrived at 
the House of Commons. One of the things I am getting used to is 
that change seems to be slow. Everything the hon. member has 
said is borne out by my experience.
<P>
	I am gratified and encouraged there is a review of the process 
going on at the political level. As the member knows, four van 
lines used to handle all the moves. It was pretty much restricted 
to a monopoly of those four van lines. Now that process is being 
opened up and two additional companies will be involved. In 
terms of the management of household moves, I believe the 
department is looking at that now.
<P>
	It was not too long ago that we had the case of a number of 
generals going south on a golf junket. The trip was cancelled by 
the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	Both the member for Peace River and the member from the 
Bloc have raised the point, which has unanimous agreement in 
the House, that waste is something which has to be eliminated. It 
has to be the job of all members of Parliament and not just the 
government. I commend the member for Peace River for his 
interest in that matter.
<P>
	This is an issue I have been working very hard on. I think 
changes will be coming. I wish to thank the hon. member for his 
interest and help in the matter.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from 
Waterloo. I know he has a keen interest in this area which 
actually precedes my interest. We have been working together to 
try to stop the kind of waste that has been going on.
<P>
	However, it has been a year. I have asked the minister of 
defence three or four questions over the last year. If change is 
coming, I certainly welcome it. I would like to remind the 
minister of defence and the parliamentary secretary that this is a 
perfect example of where we can save some money with no cost 
in service. The service can be handled quite well by the 
independent companies. I believe we should see a change here 
shortly and I certainly welcome that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate today. I 
congratulate my hon. colleague for Saanich-Gulf Islands for 
bringing forward this motion. Although I do not support the 
motion, I thank him for bringing it forward. We have heard a lot 
of debate here on the floor of the House today which I believe is 
healthy. It is what parliamentarians have to do in order to get our 
points of view across to the government so it can see what 
parliamentarians are thinking, especially on behalf of their 
constituents.
<P>
	Canadians are proud of our armed forces and of the work these 
forces have done both at home and around the world. I believe 
that most people agree with this point of view.
<P>
	Canada was instrumental in the creation of NATO in 1949 and 
maintained stationed forces in Europe for over 40 years. Our 
contribution to alliance security was highly valued. Even among 
the collection of first rate militaries, Canadian personnel are 
among the very best.
<P>
	Today we no longer station forces in Europe, but our role in 
the alliance remains a very active one. Canada continues to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10915"> 10915 </A></B>
<P>
maintain a full slate of NATO commitments and we are at the 
forefront of working for change within the alliance.
<P>
	We see the alliance as a valuable form of insurance, both in 
terms of providing for the defence of its member states and in 
terms of giving the North Atlantic communities a way to reach 
out to their former adversaries in their quest for security in the 
new Europe. Our personnel, respected for their professionalism 
and good sense, are playing an active role in this process as well.
<P>
	NATO does not represent the only venue in which Canadians 
are working for peace and security. Of course, the most visible 
contribution our personnel are making to European security 
today is through the United Nations. I am referring to, as has 
been referred to many times today, the leading role we have 
played and continue to play in the United Nations Protection 
Force in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	Canadian personnel are no strangers to UN operations. Since 
1949 we have contributed thousands of personnel in support of 
the United Nations. They have served in roles as diverse as 
monitoring ceasefires on the Indo-Pakistani border to reversing 
aggression in Korea and in the gulf.
<P>
	There are currently over 3,000 Canadian personnel deployed 
in peacekeeping and related missions. However, it is not only 
the scale but the nature of involvement that is changing. In the 
past our participation was limited predominantly to the type of 
operation undertaken in Cyprus or the Middle East entailing the 
positioning of the impartial forces between the parties to a 
ceasefire as these parties conducted negotiations toward a 
political settlement.
<P>
	Today the operations are more ambitious and the range of 
military activity is much wider and potentially more risky. As 
part of missions which are designed to restore order between and 
sometimes within states, our personnel have been asked to 
enforce economic sanctions or arms embargoes, create secure 
conditions for the delivery of aid, deny the use of airspace 
through which hostile forces could prosecute military 
campaigns or attack civilian populations in so-called no fly 
zones, and to protect civilian populations and refugees in safe 
areas.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	As these operations have evolved, there have been mistakes 
along the way. Unfortunately we must expect that there probably 
will be more. Nevertheless, the alternatives to doing the 
difficult and dangerous work for peace and stability are 
unacceptable. The result would be a violent, lawless and chaotic 
world which would be inimical to Canadian values and interests. 
The international community, Canada included, may be on a 
learning curve, but there really is no alternative to putting our 
best foot forward come what may.
<P>
	It is in this light that the experience of the Canadian forces in 
Somalia ought to be seen. No one regards the tragic events of 
two years ago with anything other than the utmost concern. I 
would like to take a few minutes to review the history of the 
Somalia operation and Canada's participation in it and to remind 
the House and Canadians that there were aspects of that 
operation, which have been mentioned here before today, which 
were not only well-motivated but quite successful.
<P>
	For most Canadians, prior to our involvement with the UN 
effort, Somalia was merely a faraway country perennially in the 
grips of civil war, famine, or both. All of that changed in 
December 1992.
<P>
	The United Nations finally moved to act on a scale much 
larger than had previously been planned. It authorized a united 
task force, UNITAF, to restore order and ensure the delivery of 
humanitarian aid in Somalia. The Canadian component of a 
much smaller UN operation in Somalia, the Canadian airborne 
regiment, was augmented and integrated into this larger effort as 
the Canadian airborne regiment battle group.
<P>
	The entire Canadian contribution to UNITAF, which included 
air and maritime support, including the support ship HMCS 
<I>Preserver</I>, was known as the Canadian joint force group and 
began to deploy to Somalia on December 14, 1992. The 
Canadian contingent was given a large humanitarian relief 
sector in the northern region of the country.
<P>
	The operating conditions could only be described as extreme: 
temperatures of over 40 degrees, the constant threat of disease, 
very little infrastructure, and the constant challenge of 
operating in an environment where our personnel encountered 
hostility from the very people they were trying to help. 
Nevertheless, the Canadian contingent quickly secured its area 
of responsibility and turned its attention to the humanitarian 
aspects of the operation.
<P>
	The efforts of our personnel in this regard were truly 
remarkable as they helped to deliver aid, assist medical teams 
and hospitals, rebuild infrastructure; repair and reopen schools, 
and train the local population, including children, to recognize 
land mines. Unfortunately, much of this excellent work, truly 
path breaking work in the realm of UN operations, risks going 
unnoticed in the light of the criminal activities of a few.
<P>
	Upon the discovery of the torture and death of a Somali youth 
at the hands of a small group of Canadian forces personnel, the 
Canadian forces convened a series of courts martial. These trials 
have resulted in the courts martial of nine soldiers.
<P>
	The completion of the courts martial paves the way for a 
comprehensive civilian inquiry into the entire Somalia affair. 
The government has decided to conduct the inquiry under the 
terms of the inquiries act. The advantage of this approach is that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10916"> 10916 </A></B>
<P>
the Inquiries Act allows the commission to compel the 
production of evidence and the attendance of witnesses.
<P>
	The government has named three prominent Canadians of 
different backgrounds and skills to conduct the inquiry. The 
commission has the authority to investigate and report on a wide 
range of issues surrounding the Somalia operation, including the 
chain of command, leadership and discipline. The terms of 
reference cover three periods of the operation.
<P>
	The first is predeployment. Here the commission can examine 
such issues as the state of discipline within the airborne 
regiment, its suitability for the Somalia operation and the 
adequacy of the screening and selection process for the Somalia 
deployment.
<P>
	The second is the period spent in theatre. In examining this 
phase of the operation the commissioners will probe such issues 
as the missions and tasks of the Canadian joint task force, the 
treatment of detainees and the allegations of a cover-up and the 
destruction of evidence.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	On post deployment, in examining this final phase of the 
operation the commissioners will investigate the manner in 
which authorities within the Department of National Defence 
and the chain of command of the Canadian forces responded to 
the full range of problems encountered in the Somalia 
deployment. The commission is expected to report in December 
and make recommendations to the government. More important, 
it will finally lay to rest a difficult chapter in the otherwise 
proud history of the Canadian military.
<P>
	The government is committed to moving expeditiously to get 
to the bottom of the Somalia affair. Whatever we may learn as 
part of the commission's proceedings should not obscure the 
value of the Canadian forces or the confidence the government 
has in their ability to carry out their roles.
<P>
	The Canadian forces are known worldwide for their 
professionalism and effectiveness. We all know they are in great 
demand all over the world. They are in demand for UN missions 
in NATO and working with their American counterparts in the 
contacts they forge with other countries.
<P>
	More important, the unique aspects of the military vocation 
aside, they are recognized to all of us as Canadians. They reflect 
our values, our history and our culture. They are not only a 
unique institution, they are a unique Canadian institution.
<P>
	They will continue to enjoy the confidence and the support of 
Canadians as they continue to protect our values and interests 
both at home and abroad.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member for Hillsborough did not exactly deal 
with the scope of the inquiry.
<P>
	With regard to the motion we have put forward today 
concerning the Somalia inquiry from top to bottom and 
complete coverage of that issue, does he consider that adequate 
to examine the inherent problems present in the Canadian 
Armed Forces today?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Proud:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands for the question.
<P>
	The inquiry as set forth will do an adequate job on the Somalia 
operation and on other aspects of the military.
<P>
	I hear questions from across the way at different times asking 
for these independent inquiries. This inquiry is necessary and 
will lay to rest the questions of Somalia. It will lay to rest a lot of 
other questions out there.
<P>
	I will not rest until I see the day when this type of 
investigation will be done from within this organization right 
here. It is my goal as a parliamentarian to see standing 
committees and other committees doing the work of these 
special commissions. When that day arrives I will have 
contributed my part to the parliamentary and democratic 
process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words in this 
interesting debate.
<P>
	If we are not careful we will end up with a military that we 
deserve. Perhaps our motto should be talk loudly and carry a 
small stick. That is really what we have done with our military 
over the years. We have said to them: ``This is your new job, 
your new mandate. We would like you to do this and if you do 
not mind, would you do that. At the same time it might be 
helpful if you did it with a little less''.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	It is not like dealing with the CBC. It is not as if it is not going 
to be able to show this program or that program. We are asking 
our military to put itself into the face of danger and very difficult 
situations. We are changing the mandate almost every time we 
get a change in government. We are saying do more but make do 
with less.
<P>
	Surely we should start to consider what the long range 
objectives of our armed forces should be.
<P>
	I am reminded of a quote by Peter Worthington a few years 
ago which I believe is quite accurate. He said the military in 
Canada has always been much more loyal to Canada than 
Canadians have been to the military. It is quite a profound 
statement because if we expect our military to be loyal to 
Canadian parliamentary tradition and to the kinds of objectives 
that we as civilians would have, we as civilians must have some 
loyalty reciprocated to the military.
<P>
	I will bring a few thoughts to this debate little different than 
many of the comments so far. I would like to put it into a 
personal perspective. The military has given an awful lot of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10917"> 10917 </A></B>
<P>
young Canadians a start in life, myself included. I joined the 
navy when I was 17.
<P>
	In suggesting I joined the military in Edmonton and went to 
Halifax, I want to remind all members in the House that 
Edmonton is a great spot for the military to be based, even those 
military people who will be transferred from Chilliwack and 
Calgary. It is a great home for those in the military and we 
welcome them with open arms.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Have you a naval base?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> I remind members that Edmonton is the 
home of the largest freshwater navy in the world, at the West 
Edmonton mall. We have more submarines there than the 
Canadian navy. We have it all. We have army, navy and air force 
in Edmonton in great supply.
<P>
	Earlier today I had the pleasure to share a few words with the 
hon. member for Bonavista-Trinity-Conception. Both of us 
being old salts, sharing this perspective from slightly different 
vantage points, he as an admiral and me as an ordinary sailor, we 
were talking about the military, about what has gone on and what 
the military means to so many people.
<P>
	The military to a lot of young men and women from the 
prairies was the first opportunity to see something of our 
country and to meet people from other parts of the country. The 
military to many people from the maritimes was the first chance 
ever to go to the prairies. That is how we got to know each other. 
In the military was the first time I heard anyone speaking 
French. I will bet in the military was the first time many people 
whose first language is French ever spoke English.
<P>
	The military is the great melting pot of Canada. I do not think 
it is good for us as a nation to lose sight of the fact that if we are 
not prepared for the unexpected, if we are honest with ourselves 
and see others as others see us rather than as we want to see us, 
we would have to say we are not a world player.
<P>
	If we are going to ask ourselves what we are, let us ask what 
we can be with our military and what could be the primary role 
of our military. It should be something that enhances the 
country, that is defensive in nature and defends our country.
<P>
	I read recently that if one comes down from Mars and has a 
look at Canada's military perspective one would think that our 
borders are somewhere in Europe. They are not. Our borders are 
right here in North America.
<P>
	Why can we not be the very best people ever for search and 
rescue? God knows we have enough land that we need that 
capability. We need to be able to protect our sea coasts and we 
need to be able to help each other in times of distress. Would it 
not make sense if our military objectives had some semblance to 
what we need as a nation?
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	We need as a nation the opportunity to share with each other. 
We need to be able to protect ourselves and we need to be able to 
protect ourselves from foreign threats. Would it not make sense 
to have a highly trained backbone of military and have a very 
broadly based standing civilian military, a huge reserve?
<P>
	Imagine if all the military bases across the country were used 
to provide an opportunity for young people, men and women, 
when they finished high school and are sitting around watching 
TV wondering what they are going to do with their lives, feeling 
that perhaps they need some growing up or some direction.
<P>
	Would it not be interesting if we could have these people come 
into the military, spend a couple of years in service for the 
country, get a sense of self-worth, a sense of confidence, and a 
sense of our country by going from one part of the country to the 
other and spend a couple of years in service to the country? That 
would not cost a whole lot more than it would cost if we had to 
have these very same people on unemployment insurance or 
pogey.
<P>
	If even a portion of these people joined the military and as a 
result ended up with a sense of discipline, the knowledge of how 
to get up in the morning and clean your own clothes and look 
after yourself which not everybody gets, imagine the benefit this 
would be down the road as people had this foundation of 
self-assurance and self-respect.
<P>
	While we are looking at the whole role of the military and 
while we are investigating the military for its actions in 
Somalia, we should not lose sight of the fact that historically the 
military has served our country very well.
<P>
	While we have a few bad apples, we should not paint 
everybody with the same brush. We should be very careful that 
we do not give our military a mandate it cannot carry out. We 
cannot on one hand say it will not have the funds necessary to do 
the job, but on the other hand say this is the job. We will have to 
cut the suit to match the cloth we have. That is the reality of the 
situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I had a chance to 
travel to over 30 countries around the globe and I share some of 
my colleagues comments that our troops abroad have made us 
all proud in terms of their contribution to the peace process, not 
only in hot spot countries but in every country they have put a 
foot on.
<P>
	It is a great honour for us as Canadians when we travel abroad 
when people see the Canadian flag and want to get one of those 
beautiful red and white pins. There is no question about it. This 
is precisely what the government wants to maintain.
<P>
	The government is trying to maintain the integrity of the 
Canadian Armed Forces. If there are some bad apples, as my 
colleagues have suggested, this is precisely what the govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10918"> 10918 </A></B>
<P>
ment wants to do, to make sure the tree  is healthy and all of the 
applies on it are edible; apples that are not only going to be 
useful for today but also useful in the future.
<P>
	I agree with my colleague that we should look at ways we 
could use our armed forces as an example for the younger 
generation in certain aspect, at least the aspect of discipline, the 
aspect of doing things with determination, with good will and so 
on. It is worth while exploring all those opportunities.
<P>
	Does the Reform Party have a specific proposal to make 
before the House of Commons when it comes to this issue. If so, 
would he share it with us?
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> No, Mr. Speaker. This is part of my own 
personal crusade to add the whole notion of responsibility to 
being a Canadian citizen. We take for granted the fact that we 
have rights and privileges. Our Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
tells us so. Nowhere in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms does 
it say we have rights and we have freedoms and we have a 
corresponding responsibility.
<P>
	I want to move all members of the House to start to think in 
terms of responsibilities. We should get our young folks to think 
they have the benefit of being a citizen of this fantastic country. 
What are their responsibilities to this country? What do they 
have to give back? What do they have to give before they can 
take from this wonderful country? We will have achieved 
something.
<P>
	If we were to use our military and use the bases we have, the 
capital cost of one aircraft or one ship could keep a whole lot of 
young people busy learning about life for a year, half a year, two 
years, whatever it might be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a long time ago when I was at staff college I wrote a 
paper which suggested something along the lines that the 
member for Edmonton Southwest has mentioned.
<P>
	The thrust was basically that at a given time in an individual's 
life, perhaps at the end of high school or at perhaps age 18 or 19, 
whichever came first, the individual would have the opportunity 
to leave the school system and involve himself or herself in 
repaying to the country what the country had put into them. It 
did not have to be in the military. It could be in the park service, 
a teacher's assistant and so on.
<P>
	I would ask the member for Edmonton Southwest whether he 
considers this a viable proposition, understanding Canadians 
reject regimentation. Would this be a viable proposition? If so, 
at what point in a person's life would he suggest this take place?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an interesting question. I 
posed that question in the media some time ago. It struck an 
extremely resonant chord in Canada.
<P>
	The average Canadian sincerely believes it is not all a one way 
street. The average Canadian intuitively knows that if we see 
young people hanging around shopping centres, if we see young 
people with no sense of direction, if we see young people 
looking at life and are afraid because they see many of their 
peers not achieving success or not doing anything positive with 
their lives, they instinctively say there has to be something we 
can do that is better.
<P>
	To automatically reject any notion of discipline or military 
training because it offends the sensibilities of people who think 
we should be making love and not war is to ignore the fact that 
people need in their lives discipline. Especially young people 
need in their lives a sense of strength, a sense of belonging and a 
sense of self-confidence that comes from that discipline.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. It is my duty, 
pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows: the hon. member for Cumberland-Colchester-Small 
business; the hon. member for Mercier-Rail transport.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I stand in defence of our armed forces and the many 
excellent highly professional people who make up our military.
<P>
	In this regard the Government of Canada has shown a great 
deal of leadership in the area of publishing a new white paper on 
defence. I believe the government has provided a defence 
policy-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I believe it was 
our speaking rotation. The hon. member for Edmonton 
Southwest spoke for half the period. The hon. member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan is to fulfil the commitment.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands reminds me, and I do apologize to the 
House. I will seek the understanding of the member for 
Annapolis Valley-Hants that the Reform Party had given an 
indication earlier this day it would be splitting its time and I 
failed to take that into account.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, through this motion and the debates herein, Reform is 
trying to tell the government and the people of Canada there are 
weaknesses appearing in many areas of the Department of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10919"> 10919 </A></B>
<P>
National Defence. The government's reaction to these faults is 
not good enough. We are saying that its leadership is inadequate 
and so is its management.
<P>
	Let us look at the airborne regiment. I applaud the fact that the 
inquiry is finally underway. It should have taken place long ago. 
There has been ample evidence since the government has been in 
power to indicate there was something wrong in the regiment. 
Why did it let it fester?
<P>
	If the government had launched an inquiry a year ago it would 
have spared us all a lot of misery and would have spared the 
sullying of the reputations of many fine people.
<P>
	The government did not act. As late as September last the 
minister said no to holding an inquiry. If an inquiry had been 
held, as we advocated, Major Armstrong, a Canadian forces 
medical officer, would have testified and had an outlet for his 
pent up concerns. The result would have been no adverse 
publicity for the forces. By the same token, it is probable we 
would not have had to go through the public video agony as these 
also would have found outlet in the inquiry. The government is 
not doing things in the proper order.
<P>
	While we are on the subject of the airborne regiment, I would 
like to use that situation to underline why our motion in part 
condemns the government's failure to hold senior officials 
accountable for command and control shortcomings and 
deteriorating morale. It started with Private Kyle Brown instead 
of starting at the top.
<P>
	I cannot believe the command structure of the Canadian 
forces did not know for quite some time there were problems in 
the airborne. I presume the Létourneau inquiry will identify the 
degree to which senior personnel were aware of and responsible 
for the deteriorating situation. Welcome as the inquiry is, it is 
too late to save the reputations of hard working professional 
soldiers and too late to save a fine regiment.
<P>
	Let us look at the defence review. Once again we laud the 
government for taking the initiative to open up discussions in 
the House on defence matters and for conducting a defence 
review. Here again the government had it backwards. The 
review of our foreign policy should have come first. Defence 
policy is a function of foreign policy.
<P>
	The other problem is that the government is not paying 
attention to what is being said. There is no point in having a 
defence review if we ignore some of its findings. Four examples 
have been ignored; personnel cuts to the forces, the budget cut 
6,700 more than the review recommended.
<P>
	Cuts to the defence budget, headquarters staff cuts, a study of 
the reorganization of national defence headquarters, creation of 
a standing joint committee on defence, review of capital 
expenditures over $30 million before a proposed committee, an 
annual review by the minister, an annual debate of defence 
policy by Parliament-these things recommended duly by the 
committee appointed have been ignored. We heard nothing 
about them.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Let us look at base closures and the rationalisation of DND's 
infrastructure. Once again I compliment the government on its 
gumption in getting on with the job. Many of this minister's 
predecessors have found it too politically difficult a task to take 
on.
<P>
	My complaints with the government methodology are now 
confined to the apparent lack of planning that went into the 
decision to close the bases at Calgary and Chilliwack. Since this 
has already been covered today by my colleagues, I will leave it 
at that.
<P>
	On my own turf national defence is closing the Nanaimo army 
camp. The community, as it seems typical for the west, has 
pretty much accepted this partly because it could bring positive 
things along with it in using the land for other purposes.
<P>
	According to what I hear, resulting from the first negotiating 
meeting that took place this week with the community, national 
defence's primary interest is not the community. It is selling the 
land at market value and is concerned about native land claims. 
That is the highest priority on its list. That does not make the 
city of Nanaimo and surrounding areas too enthusiastic.
<P>
	Let us look at morale in the department and in the Canadian 
forces. We had Colonel Oehring's report in December. He was 
mainly discussing a morale problem which he summed up as a 
loss of confidence and trust. Without these an army cannot 
operate. Colonel Oehring talked about an increasingly impotent 
military leadership and an uncaring system. He cites the 
widening gap between leaders and the led. He states the crisis of 
confidence must be at least acknowledged at the highest levels, 
and that is not being done. He believes it will take a public 
commitment by the Minister of National Defence, even the 
Prime Minister, to restore soldiers' lost and destroyed 
confidence.
<P>
	What has the minister done to restore this confidence? The 
latest report dated March 1995 comes from Brigadier General 
Jeffries at Petawawa, whose assessment after consulting all of 
his commanding officers was that morale for the moment is in 
large part satisfactory, but that there is widespread 
dissatisfaction at virtually all rank levels.
<P>
	Part of this dissatisfaction is directly attributable to the 
highest levels of leadership and management in the department 
and in the Canadian forces. At this level we want more from our 
soldiers than we are prepared to pay for. Here too, as in other 
things, we are living beyond our means. The soldiers' 
perception is that their interests and welfare are being sacrificed 
so that senior leaders can be successful in delivering the same 
bang for a much less buck.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10920"> 10920 </A></B>
<P>
	Resolution of this problem must start at the very top. What is 
the minister doing about the morale and leadership in the 
department and in the Canadian forces?
<P>
	Other things are amiss besides morale and leadership and 
there is no evidence that anything is being done. We hear reports 
of financial excesses by senior officers, reports of excessive 
expenditures on furniture and living allowances. What is being 
done? How does the ordinary soldier feel about his sacrifices, 
about his having to moonlight when his superiors spend 
irresponsibly?
<P>
	What about the unanswered questions regarding former 
deputy minister Bob Fowler? There is a long list of questions 
which the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs did not deal 
with earlier this week. The air should be cleared on matters like 
this: here are the allegations, answer them. If Mr. Fowler has 
done nothing wrong, let everyone know about it.
<P>
	The Reform motion today condemns the government for 
decisions which have diminished Canada's defence posture; 
decisions like the EH-101 helicopter. We could spend a day on 
that one. There is CFB Cornwallis, the size of the Canadian 
forces, the reserves. What is going to happen to the militia?
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	There is a long list of problems to address and it is not 
happening. Or if they are being addressed, then Parliament and 
the Canadian people are not hearing about it. When the airborne 
inquiry is over, we need a new inquiry, a broadly based, broadly 
scoped inquiry to be put in its place to address all of the things 
we have been looking at.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker I have a question for the hon. member. The debate has 
focused above all on the Somalia tragedy and to a lesser extent 
the Bosnia tragedy.
<P>
	Would the hon. member not agree that the explanation for the 
failure there lies in the failure to adequately define the roles and 
missions in advance of the intervention, the failure to separate 
and distinguish between chapter VI and chapter VII UN charter 
operations-peacekeeping as opposed to peacemaking-and the 
failure to adequately define a post-cold war military mission for 
our defence forces?
<P>
	Understanding as he does the doctrine of ministerial 
responsibility, under those circumstances would he not accept 
that the responsibility lies not on the civil servants but under our 
constitutional system on the Prime Minister and defence 
minister who ventured into those operations without adequate 
prior thought, that is to say the Prime Minister and the defence 
minister in the preceding Mulroney government?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with the member for 
Vancouver Quadra that there is a fair bit in what he says. 
Responsibility can be attributed to the prior government and its 
minister and the Prime Minister.
<P>
	It goes beyond that. I could carry that argument further and 
say we must. We have proposed that the House be involved in the 
decisions to deploy Canadian troops, that we must do that. It is a 
good point and well made. Beyond that there are other areas.
<P>
	There are continuing problems. There is a problem even in 
Somalia with the leadership of the Canadian forces. Therefore I 
have to attribute part of the blame to the government of the day 
for not taking hold of these problems and saying: ``What can we 
do about them?'' Let us get them out in the open. Let us clarify 
them. Let us not condemn the people who are innocent in this 
process.
<P>
	Yes, there is something to what the member says. Some blame 
can be attributed to the previous government, but also to this 
current government. It has to get on with rectifying things.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased today to stand in defence of our armed 
forces and the many excellent, highly professional people who 
make up the military.
<P>
	The Government of Canada has shown leadership in this area 
by publishing a new white paper on defence. I believe it has 
provided a defence policy which gives the Canadian forces the 
clear direction required in these uncertain times.
<P>
	As the Minister of National Defence detailed previously, 
senior military officers are providing leadership. This is 
evidenced by the effectiveness of our forces at home and abroad.
<P>
	This debate has special importance for me because in my 
riding of Annapolis Valley-Hants I have a significant number 
of military personnel stationed at CFB Greenwood and at Camp 
Aldershot. I have had the pleasure of meeting with many of these 
people over the last number of years.
<P>
	I am most impressed by the dedication, professionalism and 
commitment of the men and women of the Canadian Armed 
Forces. They do their work with little or no public recognition. 
Yet our military continues to make significant contributions 
around the world.
<P>
	The growing burden of public sector debt over the last 20 
years has affected all Canadians. DND and the Canadian forces 
have rightly been expected to contribute their fair share to 
reduce the nation's deficit.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10921"> 10921 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	In 1989 DND and the Canadian Armed Forces suffered deep 
cuts to personnel, capital purchases and infrastructure. The most 
recent federal budget continues that trend.
<P>
	I am certainly not suggesting that members of the Department 
of National Defence or the Canadian forces are resentful of 
having to do their part. It is quite the opposite. They, like many 
Canadians serving in the defence of Canada, are interested in 
understanding the need to do their part for the national effort to 
reduce the deficit.
<P>
	There is no denying however that fiscal restraint generates 
stress and uncertainty, a situation certainly not unique to the 
Canadian forces. Downsizing the Canadian forces means that 
expectations of a secure military career with unlimited 
advancement can no longer be met. Salaries and incentive pay 
have been frozen. Some of the rank and file, particularly those 
with less than four years' service, may find it difficult at times to 
make ends meet.
<P>
	Under these trying circumstances, it is imperative that the 
leadership in DND and the Canadian forces take positive action 
to improve morale. They must deal with the problems being 
faced by those under their charge. I contend they are doing that.
<P>
	Senior leaders are constantly in touch with their men and 
women in the forces. They will remain so to explain what is 
happening and to detail actions being taken on their behalf.
<P>
	There are a number of workforce pressures that our forces 
experience. Economic and social changes, as we know, have had 
dramatic impact on the nature of the Canadian family and the 
workforce. Marriages in which both spouses work are becoming 
the dominant trend.
<P>
	The Canadian forces are like a microcosm of the larger 
Canadian society and therefore reflect these trends. Between 
1980 and 1990 the number of military couples in the Canadian 
forces tripled. The majority of the force members are now either 
married or single parents. Among married couples, the number 
with families and working spouses is significant. This 
development has put pressure on the military as members are 
understandably seeking family, career, financial and 
educational stability.
<P>
	DND and the Canadian forces have added the challenge of 
balancing the needs of their members with the needs of 
operational requirements and effectiveness.
<P>
	Many career paths are being restructured to reduce the 
number of postings and assignments that a member of the 
Canadian forces can expect over a lifetime of service. This 
policy will result in fewer relocations, easing the burden on 
military personnel and families. Ways to alleviate the stress and 
hardship caused by moves that are frequent in comparison with 
civilians are being highly examined.
<P>
	There is also social change. Over the past 15 years society has 
embraced a new idealism based on individual human rights and 
freedoms. This is reflected in legislation such as the Human 
Rights Act, the Privacy Act and the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms. It is the task of the leaders within DND and the 
Canadian forces to identify and respond appropriately to such 
changes. It is clear that DND and the Canadian forces have 
managed to do just that.
<P>
	Canada's human rights legislation has been actively 
addressed in both spirit and letter. As a result, the role of women 
in the military has been enhanced. The percentage of women in 
the Canadian forces is among the highest of any military force in 
the world. Nevertheless, DND and the forces have reinforced 
their commitment to make military careers more attractive to 
women.
<P>
	The ability of DND and the Canadian forces to adapt and 
respond to societal pressures stands in testament to their 
leaders. As with good leadership, good morale is likewise 
integral to the success of the Canadian forces.
<P>
	Lately we have been hearing much about the morale of the 
military. Members opposite have been suggesting that the 
Canadian forces are receiving poor leadership and that morale is 
being affected. Leadership clearly influences morale. The chain 
of command's responsibility for morale was noted by the special 
joint committee on Canada's defence policy. This same 
committee however noted that the leadership provided by senior 
ranks with the Canadian forces is excellent. If morale among the 
uniform ranks is not as high as it could be, it is largely for the 
same reason that morale is not high elsewhere in society: fear of 
layoffs, fear of the future, fear of the children's future.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	This is not to suggest that senior leaders within the 
department and the Canadian forces can remain passive. They 
cannot and will not abdicate their responsibility for ensuring 
that morale is as high as possible.
<P>
	It is understood that like many Canadians, members of the 
Canadian forces are being asked to do their job with limited 
resources at their disposal. That is why care is being taken to 
address those needs that are most acute. Current plans call for 
the acquisition of a variety of modern equipment essential to the 
maintenance of multi-purpose combat capacity and capability. 
For example there exists a recognized operational deficiency in 
the armoured personnel carrier fleet. The Canadian forces will 
therefore acquire new armoured personnel carriers with delivery 
to commence in 1997.
<P>
	Furthermore, approximately 3,000 additional soldiers will be 
added to the army's field force despite an overall reduction in 
the size of the armed forces. This will help alleviate shortfalls in 
the field army's ability to meet Canada's international 
commitments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10922"> 10922 </A></B>
<P>
	A recent memo by Brigadier-General Jeffries has also been 
cited by some as proof of deteriorating morale within the forces. 
They claim that the blame can be laid at the feet of senior 
members within DND and the Canadian forces. First it should be 
acknowledged that General Jeffries states in his memo that 
morale remains, for the most part, high. Second, it must be 
realized that the Canadian forces have been under considerable 
pressure for the past few years. Memos such as the one written 
by General Jeffries represents part of the solution.
<P>
	To again quote the special joint committee, every 
commanding officer, indeed every military person commanding 
a unit of whatever size, constantly monitors the state of morale 
in his or her unit and takes whatever steps are required to 
maintain good communication within the personnel in their 
charge.
<P>
	Good leadership demands that we know what people are 
thinking and what their concerns are. Through surveys, studies 
and memos like that written by General Jeffries, issues are 
brought to the forefront and dealt with appropriately.
<P>
	In conclusion, the Department of National Defence and the 
Canadian forces face a host of pressures many of which are 
shared by all Canadians and some of which are unique to those 
who have chosen to serve the country. Changing societal 
expectations, limited resources, evolving demands on the 
workforce have created new challenges for all of us. Those in the 
Canadian military have the added challenge of meeting the 
operational requirements and responsibilities associated with 
any military force.
<P>
	Meeting these challenges effectively requires strong 
leadership. I believe senior members of the Department of 
National Defence and the Canadian forces are providing that 
leadership. Many measures aimed at addressing the concerns of 
force members have been implemented and many others are 
being examined. The chain of command bears full responsibility 
for the morale in the forces. The excellent leadership 
demonstrated by everyone from the Minister of National 
Defence on down ensures that morale will always remain high.

RIEL</A></H3>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ)</B> 
moved that Bill C-288, an act to revoke the conviction of Louis 
David Riel, be read the second time and referred to the Standing 
Committee on Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, on November 28, 1985, under Standing 
Order 22, better known today as Standing Order 31, the Deputy 
Prime Minister sought posthumous pardon for Louis David Riel. 
At that time, the hon. member for Hamilton East said, and I 
quote: ``Louis Riel, who died unnecessarily, deserves to be 
exonerated by the Government and recognized as a victim of 
wrongdoing''.
<P>
	The aim of Bill C-288, an act to revoke the conviction of 
Louis David Riel, which is before the House in second reading 
today, is simply to exonerate the victim of a conspiracy. The 
members of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs representing the Liberal Party of Canada and the Reform 
Party joined forces and decided that this bill was not votable, 
despite the fact that a number of government members 
welcomed it enthusiastically.
<P>
	It was not the intention of the Bloc Quebecois in introducing it 
to further complicate relations between whites and native 
peoples and between anglophones and francophones.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois' action is in step with work begun by 
Canadian parliamentarians, who, for more than ten years, have 
been asking the members of this House to rise temporarily above 
partisan bickering and join together to revoke the conviction of 
Louis Riel.
<P>
	Here is a brief history of the interventions preceding this one. 
On September 23, 1983, MP William Yurko tabled Bill C-691, 
an act to pardon Louis David Riel. He tried again on March 14, 
1984 with Bill C-228.
<P>
	A few months later, Les Benjamin, member for 
Regina-Lumsden, twice tabled a bill, this time to revoke the 
conviction of Louis David Riel-first on June 28, 1984 and then 
on December 13, 1984.
<P>
	On September 16, 1987, the member for Kamloops tabled the 
same bill. On October 13, 1989, Mr. Skelly, member for 
Comox-Alberni, tabled a notice of motion to recognize Louis 
Riel as a Father of Confederation.
<P>
	Lastly, on March 10, 1992, the Right Hon. Joe Clark, 
President of the Privy Council and Minister responsible for 
Constitutional Affairs in the Mulroney government and hon. 
member for Yellowhead, introduced a resolution, which was 
adopted, whereby the House recognized, and I quote: ``The 
unique and historic role of Louis Riel as a founder of Manitoba 
and his contribution in the development of Confederation'' and 
agreed to ``support by its actions the true attainment, both in 
principle and practice, of the constitutional rights of the Metis 
people''.
<P>
	The bill currently being debated in the House is identical to 
the ones which have been introduced by the New Democrats 
over the past ten years. Furthermore, I have been told that, at one 
time, there was agreement between the three parties, Conserva-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10929"> 10929 </A></B>
<P>
tives, Liberals and  New Democrats, to pass the bill, but it was 
never pursued.
<P>
	The bill we are considering today does not aim to rewrite 
history. That would be impossible. Riel is dead. And, anyway, 
the act to revoke his conviction aims to revoke his unjust 
conviction, 110 years after his death.
<P>
	On November 16, 1885, Louis ``David'' Riel, the Metis hero, 
was hanged. At a time when means of communication were far 
from being what they are today, the unjust hanging of Riel upset 
an indignant population, even as far away as on Quebec's shores.
<P>
	Less than one week after his hanging, on November 22, 1885, 
close to 50,000 people gathered in the Champ de Mars in 
Montreal, to hear the famous cry of Honoré Mercier, one of the 
greatest of all of Quebec's premiers: ``Riel, our brother, is 
dead''.
<P>
	Premier Mercier's cry is how any free person would have 
marked the passing of any just woman or man who was unjustly 
assassinated. It also is a cry marking the passing of a man who 
fought injustice towards his people.
<P>
	For this reason, the case of Riel is exemplary. I remember the 
resolution introduced in this House by the Right Hon. Joe Clark 
on March 10, 1992. Watered down to satisfy the Conservative 
and Liberal dinosaurs of the day, the resolution which was 
adopted unanimously recognizes that the Metis and Louis Riel 
had just cause to fight against the Canadian government. The 
resolution states, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note that the Metis people of Rupert's Land and the 
North Western Territory through democratic structures and procedures took 
effective steps to maintain order and protect the lives, rights and property of the 
people of the Red River;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note that, in 1870, under the leadership of Louis Riel, the 
Metis of the Red River adopted a List of Rights;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note that, based on the List of Rights, Louis Riel 
negotiated the terms for the admission of Rupert's Land and the North Western 
Territory into the Dominion of Canada;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note that these terms for admission form part of the 
Manitoba Act;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note that, after negotiating Manitoba's entry into 
Confederation, Louis Riel was elected thrice to the House of Commons;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note that, in 1885, Louis Riel paid with his life for his 
leadership in a movement which fought for the maintenance of the rights and 
freedoms of the Metis people;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note that the Constitution Act, 1982, recognizes and 
affirms the existing aboriginal and treaty right of the Metis;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note that since the death of Louis Riel, the Metis people 
have honoured his memory and continued his purposes in their honourable 
striving for the implementation of those rights.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Twice, Riel defended the Metis against the Canadian 
government: in 1869 in Manitoba and in 1885 in Saskatchewan.
<P>
	The legitimate, democratic and just nature of what he did 
must be emphasized. What Riel did was legitimate and has been 
recognized as such by all those who have made a careful analysis 
of the behaviour of the Canadian government's representatives 
in 1869. Even Macdonald later acknowledged that, in the 
circumstances, the inhabitants of the young colony had been 
obliged to form a government in order to protect their lives and 
their property.
<P>
	What Riel did was democratic. At all stages, Riel ensured that 
the people were consulted and that anglophone and francophone 
groups were represented in equal proportions, even though 
francophones were the more numerous of the two groups at the 
time.
<P>
	What Riel did was just. In his list of rights, Riel included 
representation in the government of Canada, guarantees of 
bilingualism in the provincial legislature, a bilingual chief 
justice and provisions for free farms and treaties with the 
Indians.
<P>
	Riel was elected to the House of Commons three times as the 
representative for Provencher. In an upcoming book on Riel, 
Richard Saindon, a CBC journalist in Rimouski, tells how on 
March 30, 1874 the then member for Rimouski, 
Jean-Baptiste-Romuald Fiset, took a hooded Riel in through 
one of the concealed doors to be sworn in as a member of 
Parliament and sign the registry. On April 9, 1874 he was 
expelled from the House. The motion was re-introduced, and 
when he was re-elected <I>in absentia</I> on September 3, 1874 for the 
third time, he was prevented from taking his seat.
<P>
	The strain of his battle for the Metis took a lasting toll on his 
mental health and he had to be hospitalized. He was admitted to 
the asylum at Longue Pointe, now Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine, 
on March 6, 1876. In May of that year, in a move to outwit his 
political enemies, he was transferred to the asylum at Beauport, 
now Robert Giffard, which he left a year and a half later on the 
undertaking that he would lead a quiet life.
<P>
	In July 1884, at the request of Metis, anglophones and Indians 
in Saskatchewan, Riel, who was then living in Montana, 
returned to Canada, to Batoche in Saskatchewan, to defend his 
people. On December 16, 1884, the organization representing 
the Metis and anglophones sent the Canadian government a long 
petition with 25 clauses, mostly about land claims, which 
outlined Metis and Indian grievances.
<P>
	Representatives of the Saskatchewan people requested that 
they be allowed to send delegates to Ottawa with their List of 
Rights as in 1870, so that an agreement could be reached on their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10930"> 10930 </A></B>
<P>
entry into Confederation, should they become a free province. 
Secretary of State Chapleau acknowledged receipt of the 
petition and then Prime Minister Macdonald, who later denied 
receiving it,  passed it on to his Minister of the Interior, the hon. 
David Lewis Macpherson.
<P>
	While Riel suffered renewed attacks of paranoia as a result of 
the tension, the federal government responded to the 
Saskatchewan people's fair demands by sending in the army. On 
May 15, 1885, Riel gave himself up.
<P>
	As for the trial which led the Metis hero to the scaffold, it was 
full of irregularities. Let us look at the facts. Militia minister 
Joseph-Philippe-René-Adolphe Caron sent Riel to jail in 
Winnipeg. For his part, then Prime Minister John Alexander 
Macdonald wanted to ensure a unanimous verdict. He analyzed 
the situation. He knew that people in Regina did not like the 
accused, while Winnipeg residents were supportive of him. He 
therefore decided to have Riel tried in Regina instead of 
Winnipeg.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	In fact, if Riel had been tried in Winnipeg, he would have been 
entitled to a 12-man jury, half of which could be made up of 
francophones. He would also have been entitled to a Superior 
Court judge whose independence is guaranteed by law and 
custom.
<P>
	However, conditions were quite different in Regina: with no 
guarantee of bilingualism, the jury was composed of 
English-speaking Protestants. The only francophone out of the 
36 people who were called had an accident and the only Catholic 
recused himself. A unilingual English judge, Richardson, was 
chosen. He owed his position to the federal government and 
could be summarily dismissed at any time.
<P>
	Among the 84 accused rebels, Riel was the only one tried 
under a 1352 English law rather than the 1868 Canadian 
legislation. The former provided for compulsory capital 
punishment and the latter, for life imprisonment.
<P>
	Although Mr. Roy, the Beauport asylum's medical 
superintendent, and Daniel Clark, the superintendent of the 
insane asylum in Toronto, recognized that Riel suffered from 
megalomania, preference was given to the evidence given by 
Wallace, medical superintendent of the insane asylum in 
Hamilton, who, on the basis of a half-hour interview, 
maintained that Riel was of sound mind.
<P>
	In his address to the jury, Judge Richardson appeared strongly 
prejudiced against Riel, according to Thomas in the <I>Dictionary 
of Canadian Biography</I>. In fact, the Macdonald government 
sacrificed Riel to the powerful Ontario Orangemen's lobby.
<P>
	To justify itself, cabinet goes as far as falsifying, in a report to 
this House, the report by Dr. Valade attesting that Riel was not 
guilty by reason of insanity. From 1885 to this day, every 
psychiatrist who reviewed Riel's case, with one exception, 
diagnosed the Metis leader as suffering from grandiose 
delusion. Finally, on the one hand, the Canadian justice system 
convicted 20 Metis and many Indians, but on the other hand, it 
acquitted two  White settlers charged with a national security 
offence, namely Jackson and Thomas Scott.
<P>
	Riel's assassination, while being the most visible 
manifestation of it, is but one of the elements of a national 
policy aimed at quashing any wish to have a distinct society west 
of Ontario.
<P>
	Francophones account for only 1.9 per cent of all immigrants 
who settled in Western Canada. It is therefore no wonder that, 
today, francophones account for as little as 4.7 per cent of the 
population in Manitoba; 2.2 per cent in Saskatchewan; 2.3 per 
cent in Alberta; 1.6 per cent in British Columbia; 3.3 per cent in 
the Yukon and 2.5 per cent in the Northwest Territories, when in 
the days of Louis Riel, the francophone community was the 
largest community in Western Canada.
<P>
	No wonder such an adverse immigration policy led to 
francophones becoming assimilated in a flash, as we can see 
from 1991 statistics, which indicate rates of assimilation of 52.1 
per cent in Manitoba; 69.6 per cent in Saskatchewan; 66.9 per 
cent in Alberta; 75.2 per cent in British Columbia; and 56.6 per 
cent in the Yukon and the Northwest Territories.
<P>
	In 1891, the Canadian government put a Quebec religious 
teaching order in charge of opening schools in the West to turn 
francophone Metis children into anglophones. A century later, 
at a mass celebrated on September 3, 1991, the Sisters of the 
Assumption recognized their participation in the cultural 
genocide of the Metis in Alberta.
<P>
	Louis Riel was hanged for being a Metis and a francophone, 
for having advocated a distinct society. I had hoped that on the 
110th anniversary of his assassination, this House would rise to 
the occasion and honour this man who devoted his life to 
championing the rights of his people. I must face facts and 
realize that it is no use.
<P>
	To those who strongly object to such historical reminders, I 
simply want to remind that to deny the past is to fail to try to 
understand the present and, most importantly, to refuse to give 
ourselves a future.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	We, in Quebec, have looked at these events of the past. What 
we understand about our present circumstances is that the rest of 
Canada denies our existence and refuses to see and accept us as 
different. That is why the only possible future for us rests in the 
courage and pride we will take in soon giving ourselves a 
country of our own.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to discuss private member's bill C-288, an 
Act to revoke the conviction of Louis David Riel, which was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10931"> 10931 </A></B>
<P>
tabled by the hon. member for Rimouski-Témiscouata. The 
preamble of this bill states that Louis David Riel, Member of the 
House of Commons for the electoral district of Provencher from 
1873 to 1874, was convicted on August 1, 1885 of high  treason, 
sentenced to death, and was hanged on November 16, 1885, at 
Regina, North West Territories.
<P>
	The bill also states that notwithstanding his conviction, Louis 
David Riel has become a symbol and a hero to successive 
generations of Canadians who have, through their governments, 
honoured and commemorated him in specific projects and 
actions. The purpose of this bill, is to revoke the conviction of 
Louis Riel for high treason. To that end, the hon. member who 
sponsors the bill refers to the role played by Louis Riel in 
Canadian history.
<P>
	Louis Riel was elected three times to this House. His 
constituents considered him to be a guide who was reliable, 
intelligent and educated. Louis Riel worked in close 
co-operation with the members of his community to help them 
identify and state their claims and their objectives. Louis Riel 
played a major role in helping Manitoba become a member of 
Confederation as a province, not as part of the North West 
Territories, and in ensuring that the guarantees protecting 
religion and the language were enshrined in the Manitoba Act. I 
think we all recognize the very prominent role played by Louis 
Riel as protector of the interests of the Metis, as well as his 
contribution to the development of western Canada.
<P>
	Some actions have already taken in the past to recognize the 
contribution of Louis Riel to the building of our country. Let me 
just briefly mention the issue of stamps, the erection of statues 
and the organizing of cultural events. Moreover, on March 10, 
1992, the House of Commons passed a resolution, tabled by the 
then President of the Privy Council and Minister responsible for 
Constitutional Affairs, recognizing the role played by Louis 
Riel.
<P>
	That resolution, which was passed by this House and the other 
place, received the support of the Metis nation of Canada and 
ended with these words: ``That this House recognize the unique 
and historic role of Louis Riel as a founder of Manitoba and his 
contribution in the development of Confederation; and that this 
House support by its actions the true attainment, both in 
principle and in practice, of the constitutional rights of the Metis 
people''. Members on this side of the House supported the 
resolution and recognized Louis Riel's contribution. Louis Riel 
paid the ultimate price as leader of a movement which fought to 
protect the rights and freedoms of the Metis people.
<P>
	He was convicted of high treason, sentenced to death and 
hanged. This bill, which seeks to revoke the conviction of Louis 
Riel, raises important issues which must be carefully reviewed. 
As I said, it seeks to revoke the conviction of Louis Riel, an 
event which is also part of Canada's history. In conclusion, I 
suggest that we take a look to see how we could implement this 
initiative.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak to Bill C-288, an act to revoke the conviction 
of Louis David Riel. I acknowledge and appreciate the point of 
view brought forward by my colleague and friend from 
Rimouski-Témiscouata.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament from Alberta, I am well aware of 
the controversial role that Louis Riel played in the political 
development of the west. Some historians depict Riel as a traitor 
who openly rebelled against Ottawa. Others consider him a 
father of Confederation who in 1870 negotiated Manitoba's 
entry into the dominion. Still others consider him the founder of 
western alienation movements which have protested central 
Canadian political and economic power.
<P>
	For over a century now this historiographical debate has been 
raging as to whether Riel was a traitor or a martyr. I do not 
believe we will resolve that debate today. Having said that, I 
believe it is inappropriate as well as unnecessary to revisit and 
to rewrite our national history. Granted, some of the decisions 
taken in the Riel trial are questionable, but I am not convinced 
this bill was put forward to simply right a perceived wrong.
<P>
	Thus far in the 35th Parliament, two Bloc Quebecois 
initiatives with revisionist undertones have been debated. First 
there was Motion No. 257 which set out to officially sanction at 
the federal level Patriots Day. On November 1, 1994 I cautioned 
the House that if it adopted the motion of the hon. member for 
Verchères we would be galvanizing support for a celebration 
with sovereigntist undertones.
<P>
	In addition to the examples I presented to the House last 
November, I have since discovered another one. It is in a scene 
from Denis Falardeau's latest film <I>Octobre</I>. As most of us know, 
its production was heavily financed by the National Film Board 
as well as by Telefilm. At one point in the film the FLQ 
kidnappers of Pierre Laporte made reference to their historical 
and emotional ties with the Patriotes' objectives during the 
1837-38 rebellion.
<P>
	Now the House is debating Bill C-288. Our hon. colleague 
from Rimouski-Témiscouata knows full well the controversy 
surrounding the conviction of Louis Riel and the national 
schism which followed his hanging and her eloquence was a 
statement of that. In 1885 there was a shared minority complex 
between the French Canadians and the Metis people. Both 
groups were francophone and both groups were Catholic.
<P>
	Today some members of the Bloc Quebecois are siding with 
francophones outside Quebec in their fight for greater rights. 
Since the collapse of the États généraux du Canada-français in 
1968 and more recently during the Mahé case heard by the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10932"> 10932 </A></B>
<P>
Supreme Court of Canada, Quebec nationalists have not always 
stood up alongside the various francophone communities in 
their struggles against their respective governments. Now there 
seems to  be a renewed sense of co-operation between the 
Quebecois and the francophone diaspora.
<P>
	With this bill the Bloc Quebecois would more than likely win 
the support of the franco-Manitoban and Fransaskois 
communities as well as gaining some sympathy for their 
cessionist cause. The franco-Manitobans and the Fransaskois 
alike must not forget that the BQ is working toward separation. 
The BQ may be considered in this case a circumspect ally.
<P>
	However, in 1885 the French Canadians were not circumspect 
allies of the Metis. They were genuinely outraged at the 
supposed mockery of justice perpetrated against Louis Riel.
<P>
	Considered by the Metis people as a hero who negotiated the 
Red River colony's entry into Confederation, Riel was once 
again called upon by his people in 1884 to lead the newest 
struggle against Ottawa encroachment on their land.
<P>
	Riel and his followers took up arms against federal troops. 
Outmanned and outgunned, Riel finally surrendered on May 15, 
1885. The prisoner was subsequently transferred to Regina for 
his trial. On August 1, after only a half hour of deliberation, the 
jury found Louis Riel guilty of high treason. Under British law, 
high treason was punishable by death.
<P>
	The conviction and subsequent hanging of Riel in Regina 
created great upheaval in Quebec. On November 17, the day 
following the execution, Honoré Mercier founded a new 
political party which included bleus as well as rouges outraged 
by Riel's hanging. The main objective of the new Parti National 
was to oust Sir John A. Macdonald and his cabinet. One of the 
Parti national's goals was to canalise and perpetuate the 
solidarity created among the French-speaking Canadians by the 
Riel affair.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	A week after the hanging a rally at the Champs de Mars in 
downtown Montreal attracted thousands. The crowd gathered to 
express its frustration with how English Canada had treated one 
of its own in the west. Honoré Mercier started his now famous 
speech with a call for solidarity: ``Riel, notre frère est mort-''
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mercier went on to say: ``By killing Riel, sir John not only hit 
our race in the heart, but he mostly hurt the cause of justice and 
humanity, which, represented in all languages and blessed by all 
religions, appealed for clemency on behalf of the Regina 
prisoner, our poor brother from the Northwest''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Also during the rally resolutions were passed which stated:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	``Whereas it is obvious that the government used this 
execution purely for political gain; that it coldly calculated how 
many ridings would be lost to a policy of clemency and justice; 
that as a result of these calculations, it sacrificed our brother to 
the hate of fanatics, allowing them to turn against one another 
the various races who, in this country, live under the protection 
of the English flag; RESOLVED: That, by executing Louis Riel 
on November 16, the government of sir John A. Macdonald 
committed an inhuman and cruel act unworthy of a civilized 
nation, and especially deserves the reprobation of all citizens of 
this province''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am afraid Bill C-288 will evoke if not stir these sentiments 
of English Canada versus those of French Canada once again. 
On the eve of one of our country's most passionate debates the 
Bloc Quebecois perhaps is evoking controversial episodes of 
our national history, episodes that tore at the very fabric of our 
country. First there was motion 257 which dealt with the Patriots 
and now there is Bill C-288 which deals with Louis Riel.
<P>
	Further to this discussion, Jeffrey Simpson stated in his 
December 20, 1994 article in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> entitled ``The 
Liberals refuse the queue that's trying to wag the government'':
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>History is always being rewritten, so that the devils of yesterday sometimes 
become the martyrs of today, and heroes in their time often lose their lustre with 
the passing of years. Understanding history is critical so that the errors of the 
past are not repeated, but retrospective justice asks today's Canadians to pay for 
decisions they had no part in making.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Jeffrey Simpson is right. We must understand our past so that 
we may forge ahead. The hanging of Louis Riel created a great 
uproar all across the land, especially in Quebec. Instead of 
evoking controversial elements of our past, should we not as 
legislators be looking for solutions to today's problems?
<P>
	I find it regrettable that the House is spending this time 
debating issues such as these. All of us as parliamentarians 
should be concentrating our efforts on finding solutions to 
present day problems. By saying this I in no way mean that we 
should not be proud of our history, that we should not become 
more familiar with controversial episodes of our national 
history and that we should not forget where we come from 
because as Donald Creighton, one of Canada's foremost 
scholars, argues, for a solution to a political problem to be 
efficient, it must be based on a sound understanding of history.
<P>
	When I say the House should be debating present day 
problems, I mean there are so many issues, political, economic, 
social, of great consequence. Even my colleagues in the Bloc 
Quebecois would agree these are  the things we should be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10933"> 10933 </A></B>
<P>
debating on the floor of the House instead of arguing whether 
Louis Riel was a martyr or a traitor. That task may be better left 
to historians.
<P>
	Without a doubt Louis Riel is a controversial figure in 
Canadian history. Some consider him a traitor, others a martyr 
and still others consider him the founder of the western 
alienation movements.
<P>
	Who are we as parliamentarians to revisit events which took 
place over a century ago and pass judgment on them?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
great pleasure to address the House this afternoon.
<P>
	I think that this initiative must be carefully examined.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	My intention today is not to bring back the past. I do not know 
the answers. As we know very well, there are people who 
question whether or not justice was served. I honestly believe 
that a number of irregularities were committed which clearly 
show that justice was not served. But let us not join the debate. 
Let us look at the situation today, at what people believe 
happened to him. That is what I am mainly interested in.
<P>
	There is a great deal of controversy surrounding Riel, and I 
think this is not the objective we have in mind. I could identify 
historians who could come and tell us what they believe is the 
truth about Riel. They are absolutely convinced that they are 
right, and I suspect that they would share to a certain extent the 
opinion of my colleague who spoke before me. Others would 
tend to side with the hon. member who delivered the first 
speech.
<P>
	So I will put all that aside for now. I would like to focus on 
what we know, the facts on which we can agree. For example, I 
think that we agree on the fact that irregularities were 
committed during the trial. We heard all kinds of evidence and I 
will not go over it again. I think that we should talk, as I did, to 
the Metis in Manitoba and elsewhere about Riel, because he is 
still a hero to them. They know, admire and respect Louis Riel, 
who is a symbol to the Metis and a number of other groups, 
including francophones, at least francophones in my 
region-and I am not saying that to denigrate francophones 
elsewhere. The fact is that we may know him a little better 
because we lived with him.
<P>
	He was elected three times to the legislature. There was a 
certain amount of respect on the part of the population. Whether 
or not we agree on his definition of society, he worked to define 
and formulate his constituents' demands and objectives. He was 
very sincere in doing this. We often forget that he wanted 
Manitoba to join Confederation and not the Northwest 
Territories. He wanted religious and linguistic guarantees in the 
Manitoba Act. He looked after, perhaps mainly, the interest of 
the Metis, but also that of the  francophones, of course, and the 
anglophones as well because, as mentioned earlier, he was a man 
ahead of his time. Even at that time, he was a man with a very 
keen sense of justice, a judgment like we wish we could see 
more often in many sectors of our society today.
<P>
	On March 10, 1992, the following resolution was introduced 
in this House, and I quote: ``That this House recognize the 
unique and historic role of Louis Riel as a founder of Manitoba 
and his contribution in the development of Confederation and 
support by its actions the true attainment, both in principle and 
practice, of the constitutional rights of the Metis people''. That 
is what this House declared on March 10, 1992. I was there. I 
even spoke on this resolution. If I am not mistaken-I did not 
have the time to go back and check- the majority, if not the vast 
majority, of the members present supported this resolution. I 
find this very commendable.
<P>
	As I said earlier, I do not intend to try to change or rewrite 
history, because I do not have the answers. But what I will do is 
look at who Riel is today. I shared with you, Mr. Speaker, and my 
hon. colleagues of this House what I was told by the Metis 
people, the francophones who know him, and the historians who 
studied him.
<P>
	This bill calls for Louis Riel's conviction to be revoked. As I 
said at the beginning of my remarks, I think this is something we 
should take a real good look at and I suggest that we appoint a 
committee, with perhaps one MP from each party, to determine 
whether or not this is feasible. Perhaps we could-and this is my 
wish and my distinct preference-find unanimous consent to do 
so.
<P>
	I will sum up with these few words in English:
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Louis Riel is a hero, a symbol. He was a political personality 
and a leader who became a victim because of a number of 
situations in which he found himself. Let us not kid ourselves.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	He was not treated like just any other individual.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We know that. We know it deep down in our hearts.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We know it very well. We know that he was a Metis and a 
Catholic and that he spoke French. And we know the at the time 
it was very difficult to be these three things.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10934"> 10934 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I said in 1992 and I will say again that Mr. Riel was a unique 
person, a historical personality. He was recognized as the 
founder of Manitoba. He has to be appreciated for his 
contribution to this confederation.
<P>
	I will repeat my proposal that we seek the possibility of 
forming a committee with at least one member from each party 
to see whether we can make this project a reality or come to 
some sort of satisfactory conclusion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to add my comments to those of the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata who introduced Bill C-288, an Act to 
revoke the conviction of Louis David Riel who was unjustly 
accused of high treason.
<P>
	The man who was hanged in Regina nearly 110 years ago 
today has become a truly historic figure in this country. He 
profoundly affected the course of events in his time and 
continues to do so today, in 1995 as we talk about him in this 
House, since his memory and his efforts to defend the rights of 
Canada's francophones and Metis live on in our hearts and in our 
history. That man was Louis David Riel.
<P>
	The story of Louis Riel is one of famous speeches, of noble 
resolutions to support human rights and of battles that made him 
the hero of many generations of Metis and francophones and of 
the entire population of Manitoba.
<P>
	As you know, Louis Riel was convicted of high treason on 
August 1, 1885. He was subsequently sentenced to death and 
hanged on November 16 that same year, at the age of 41. Those 
are the facts, but what did this man do to be accused of high 
treason? What did he do to incur this conviction and 
punishment? The reason we are still talking about the case of 
Louis Riel today, after so many years, is that many people still 
feel he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice.
<P>
	To this day, the Canadian government has never challenged 
the verdict of guilty pronounced against Louis Riel, despite all 
the manipulation around his trial. Now that the values on which 
the judicial system at the time was based have changed, it is high 
time the Canadian government made a symbolic gesture by 
agreeing to revoke the conviction of Louis Riel.
<P>
	Many people, and I am one of them, believe that the injustice 
done to Louis Riel, which continues today, arose from the very 
nature of the charges brought against him. Even in this House, 
the memory of Louis Riel has given rise to many discussions and 
to several unsuccessful attempts to do justice to this remarkable 
man, in the light of the extremely positive judgment passed by 
history.
<P>
	I am referring, for instance, to the bills tabled in September 
1983 and March 1984 by the Progressive Conservative member 
for Edmonton East, William Yurko, the purpose of which was to 
pardon Louis Riel. The memory of the Metis leader did not share 
the fate of the two bills which died on first reading. In December  
1984, the NDP member for Regina-Lumsden, Les Benjamin, 
made another attempt, also unsuccessful, with a bill to revoke 
the conviction of Louis Riel.
<P>
	On November 28, 1985, the present Deputy Prime Minister, 
Minister of the Environment and member for Hamilton East 
spoke out in favour of a review of the conviction of Louis Riel. 
She said in this House, and I quote: ``Mr. Speaker, we are now in 
November and one hundred years have gone by since the 
hanging of Louis Riel. I now ask that this Conservative 
Government exonerate the victim of the conspiracy of another 
Conservative Government''. The hon. member for Hamilton 
East went on to say, and I quote: ``Louis Riel, who died 
unnecessarily, deserves to be exonerated by the Government and 
recognized as a victim of wrongdoing''.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	The search for justice is irrepressible, hard to put down as we 
would say, since, in 1987, the present member for 
Kamloops-Shuswap tabled a new bill to revoke the conviction 
of Louis Riel for high treason. This bill, along with the motion 
tabled in November 1989 by the New Democratic member for 
Comox-Alberni, Robert Skelly, to recognize Louis Riel as a 
Father of Confederation, shared the unfortunate fate of previous 
attempts.
<P>
	The memory of Louis Riel was finally honoured on March 10, 
1992 by this House, when it adopted a motion by Conservative 
minister Joe Clark to recognize the unique and historic role of 
Louis Riel as founder of Manitoba and his contribution in the 
development of confederation.
<P>
	The motion was to the effect that the House also take note, and 
I quote, ``That the Metis people of Rupert's Land and the North 
Western Territory through democratic structures and procedures 
took effective steps to maintain order and protect the lives, 
rights and property of the people of the Red River''.
<P>
	With this motion of March 10, 1992, the House also took note 
that, in 1870, under the leadership of Louis Riel, the Red River 
Metis adopted a list of rights and that, based on this list of rights, 
Louis Riel negotiated the terms for the admission of Rupert's 
Land and the North Western Territory into the Dominion of 
Canada. These terms of admission today still form part of the 
Manitoba Act. In addition, the House took note in adopting this 
motion that, after negotiating Manitoba's entry into 
Confederation, Louis Riel was elected three times to the House 
of Commons.
<P>
	More importantly still, the House took note that, in 1885, 
Louis Riel paid with his life for his leadership in a movement 
which fought for the maintenance of the rights and freedoms of 
the Metis people. This was a clear affirmation, with no hint of 
criticism of the deeds of Louis Riel, quite the contrary. Lastly, 
the motion noted that since the death of Louis Riel, the Metis 
people have honoured his memory and furthered his purposes in 
<P>

<B><A NAME="10935"> 10935 </A></B>
<P>
their honourable striving to have us respect the rights for which 
he so dearly paid.
<P>
	A little closer to home now, the current member for 
Saint-Boniface, the riding in which the body of Louis Riel is 
buried, would go even further and would demand that we 
recognize the Metis leader as one of the ``Fathers of 
Confederation''.
<P>
	If Louis Riel has remained a hero for so many generations of 
Quebecers and Canadians, it is because of the reasons listed 
earlier and officially recognized by the House of Commoms. 
This House must be consistent in its own decisions and admit 
that it cannot recognize Louis Riel's role as founder of Manitoba 
and his contribution to the development of the Canadian 
Confederation, while still tolerating that his conviction for the 
offence of high treason stand.
<P>
	Riel was not convicted of murder, theft or vandalism. He was 
convicted of high treason. But how can a traitor later be 
recognized as the founder of one of the provinces of the country 
which convicted him? If he was even guilty of any crime, might I 
suggest that he was probably convicted of the wrong indictment 
for the wrong motives. We must therefore do him justice and 
revoke the conviction of high treason which continues to taint 
his memory.
<P>
	This is not rewriting history. This is simply repairing, in the 
light of historical facts themselves, an injustice done to Louis 
Riel. We must avoid giving the issue our attention only when it 
is convenient to do so, given popular opinion on the matter. By 
the same token, we must also avoid glancing selectively at the 
life of Louis Riel, retaining only the points which would allow 
us to make a hero out of him. Louis Riel cannot at the same time 
be both traitor and hero.
<P>
	As long as this historic paradox is not eliminated, members 
from all parties, perhaps even Reform members, will rise in this 
House to ask that we put an end to it. I am hopeful that, some 
day, justice will be done for Louis Riel. As we know, this issue 
goes far beyond ideological and partisan considerations.
<P>
	On February 28, the president of the Ukrainian Canadian Civil 
Rights Association, Mr. Gregorovich, sent a letter to every MP, 
asking them to support this bill. As Mr. Gregorovich pointed 
out, this legislation does not seek to grant a posthumous pardon 
to Louis Riel, but simply to strike down the conviction of high 
treason.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	It is in that spirit that I ask for the unanimous consent of the 
House, so that this bill can pass second reading and be referred 
to the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent of the House to pass the motion tabled by the hon. 
member for Verchères?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. There is not 
unanimous consent. Resuming debate.
<P>
	Since no other member wishes to take the floor, and since the 
motion will not be put, the period provided for the consideration 
of Private Members' Business has now expired and the item is 
dropped from the Order Paper, pursuant to Standing Order 96.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SMALLBUSINESS">SMALL BUSINESS</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	The Canadian Federation of Independent Business in its 
research paper and report on barriers faced by women business 
owners concludes that banks and lending institutions promote a 
double standard in their lending practices. This report points to a 
higher loan refusal, higher interest on the loans acquired and 
greater differential between capital applied for and capital 
accessed for women when compared with men who own 
businesses or male-female co-owned businesses.
<P>
	The prejudice on the part of the lenders does not match up to 
the reality of the women in small business. Because of careful 
attention to detail, careful planning and tenacity, women are 
known to have a higher success rate in business start up and 
lifespan than men.
<P>
	The CFIB as part of its research polled its 85,000 
membership. It found that of the nearly 11,000 responses, 68 per 
cent were male who owned a business, 25 per cent were 
co-owned but only 6 per cent were solely owned by a female. 
These numbers in and of themselves mean very little until 
compared with the exploding number of women entering solely 
owned proprietorships.
<P>
	Since 1981 the number of women owned businesses has 
nearly doubled from 323,000 to 639,000 in 1994. Current 
projections place the number of women business owners at 
680,000 by the year 2000. This is not a fad that will end with the 
women of this country being silenced by the pistol whipping of 
bankers. It is a revolution born out of necessity being a response 
to changing family structures and an increasing sense of 
independence.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10936"> 10936 </A></B>
<P>
	What is needed is either a change in attitude by the money 
lenders to accommodate this projected rapid growth, an increase 
in the number of banks and credit unions which cater 
exclusively to the needs of women entrepreneurs, or an 
intervention by government to ensure equality.
<P>
	It would appear from the CFIB report that in spite of the 
inroads accomplished by women during this century, the banks 
have refused to wake up to modern realities and still consider 
women a bad loan risk even before they apply. This is a handicap 
that must be eliminated if small business is to continue to be the 
main engine driving our economy and if Canada is to continue 
realizing its full growth potential.
<P>
	In the face of this apparent discrimination, what is the 
minister prepared to do to ensure a level playing field for the 
sector of our business community which is proving itself to be 
self-sustaining and very successful?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the question.
<P>
	The growth of entrepreneurship in the Canadian economy has 
been remarkable over the last decade. The number of 
self-employed women has also grown at over three times the 
rate of business formation by self-employed men. Today there 
are more than 600,000 self-employed women, representing over 
one third of all self-employed in Canada.
<P>
	Women entrepreneurs tend to be more reliable credit risks 
since they are less prone to go out of business than men. They 
should therefore be considered more dependable from the 
perspective of banks.
<P>
	Despite this, the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business study, to which the hon. member referred, indicated 
that women continue to face greater obstacles to financing than 
men.
<P>
	A recent study by Statistics Canada suggests that while there 
is no systemic discrimination against women entrepreneurs, 
they tend to operate businesses in higher risk sectors. In those 
sectors both male and female entrepreneurs face substantially 
similar obstacles to financing.
<P>
	Let me give some concrete examples of what the government 
has done. The Federal Business Development Bank is 
committed to helping women. About one third of FBDB loans 
are made to businesses with 50 per cent or more female 
ownership. FBDB designs seminars and conferences especially 
for women; 500 women attended these last year.
<P>
	The government has been improving access to financing for 
small business. Lending under the Small Business Loans Act has 
increased by more than four times in the last two years. We are 
pressing the banks to increase lending to small businesses. They 
have taken some steps to improve their services to small 
business. We will continue our efforts to ensure all 
entrepreneurs have easier access to financing so they can start, 
grow and prosper.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly, the House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.57 p.m.)
