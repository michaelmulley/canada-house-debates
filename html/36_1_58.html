<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>BILL S-4—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, I am now prepared to rule 
on the point of order raised by the hon. member for Cypress 
Hills—Grasslands on February 4, 1998 concerning Bill S-4, an act 
to amend the Canada Shipping Act. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I begin, I would like to thank all the members who 
participated in the discussion on this matter: the hon. member for 
Elk Island, the hon. member for Nanaimo—Alberni and the Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would especially like to commend the hon. member for Cypress 
Hills—Grasslands for having raised his point of order in such an 
articulate way that demonstrated thorough research and concise 
argumentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member argued that Bill S-4 violates Standing Order 
80 because it substantially increases the limits of liability upon 
the government, thereby infringing on the financial privileges of 
the House of Commons. 
He concluded by requesting that Bill S-4 be removed from the Order 
Paper. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to remind all hon. members of citation 619 of 
Beauchesne's sixth edition which states in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Standing Order 80, the House of Commons claims that all 
aids and supplies are the sole gift of the House of Commons and 
are not alterable by the Senate. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words the House of Commons claims pre-eminence in 
financial matters, that is, public expenditure and taxation. 
Public expenditure is sometimes referred to as charges upon the 
public revenue, and taxation as charges upon the people. 
Therefore, all legislation that entails charges upon the public 
revenue or upon the people must originate in the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To determine if Bill S-4 is properly before the House, the 
Chair must ascertain whether or not it does in fact constitute a 
charge upon public funds. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before doing so, I want to say a few words regarding one of the 
precedents cited by the hon. member for Cypress 
Hills—Grasslands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In support of his claim that Bill S-4 breached the financial 
privileges of the House, the hon. member made reference to a 
decision given by Speaker Lamoureux on June 12, 1973 concerning 
the then Bill S-5, an act to amend the Farm Improvement Loans 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time Speaker Lamoureux ruled that Bill S-5, while not 
proposing a direct expenditure did involve substantial additional 
liabilities on public moneys and therefore infringed on the 
financial privileges of the House.  Obviously Speaker Lamoureux 
could find no financial authority to cover such liabilities and 
consequently ordered that notice for first reading of Bill S-5 be 
removed from the Order Paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While looking at the elements of the case before us I have 
discovered that there exists very few decisions in the area of 
liabilities and how these relate to the financial privileges of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those reasons I have relied on the well-established 
principles described in the 21st edition of Erskine May under the 
subheading “Tests used to determine whether expenditure involves 
a charge”. In deciding if a proposal for expenditure actually 
imposes a charge, May stipulates that a charge must be new and 
distinct. This is explained at page 712 where it is stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question may arise whether a proposal for expenditure or for 
increased expenditure is not already covered by some general 
authorization.  The test for determining this question in the 
case of a substantive proposal, that is a provision in a bill, as 
introduced, is a comparison with existing law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comparison of provisions in a bill with the law on the 
subject, as it exists, may show that, while such provisions 
undoubtedly involve expenditure, the power to incur such 
expenditure is covered by general powers conferred by statute. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues, I would point out to you that these are very 
technical matters, so I would ask that you give them some 
attention.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding of the procedural implications of Bill S-4 is 
the following.  The increased limits of liability are set out in 
the proposed amendments to the Canada Shipping Act but the actual 
compensation available to claimants is subject to the Crown 
Liability and Proceedings Act, more specifically section 30(1) of 
this act which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On receipt of a certificate of judgment against the crown issued 
pursuant to the regulations, the Minister of Finance shall 
authorize the payment out of the consolidated revenue fund of any 
money awarded by the judgment to any person against the crown. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To further quote from Erskine May, it is stated at page 717: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where sufficient statutory authority already exists for payments 
to which bills relate, no further resolution and recommendation 
is required. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There follows a list of cases not requiring further 
authorization, one of them being case No. 2 which is “Liability, 
to pay damages, covered by existing law”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this says is that in the case of the Canada Shipping Act, 
provisions are made for changes to liabilities which, as the hon. 
member for Cypress Hills—Grasslands says, will create a charge 
upon the public revenue. However as Erskine May explains, where 
there is an act already in force to pay damages, no royal 
recommendation is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude that there is already statutory authority under the 
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act to make the payments that 
Bill S-4 outlines.  Therefore I would rule that Bill S-4 is in 
proper form and that it should remain on the Order Paper.

amendment) from the committee; and of Motions Nos. 20 to 30, 32

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
great pleasure to stand and speak but I must admit that every 
time the government uses closure it makes me extremely annoyed. I 
think of what my electorate thinks of this kind of procedure. It 
is so disgusting and so despicable.  This is one of the reasons 
the Reform Party was formed and why we believe we have to make 
changes to this place. This is such a disgusting act.  We all 
realize how detrimental it is to the democratic process and to 
any kind of respect we might have for a place like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments in Group No. 5 probably fit well with what the 
government has just done.  It is denying the auditor general 
authority to audit this public agency and it is refusing access 
to information concerning this organization. The government 
members do this and then say they believe in democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three aspects of Bill C-4 that are undemocratic.  The 
government is slapping the western Canadian agricultural 
community in the face.  That will be remembered.  The government 
should look at the number of western Canadian members it has to 
get an idea of what western Canadians think of this lack of 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk briefly about this bill in the time we have.  Let us 
first talk about the supposed elections it refers to.  Farmers 
will elect 10 members and the government 5 members and the 
president.  The farmers are the shareholders of this corporation 
and should elect all members.  They should be electing the 
president and the members of this organization. If you believe in 
true democracy, you believe in elections by the people who have a 
stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Chile and Argentina senators are elected to their senates. 
Most countries in the world have elections.  Elections mean 
democracy.  This is an undemocratic act and we should make that 
public.  This is an insult to the people and the farmers of 
western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read an example of this kind of slap in the face in my 
newspaper last night.  The editorial discusses the disposal of 
bases. When militaire Saint-Jean was shut down $25 million plus 
donation of the property was given.  When the base in Toronto was 
given up, 380 acres were donated, plus $22 million.  When the 
base in Calgary was given up nothing was given and no land was 
given by the federal government.  That is typical of how this 
government abuses western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about public information?  I am a farmer in part.  I 
received a letter from the wheat board in my mail last week. This 
letter is an insult to the intelligence of the farming community. 
This letter talks about how democratic this board will be.  It 
talks about the real power of the farmer.  It talks about 
complete accessibility.  This is an insult to the people of the 
farming community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals cannot allow access to information, what are 
they trying to hide? 
What are they covering up?

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I read this letter I say that it is a cover-up.  What are 
they trying to hide?  What are they doing?  Are they out selling 
grain for the farmers of western Canada or are they sitting on 
their duffs in some fancy office some place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to know what kind of prices they are getting for grain. 
It is my grain.  It is our grain.  What kind of prices are they 
getting?  They say that will destroy competition. Give me a 
break.  If they release the prices they got for grain in 1996-97 
that will not destroy competition.  I challenge this government 
on the ability of the Canadian Wheat Board to be the only 
marketing agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is about democracy.  Let farmers choose.  Let farmers 
decide whether they want to have the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the issue.  The issue is the abuse that is going on. 
We should be able to access the information.  It should be opened 
up so the auditor general can ensure accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rumours are created because of this sort of thing.  What are the 
people in the Canadian Wheat Board being paid?  What kind of 
bonuses do they get at the end of the year?  What kind of perks 
do they get? How can they justify keeping all that secret from 
the farmers whose grain they are supposed to be selling? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak about competition.  In my area of foreign 
affairs I often talk to trade delegations.  I hear them say “Do 
you guys still grow grain over there?  Do you still have grain 
for sale?  We never see anybody coming to sell it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear about the problems of ships sitting for 30 days or 45 
days because they cannot take delivery.  The Canadian Wheat Board 
is blowing the marketing of grain.  It needs to be accountable. 
It needs to be examined.  It needs to be subject to the scrutiny 
of its membership, the farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are talking about putting more crops under the control of 
the Canadian Wheat Board.  That is a pretty scary thought.  What 
about canola?  What about feed barley?  Will those crops be 
included?  Will the wheat board inefficiently try to market an 
increased range of grain products?  That is not good news for 
farmers anywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is about freedom of choice.  A farmer has to decide what he 
should grow.  A farmer has to decide what kind of fertilizers he 
should use.  He has to decide when to spray and what to spray. He 
has to decide whether to insure against hail and all the other 
problems.  He has to decide when to swath and when to harvest. He 
has to make all those decisions and worry about quality. The most 
important part is the paycheque that he gets for doing all that. 
The most important thing is the marketing of the product he 
produces.  He controls everything else but he does not have any 
control over the people he should be electing to do his 
marketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those people should be accountable.  How much do they get paid? 
What do they do?  How aggressive are they?  He has a right, as a 
farmer, to know those answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to know we are getting the highest price possible.  We 
need to know what this secret monopoly, which is filled possibly 
by patronage appointments, is all about.  I hear the words 
accessibility and accountability.  That is really what it comes 
down to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look back to when this board was formed.  Many of the 
farmers in my constituency have told me that they needed it at 
the time.  I do not think we are talking about that.  The issue 
of whether we should have it is not the question. The question 
concerns accountability.  It needs to be open to the auditor 
general.  It needs to be open to access to information. The 
people affected by this need to have access to it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
here we are after a vote to gag the opposition as we consider Bill 
C-4.  The government has used its majority to gag us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we in the Bloc Quebecois will use the time we have 
left to point out the failings of the bill, as has been our 
practice since our arrival in this House, put forward constructive 
amendments and hope that the government majority will agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board, it will be remembered, will have 
sales of between $6 billion and $7 billion annually.  This is not 
peanuts. 
We in the Bloc have a very constructive proposal, Motion No. 20, 
and I would like to take a few minutes to read it.  I would invite 
you, Mr. Speaker, to pay careful attention, because this is 
important.  It is vitally important as a moral issue and to give 
grain producers confidence in the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You already know that the Board, although its prime objective 
is praiseworthy, has lost a lot of credibility among the main 
stakeholders, the grain producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 20 reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-4, in Clause 4, be amended by adding after 
line 37 on page 7 the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“(4) Notwithstanding subsection (2), a department 
within the meaning of the Financial Administration Act 
includes the Board for the purposes of the Auditor 
General Act”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean exactly?  It means, currently and once 
Bill C-4 on the Canada Wheat Board is passed, the books will be 
audited once a year to see whether the people appointed by the 
government, primarily the president, are working for the benefit of 
producers or for their own benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The company of Deloitte and Touche will do the audit.  I will 
not ask how much that means a year for this firm, which is a 
willing contributor to the Liberal Party campaign fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the interests of transparency, we in the Bloc Quebecois are 
proposing not only that the auditor general be the one to audit 
transactions, but that he also be allowed to audit the Canadian 
Wheat Board's operations.  The accounting firm will audit only the 
statement of income and outgo.  You know how it works.  An 
accounting firm prepares the following sort of letter:  “On the 
basis of the figures supplied to us, we have audited a few invoices 
and everything seems to be in order”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is always this traditional phrase relieving the private 
auditor of all responsibility in the event of fraud.  Whereas the 
credibility of Denis Desautels, who plays an extremely important 
role, is above all suspicion and he could also, as I was saying 
earlier, audit the Canadian Wheat Board's operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the sales figure of $7 billion.  A mere 1% adds up 
to hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Funds could be 
misappropriated.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the president and the four other individuals 
appointed by the Liberal Party could be above all suspicion, but 
the absence of suspicion could later turn into slight doubts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take Senator Andrew Thompson, for example.  He was a good 
Liberal who headed up the Ontario Liberal Party.  He was appointed 
to the Senate by a Liberal government.  Today, he has fallen from 
favour.  But the Constitution tells us he was appointed until age 
75.  We are stuck with him.  That was a Liberal appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are proposing that appointments be examined and approved by 
the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food, something the 
government party is unfortunately rejecting as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the good of grain producers, I am asking the Liberal majority to 
seriously consider and approve—this is nothing to be ashamed of—the 
Bloc Quebecois' proposal, which seeks to give more transparency to 
the Canadian Wheat Board. If the idea has to come from the Liberal 
Party, then let us remove my name and put the name of a Liberal member 
on the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food. I can certainly 
live with that. As you know, the Canadian Wheat Board provides excellent 
services and is a necessary corporation. Still, only 60% of farmers are 
willing to rely on it. This is not normal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use the rest of my time to look at Motion No. 21, moved by 
the Conservative member from Manitoba. The hon. member proposes to add 
a heading, but I am almost certain that Liberals will vote against it. 
Let me give an idea of how narrow-minded the Liberals are when it comes 
to helping farmers. This motion makes sense. I cannot see why the 
Liberals will reject it. It reads, in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>5. The Corporation is incorporated with the object of marketing 
grain grown in Canada in the best interests of farmers— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion states that the corporation works in the best interests 
of farmers. Does this not make sense? Is the CWB's raison d'être not to 
maximize grain producers' returns? Its role is to help and support our 
grain producers, not make them poorer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on what Liberal members on the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food said, the Liberals will vote against Motion 
No. 21, moved by the hon. member for Brandon—Souris. Again, all this is 
not very transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go back to the financial interests that the Liberal Party 
may have in passing Bill C-4. Given the refusal to have the books of the 
Canadian Wheat Board audited by a private accounting firm, and given the 
refusal to let Denis Desautels, the auditor general, take a look, we are 
justifiably concerned about the transparency of the Canadian Wheat 
Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that 15 directors will sit on the CWB's board of 
directors, 10 of whom will be elected by the producers themselves.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are five others, including the president, who, to all 
intents and purposes—and we might as well be honest about it—will 
run the board of directors.  He will run the Canadian Wheat 
Board.  This very important person will be appointed by the 
governor in council and there will be no way to have the auditor 
general audit his books.  That is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I launch an appeal, in closing.  I appeal to my colleagues 
opposite to work for the benefit of farmers and not for their own 
personal benefit. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my first 
words this morning have to be ones of condemnation as well toward 
the government for introducing closure on Bill C-4.  I remind the 
House, especially those who do not sit on the Standing Committee 
for Agriculture and Agri-food, that the bill was rushed through 
the House last fall.  At that time the excuse was that the 
government wanted to have the bill through before Christmas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall that even before the Canadian Wheat Board made its 
presentation on Bill C-4 opposition and government members on the 
committee were to have their amendments in.  This is yet another 
example of this rush to judgment.  A couple of more days to have 
concluded all this would not have been beyond the pale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing this morning with Group No. 5 in which there are 
14 or 15 amendments.  In a broad brush way they include the 
auditor general, which my colleague for Frontenac—Mégantic spoke 
about it at some length; maximizing returns to farmers-producers 
and I will come back to that; the contingency fund; how any 
profits from the new wheat board will be consolidated; and the 
questions of lower then normal price, best returns, overtime and 
the accountability of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to zero in during my remarks this morning on the 
contingency funds.  For us this proposal is perhaps the worst 
feature of Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4 does not reflect the wishes of western Canadian 
farmers.  Despite objections from numerous farmers and farm 
groups section 39(1) remains in the bill.  That section would 
allow for cash buying and thus undermine price pooling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4 also terminates the government's guarantee of adjusted 
initial prices.  These two changes together would necessitate the 
creation of the contingency fund which has been estimated could 
cost farmers as much as $5.45 a tonne every year for five years 
on every tonne sold through the Canadian Wheat Board.  That is a 
total of $27 per tonne marketed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is based on Mr. Hehn's estimate of a contingency fund that 
would be in the neighbourhood of $575 million or $580 million. 
Again we have no indication from the government about how big or 
how small that contingency fund will be.  One assumes that the 
$580 million comes loosely on a 10% contingency fund for the 
annual marketing of the Canadian Wheat Board, which is in the 
neighbourhood of $6 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contingency fund could cost wheat and barely growers almost 
as much money as they received under the Crow payout scheme of 
two or three years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian Wheat Board supporters are not only being asked to 
accept legislation that fundamentally damages the board, but 
through the contingency they could be asked to pay thousands of 
dollars each if Bill C-4 changes are implemented.  The bill 
ignores and repudiates the clearly articulated will of the vast 
majority of western Canadian farmers and is therefore totally 
unacceptable in its present form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister responsible for the wheat board has been able to 
achieve the almost impossible.  He has all the opposition parties 
united against the bill, admittedly for very different reasons 
but nonetheless in total opposition to what we have in front of 
us. 
It seemed to be unthinkable at the time but the impossible has 
been achieve.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make it crystal clear that our caucus and our party 
oppose the bill because we do not believe that what is here 
unamended will improve the Canadian Wheat Board.  Rather it will 
significantly weaken the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental question that needs to be answered is whether 
the bill will or will not be an improvement over what we have 
now, particularly the three pillars of the current wheat board. 
The conclusion, as I have said, is that what is before us is a 
significant diminution of the wheat board which has been a 
critical factor in western Canada for the past 63 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three pillars of the wheat board.  We believe two of 
them are at risk in the bill as we see it, price pooling and 
government guarantees.   If the Reform amendments were adopted 
the third pillar would disappear as well, single desk selling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, Reform wants to do away with the wheat board. 
They want a voluntary board or to do marketing which would 
effectively kill the wheat board.  The notion of a voluntary 
board is a total fraudulent idea.  It is a scam, as was noted by 
the Alberta Judge Muldoon who said that a duel market was simply 
a quick transition to an open market.  This is something Reform 
critics and commentators never acknowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say how refreshing it was to hear the agriculture 
critic for the Conservative Party when he rose on Monday to speak 
to the bill and specifically to some of the resolutions, instead 
of the pathetic bleating and ranting of many but not all in the 
Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One Reform Party speaker told us how many speakers from his 
party had risen to speak in this debate.  Let me say as an 
interested observer that there was a heck of a lot more chaff 
than wheat in most of the content we heard on Monday afternoon. 
Particularly abysmal was the performance of the member for 
Saskatoon—Humboldt.  I would encourage any fair minded person to 
go back and read his contribution to Monday's debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Western Canadian wheat growers have a policy that I do not agree 
with.  They have a lengthy paper on duel marketing.  They are the 
ideological soul mates of many Reformers.  They must be somewhat 
embarrassed when they hear what is said many times on the floor 
of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the contingency fund, we would propose specifically under 
Motion No. 25 to delete all references to the contingency fund. 
Let me underline that we believe the fund is, as I have said 
before, the single worst feature of the bill.  The idea of 
establishing such a fund follows from provisions in the bill for 
cash buying.  That is the logic behind it.  The contingency fund 
is unnecessary if Ottawa would continue to provide financial 
guarantees to the board as it has done for the past six decades, 
guarantees, I might add, that are seldom used and as a result 
cost taxpayers next to nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the government is either unwilling or unable to 
indicate how large of fund is required.  I have alluded to that. 
The assumptions are somewhere between $350 million and as much as 
$575 million to establish the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note in passing that the parliamentary secretary to the 
minister of agriculture rose in his place while we were debating 
the bill last November and said that nobody could pinpoint 
exactly how large the contingency fund would be.  It is another 
dilemma in our position on the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe the government could make an important concession by 
guaranteeing federal finances that have seldom been required over 
the past six decades to support the wheat board. 
It would mean that the kind of money we are talking about would 
not be required to be produced by farmers but instead would have 
some genesis and some real assistance from the Canadian 
government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 30 simply reinforces the federal guarantee to the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  It is in Group No. 5 as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I close I want to refer to one of the amendments before 
us.  It was somewhat startling to hear what the member for 
Yorkton—Melville said on this grouping.  Subsection 1 shall not 
be interpreted to prevent the corporation from making a contract 
to sell a type of grain at a price that is lower than normal in 
order to secure other sales of the same type of grain that will 
result in the best return to producers of that type over a period 
of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That amendment sticks out because it is totally hypocritical. 
That party has been chastising the wheat board over many years 
because it fails to get the best return.  Now it is suggesting 
that we should do it as an order of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close by saying that this party opposes any notion of a 
contingency fund and we want to see the continuation of 
government guarantees in Bill C-4. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the 
opportunity to speak to this very popular Bill C-4, an act to 
amend the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>   Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>  Politics are alive and well in the 
Chamber.  People are laughing about the popularity of the wheat 
board bill, but the standing committee on agriculture in the 
previous year listened to all groups involved in the production 
and the sale of wheat.  They spent days and even weeks on the 
road listening and consulting with people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since that time the ministry has sent out hundreds of thousands 
of forms and letters of information to all growers in western 
Canada, all growers of all commodities.  Growers have been happy 
with the Canadian Wheat Board.  It has been one of the most 
successful bodies in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is guilty of twisting the facts.  We are not 
surprised about that, but it is unfair to the majority of the 
people who produce and grow wheat, the people whom I respect very 
much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, according to one of my colleagues, has been rushed to 
judgment.  Again I repeat that my colleagues spent months on it. 
Since that time we have heard from representatives of all 
commodity groups at committee.  Who would represent some of those 
groups?  The growers cannot decide themselves who should 
represent those groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party wants a voluntary wheat board.  It wants its 
cake and to eat it too.  It wants to do a flip-flop, jump in, 
jump out, and have it both ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The area of one of my colleagues opposite who sits on the 
standing committee has been dealt very severe blows by Mother 
Nature.  In the Peace River area the people do not deserve what 
they have had in the way of weather.  I know this hard working 
member has raised the concerns of these growers.  Yet how do we 
address them?  There are programs in place to help these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We survived the 1998 ice storm.  It was the most severe natural 
disaster in the history of the country.  There may be a 
difference between a major natural disaster and something we can 
insure against.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case the Reform Party wants the people who had no 
insurance to receive money for the buildings that burned down. 
They want the best of all of this.  The members of the Reform 
Party want the auditor general.  They are doubting the words of 
one of the most professional auditing firms in Canada. They tell 
us that this auditing company does not give them a transparent 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  All they do is check the numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>  They check the numbers.  I 
understand that a professional auditing firm does check numbers 
and if it produced a report I would accept it.  One of my 
colleagues in the standing committee has asked members of the 
Reform Party if they would give us an audited statement of the 
finances of their party and we are still waiting for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want members opposite to recognize the fact that the 
government, our party and the committee have not heard at all 
from the majority of the growers in western Canada.  The majority 
of the growers are satisfied with the status quo.  They have 
faith in the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the Reform Party are asking that the Canadian 
Wheat Board be subject to audits by the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  What is wrong with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>  What is wrong with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Making the Canadian Wheat Board subject to the Access to 
Information Act would force it to reveal far more information 
about its activities than any of its competitors.  The release of 
company information would put the Canadian Wheat Board at a 
disadvantage when it negotiates sales with international buyers. 
This would not help their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also ask members opposite to listen not just to the members of 
their own political party but to meet with their constituents in 
general.  We cannot pay attention just to the letters we get from 
a few people.  We have asked the members of these groups to come 
before us at the committee. They do not represent a majority of 
the people in this country.  They do not represent the majority 
of the growers in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member opposite said that this party here does not represent 
the voices of the growers in western Canada with regard to the 
Canadian Wheat Board because these growers have not replied with 
the forms that were sent to them.  The members of the Reform 
Party talk about the board of directors and that the growers have 
no control with this new Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought that when the growers had the opportunity to appoint 
10 directors out of 15 they would have a majority.  They will 
have the power to do what they want to do.  They will have total 
control.  What amount of money could they pay this director?  If 
they do not like the director they could lower the pay.  They 
have the majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think this is a laughing matter.  This is something I 
would like to see discussed fully in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to groups from across the different prairie 
provinces and I welcomed the opportunity to learn from them. 
However the biggest thing I have seen from all these groups is 
that everybody wants to protect their turf.  Everybody wants to 
say that they are representative of the groups.  I do not think 
we can have 14 different marketing groups within some 
commodities.  There has to be an umbrella to cover all of these 
groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board has been one of the most successful 
bodies in the history of this country.  The amount of money and 
the quality of a great Canadian wheat product will make for 
increased sales in the future.  We have to have control over a 
product like this.  What more control can we have than 10 
directors who represent the growers who produce this product?

bill.  The member also said it was for various reasons.  They are 
not all in support of the Reform policy and the Reform 
amendments.  I would like to bring attention to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday we saw history being made in this House when we saw 
the PC party vote with the Bloc.  I believe the NDP voted with 
its brothers too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case the farmers of western Canada are watching the 
Reform Party, not just letting the Reform Party lead them.  A 
group of these Reformers have taken out ads on the Ottawa radio 
stations to tell us in Ottawa how we should vote.  We should not 
listen to the producers.  We should go by a paid radio 
announcement.  I heard these ads on the radio and I do not think 
some radio advertisement is the way to go.  I would rather that 
the same groups made use of the standing committee which is open 
to the groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter.  I look 
forward to standing in the House and speaking on the next reading 
of the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in the House to speak to the 
Group No. 5 amendments on Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 23, securing the best financial return for the 
producers is a unique concept.  We have a farm crisis in western 
Canada and a lot of it comes down to the fact that the bottom 
line is in the red and not in the black. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 28, 1997 the minister responsible for the wheat board 
said in this House in a query to my compatriot for 
Yorkton—Melville “I can assure him however that the Canadian 
Wheat Board in every market in the world extracts the very best 
price it can possibly get for the farmers of Canada”. I will 
repeat that, the very best price it can possibly get. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these amendments do is change the object of the Canadian 
Wheat Board Act so that it matches more exactly what that 
minister is telling us in the House and telling Canadians the 
purpose of the act is.  If the minister honestly believes that 
the Canadian Wheat Board extracts the very best possible price, 
then he should wholeheartedly support these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently section 5 states “The board is incorporated with the 
object of marketing in an orderly manner in interprovincial and 
export trade, grain grown in Canada”, let me repeat that one 
portion “grain grown in Canada”.  I find it odd that the act 
gives the board authority to market grain grown in all of Canada 
but only imposes its monopoly powers in the prairie provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government monopoly good for grain grown in the west 
but not good enough to force on farmers in the rest of Canada? 
Could it be they do not really want it? Are we not as smart or as 
capable to handle our affairs in the west?  Do we not have a 
stake in our own marketing?  We grow it, we take the risks, we 
like to have a share of the gravy at the other end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this government monopoly is supposedly serving farmers' 
marketing needs in the west so well, I find it odd that farmers 
in the other provinces are not demanding that the wheat board 
take over their marketing too.  The fact that it is not happening 
illustrates why western wheat and barley producers are so 
frustrated.  They are being discriminated against.  They are 
being forced to sell their grain to the government controlled 
monopoly while farmers in the rest of the areas in Canada can 
sell to whomever they wish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least these amendments would make sure that the prairie 
farmers are getting the best return that a government operated 
monopoly can get for them.  As the wheat board act is worded, all 
they are guaranteed is orderly marketing, not good marketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments would improve on the existing wording by saying 
the purpose of the Canadian Wheat Board in the orderly and 
co-ordinated marketing of grain is to maximize, and I underline 
maximize, the financial return to the producers it serves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first amendment, Motion No. 1, adds a preamble to the act to 
clarify the reasons why we have a Canadian Wheat Board and that 
the first priority of that board should be to secure the best 
financial return to producers.  People from all political stripes 
can identify with that one.  The board must be accountable to 
those farmers for that performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second amendment, Motion No. 23, changes the wording of 
section 5 of the act to state “The object of the corporation is 
to secure the best financial return to producers of grain in 
Canada by marketing grain in an orderly and co-ordinated 
manner”.  It also adds to section 5 that the board carries out 
this marketing activity “on behalf of the producers of the 
grain”.  Put their interests first.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sad day that my colleague from Yorkton—Melville has had 
to draft such an obvious amendment to put the best interests of 
the producers ahead of the rights of this marketing board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This change in the object or purpose of the act resulted in 
three consequential amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first amendment, Motion No. 28, concerns clause 7 of the 
bill.  Section 7 of the act is being amended to ensure that grain 
sold or disposed of is not only sold for a price the board 
considers reasonable, but that it must be done in order to fulfil 
the new objective of maximizing the financial return to farmers. 
What a concept that is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second consequential amendment, Motion No. 29, also concerns 
clause 7.  It directs any profits from the sale of grain back to 
the producers rather than have the profits paid into the 
government's consolidated revenue fund which is kind of like 
putting them in a sinkhole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third consequential amendment, Motion No. 39, concerns 
clause 22 which is found at pages 16 and 17 of Bill C-4.  It 
would ensure that undistributed balances would be paid back to 
the producers who are entitled to the payment rather than just 
being designated to the government's vague term “for the benefit 
of all”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 45 would insert a sunset clause.  The last amendment 
is what is commonly referred to as a sunset clause.  It would 
require the auditor general to examine the wheat board's 
operation over the five year period ending December 31, 2002 to 
determine if the board had met its first priority as described in 
the new amended section, namely to secure the best financial 
return to the producers by marketing grain in an orderly and 
co-ordinated manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point the auditor general is not allowed to have a peek 
at the books, but he is allowed to look at other areas, like 
defence, CSIS and the RCMP, which are also highly political and 
could lead to problems.  Why can he not look at the wheat board? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general's report on the wheat board's operation 
would have to be delivered to the minister no later than 
September, 2003.  The minister would have to table the report in 
the House and in the Senate where it would be referred to a 
committee of the whole. This sunset clause would repeal the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act if it had not lived up to its mandate 
over that five year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another accountability measure.  If the people who are 
running the wheat board, whether elected or appointed, know that 
their performance will be measured independently by the auditor 
general after that timeframe, they will make absolutely sure they 
are securing the best financial return for the producers. Their 
jobs are in the balance.  Some accountability exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real benefit of a sunset clause is that it forces the board, 
the government and Parliament to revisit this legislation every 
five years to make sure it is still needed and that it is 
achieving the objectives established by Parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I cannot let this opportunity pass 
without making reference to the fact that the government has 
brought in time allocation.  The way in which the government has 
treated this very important legislation has been absolutely 
reprehensible right from the very beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my speech at third reading, which will probably be next 
Tuesday, I will outline for the House, for the viewing public and 
most important for the western Canadian farmers exactly what has 
transpired over the last year and a half and how the minister 
responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board and the government have 
handled this very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In debate on the last group of motions the hon. member for 
Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and Addington made some absolutely 
outrageous statements which cannot go unnoticed.  He said that 
the majority of growers are satisfied with the status quo. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the statement he made which clearly shows the fantasy 
world Liberal members live in when it comes to the Canadian Wheat 
Board and how it affects the livelihoods of western Canadian 
grain farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now discuss the motions in Group No. 6.  There are six 
motions listed under Group No. 6,  Motions Nos. 35 to 40, 
inclusive.  I will primarily address Motion No. 40 which I put 
forward and which was supported by my colleague from the 
progressive Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the unique things about this is that the Minister 
responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board has accomplished the 
near impossible.  This was referred to during the November debate 
of this bill at report stage. It was also referred to this 
morning by an NDP member.  The minister has alienated almost 
every western farm group with the way he has bungled this issue 
from the very beginning.  It is no small accomplishment to get 
everybody in western Canada angry with you, but he has managed to 
accomplish that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pay some tribute to the farm organizations, some 
of which have banded together to form an ad hoc group called the 
coalition to fight Bill C-4.  That is the level of intensity 
springing up across western Canada as farmers are trying to get 
this government to reconsider.  I thank those groups for the 
time, energy and considerable expense they incurred to bring 
forth proposed amendments to Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate the government does not respect this 
contribution.  This is obvious because these groups that 
represent the majority of grain producers were not consulted when 
legislation was drafted in the first place and because the 
Liberals rammed the legislation through committee, allowing 
minimal time for witnesses to testify.  Then today they invoked 
time allocation to limit MPs' opportunity to properly debate 
these substantive amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure those groups from both sides of the debate, those 
content with the status quo in the Canadian Wheat Board and those 
calling for significant change, that their efforts have been 
valuable and very much appreciated by me and my Reform 
colleagues.  Their submissions and input have guided us in our 
approach to Bill C-4.  I thank every last organization and 
individual who made submissions to the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, wrote letters to MPs and called to 
express their views on this important legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of these groups came up with an ingenious amendment that 
seeks to meet the needs of all parties involved with the Canadian 
Wheat Board.  This amendment provides voluntary opportunity for 
risk management.  It allows other producers to maintain their 
exclusive use of the Canadian Wheat Board to market their grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was so impressed with the amendment proposed by the Western 
Canadian Wheat Growers Association that I thought all MPs should 
have the opportunity to debate it as an amendment to Bill C-4 in 
the House of Commons.  It is known as the cash pricing option.  I 
will guide members through it as outlined by the Western Canadian 
Wheat Growers Association in the brief it submitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendment to the Canadian Wheat Board Act would 
allow producers to forward price 25% of their wheat production. 
They would use the same recognized futures exchange used by the 
wheat board for pricing and hedging of prairie wheat, that is 
Minneapolis for spring wheat and Chicago or Kansas City for hard, 
red winter wheat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The option would work in this manner.  The producer would first 
commit to a deferred delivery contract or sell a futures contract 
for part or all of his 25% allotment.  Sometime before the 
futures contract month becomes a cash month, the producer would 
deliver his wheat either to an agent of the board at a country 
elevator or to a landed basis location, that being a terminal or 
a processor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon delivery of the wheat, the grain company holding the 
deferred delivery contract would give its futures contract to the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  The Canadian Wheat Board would then buy 
back the futures contract and execute the cash side, that is sell 
the cash wheat to any customer it desires. The producer's 
settlement would be the futures price adjusted for exchange rate 
minus basis deduction from the Canadian Wheat Board. 
As well, the producer's settlement would be adjusted from base 
grade specs of the futures contract for grade, protein, moisture, 
and so on.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This cash pricing option would allow farmers to trade one 
quarter of their wheat in exactly the same way in which they 
presently trade canola, flax, rye and oats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this proposal every farmer would have an equal opportunity 
to participate. Farmers who would forward price the maximum 25% 
are also taking on the risk that they may not get the best price. 
No one hits the market highs all the time. But farmers would have 
better ability to manage price risk and manage cashflow, 
especially in years when the initial price is set extremely low, 
like this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers would gain assurance that they are getting the world 
price, and that is important for farmers who have become 
accustomed to dealing with the secretive Canadian Wheat Board. 
Many farmers are suspicious that the Canadian Wheat Board system 
does not deliver the world price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cash pricing option would have a number of other 
consequential benefits that the Liberals, if they would bother to 
pay attention, would find very attractive. The threat of border 
runs and civil disobedience that we have seen frequently would be 
reduced by allowing farmers access to the better prices they can 
see in the U.S. market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Liberals struggle to put out fires in trade skirmishes 
with the U.S., this amendment would reduce trade irritants for 
the federal government by showing that Canadian grain coming into 
the U.S. is at world price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these advantages would be found, while at the same time 
single desk selling is maintained, reassuring those who favour 
this approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment embodies the true spirit of compromise. It is a 
step in the right direction that boldly yet wisely seeks to 
progressively develop the western Canadian grain marketing 
system. Yet it also provides security to those who believe single 
desk selling is in their best interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is obvious that this amendment is worthy of serious 
consideration by all MPs in this House. While the opposition to 
the government's version of Bill C-4 has been loud and prolific 
from all sides of the issue, a group of Canadians has brought to 
us a mechanism with which to resolve a dispute. Producers are 
willing to give it a try. Members of this House should ensure 
they get that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just enough time to wrap up by saying how appalled I am 
on behalf of all opposition MPs, as the agriculture critic for 
the official opposition in the House of Commons today, that this 
government would move to bring in time allocation again, as we 
saw it do so often in the 35th Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot let it go without saying that I think western Canadian 
farmers are going to be watching this debate. I am sure they have 
watched with intense interest up until today. I think the move 
today to shut down debate with one day of debate for report stage 
remaining today and one day only for debate at third reading is 
absolutely reprehensible, and this government should certainly be 
embarrassed, if nothing else.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are 
dealing with group 6 amendments to the Canadian Wheat 
Board Act and there are a total of six amendments here. Our party 
has proposed three of them and I would like to deal with them in 
some detail in the few minutes I have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendment 35, regarding the pooling period, maintains the wheat 
board's pool account for the entire year, rather than having it 
broken down into shorter periods of time which is one of the 
proposals in Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal, we believe, to shorten the pooling period is 
linked to cash buying, that is obvious, and other tools which are 
alleged by the minister responsible to make the board more 
flexible. We do not believe it would make the board more 
flexible, but we are sure that the long run result will be to 
undermine farmer confidence in the board and thus weaken the 
board in the long run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendment 36 concerns the federal government guarantees.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment, in the spirit of an earlier one, serves to 
maintain the government as the guarantor for the board rather 
than having the board set up a contingency fund to perform that 
task.  I referred to that earlier when we were dealing with group 
5 amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 39 is our other amendment regarding cash buying.  I 
would like to spend a little more time going through what our 
hopes and expectations are in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 39 is the amendment that would remove the current 
proposal in Bill C-4 to have the wheat board make cash purchases 
of grain.  Bill C-4 does many things to undermine, we believe, 
the Canadian Wheat Board but nothing in the bill is more damaging 
than the proposal for cash buying.  The wheat board has long had 
a practice of buying grain from farmers at announced prices and 
distributing profits to all producers on an equitable basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, under the proposals before us, in the brief time that has 
been allotted by the government, the wheat board will be able to 
buy grain from anyone, anywhere, at any time and at any price. 
We are absolutely convinced that this will totally destroy a 
fundamental pillar of the wheat board and it will undermine 
farmer confidence in it forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposals for cash buying are linked to other damaging 
proposals in Bill C-4.  The contingency fund is one and the 
proposal to shorten the pooling period or have several pooling 
periods on a 12 month basis, which has been talked about before, 
is another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I noted, the Reform Party would have us go beyond even the 
weakening of these two pillars by attempting to destroy the third 
pillar which is the single desk selling via the dual marketing 
proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is opposed to cash buying?  The previous speaker was saying 
how many people have become involved in this and come together. 
The Saskatchewan Wheat Pool does not think that cash buying makes 
a lot of sense in this plan.  I remind viewers and members that 
the wheat pool in Saskatchewan is the largest grain buying 
organization in Canada.  The sister pools in Manitoba and Alberta 
are also opposed.  They are joined by many other groups, 
including the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities 
and the National Farmers Union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are our comments on group 6.  We want to leave the 
indelible impression that we are very much opposed and say no to 
cash buying. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
do not know why you should be so lucky or have the luck of the 
draw to be able to listen to my pearls of wisdom on this bill, 
but it seems you are always in the House when I get up to speak. 
Congratulations, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am extremely disappointed with the motion passed earlier today 
effectively stopping the democratic voice of not only 
parliamentarians but the numbers of producers this legislation 
will affect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I came to this House a raw rookie not that many months ago 
I expected that I would have the opportunity to put forward the 
views of not only my constituents but constituents who are 
affected by this legislation.  Now I find that the government has 
decided that the voices of parliamentarians should not be heard 
and that the voices of western Canadian producers should not be 
heard.  It seems there is an obvious move afoot to have a piece 
of legislation put through this House without forethought and, 
quite frankly, the understanding as to how the clauses in this 
legislation will affect those very producers we represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have put forward an amendment in Group No. 6.  Before I go 
through the amendment, I would like to say that there are a 
number of excellent amendments that have been put forward to the 
House but unfortunately they are not being listened to by the 
drafters of that legislation, the government of this country. 
In fact, if the government would listen, if it would understand 
the need for these amendments, I am sure it would appreciate that 
they should be implemented into this legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Group No. 6, I have put forward an amendment.  I will read 
the amendment.  It states that the corporation may enter into 
agreements with a producer at the beginning of the crop year 
authorizing the producer to market independently of the 
corporation a specified percentage of the wheat or barley 
produced by that producer in one crop year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That speaks to options.  It speaks to choice.  I would like to 
emphatically state at this point that we are not opposed to the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  That is not what the speakers before me or 
after me have said.  I believe sincerely that the Canadian Wheat 
Board can compete effectively with other competition that is now 
in the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As examples of that I put up the deregulation of utilities which 
has happened across this great country of ours in the past 
numbers of months, the deregulation of gas utilities, the 
deregulation of telephone utilities.  I will give a brief glimpse 
into the future, the deregulation of hydro or the electricity 
industry that is going to come to this country.  Those 
corporations did not wither and blow away into the wind.  They 
worked harder to compete for the customer they were serving and 
have done so in a very efficient manner.  It has produced 
efficiencies for the consumer or in this case it would produce 
efficiencies for the producer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is all we are saying.  They can and should compete on the 
open market.  The Canadian Wheat Board in my conservations with 
it will not even consider this particular tenet of what it should 
be looking at for the next number of years.  Its head is stuck 
firmly in the sand and firmly with a monopoly situation. It is 
not going to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With international trade, with the fact that the producers are 
not going to accept this piece of legislation, they are not going 
to be satisfied with what is put forward, there is still going to 
be substantial opposition to this legislation and to the Canadian 
Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Please, if there is one thing I can plead with the government 
and with the Canadian Wheat Board, it is put into place now what 
is necessary for the next year, two years or three years to make 
choices and options available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My motion speaks specifically to that.  It is a nice little 
segue into what is going to happen into the future.  Let 
producers have a particular percentage of their product they can 
now sell on the open market on a cash basis, on a hedge basis, 
can go to the Chicago exchange and can hedge the type of cashflow 
they require in order to run their operations. A number of the 
amendments in this group speak to that very thing which does 
speak to choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not all the producers, and I accept that, necessarily want to 
have that choice.  But what they would have is the ability still 
to go to the Canadian Wheat Board under the pillars they are 
still guaranteed under the Canadian Wheat Board.  They then could 
pool their grain.  They could get their initial payments the way 
they would like to and plan their future in their farming 
businesses from year to year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, when it happened in the other utilities a number 
of those customers stayed with the original utility because there 
was loyalty, because they wanted to, because it was convenient, 
because it was simple.  If those are the reasons why producers 
wish to remain with the Canadian Wheat Board, so be it, and let 
the Canadian Wheat Board compete on that basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, I would suggest at that time that the Canadian Wheat 
Board be able to compete on other commodities, not simply barley 
and wheat. Let it openly compete with the other commodities at 
that time, the canola, the flax, the rye and the oats.  That is 
fair.  Fair competition is fair for everybody. Let it have that 
ability.  Do not simply have a monopoly for two crops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion put forward by the Reform Party speaks basically to 
the same amendment I have put forward, perhaps a bit more 
detailed.  It does speak to certain percentages of hedging 
available to it but in essence what we are simply saying is 
please allow for the options to be made to the producer.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak to NDP Motion No. 39.  This motion is to 
delete the one clause I suppose that gives a little opportunity 
to producers in this piece of legislation, the cash purchases. 
Cash purchases have been in place for quite a substantial amount 
of time, have been used for barley in the past and have been very 
successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention a couple of points with respect to my 
motion once again.  There are countless examples of how marketing 
outside of a monopoly is good for economic efficiency. In the 
November 13 issue of the <I>Western Producer</I>, the Canadian 
Wheat Board's chief commissioner, Mr. Lorne Hehn, said: “The 
growing domestic feed demand and increasing production of malting 
quality barley probably means that within five to ten years there 
will not be enough surplus feed barley to operate a predictable 
export program under the Canadian Wheat Board”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is that saying?  What it says is that barley is not even 
going to be needed to be marketed under the Canadian Wheat Board 
in five to ten years.  By the way, I take exception to the five 
to ten years.  I think it will be sooner than that.  If Mr. Hehn 
thinks it is five to ten, he is again sadly mistaken in his 
forecasting for the Canadian Wheat Board.  It is sooner than 
that.  No longer will barley be required to be marketed under the 
board because there will not be any need to market barley.  It is 
going to be used domestically and only here in Canada for feed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1996 there was a study on the economics of single desk 
selling of western Canadian grains by two Ph.D ag-economists, Mr. 
Carter and Mr. Lyons.  They state that a driving force for much 
of the Canadian Wheat Board activity is equity in treatment of 
producers rather than economic efficiency among producers.  This 
is self-explanatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When oats and barley were removed from the Canadian Wheat Board 
jurisdiction, the volume of barley and oats exports to the United 
States increased dramatically.  Is this merely a fluke or a 
strong sign of the Canadian Wheat Board's inefficient marketing 
practices?  Make the choice.  If someone wants to market through 
the board they can.  If they want to market on the open market 
they should be able to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that following the removal of oats from the 
Canadian Wheat Board in 1989 farm gate prices for oats have risen 
relative to world market levels and marketing costs have fallen 
by about one-third.  When oats were taken off the Canadian Wheat 
Board prices went up.  People still market it through the private 
sector and their marketing costs have reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked to the people who grow this.  I have talked to the 
people who have oats.  They say they would not want to go back 
into that system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion put forward by me with respect to some options, 
fairness and choice has to be listened to by this government 
because that is what the producers are saying.  If they do not 
get it in this legislation they will get it in the next 
legislation that will be coming not too far in the distant 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do hope some of the amendments are listened to honestly, 
logically and openly by the government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I live in a great farming community, as I am sure you know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to share some of the comments from the government 
side with regard to particularly the amendments in group 6 but 
some other comments as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I find it interesting that members opposite would stand 
and complain about what they referred to as closure.  They know 
full well that time allocation is a necessary tool that any 
government uses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Rubbish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  This is not rubbish at all.  I have 
experienced the kinds of delays and filibustering that can occur 
with members standing in their place in a democratic legislature 
reading a telephone book or some other kind of nonsense simply to 
stall the government's program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to share and put on the record some of the time, when we 
talk about time allocation, that Bill C-4 has enjoyed.  Its 
predecessor was Bill C-72.  At second reading there were over two 
hours of debate in this place. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were over 39 hours in committee.  There was more time at 
report stage and an additional three and a half hours in the 
House.  That was the predecessor to the bill which we are 
debating today.  There was quite a bit of discussion on 
essentially the same bill and the same issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill was debated for over three hours at second reading. We 
should bear in mind that the predecessor to this bill was debated 
for 19 and three-quarter hours in committee in addition to the 39 
hours.  It was debated for several hours at report stage.  There 
were over 11 and a half hours of debate in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is not about rocket science.  This bill is 
fundamentally about democracy and the governance of special 
purpose bodies.  I think the number of hours of debate in this 
place alone have been sufficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I categorically reject the comments by members opposite that 
there is heavy handedness or closure intended.  Indeed we are 
allowing the opposition parties to put forth amendments.  There 
has been substantial debate.  Public hearings were held right 
across Canada, notably in western Canada where this legislation 
will have the greatest impact.  The farmers will benefit 
dramatically from the changes which are being made to the 
governance of this body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes which are being made to the governance will turn 
what is a cumbersome, old crown corporation, which we know has 
had some difficulty, into a mixed, modern type of system which 
will allow the farmers to appoint two-thirds of the directors to 
the board.  How could it be more democratic? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members opposite do not want western farmers to have that 
kind of democratic participation, maybe they should say so.  I 
have some difficulty understanding how they could justify that 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed the government has listened to the farmers in western 
Canada.  This has been an extremely democratic process.  A lot of 
time has been spent on this issue both in the communities and in 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments in Group No. 6 would lead to a reduction in the 
operating flexibility of the Canadian Wheat Board.  That is 
exactly what this bill attempts to do.  It will create 
flexibility in a new board.  It will be able to elect its own 
chair, who will be elected by the farmers.  It allows for 
democratic votes to take place in the farming community when 
certain products are being deleted or added.  This is one of the 
most democratic processes I have ever seen in government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two of the proposed amendments would remove flexibility tools, 
namely shorter pool periods and cash buying authority.  I cannot 
imagine why the Reform Party would want that to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other amendments would deny the wheat board the power to make 
adjustments to initial payments on its own authority.  That is 
extremely important.  It would reduce the ability of the wheat 
board to use funds from uncashed cheques for the benefit of all 
producers and to engage in cash trading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I would ask members opposite why in the world they would 
want to restrict the wheat board.  As many of them represent 
farmers in those communities, why would they not embrace this 
legislation?  They should see it as an opportunity for democracy 
to occur in a special purpose body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have several of those bodies.  We recently had a debate about 
changes to the ports legislation.  Once again it is the same 
concept.  It allows more local democracy.  The principle is that 
the government which is closest to the people is the most 
efficient and best government.  That is exactly what this bill 
will accomplish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those reasons we clearly cannot support these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new flexibility tools are important provisions which must 
remain in the bill.  These tools would allow the wheat board to 
offer producers alternative means of receiving payment.  Again, 
why would we not want to offer those alternative means? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They would speed up cash flows, which is extremely important in 
any business, while retaining the benefits to producers of the 
CWB being a single desk seller.  They would also allow the board 
to better manage its own risk.  That is where we have seen the 
government trying to go in many areas to get better risk 
management in the hands of the operators on the ground and 
actually doing the work.  We believe that would do exactly that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The initiatives we are talking about are all enabling 
initiatives.  They will or will not be used at the sole 
discretion of the board of directors.  I remind members opposite 
once again that two-thirds of the board of directors will be 
appointed by farmers locally and five out of the fifteen will be 
established by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that the board be able to adjust initial 
payments quickly when market conditions make it appropriate to do 
so.  That is one of the reasons flexibility is so important. It 
will help to get money in the hands of the producers as quickly 
as possible to attract deliveries of grain in a rising market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bit of the just in time mentality we see in business 
today.  These modern changes will help them respond to those 
issues.  If we were to adopt those amendments it will result in a 
slower process for getting money into the pockets of western 
Canadian grain producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about and what they are trying to change is 
modernization of a system that will see— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston:</B>  Rubbish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  It is not rubbish.  The gentleman 
opposite says it is.  I would like him to defend why he would be 
against local autonomy, why he would be against grain farmers 
having the authority and the responsibility to run the wheat 
board, which has not happened under a crown corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without these changes we will leave farmers in western Canada 
working with an antiquated system that will restrict their cash 
flow, will restrict their ability to do business in the modern 
world and will restrict their flexibility to adjust to changing 
conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure it will be no surprise to members opposite that the 
government will not be supporting these amendments.  It is not 
because we did not hear them.  We heard them but we categorically 
reject them because we think they are bad for the farmers of 
western Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to add my voice of condemnation to the move taken by 
the government today to stifle debate on the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take exception to the last speaker who said that this was not 
closure but was simply time allocation and that we have had a lot 
of time to discuss the bill.  That is rubbish.  It is a real 
flip-flop for him and his party to take that stance when a few 
short years ago they stood on this side and condemned the 
Conservatives over and over again for invoking closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When you and I were boys, Mr. Speaker, a period that many people 
would refer to as the old days, a mythical character rode the 
western plains on a white horse and shot silver bullets.  Known 
as the Lone Ranger, this relentless crime buster divided his time 
between rescuing damsels in distress and bringing bad guys to 
justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today another mythical character roams the Canadian plains. 
Known in Saskatchewan as the lone Liberal, his mission is to 
round up farmers who think they have the right to sell their own 
grain.  Along with his trusty sidekick for comic relief, the 
Canadian Wheat Board, he brings to justice villainous farmers who 
think that if they can grow it they can sell it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the lone Liberal and the CWB in hot pursuit these criminals 
are dealt with, with due dispatch and without delay, while lesser 
law breakers like rapists and murderers are sternly admonished 
and sent home. 
Prairie farmers beware.  The lone Liberal rides again and he 
knows where they live.  He also knows where they park their 
trucks. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the lone Liberal wonders why he is the only Liberal from 
Saskatchewan, all he has to do is look at his sidekick, the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  By pushing the CWB agenda and not standing 
up for farmers, his compatriots were trounced in June. The heavy 
handed approach favoured by the lone Liberal will only mean that 
he will be the last Liberal from Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are frustrated.  They are fed up with the paternalistic 
approach of the government.  Its primary goal is to control all 
facets of the lives of farmers.  If anyone wonders why these 
farmers resort to border busting, the reason is that the 
government has made sure there is no option to the Canadian Wheat 
Board; it is the only game in town. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are self-employed only in the eyes of the tax man.  In 
reality they are public servants without the benefits, without 
the salary and without the pension.  The wheat board is like big 
brother, directing farmers on when to deliver the product and how 
much they will be paid:  “Just bring it to us.  It is none of 
your business what we get for it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowhere is the government's control fetish more evident than in 
its attempt to keep western farmers in line.  For decades 
Liberals have been inventing ways to control the western economy. 
They did it in the national energy program.  They are dying now 
to impose a carbon tax but in the interim they will settle for 
depriving western farmers of their property rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill even expands the board's control over wheat and barley 
to other grains, and to think the wheat board was set up as a 
temporary measure.  Did we not hear that about income tax and the 
GST? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Failure to comply with this old soviet style state run monopoly 
results in a jail sentence.  Farmers whose only crime is to try 
to get a fair price for their product are relentlessly pursued by 
the wheat police and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law 
by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make matters even worse, the board is now paying farmers less 
than the world price for grain.  Compounding the problem is the 
fact that the board is so shrouded in secrecy that farmers cannot 
even determine how much less than the world price they are 
receiving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian taxpayers are on the hook for a $7 billion liability 
through the board, but the Canadian Wheat Board is not 
accountable to farmers or Canadian taxpayers.  It is an 
unbelievable situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The advance billing for Bill C-4 predicted an enhanced 
accountability to farmers.  Instead what we have before us today 
is a badly flawed initiative in which the Canadian Wheat Board is 
accountable only to its master, the minister, the lone Liberal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation continues to promote secrecy over accountability 
by ensuring the board escapes the scrutiny of the auditor general 
and exempts it, believe it or not, from the Access to Information 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody is advocating that the wheat board should negotiate 
contracts in the media or in the public.  We admit that.  There 
has to be some secrecy to present day negotiations.  The notion 
of commercial confidentiality may have some validity on current 
negotiations.   But why is the government so opposed to releasing 
historic information?  The only reason I can think of is that it 
may be trying to hide extravagant spending, bungling and 
mismanagement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the Liberals love to brag.  If they were proud of their 
record they would certainly want to tell us all about it.  It 
appears that we will never know because the bill stifles the 
ability of the elected directors to represent the farmers who 
elected them. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can directors act freely if they are bound by secrecy?  By 
denying board members liability protection they will not be able 
to speak out and act on behalf of their farmer constituents.  If 
the government thinks its problems will be over once Bill C-4 
becomes law it is sadly mistaken.  In fact the Canadian Wheat 
Board will become a target in international trade negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes to the Canadian Wheat Board Act before us today will 
not satisfy our trading competitors that the board is independent 
from the federal government.  It will be nothing less than a 
monumental challenge to convince protectionist U.S. Congress 
members that the board does not have an unfair trading advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government and the lone Liberal from Saskatchewan really 
want to empower farmers, they will accept the amendments proposed 
by my colleagues, the hon. member for Prince George—Peace River 
and the hon. member for Yorkton—Melville.  It is high time for 
the Canadian Wheat Board to act in the best interest of farmers, 
not just of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would certainly endorse Motion No. 37 in Group No. 6.  It is 
not exactly what we had in mind, but it is a step in the correct 
direction.  It would authorize a producer to market outside the 
Canadian Wheat Board a percentage of the wheat and barley 
produced by the producer in a crop year.  This is the sort of 
thing we have been advocating all along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people who like to spread misinformation about members of 
the Reform Party saying that it is the party that wants to knock 
the wheat board on the head; they want to kill it and do away 
with it completely.  That is absolute rubbish.  We have never 
advocated that.  We have always advocated a dual marketing 
system.  If the Canadian Wheat Board cannot operate without its 
state run monopoly, it must be as very poor organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every one of us has to compete in our business life and in our 
political life.  I think competition is good and so should the 
Canadian Wheat Board. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I rise with considerable interest to speak to Group No. 6.  The aim 
of these amendments for the most part is to improve Bill C-4, 
which, we must admit, is a step in the right direction toward 
improving the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Canadian Wheat Board was set up, its underlying 
principles were valid.  At that time, we were in a period of full 
economic crisis, and grain producers were working hard for next to 
nothing.  The wheat board was founded then, when it was needed. The 
effect of this was to raise prices and stabilize incomes, which 
were then very, very low.  Times were tough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the bill is a step in the right direction, it could be 
a big step.  It is a little step, because the three to five members 
on the previous board of directors were political appointments. 
When the Liberals were in government, they appointed their friends 
with very little regard, as we know, for the quality of their work. 
When we changed vehicles, from red to blue, the friends of the 
Conservatives were appointed.  Here too, the appointments were very 
dubious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning I drew a parallel with Senator Thompson who, a 
few years ago, was an excellent Liberal, but today is the shame of 
his party.  They want to kick him out of the Senate as they did out 
of the Liberal caucus.  Since he was appointed to age 75, they are 
stuck with their choice.  That is what the Constitution says.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is, then, a small step in the right direction, but it 
could be a medium step or a giant step.  The opposition parties 
have brought in several motions, highly constructive suggestions 
for the most part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party, the Bloc Quebecois, for which I am the spokesperson 
on agricultural matters, proposed Motion No. 46, which would 
require the Canadian Wheat Board to give access to information. 
Those mainly responsible for the existence of this Canadian Wheat 
Board, the producers, could thus, using the very founding 
principles of the Access to Information Commission, verify whether 
the Board was being administered very well, well, badly or very 
badly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the House that, year in and year out, wheat 
sales hover around the $6 billion mark, and are coming up to $7 
billion. 
I have just been doing the math, for the fun of it.  If, for 
example, the board makes a one one-hundredth of one percent 
error—one-hundredth of a percentage point is very little, one-hundredth 
of a penny is so little compared to a dollar, and we do not even 
bother to bend over to pick up a penny—that still represents a 
$600,000 error.  That is significant.  If the error is one one-thousandth, 
that represents $60,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ten directors elected by the producers and the five 
appointed by the governor in council will, presumably, be highly 
competent of course. The CEO, who will be the only full time 
person, the one who will obviously call the tune for the Canadian 
Wheat Board, will be appointed by the Liberal Party.  Let us face 
it, they are the ones in power today.  So the CEO will certainly be 
a good Liberal, let me tell you, and will draw a nice comfortable 
salary, needless to say. 
If this president or CEO is out by a fraction as small as 1%, huge 
sums would be involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the interests of transparency, we in the Bloc Quebecois are 
suggesting that grain producers or anyone, I or my neighbours in 
the riding, should be able to request an audit in order to have 
this board release documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind you that, in Group No. 5, we learned that the 
auditor general would not have the opportunity or the right to go 
and audit the books and find out how well or badly the Canadian 
Wheat Board was being run.  Sometimes I honestly wonder whether the 
Liberal government headed by the member for Saint-Maurice does not 
have some things it is trying to hide from grain producers.  It is 
a question I ask myself, and I hope that a member of the government 
party will give me an answer after I have finished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trust of grain producers must be restored at all costs. 
This is essential.  It is terrible the number of telephone calls, 
letters and faxes my office has received from western farmers, from 
western groups working tirelessly for the defence of grain 
producers.  Unfortunately, as soon as it looks like farmers are 
going to get any control, the government hesitates, although 
farmers themselves are the ones who know how it should be run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example—I am digressing briefly—there will be 15 
members on the board of directors.  In that sense, it is an 
improvement.  Before, there were three, four or five at most, and 
they were all partisan appointments.  People were told “We are 
sending you there”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if a prime minister wanted to get rid of a member of 
Parliament, he would appoint him to the Canadian Wheat Board, where that 
person would get a good salary and nice perks. A byelection would 
follow, and some friend of the prime minister would get elected and get 
a cabinet post or some other big job. It would now be a good thing to 
change things, restore the producers' trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a step in the right direction, since 10 of the 15 directors 
will be elected by farmers, who will vote by region. For example, grain 
producers in the Peace River area will vote for Mr. Y, who will become 
their representative. If he does not do a good job, he will be replaced 
the next time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B> Or Mrs. Y. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> Or Mrs. Y, of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is with the position of chairperson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by discussing another motion, moved by the hon. 
member for Prince-George—Peace River, who is making a very interesting 
suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill currently provides that the already existing advisory 
committee may—it may, but all this is not clear—continue to exist. 
Motion No. 48 moved by the Reform Party member proposes to clearly state 
that the existing advisory committee will be dissolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board will have 15 directors, compared to the three members 
currently sitting on the advisory committee. We agree with the Reform 
Party that having a board with 10 elected and five appointed directors 
would be enough. This is not to say we necessarily approve of the number 
10 for elected directors. 
Personally, I would have proposed that all members be direct 
representatives of grain producers, and that they be elected through a 
general vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the chairperson does not do a proper job, he will be let go at 
the end of his mandate, as was the case with the Conservative Party, in 
1993, when only two board members were kept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would like you, as Speaker of the House, to ask the 
Prime Minister, the Minister of Agriculture or, rather, the Minister 
responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, namely the Minister of Natural 
Resources, to take a close look at the many motions before us. These 
motions do not seek to weaken Bill C-4, but to improve it. After all, 
this legislation deals with sales of between $6 and $7 billion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what 
we are debating now is group 6, a grouping of amendments 
including three very progressive amendments moved by my colleague 
and next door neighbour, the member for Palliser. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make very clear at the outset that I too object to the 
government's imposing closure on this very important piece of 
legislation for western Canadian farmers and indeed for all the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the government House leader understands that the 
Canadian Wheat Board is a very important institution, doing about 
$6 billion worth of business every year on behalf of western 
Canadian farmers.  That $6 billion worth of business every year 
provides a tremendous spin-off to not just western Canadian 
farmers or western Canadians but to the nation as a whole.  That 
is why this legislation should not be forced through the House 
with closure but that this House should be more receptive to 
accepting some of the progressive amendments that have been moved 
by members on the opposition side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be very clear at the outset that our party has stood 
historically behind the concept of the Canadian Wheat Board.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had the wheat board now for roughly 60 years in this 
country.  There was a real struggle back in the 1930s and the 
1940s to fight for the creation of a Canadian wheat board that 
would market things collectively and operate as a single desk 
marketing agency for the farmers of western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can remember the days when I was a kid and my grandfather 
telling about the struggles that people of his generation had in 
the 1920s, 1930s and early 1940s against the Winnipeg grain 
exchange and the Chicago futures market in terms of getting a 
decent price for the grain they were marketing to different parts 
of the world.  After a long struggle and through all kinds of 
prairie popular movements, the creation of the Canadian Wheat 
Board occurred some 60 odd years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today there is a fight on the prairies once again about the very 
survival of the Canadian Wheat Board.  Our party is firmly behind 
the wheat board.  We want it democratized and as open and 
accountable to farmers as possible, but we want the wheat board 
to be expanded to include more grains so that it can market those 
grains for the farmers of western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the option?  The option is to open up the market and 
allow the big grain companies like Cargill and others to market 
grain and reap the profits of the farmers of western Canada. That 
is the position taken by the Reform Party.  It is trying to 
disguise that by saying it wants a dual marketing system, a 
double marketing system in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  That's what farmers are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  The farmers are not saying that. When 
there was a vote in western Canada on barley and the wheat board, 
the farmers said very clearly they wanted to maintain barley in 
the Canadian Wheat Board by about a 65% to 66% vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party says it believes in democracy and a referenda. 
There was a referendum on that issue.  The Alberta government 
intervened on the side of the open marketers I think with about a 
million dollars and, despite that, the producers turned it down 
almost two to one going into the open market.  Has democracy 
spoken?  Reform Party members should be listening to democracy, 
listening to their constituents and listening to their farmers if 
they believe in what they are saying to the people of this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that the member for Wild Rose, being a populist, would 
agree that we should listen to the farmers of western Canada and 
listen to the democratic choice those farmers have made in 
western Canada.  He should come around to our ridings and hear 
what people are saying about keeping the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, what we are hearing from the Reform Party—and western 
Canadians watching should be aware of this—the member for 
Cypress Hills—Grasslands said in the House a while back that the 
Canadian Wheat Board in this country compares to the old Soviet 
Union.  What kind of extremism is that?  Here is a party that is 
so extreme that it compares the Canadian Wheat Board, which is 
supported by Canadian farmers, the people in my riding, to the 
kind of institutions in the old Soviet Union.  That is what the 
Reform Party is saying and it is on the record here in 
<I>Hansard</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the member for Wild Rose say about that?  Why does he 
not go wild on that one?  That is what the Reform Party is 
saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that was not enough, the member for Skeena, that great grain 
producing riding of Skeena, compared the Canadian Wheat Board to 
a police state.  It has been a long time since I have heard that 
kind of extremism in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the Reform Party are getting very excited.  I am 
afraid they are going to start rushing me.  I have not had much 
training in boxing recently, but I hear those extreme voices 
being raised once again about jailing farmers.  There are some 
farmers in a movement called farmers for just us who broke the 
Canadian law.  They were found guilty by the courts in this 
country and here are the members of the Reform Party saying they 
want to stand up on behalf of law breakers.  Again, the extremism 
in that party ought to be noted by ordinary people in this 
country.  It is about time they were called to task on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the farmers in farmers for just us have broken the law 
and members of the Reform Party stands four square behind them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important part of any parliamentary democracy is to listen to 
the people, and the people of western Canada have spoken very 
clearly, very succinctly and often on the need to keep the 
Canadian Wheat Board and single desk marketing and have that as 
an institution of economic good for the people of western Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a referendum on that as it pertains to barley.  The 
Reform Party lost that referendum.  They pretended it did not 
exist. They do not listen to their constituents.  In fact some of 
them should be recalled on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to have a Reform Party member get up and tell us 
why they do not want to listen to the people.  I believe the whip 
of the Reform Party is hanging his head in shame up there at the 
Chair because the Reform Party was not listening to the people of 
this country when they spoke so clearly in the barley referendum. 
I would like to have a Reform Party member get up and explain 
how they can do this, how they can not listen to what the people 
are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wheat board is a very important institution.  The wheat 
board sells about $6 billion a year of grain.  The profits are 
returned to the farmers, not to private investors. The wheat 
board is accountable to Parliament.  The wheat board has its 
books audited independently by Deloitte & Touche.  The wheat 
board is accountable.  It is open.  It is there for the farmers 
of western Canada yet the Reform Party is opposing the Canadian 
Wheat Board.  I wonder why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at who funds the Reform Party.  Conrad Black.  I do 
not know if he contributed to your campaign, Mr. Speaker, but he 
did not contribute to mine.  He contributes to the Reform Party. 
Imasco, some of the big banks and believe it or not, the CPR. 
That is why the Reform Party is in opposition to the Canadian 
Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just like the fights which occurred in the 1930s and 1940s with 
the far right in western Canada as they opposed orderly 
marketing, those fights are occurring again by these new radicals 
and new extremists who are taking a stand against orderly 
marketing in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whip of the Reform Party is so ashamed, he is now across the 
House and is sitting with the Liberals.  A few minutes ago he was 
hanging his head in shame, but now he is sitting with the 
Liberals, dissociating himself from the Reform caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The member has this problem with staying on course and 
relevancy. He got beaten in Yorkton—Melville badly for not 
listening to his people.  As a result, he does not stay on the 
subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the hon. member is discussing 
the Canadian Wheat Board Act which is what we have been debating 
here all day.  He has some minutes remaining in his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have been representing 
farmers in this House for some 26 years. I know what the farmers 
are saying in my riding and around Saskatchewan and around 
western Canada.  They want a strong Canadian Wheat Board. They 
want Parliament to support that Canadian Wheat Board.  Yes, they 
want it to be more accountable, they want it to be more 
democratic, but they want to keep the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real debate is whether or not that wheat board continues to 
exist.  The Reform Party will destroy the Canadian Wheat Board. 
They will set up a dual marketing system.  They will destroy the 
Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have had members in this House that have compared the 
Canadian Wheat Board to a police state. The member for Skeena did 
that.  The member for Cypress Hills—Grasslands was comparing the 
wheat board to the old Soviet Union.  These are extremist 
statements.  But that is exactly where the Reform Party stands. 
They are also not listening to the democratic will of western 
Canadians who voted very clearly to keep barley within the 
context of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I say to them, why do they not listen to their constituents? 
Why do they not listen to what people are saying?  If they did 
that, we would have a strong wheat board for the farmers of 
western Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is absolutely astonishing to listen to that member 
from Saskatchewan rant and rave about how he is the great 
protector of the rights of Canadian farmers.  Here is a member 
who fled from the rural ridings of Saskatchewan because his 
support was non existent. 
He fled to an urban riding to seek re-election.  What did he care 
about the farmers? He wanted to go to the city so he could get 
himself another job.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order and it is a legitimate one. The member from the Reform 
Party is geographically challenged. The riding of Qu'Appelle is 
one-half rural and one-half in the city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sure all hon. members are happy 
to learn the demographics of the hon. member's riding, but I am 
afraid it is not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is quite likely the hon. 
member's thinking is one-half in the mud and one-half in the 
sand.  There is no doubt about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard the member talk about this glorious wheat board, a 
wheat board that is determined to shackle the efforts of Canadian 
farmers.  That is the philosophy of communism where the state is 
in control of everything.  I am not surprised that it is coming 
from that member from Saskatchewan, a disciple of the socialist 
communist philosophy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
on a point of order.  There are times when members get carried 
away.  I would like to ask the member to withdraw that.  He said 
I am a disciple of the communist philosophy.  I am not.  I never 
have been.  I have always been critical of that.  I would like 
him to withdraw that comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am not sure that what the hon. 
member said or what is objected to is necessarily 
unparliamentary.  I am unaware of a precedent that would rule it 
is an unparliamentary term.  If the hon. member could assist the 
Chair later with that, I would be glad to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that hon. members generally would prefer to continue 
their remarks in a temperate vein and I would urge that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is not listening 
to what the Reform Party has said because he chooses not to.  He 
chooses to keep his head in the sand and not listen to a new way 
of doing things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a way of doing things which we believe would free the 
farmers from the oppressiveness of the Canadian Wheat Board. It 
would free the farmers from the dictatorship of the Canadian 
Wheat Board.  It would free the farmers from the corruptness of 
the Canadian Wheat Board, free the farmers from the mismanagement 
of the Canadian Wheat Board and free the farmers from the 
influence of the Liberal friends of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What corruptness? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, they ask what 
corruptness. There has been allegation after allegation by 
Canadian farmers who have sought to take this issue to court only 
to find that the Canadian Wheat Board and this Liberal government 
do everything they can to keep the issues out of court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one Canadian farmer wants to try to do something for 
himself to improve his standard of living, to expand the best 
possible market for the product that through his toils he grew 
out of the ground, what do they do?  They throw him in jail 
because he will not be guided by the dictatorial powers of the 
Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sad day in this House when the Liberal government brings 
in closure on an issue so important as this.  This is an issue 
that takes away the rights of Canadian farmers.  It is a bill 
that serves to increase the secrecy of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
It is a bill that serves to cloak more in secrecy the goings on, 
the financial dealings and how they are doing business so that 
ordinary Canadian farmers and members of the opposition cannot 
get access to find out where the mismanagement is occurring, 
where the corruption is occurring, where the sleight of hand is 
occurring in the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who could we expect in advance to support the government on this 
oppressive bill?  None other than the New Democratic Party 
members. We could have bet a day's wages that they were going to 
jump on board with the Liberals on this bill. 
The only type of authority they understand is a state authority.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That goes back to the roots of this member's philosophy when he 
talks about big brother looking after everything and not letting 
any individual initiative come to the surface, not rewarding 
individual efforts.  That is not the style or the philosophy of 
the NDP.  It wants a collective state where everyone works for 
the state.  They get little in return and they pay into the big 
brother government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder the NDP member fled his rural riding after the 1993 
election and sought refuge in the city where he could find some 
new fields on which to sow his socialist philosophy.  It is 
unfortunate that he did and we have him back in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have put forward an oppressive bill.  It oppresses 
the right of farmers to work hard, to succeed and to try to make 
life a little better for themselves.  It places them under the 
thumb of a wheat board that does not want to open its books to 
Parliament.  They would not even let the Auditor General of 
Canada look at the books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the Liberals trying to hide by putting in a bill like 
this?  They do not want the Auditor General of Canada, the 
watchdog for Canadian taxpayers including the western farmers, to 
look at their operation.  Why? Because it would expose the 
mismanagement, the nepotism and yes, the corruption in the 
Canadian Wheat Board.  There is that word again.  It comes up all 
the time when I think of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  The arrogance.

some more here?  We could go on and on.  I should have a 
thesaurus here.  We could have a lot of fun here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports the freedom of choice for farmers. 
The Reform Party supports the individual initiative of Canadian 
farmers.  The Reform Party supports that that initiative can be 
rewarded by getting the best price possible for their products. 
If they can do it themselves, then we want to let them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot support this bill or any of the amendments put forward 
by the Liberal Party or the NDP. I rest my case.  This is a 
terrible bill in the history of farming in Canada.  It cannot be 
supported in this House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, for 60 
years the wheat board as a crown agency has done an admirable job 
for farmers, for all farmers, those with small farms, those with 
large farms.  Studies show that each year farmers make $265 
million more selling wheat through the wheat board than they 
would selling to the private grain trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the best grain marketing organization in the world.  The 
wheat board has been able to get good prices and returns the 
profit to farmers rather than having it line the pockets of 
private grain graders.  The wheat board is a $6 billion industry 
and certain corporate interests would love to get their hands on 
it.  It is because of that that we see the Reform Party and its 
business friends trying to abolish the wheat board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform, like the Liberals, want a winner take all economy 
and they want to get there a whole lot faster.  To this end we 
have seen the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, the 
Winnipeg Commodity Exchange and Cargill rally behind the position 
or more likely lobby that position.  We see the National 
Citizens' Coalition attacking the integrity of the wheat board. 
It is no surprise that a former Reform MP, Stephen Harper, is 
leading that charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Producers support the wheat board.  It has ensured stability in 
their interest.  Statements made in the past by Reform members 
compared life in Canada under the wheat board to life in the 
former Soviet Union.  They call Canada a police state because we 
have a wheat board.  These remarks only prove that Reform members 
are capable of writing for the tabloids. 
These remarks only prove that Reform is capable of writing for 
the tabloids.  These remarks are extremist rhetoric and we have 
listened to a whole lot of it.  They do not accurately reflect 
the work and actions of the wheat board.

not with us today.  He came from the riding of 
Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar which is a fairly large farming area. 
I suggest his party's stance on the wheat board is one of the 
main reasons he is not here.  The majority of the farmers do not 
support Reform's position on the wheat board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that producers are not happy with the 
government's amendments to the act.  There is no question that 
more accountability and transparency are wanted.  The producers, 
however, do not want to throw the baby out with the bath water. 
They want the Canadian Wheat Board.  If this government seriously 
wants support for the changes it must ensure access to 
information and it must ensure that there is accountability.  Its 
failure to do this again leaves people questioning high paid 
appointments and patronage.  This only taints the Canadian Wheat 
Board.

off debate, especially on this group of amendments.  It is so 
typical of the government's arrogant attitude and how it has 
approached debate on this bill that it will not put members 
forward to debate these amendments.  It is absolutely despicable. 
I hope and pray that the western Canadian farmers who are 
following this debate are taking note of the complete disdain 
with which the government has treated this debate over the last 
number of days.  There are hardly any Liberal members in the 
House.  The few in the House have not even addressed the issue. 
They are not interested in having an honest, open and proper 
debate on the 48 amendments which have been put forward, and they 
are very substantive amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice the member for Malpeque, a Prince Edward Island 
potato farmer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big issue in this set of amendments is contained in Motion 
No. 43 which was put forward by my colleague from the Progressive 
Conservative Party to remove the inclusion clause. If there is 
one clause in Bill C-4 which has raised the ire across the board 
of western Canadian farmers it is the inclusion clause. The 
government knows it.  There were many submissions and 
presentations made to the government in committee and across the 
land against the inclusion clause, and yet the government and the 
hon. member for Malpeque will not stand to defend it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that people from coast to coast in this country 
who are involved in the farming communities know that the member 
for Malpeque should be down at the other end of the House.  He 
should be in the NDP caucus.  The only reason he is not is he 
knew he could never run for the NDP in Prince Edward Island and 
have a hope of getting to the House of Commons, so he decided to 
run as a Liberal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a past president of the National Farmers Union we know where 
his thinking is.  We know that he wants more state control of 
agriculture in Canada.  He wants expanded control of the Canadian 
Wheat Board.  He wants more control, just as the hon. member from 
Regina just said. 
They want more crops brought in under the Canadian Wheat Board, 
more farmers in jail, I would assume.

hear from, said about the inclusion clause when they appeared 
before the standing committee on agriculture last fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prairie pools sent a written request to the minister by 
association which can demonstrate that it is the predominant 
organization which exists solely to represent the producers of 
that commodity in the designated area. They want it very clearly 
defined who is going to initiate including more commodities under 
the control of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the prairie pools have some serious concerns about this 
inclusion clause. United grain growers say no to the inclusion 
clause. Western Canadian wheat growers say no. Canadian canola 
growers, no; flax growers of Western Canada, no; the Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business, no; oat producers of Alberta, 
no.  The list goes on and on. Virtually every group of witnesses, 
every farm organization that appeared before the committee said 
no to the inclusion clause and yet does it make any difference? 
Are they listening over there? They are still there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remark on what has happened over the last little 
while with this bill, the reality. I spoke on Monday. I raised a 
question of privilege on this very issue, because what we have 
seen is this government and this minister, the Minister 
responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, showing complete 
disdain, a lack of respect for this institution.  That is the 
reality of what has happened. He is just proceeding as though 
this bill is law to the extent that because we have so many 
western Canadian farmers in the caucus of the official opposition 
in this House who wanted to speak to this bill, wanted to 
properly debate the amendments, actually brought in closure today 
to shut down debate. They do not want to hear from western 
Canadian farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a group that has grown up from grassroots western 
Canadian farm organizations specifically to fight this bill. The 
thing that unifies it is the inclusion clause. That is the one 
thing that unified all these groups under a common umbrella. They 
said no, we certainly do not want that. Yes, we want to see 
change with the Canadian Wheat Board, but we certainly do not 
want to see it expanding its already mandatory powers over wheat 
and barley to other commodities such as canola or flax, things 
marketed on the free market right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the organizations that make up this coalition 
against Bill C-4. Included are the Alberta Canola Producers 
Commission, the Alberta Winter Wheat Producers Commission, the 
B.C. Grain Producers Association, an organization that I was very 
proud to be the president of for a number of years when I was 
actively farming.  I probably shovelled more grain that ended up 
in Canadian Wheat Board cars than most members on the opposite 
side have ever seen in their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also included are the Canadian Canola Growers Association, the 
Canadian Federation of Independent Business, the Canadian Oil 
Seed Processors Association, the Flax Growers of Western Canada, 
the Manitoba Canola Growers Association, the Oat Producers 
Association of Alberta, the Ontario Canola Growers Association. 
Even Ontario canola growers are in on it because they are 
concerned about this. Others are the Western Barley Growers 
Association, the Saskatchewan Canola Growers Association, the 
Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association and the Winnipeg 
commodity exchange. They all joined together to try to fight Bill 
C-4, largely because of this inclusion clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would add that this meeting I referred to in my point of 
privilege last week, the meeting that the hon. minister for the 
Canadian Wheat Board held in Regina on January 21, some of those 
organizations I just read out were invited to attend that 
meeting. And what happened at that meeting? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1325"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of those organizations invited urged the minister 
to drop the inclusion clause brought forward because of one 
member, the hon. member for Malpeque who joined the House and 
perhaps will join in the debate.  We welcome him and we would 
like to hear from him in this debate later on.  Those 
organizations walked out in complete disgust.  They wanted to 
discuss the bill and the ramifications of this bill on western 
Canadian farmers.  The reality was the minister was there to 
discuss how to hold the elections.  We had not even voted on how 
many directors there would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an amendment that has been put forward by me on behalf 
of the Reform Party to have all 15 directors elected.  We are not 
going to vote on that until next Monday evening.  Yet the 
minister holds a meeting in Regina and invites farm groups to 
discuss how to go about holding these elections, as though this 
bill were already law.  We wonder why the Parliament of Canada 
has become irrelevant in the minds of so many Canadian citizens. 
It is because of the arrogant attitude of ministers like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened at this meeting?  The majority of those groups 
walked out in complete disgust.  It is interesting that both the 
premier of Alberta and the premier of Manitoba wrote to the Prime 
Minister about this inclusion clause.  I have copies of the 
letters. They wrote scathing criticism of this inclusion clause 
that the socialists obviously support judging by the heckling 
coming from that end.  They join their other Liberal brothers in 
trying to support this state run commodity organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately my time has expired.  I would like to go on for 
considerable length discussing this, but that's life. 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, just an 
observation at the outset.  While we very much in this corner of 
the House oppose what the government has done today by invoking 
time allocation, it is interesting to note how quickly the debate 
is now going through once time allocation has been proceeded 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been dealing with these groups of amendments for several 
days.  It seems, by my calculation, to be taking slightly over a 
day to get through one group.  We started at group 5 a couple of 
hours ago and now we are in the seventh and final group.  It 
seems the Reform Party, which put up 19 or 20 speakers, is able 
to rush out and say look, the government forced us into time 
allocation and are they not a horrible group of people.  Reform 
has the thing through. It won what it thinks it will be able to 
carry out to the farmers.  It is a sham and a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Group 7, the one we want to zero in on this afternoon, is the 
inclusion the clause.  As the previous speaker indicated, our 
caucus does support the inclusion clause.  We want to explain why 
we support the clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous bill allowed farmers to decide in a vote to remove 
or exclude grains from the board's authority.  It seems to us 
that it is only fair, normal and natural that farmers can also 
vote to add additional grains.  I stress that such an inclusion 
of a grain besides wheat and barley would occur only after a vote 
of farmers and/or producers.  That is democracy in its truest 
form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a great deal of concern how a vote to include a 
grain would be actually triggered. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the legislation stands a farm group would have to seek 
conclusion.  The minister would then decide if the group was 
sufficiently representative of producers of the commodity in 
question.  Only then would a vote occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our proposal in Motion No. 44 was actually suggested by the 
minister of agriculture for the province of Saskatchewan when he 
appeared before the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food last fall.  We proposed that the process to include a 
grain be exactly the same as that of excluding a grain; that the 
board of directors of the wheat board ask for it; and that, if 
they do, farmers would then vote on it.  This would streamline 
the process for the inclusion of a new grain and make it less 
divisive than we think the legislation before us now proposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe these are sensible and moderate propositions quite in 
contrast to the venom which has been spread in recent months by 
the so-called coalition against Bill C-4.  The activities of this 
coalition are nothing more than an undisguised frontal attack on 
the Canadian Wheat Board.  The coalition is trying to do through 
the back door what it failed to do through the democratic 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to run through its demands.  The coalition continues 
to insist that barley be dropped from the wheat board's 
jurisdiction.  As my colleague from Regina indicated a few 
minutes ago, farmers voted on that question in 1997.  Some 63% of 
them voted in favour of keeping barley under the board's 
jurisdiction, notwithstanding the $1 million the Alberta 
government put up in paid advertising to try to ensure the vote 
would go against keeping barley within the CWB. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The coalition is also demanding cash buying and dual marketing 
as has been noted earlier.  In our humble opinion and in the 
opinion of Judge Muldoon from Alberta that is nothing more than a 
prescription for doing away with the wheat board.  It is 
something that farmers have rejected as recently as 11 months 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The coalition and its Reform partners are demanding that the 
inclusion clause for grains be dropped altogether from the bill. 
Who is it who wants barley out from the wheat board jurisdiction 
in the inclusion clause?  We heard the previous speaker, the 
Reform agriculture critic, talk about some of those groups.  I do 
not think he mentioned all of them.  I just want to make sure we 
get them all in.  Most of the faxes that arrived in my office 
carried the identification of the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business, a well known farm group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What other bona fide farm organizations belong to this unholy 
coalition?  The Winnipeg Commodity Exchange.  I do not think I 
heard the member make reference to the Winnipeg Commodity 
Exchange.  The Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce has big farmers out 
there.  The oilseed producers which includes Cargill and 
unofficially the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say to these corporate interests and to the Reform Party that 
a debate about the wheat board is a debate for farmers and not a 
vote for corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us compare the coalition to one group that supports the 
inclusion clause, the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, 
arguably the largest farm organization in Canada and an 
organization that has the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool as a member. 
Other supporters of the inclusion clause include Wild Rose 
Agricultural Producers from Alberta, not the member for Wild Rose 
but the agricultural producers of Wild Rose; the Saskatchewan 
Association of Rural Municipalities, which represents more than 
200,000 rural taxpayers; and the Government of Saskatchewan.  The 
previous speaker noted that Premiers Klein and Filmon had written 
to the minister responsible for the wheat board.  Let the record 
show that the premier of Saskatchewan has recently written, 
urging that the inclusion clause remain in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ask the Reform Party and the agribusiness lobby why they are 
worried about a possible producer vote to include grain, a party 
that talks constantly about plebiscites and referendums?  Let the 
farmers decide.  New Democrats have always supported the wheat 
board because it works in the best interest of farmers.  That is 
why we support the inclusion clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just before I take my place, I want to respond to something that 
was said by the member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley who 
assured the House that the NDP would be supporting Bill C-4. 
I want the record to show, as I said during debate on Group No. 
5, that the minister responsible for the wheat board has done the 
impossible.  He has all opposition parties offside on this 
legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, some day in the future there will be a dual market 
because every farmer in the country cannot be kept under a 
monopoly. That will change.  I have no about it.  When it happens 
I hope the government of the day apologizes to farmers and pays 
compensation.  I will be waiting to see the day.  I am sure it 
will happen in my lifetime, God willing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the hon. member for Palliser voted against the time 
allocation motion, having the debate shortened, but he seemed to 
support it in his speech.  I cannot imagine why he would do that 
when we are trying to get all the facts on the table.  We are 
trying to present them to the government that is bringing forward 
the bill so that it can learn to change its ways and change the 
bill to reflect what is best for Canada and for farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to bring NDP members up to date.  They talk about 
survival of the Canadian Wheat Board as do the Liberals and Bloc 
members.  It is paramount in their minds. Everyone should be 
talking about the survival of Canadian farmers in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will describe a typical farm in western Canadian.  We are not 
talking about a quarter section or a half section any more.  We 
are talking about investment dollars in the millions, just under 
a million dollars to run a decent sized grain farm.  We are 
talking about a significant business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is foolish to talk about marketing grain as it was done 60 
years ago or to say that is the way it should be done nowadays. 
The cosmetic changes the Liberals are putting forward in the bill 
do nothing with regard to true price discovery.  They do nothing 
with regard to freedom for individuals to produce a product and 
sell it on their own as they see fit.  The bill is a recipe for 
disaster for western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk for a minute about what would happen if the 
wheat board went to a dual market or allowed farmers to sell on 
their own.  Who would then market the grain? One of the biggest 
marketers would be the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool. 
I lived in Saskatchewan before I moved to Manitoba.  There was a 
lot support for Sask Pool.  Many of my old CCF relatives, current 
NDP relatives and others in Saskatchewan support the Saskatchewan 
Wheat Pool.  The Saskatchewan Wheat Pool is a top grain marketing 
co-op in the world.  The pool placed 23rd overall.  It was the 
largest grain marketing co-op.  Those that ranked above it were 
involved in dairy, meat and sugar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a farmer were allowed to sell his grain outside the wheat 
board, he might choose to sell it to the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool. 
The Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, with its size in the world economy, 
especially in the agricultural sector, could very well find out 
what is a good price. 
It could compete against the wheat board.  It could compete 
against Cargill, UGG and ADM.  At that point the farmer would 
have the choice.  He would say that he got a real good price from 
Sask Pool and that is where he would like to sell his grain.  If 
Sask Pool suddenly decided to shaft the farmer for a few years 
and to start giving grain away for political reasons or doing 
something foolish to cause the price paid to the farmer to go 
down, we would soon see the farmer selling to an alternative 
buyer.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sask Pool has made an alliance with an eastern European country 
with regard to the possibility of changes in the future grain 
marketing system in Canada.  UGG has formed a strategic alliance 
with a Japanese company, Marubeni.  I read from a report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry sources said the alliance is also part of a long term 
strategy by Marubeni as it is watching for deregulation of 
Canada's wheat and barley markets. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do they think Saskatchewan Wheat Pool is doing?  It knows a 
deregulated market for marketing grain is coming down the pipes. 
Everybody in the House should know it by now.  There is enough 
information around.  For some reason the Liberal government is 
sticking its head in the sand.  Instead of trying to make changes 
today it will keep western Canadian farmers in this straitjacket 
monopoly for the next 10 years to 15 years.  Maybe this 
straitjacket will only last until the next election, with any 
luck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak for a moment to price discovery.  This 
deals with the inclusion clause, Motion No. 43.  The proposed 
inclusion clause would allow the mechanism to fundamentally 
change the price discovery process and reduce the relevance of 
the grain purchasing price setting mechanism.  I will use canola 
as an example.  It has been raised in the House and everyone is 
familiar with that product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Winnipeg Commodity Exchange canola contract provides a price 
reference and an effective hedging tool for producers, grain 
merchandisers, exports, importers and processors both 
domestically and internationally.  They have a choice.  They have 
to decide when they market canola how they will do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the futures price for canola, and this could read 
wheat or barley, either way, reflects the world price of canola. 
This function of a commodity exchange provides for an effective 
and efficient way to discover prices, to hedge those prices and 
to transfer price risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What am I talking about?  I am talking about a major Canadian 
business, for example a $1 million farm or a $500,000 farm on the 
prairies, making decisions in their corporate or personal best 
interest.  They need to maximize the profits they can make for 
their farms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed inclusion clause, if used to grant authority over 
canola, would allow for price discovery process supporting the 
canola contract to change from an open market system to a closed 
regulated system and eliminate the relevance of the contract as 
an international pricing and risk marketing tool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members of the NDP and the Liberals whether this is what 
they want.  I think they do because this is the bill they have 
put forward.  They do not want a true price discovery mechanism 
to be in place.  By not having access to what actually is 
happening in the Canadian Wheat Board as to pricing and so on, it 
looks to me like they are trying to keep the whole thing kind of 
hidden, kind of secret, so that the true price for grain is never 
determined. 
The farmer takes what he gets, according to what the wheat board 
wants to give him.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I could continue to speak about the wheat board and the impact 
it has on demurrage costs and a lot of other things, but I think 
I have made the basic points as to why farmers have to have 
choice.  It is their pocketbooks we are talking about.  They 
should be able to sell their grain to whom they want, whether 
through the wheat board or privately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not support Bill C-4.  I support a wheat board for the 
farmers who want to be in it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, prior 
to dealing with Bill C-4 and some of the amendments which have 
been proposed, I would like to respond to statements which have 
been made by my Reform colleagues across the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Reformers have suggested they are all knowing and 
representative of the western prairie farmers simply because the 
majority of Reformers come from the western provinces.  They also 
suggest that we on this side of the House and our Conservative 
and NDP colleagues should not be speaking to this bill because 
they are all knowing and they are the representatives.  They 
suggest that we should be listening and doing nothing else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here to tell them that when we are dealing with an issue 
which affects the entire country, when we are dealing with an 
issue that represents $6 billion to $7 billion, guaranteed by 
every man, woman and child in this country, I am going to speak 
to it.  It is my parliamentary privilege to do so, just as it is 
for members from Quebec, the maritimes, B.C. and northern Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ninety per cent of my riding is agricultural.  The people in the 
agriculture community want to see a couple of clear things coming 
from this House.  They want clear questions, clear statements and 
clear answers.  They do not want to hear all the rhetoric, 
misinformation and grandstanding which Reformers are throwing 
out.  Some of the statements with respect to Bill C-4 which have 
been made today and in days gone by have been absolutely 
ludicrous.  We should be dealing with the straightforward points 
the government is recommending with respect to Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I speak to those points I would like to mention a couple 
of comments which appear in <I>Hansard</I> that my Reform 
colleagues have made.  Perhaps these members, when they see fit, 
might apologize for the comments.  Literally they have been 
grandstanding.  They have been creating anarchy on the western 
plains.  They should be ashamed of themselves. These are not my 
words.  These are their words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Cypress Hills—Grasslands said: “This is 
little more than a personal anecdote.  Most of the 200 farmers 
present were staunch supporters of the Canadian Wheat Board.  I 
might even say most of them were rabid supporters of the Canadian 
Wheat Board”.  I quote the word rabid. They are classifying 
wheat board supporters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give the House a dictionary definition of the 
word rabid.  This is how they are classifying western wheat 
producers: “Rabid:  furious, violent”.  Is that the kind of 
language we expect to hear in the House of Parliament?  The 
definition continues: “unreasoning; headstrong; 
fanatical—affected with rabies”.  That is what they have 
branded the producers of the CWB.  They have branded them as 
rabid supporters.  I suggest that the member should consider 
apologizing for his absolutely outlandish comments.  They are 
completely unacceptable and something which I certainly would not 
imagine coming from a parliamentarian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this bill is about and what we should be discussing today 
are clear and precise facts such as are the wheat producers going 
to have control of their wheat board.  The answer is yes, 
absolutely yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give my colleagues across the floor a little 
definition of democracy.  It is anything over 50%. 
They like to throw out these referenda.  If they do not have the 
majority of support in the ridings they will step down from their 
seat.  Democracy is 50% of the vote, gentlemen.  The grain 
producers have 66% elected representatives on the wheat board. 
That is a vast majority.  Two-thirds of the directors will be 
directly voted in by the wheat producers.  So their myth is set 
aside.  No more fallacies, just simple truth.  The farmers will 
have control.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to government appointments, the government of this 
country is backing the Canadian Wheat Board to the tune of $6 
billion.  Are Reformers suggesting this government should have 
absolutely no role to play?  Are they suggesting that we sign a 
blank cheque every year and we have no control or mechanism in 
place to make sure the money is being spent wisely?  If that is 
what the Reform Party is suggesting it would have this government 
bankrupt in no time at all.  I suggest the Reform Party should be 
ashamed of itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly would not be prepared to offer a corporation $6 
billion in guarantees without having some control in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak to the farmers' involvement.  We have 
heard the Reform Party throw out many names and agencies of 
people who have been opposed to this bill, most of whom are 
somehow either directly or indirectly related to the Reform 
Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a minute and go over a chronology of 
events, the consultations the hon. minister went through.  This 
is not something that we are bringing closure to in a matter of 
one day.  This has been ongoing for many months.  Unlike my 
colleagues across the floor, my opposition members in the NDP, in 
the Conservative Party and in the Bloc chose to table some of 
their amendments during committee, in front of the experts.  They 
felt they would stand the test and have good debate on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not my Reform colleagues.  They withdrew all their amendments at 
committee.  They said we are going to do it in the House where we 
can grandstand, where we can do nothing more than support the 
people who support us, the Reform members who were not elected 
and decided to join various organizations that came forward to 
present themselves.  That is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a minute and go through this chronology. 
These are facts.  A factual brochure on the grain marketing 
system was distributed to over 200,000 farmers, not executives 
and board members, but farmers, organizations and industry 
representatives in December of 1995.  There was series of 15 town 
hall meetings held across the prairies in 1996 to provide farmers 
and other individuals the opportunity to express their views. 
Twelve days of public hearings were held in Winnipeg.  There have 
been many opportunities for the farmers to provide their comments 
with respect to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The panel travelled across the country and it heard what the 
farmers want.  Not a couple of specific Reformers, those who are 
all knowing, those who are wanting to yell across the floor or 
act violently.  They heard from common sense individuals, good 
business people, farmers, grain producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will do a good job for the Canadian wheat producer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude with a couple of the principles behind the 
Canadian Wheat Board and the acts mentioned therein.  I will read 
some notes I have made as I have gone along.  I would encourage

to function more effectively in carrying out its mandate to 
market western wheat and barley for export and domestic 
consumption on behalf of farmers.  The current commissioner 
structure of senior management will be replaced by a part time 15 
member board of directors comprised of 10 producer elected 
representatives and 5 government appointees, including a full 
time president and chief executive officer who can only be 
appointed with consultation with the rest of the board. 
Not simply the minister's whim, but the rest of the board has to 
be consulted in this. Further, the rest of the board is going to 
decide his salary.

about to make.

they will do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all I would like to state emphatically that this House 
has introduced closure, even though they wish to say it is time 
allocation.  There are a number of issues, a number of things 
that should well be said on behalf of our constituents by 
individuals who are elected to this House, the parliamentarians, 
to give forward their views and their thoughts on the amendments. 
The hon. member who sits on the committee gave us his closing 
arguments on Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with group 7, the amendments that have been 
tabled.  We have dealt with groups 1 through 6 and there are a 
number of good amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This section is the one I have the most concern with.  I have 
said to the minister, to other members of the committee and to my 
own constituents who do not like this legislation that, in fact, 
if this particular clause were removed from the legislation I 
would reluctantly consider looking at the whole legislation in 
favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the inclusion clause is the clause that scares the 
living daylights out of me.  I should tell you why. The inclusion 
clause was not in the original piece of legislation that was 
tabled, Bill C-72, prior to the House adjourning for an election. 
During the period of time from April to June 2, it seemed there 
were literally hundreds and thousands of people who approached 
government who wanted to include into this piece of legislation 
an inclusion clause that would allow other commodities to be put 
into the legislation to be on a monopoly single desk selling 
basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Like many of my colleagues, I will look

</I></B></P><P align=left>Suicide is the primary cause of death among young men between 
15 and 29 and has been on the rise since 1990.  More women than men 
attempt suicide. 
This is a complex phenomenon if ever there was one, and the risk 
factors involved in suicide are many: psychological problems, drug 
or alcohol dependency, dysfunctional families, difficult economic 
circumstances, job loss, social isolation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's cuts in transfer payments to the 
provinces have forced them to cut health and social services. 
Furthermore, the empty job creation promises of the Liberal 
government are not helping anyone in difficulty to see the light at 
the end of the tunnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By giving the provinces their due, the Liberal government will 
be helping to prevent suicide.  We encourage it to do so.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday a

which attempted to identify some potential solutions for settling 
the problem of Canada-Quebec relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those experts included Prof. Guy Laforest, well-known across 
Canada and a staunch member of the Yes side during the last

Government of Quebec was its inability to demonstrate the validity 
of the sovereignist project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such an expert opinion is worth its weight in gold.  It 
confirms that the people of Quebec made the right choice in the two 
Quebec referendums in 1980 and 1995, namely to opt in favour of 
keeping Quebec within Canada.

her work in the refugee communities in Canada she has been 
recognized by receipt of the Order of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today the finance minister showed what is happening to 
this year's budget surplus.  His priority is not tax relief.  It 
is not debt reduction but more spending, pay raises for the top 
3,300 government bureaucrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians would like a pay raise and the finance minister 
could give it to them by simply giving Canadians broad based tax 
relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the finance minister think it is okay to leave his 
bureaucrats with more money in their wallets but not Canadian 
taxpayers? 
<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, let us be very clear.  Since we have taken office we 
have said that the payoff for deficit cleanup, for cleaning up 
the balance sheet and for the tremendous effort of Canadians, 
will in fact be lower taxes.  It will in fact be greater security 
for our social programs.  We will continue on that vein. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one thing I would say within that context is that it makes 
very little sense to me, given the importance of the public 
service and the tremendous dedication, that the Leader of the 
Opposition should attempt to downgrade their efforts for the 
country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish the finance minister was as concerned about the 
dedication of taxpayers as he is about the dedication of 
bureaucrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just what Canadians were afraid of, that the finance 
minister would spend any surplus on made in Ottawa projects, not 
on tax relief for ordinary Canadians:  pay raises for the top 
bureaucrats, the $3 billion memorial fund for the Prime Minister, 
a sop to this minister, a trinket to that minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the finance minister is done with all these Liberal 
spending projects how much money will be left for broad based tax 
relief? 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am surprised that a party that is supposed to be based on 
market principles would refuse to recognize that the top 
executives in the public service are absolutely necessary to the 
nation.  We need the highest possible quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a lot of them are now going to the private sector because 
the salaries are higher, I am surprised the Reform Party would 
lack the foresight to be able to pay senior public servants that 
we need the price they deserve in the market. 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we recognize paying bureaucrats what they deserve, but 
what we want is to pay taxpayers what they deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still do not have the answer to our question of what is 
happening to the vanishing surplus.  What worries Canadians is 
the finance minister's reports say there is a surplus right now. 
The spin doctors are now saying there will not be a surplus at 
the time when the budget comes down, that in fact there will be a 
$2 billion deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are the finance minister's spokesmen predicting a deficit if 
the books say surplus?  What is his explanation for the vanishing 
surplus? 
<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I can see the jealousy of the Reform leader because we 
have been successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is just trying to take away the credit of the Minister of 
Finance because the Minister of Finance and the government have 
been able to balance the books and now there will be money. Today 
he is no longer interested in the reduction of the debt. Today it 
is the reduction of taxes.  Tomorrow what will it be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For us it is very clear.  Half the surplus is going for economic 
and social programs because we have problems in Canada that need 
attention, and the other half will be going for tax reduction and 
debt reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear, Mr. Speaker, and I am sorry the Leader of the 
Opposition—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it has now been 16 years since the 1982 Constitution was 
unilaterally imposed against Quebec's wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next week, in a reference based on this same illegitimate

<P><A NAME="LINK122"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canada's Constitution was perfectly valid for the Government of 
Quebec when it asked us to amend it to allow a new school board 
system in Quebec.  We cannot use the Constitution when it suits us 
and reject it when it does not.  Here, as in France, the rule of 
law must prevail. 
<P><A NAME="LINK123"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would remind members that the school board issue came under the 
1867 Constitution. However, the words I quoted were the very words 
used in 1987 during the Meech Lake accord hearings by Yves Fortier, 
the federal government's lawyer for the Supreme Court reference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Prime Minister not think that the credibility of his 
spokesperson, Yves Fortier, is seriously compromised by the fact of 
his appearing before the Supreme Court to argue the exact opposite 
of what he claimed in 1987?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Mr. Fortier was an ardent defender of the Meech Lake 
accord.  His remarks, if they are to be quoted fairly, should be 
quoted in full. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Fortier described the 1982 Constitution as “an unfinished 
work” and he added:  “As a jurist, I view 1982 as a turning point 
in Canada's constitutional history.  It marks the patriation of our 
country's Constitution, the approval of an amending formula and, 
above all, the entrenchment in our Constitution of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms”.

reference to the supreme court, praised the merits of a unilateral

does the minister endorse the remarks of his spiritual leader

the option of holding a massive demonstration of national will, 
which would imply on our part a unilateral declaration of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council

posing his second question.  That would have saved my repeating the 
fact that international law permits the unilateral elimination of 
traces of colonial relations, but Quebeckers in Canada are not

the rule of law and democracy for all.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past six weeks more than 18,000 jobs have been wiped

<P><A NAME="LINK132"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the reality is that when we formed the government four 
years ago and a few months, there was 11.5 % unemployment in 
Canada. It was down to 8.6% two months ago.  There was a slight 
increase last month because of the unfortunate incident in Quebec 
and in eastern Ontario with the ice storm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have many programs to help young people in Canada. The basic 
thing we have to do is restore the finances of Canada in a way 
that we can be competitive and create jobs.  That is why we have

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 48,000 
fewer jobs for young people.  Student protests in Quebec against 
escalating education costs are the latest eruptions of 
frustration and worry among Canada's youth.  No wonder when 
average student debt loads have climbed above $25,000.  No wonder 
when Liberal policies have caused tuition fees to jump 31% since 
this government took office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister acknowledge today that a national system

<P><A NAME="LINK134"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

ministers in December we discussed the problem of young people 
finishing university with a difficult situation of debt they have 
accumulated during the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have decided to work with them.  It is also why we have 
decided with the millennium projects for Canada that the main one

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, under 
the current act, and in the opinion of a well-known tax consultant firm, 
shipping companies incorporated abroad and administered from Canada are 
protected from any challenge by Revenue Canada regarding their place of 
business and, therefore, the taxes they might otherwise have to pay in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the current legislation does not clearly protect holding 
corporations engaged in international shipping activities, as do the

C-28 will correct this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Finance. By protecting holding 
corporations in the Income Tax Act, by protecting his business, through 
legislative provisions, from any possible challenge by Revenue Canada 
regarding place of residence, is the minister not clearly and directly 
putting himself in a conflict of interest? 
<P><A NAME="LINK147"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it

</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the existence of a conflict of interest, the ethics 
commissioner said that everything was done according to the rules. The

entitled to these tax savings.

opponent to trade and investment when he was in opposition.  Let

said it is a shame we have to rely on newspapers to begin to 
enlighten not only Canadians but elected Canadians.

the questions about where people stand on trade, on investment 
and on job creation are pointed at the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will know that as soon as I became trade minister I 
wanted to engage in greater debate, not hide it.  It was I who 
requested the committee to look into the MAI.  It was the

members of Parliament and engaged NGOs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
considering he has only had two questions in four months one 
would think he would have a better answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister would start listening to himself he might 
recollect what he said in 1992.  During the free trade debate in 
1992 he said this House should condemn the government for its 
failure to be completely open with Canadians about the principles 
and objectives of the NAFTA.  That is exactly what we are talking 
about with the MAI.

have prepared those two questions better or at least finished the 
second question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure what the member's complaint is.  We have engaged 
the Canadian public in a national debate.  We want more debate 
and more information.  The question that should be asked is what 
is the Reform Party doing.  How many briefings has he had across 
the country?  As opposition critic, has he triggered a national 
debate in this House?  Has the Reform Party used opposition day 
motions?  No, it has not.  It is its own insecurity that 
motivates the two pathetic questions in the last four months.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Transport has asked for a review of the grain 
handling and transportation system from farmer to port.  If this 
review is to have any credibility, producers must have all 
options of grain transport available to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of Transport halt the elimination of one of 
these options?  Will he ensure that not one more kilometre of 
track is torn up, allowing time for Judge Estey to report? 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. 
member for her question.  It is an important issue to this 
government, to her, and to constituents across Canada, especially 
in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member will know that the rail lines in this country 
have to submit five year plans before they do anything with any 
rail line anywhere in Canada.  If the hon. member wants to 
familiarize herself with the process, she will learn whether or 
not a particular rail line will be closed down.  Then when the 
decision is made, if a decision is made, on a rail line 
abandonment, that procedure, that process takes an entire 
three-year period before that track is torn up.

last week the Minister of National Defence informed the House 
that the Prime Minister and the government were waiting for 
Saddam Hussein to come to his senses.  I would suggest that the 
revelations of the last couple of days require that the minister 
come to his senses as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anthrax is a biological weapons agent.  Anthrax vaccine takes 28

within 28 days of inoculation.

indicated to this House have and will be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not true what hon. members are saying about these 
inoculations.  The first inoculation has in 85% of individuals an 
effective factor and until the subsequent inoculations are taken 
there are antibiotics that will cover the situation quite 
adequately.  The medical doctors of the Canadian forces and I 
have discussed this matter. I am quite satisfied that our troops 
are properly protected.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to point out that in last year's budget we 
introduced the Canada Foundation for Innovation, an $800 million

networks of centres of excellence, made it a permanent program. 
We added money to IRAP, as we promised again in the red book.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK217">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-4, an act to amend the 
Canadian Wheat Board and to make consequential amendments to 
other acts, as reported (with amendment) from the committee; and 
of Motions Nos. 42, 43, 44, 46 and 48. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Brandon—Souris had the 
floor.  My colleague, you have eight minutes left in your 
remarks. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate that leniency.  I did not realize I had that much time 
but I can certainly spend that much time speaking to this very 
important piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nice to see members of the committee on the government 
side still in the House, obviously listening to some of the more 
proactive amendments that have gone forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned on this particular group of motions, the major 
issue that is being dealt with here is the inclusion clause that 
has been put into this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-72, when it was tabled prior to the election, there 
was no mention of any inclusion, the inclusion clause being that 
of canola, flax, rye and oats.  We were told in committee after 
Bill C-4 came back and this inclusion clause appeared 
mysteriously in the legislation, that when the committee went 
throughout the country on Bill C-72 it had heard from hundreds 
and hundreds people who wanted to come forward and have the 
opportunity to include these other clauses as a single desk 
seller on the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, surprise, surprise.  When we sat in committee and dealt 
with Bill C-4, very few of those hundreds of individuals who 
wanted inclusion came forward.  As a matter of fact the majority 
of the people who came forward to committee spoke totally in 
opposition to this particular clause, that of inclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were some individuals who did suggest that inclusion was 
fine, but almost all of those individuals and organizations who 
came forward spoke totally in opposition to inclusion.  Let me 
give some names. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The canola growers. These are the same producers that this 
government suggests it is going to represent, that the Canadian 
Wheat Board represents the producers of western Canada.  These 
are the same producers that came forward and said emphatically 
that they did not want to be part of the board with this 
particular commodity.  They said that canola should be out of the 
board with no option at all of having it put in.  These are the 
same producers that this government says it is trying to 
represent and have represented on the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My most serious concern is with the loss of industrial 
opportunities in this country because of this inclusion clause. 
That comes specifically from the canola processors. They were in 
front of the committee and they said again emphatically “If we 
are to invest industrially in western Canada, why would we do it 
when our raw material could be jeopardized?” Just the simple 
fact that the word canola is in this particular legislation will 
scare investment out of our country. That is not scaremongering, 
it is fact.

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked to the chief executive officers of these 
corporations which I assume members of the government have not 
done.  B.C.O. said “Why would we invest tens of millions of 
dollars into a commodity that we may not have access to if in 
fact this legislation goes through?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our area of western Manitoba and western Canada depend on this 
type of industrial job creation. If we do not have the ability to 
develop our own markets and our own raw material, then we will 
not develop those jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The flax producers also came before the committee. They do not 
want flax put in as an opportunity of inclusion into the 
legislation. The same producers that this government says they 
want to represent are saying “Do not represent us. Get it out of 
the legislation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The oats producers also came forward. In fact oats used to be a 
commodity under the Canadian Wheat Board. It was a single desk 
seller. It was taken out of the wheat board's jurisdiction and 
surprise, surprise, they do not want back in. They say that since 
oats has been taken out, their value has increased in that 
commodity, that in fact it has reached world markets, that in 
fact its marketing costs have dropped by about a third from the 
point when they were in the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same producers that this government says they want to 
represent in the Canadian Wheat Board do not want to be 
represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is going to go forward and pass this 
legislation with respect to the Canadian Wheat Board with wheat 
and with barley, my plea if you will, is please do not extend 
that to other commodities. We do not want it. The producers do 
not want it. We do not know who wants it quite frankly, perhaps 
with the exception of one hon. member on the government side who 
is going to destroy the wheat board with this type of clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another organization has some serious concerns and it came to 
committee. That organization is the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange. 
The Winnipeg Commodity Exchange deals in canola futures. If it 
were a single desk seller, those canola futures would not be 
available to the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange. That organization 
has substantial employment in the province of Manitoba and 
certainly develops a market for the canola product that is 
produced by western Canadian farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are having an excellent debate, if I can just share that, 
with the proponent of inclusion and everyone else who is opposed 
to inclusion, but perhaps there could be order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I approached this government, this minister and these 
individuals who are so bent on having the inclusion clause, the 
answer they gave me for having the inclusion clause was, first of 
all that everybody wants it, which they do not. Second was that 
if you have exclusion, then you have to have inclusion. Guess 
what. We would be more than happy to get rid of the exclusion 
clause with the Canadian Wheat Board to in fact achieve getting 
rid of the inclusion clause in this particular piece of 
legislation. There are no more other answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was one more which was really ridiculous but I will share 
it.  The other answer was, “Hon. member for Brandon—Souris, do 
not worry about it. It is never going to be triggered, it is 
never going to be enacted”. That was the answer I got back from 
members of the committee, “Do not worry about it. Inclusion is 
in the act but it is never going to happen”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guess what.  If it is never going to happen, get it out of 
there. Do not leave the inclusion clause in.  It is putting fear 
into the marketplace. That fear in the marketplace is going to 
have a dramatic impact on the industrial development not only of 
the crop itself for the producers but also for jobs that we can 
create in western Canada based on these crops, based on the value 
added of these crops.  Just having it in there is a very scary 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will pass my time on to others whom I know speak as 
passionately as I to this particular clause.  If there is one 
amendment that the House listens to honestly, to all the people 
who have spoken, this is it.  Make no mistake. The inclusion 
clause must be taken out of this legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
my pleasure to rise today in the House and to join with my 
colleagues on both sides of the House to discuss this important 
piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I shared what I want to say with a couple of the Reform Party 
members outside the House this afternoon when we were discussing 
this.  My interest in this bill of course is as a rural member in 
Manitoba on behalf of the farmers there.  It is also of 
particular importance because I shared with them my own family 
background where the Iftody family came to this country 100 years 
ago.  This year we will be celebrating 100 years of being in 
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My ancestors came here as farmers.  They were clearing the land 
as grain farmers.  Those good people and their successive 
generations, like many immigrants from eastern Europe, cleared 
that land and planted primarily grain.  That evolved to a much 
more sophisticated system but all of them will tell, if hon. 
members will listen on both sides of the House, of the changes 
that have occurred in the industry in the past 100 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will tell, and some have told me, of the monopolies in the 
1920s and 1930s of the large private grain companies that were 
gouging the farmers, controlling that process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it absolutely surprising, strange and odd indeed that 
some of these members of Parliament are advocating a return to 
that place where invariably with the break-up of the wheat board 
we would have a companion, parallel process of monopolization 
with one grain company buying the other and buying the other 
until we are left with one or two large companies again in Canada 
competing against the small farmer whom these folks ostensibly 
are trying to protect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the background to some of the comments I want to make on 
this.  First, in the small business sector, or perhaps a farmer 
in a small farming operation, where would he or she today in the 
free market find an underwriter for exporting their product 
overseas?  Some of the members have raised that question most 
recently about moneys owed to Poland, Russia or Asia because they 
need forward financing in order to buy the grain.  Who would do 
that?  Would the farmers be expected to pay the premiums on that 
and the risk of exporting in insurance as other manufacturers? 
Who would cover that?  We have not talked about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a guarantee of $6 billion by the Government of Canada 
for the Canadian farmers.  I think that is significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Export Development Corporation, for example, does provide 
insurance policies as well for farmers who are exporting.  Even 
in my own riding, if they are shipping overseas they do not know 
whether that receipt will come back void, that the company has 
shut down and they will lose that shipment.  They need those 
guarantees.  They are well placed companies, some of them doing 
$55 million or $100 million worth of exports.  They need that 
insurance. They seek that insurance.  It is provided through 
instruments of the Government of Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the democratic process of the election of the 
board members, I cannot understand how it is, after the whole 
history of the wheat board and talking to farmers in Manitoba, 
grandfathers, sons and daughters who have farmed, that somebody 
would argue that for the first time in history we would allow and 
elect 66% of the members of that board, freely and duly elected, 
by the farmers.  This is the first time.  Yet we have opposition 
to that.  We have members of parliament who will stand in this 
House and vote against that democratic process and that 
principle.  I find that really puzzling and troubling.  This is a 
historic moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time these farmers lobbying in the coffee shops in 
my riding of Provencher, for example, will have the opportunity 
to talk to their colleagues about their plans for the marketing 
of grain in Canada, outside of Canada, to the U.S., to the Asian 
markets, and they will seek the approval of their peers.  They 
will lobby and they will put their ideas forward in Alberta, in 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they have the guarantee of those people and have the 
confidence of their brother and sister farmers they will get that 
vote.  They will get that vote and they will become a board 
member.  How can anyone argue against that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is now emerging a charter challenge against the wheat 
board under the rights and freedoms.  The Prime Minister of 
Canada, at that time the minister of justice, brought in the 
charter of rights and freedoms.  He argued for it in the House of 
Commons.  The very people now who want to use that were arguing 
against the charter.  They did not want the charter. They were 
arguing for the notwithstanding clause in the charter which 
eventually they got.  The notwithstanding clause in the charter 
generally says that any rights that may be abridged or abrogated 
in the charter, notwithstanding the collective good, may be 
overridden.  What some of the members are forgetting to discuss 
is the larger question of the collective good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found it curious that they would apply to the human rights 
commission to invoke the charter of rights and freedoms to be 
able to accomplish we do not know what, but a charter of rights 
and freedoms that they attacked in 1980, in 1983 and that they 
continue to attack today.  I find that puzzling indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been some discussion about the inclusion clause.  I 
too have some concerns about it.  My bottom line for the farmers 
in my riding of Provencher is that I want them to prosper, I want 
them to do well, I want them to have a fuller say in the 
marketing of their grain, but we look at it in the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone is talking about the spot market and rushing over the 
border with a load of grain.  We saw what happened in the Durham 
wheat question when our farmers were bringing grain over into 
Montana.  There were almost fist fights at the local elevator 
prompting them to go to their congressmen and senators.  Then 
they imposed an arbitrary cap on the kind and amount of wheat we 
could send to the U.S.  Is it not logical and clear to some of 
the members in the House?  How long do they think we will ship 
our grain over with our trucks to the U.S. before the American 
farmers are on the phone to their local politicians?  Do we want 
to be beholden to them?  I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not argue that we do not need changes to the wheat board. 
We need some fundamental changes to the wheat board.  It must be 
responsive to Canadian farmers.  I asked and requested it to be 
responsive to the farmers in my riding.  To suggest that we blow 
it open and disband it and put it in the hands of a short term 
interest is not wise and it is not prudent.  Ultimately it would 
hurt farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do have some concerns with the inclusion clause.  I share some 
of the views of my colleague from Brandon—Souris.  I appreciate 
his views.  I too met with a number of people to discuss this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met with canola growers.  I met with western wheat growers 
following their meeting with the hon. member I had mentioned. 
They said to me that they would support the bill if the inclusion 
clause were removed.  They said they would support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said I will meet you half way if you give me a letter stating 
that is a public position of yours. I would take it to the 
Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and to the Prime Minister 
and say look, we have some movement here.  I am still waiting for 
the letter.  I was hoping to have received it today.  I have not 
received the letter and the member for Brandon—Souris said that 
if there were some changes, he would support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there is still some area for discussion here.  But the 
bottom line is this. With the underpinning of the 66% of the 
board and the members having control over that process, how would 
it be possible that they would violate the will of the farmers 
they are ostensibly elected to represent and they would include 
something in the board, canola for example, without the approval 
of those farmers?  I think it is inconceivable.  It cannot 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member was asking those rhetorical questions.  Could it 
happen?  I think very unlikely.  It is a safety measure, but you 
cannot look at these structural changes in one year, three year. 
We talk about five year and ten year corporate plans.  In 
something this important to western Canada, we need a 25 year 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, I think we can support the basic intent and spirit 
of this bill, which is to bring a democratic reform to the 
Canadian Wheat Board, that regular farmers, men and women, can 
sit on that board and make long term decisions which are in their 
best interests and in the best interests of their children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it is sort of a miracle, in view of the fact that the government 
over there has once again put time allocation on the free speech 
of members of Parliament representing their constituents, that I 
am able to speak at all.  I like to participate in miracles.  I 
am glad to have this opportunity to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I live on a dairy farm.  It is not a western grain producing 
farm but it depends very much on the free movement of western 
produced grain.  I have some idea of what farmers across western 
Canada are facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a privilege to speak during this report stage of Bill C-4, 
an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to at least give the government a bit of credit for being 
consistent. This legislation was flawed in the last session as 
Bill C-72 and is still flawed.  Perhaps one of the biggest 
shortcomings is that the legislation will not bring about 
voluntary participation in the Canadian Wheat Board.  This means 
farmers still will not have the freedom to choose how they want 
to market their grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4 gives Canadian wheat farmers no options.  Thousands of 
farmers have told the government they are not happy with the 
Canadian Wheat Board monopoly. These farmers want the right to 
market their product themselves and Bill C-4 simply ignores those 
demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like so many initiatives by this Liberal government, it is 
window dressing.  Bill C-4 is a poor attempt by the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food to make it appear as though it is 
responding to farmer demands for change.  By doing so and by 
effectively doing nothing, it has dodged the real issue of 
marketing options, and the minister's attempts to placate 
producers with this legislation could backfire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wheat Board's grip on the sale of wheat and barley 
is an extremely controversial and divisive issue among Canadian 
wheat farmers.  Yet the government fails to recognize that this 
controversy will not simply go away.  As a result, farmers on 
both sides of the issue are growing increasingly frustrated 
because the minister will not deal with the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has adopted a zero sum approach in this matter, an 
all or nothing attitude.  Instead of establishing mechanisms 
which would allow farmers to choose how their grain will be sold, 
the exclusion and inclusion clauses in the bill leave no room for 
compromise.  These clauses mean that various grain producing 
groups could eventually vote to have their product included in or 
excluded from the Canadian Wheat Board.  This means that a 
particular grain product is either in or out. 
There is no middle ground for farmers who are on the losing end 
of a vote concerning the inclusion or exclusion of a particular 
grain product.  Far from preserving the Canadian Wheat Board, 
this situation could ultimately destroy it as one producer group 
after another chooses to get out from under its thumb.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These concerns are not new to the Liberals.  Nor are they 
without merit.  In fact the government ignored recommendations 
from its own western grain marketing panel.  In July 1996, after 
a year long study, the panel told the government that the 
Canadian Wheat Board should operate more like a private company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It went on to say that the board's monopoly on the sale of wheat 
should be reduced and that its monopoly on export feed barley 
should be ended.  Yet, with an all or nothing display, the 
plebiscite that the minister finally permitted for barley growers 
early this year gave farmers little choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically they were asked “Do you want to go or stay with the 
Canadian Wheat Board?”  There was nothing in between.  What kind 
of choice is that?  The plebiscite charade has left farmers more 
frustrated than ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know how dangerous it is for governments or government 
agencies to try to settle issues by wording questions that 
influence the outcome.  We saw that in the latest of Quebec's 
never ending referenda.  The point here is that attempting to 
influence the outcome never helps to settle the issue.  It just 
makes it worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4 would allow for the election of 10 members to the new 
board of directors.  However, this is not enough, as a fully 
elected board of directors is necessary if the voice of farmers 
is truly to be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if just three elected directors were to shift their 
vote to align with the five government appointed members of the 
board, the majority of directors elected by the farmers would 
find themselves outvoted.  So much for democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ability of the directors to represent the farmers who 
elected them is in doubt.  That is one of the reasons I fully 
support Motions Nos. 42 and 43 to this flawed bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just like CSIS, Canada's secretive spy agency, the Canadian 
Wheat Board does not have to answer to the Access to Information 
Act.  It cannot be audited by the auditor general.  How can the 
directors act freely if they are bound by this secrecy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the directors would not hold ultimate authority 
over the Canadian Wheat Board.  That is because the agriculture 
minister and the finance minister would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect, the corporate plan, which includes all the businesses 
and activities of the Canadian Wheat Board, as well as its annual 
borrowing plan, would have to be approved by the Minister of 
Finance.  This means that even though the Canadian Wheat Board 
would no longer officially be a crown corporation, the federal 
government's grip would actually be tighter from a financial 
point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The directors could also be denied liability protection if they 
were to speak and act freely on behalf of farmers.  Directors 
would only be covered for liability if they acted in the best 
interest of the corporation.  This creates an automatic conflict 
of interest as any instructions given to the Canadian Wheat Board 
by the federal government are defined as being in the best 
interest of the corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a director does not follow government directives, will they 
be held liable for not acting in the best interests of the 
corporation?  I would suggest that there are some serious 
consequences which the government has failed to address in the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would also mean that a province planning to make 
changes demanded by a majority of its farmers is out of luck. 
Bill C-4 is binding on the provinces.  Because this is the case, 
the federal government should have consulted with the provinces 
on the reform of the Canadian Wheat Board.  This was not done and 
the Liberals charged ahead on their own.  The message from the 
federal government clearly says “Forget it.  We are in charge 
here”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Canadian Wheat Board is being left wide open as 
a target in international trade negotiations.  This legislation 
will not satisfy our trading partners that the Canadian Wheat 
Board is independent from the federal government.  This is 
significant because countries like the U.S. are pointing out that 
the Canadian Wheat Board, with the large degree of involvement 
and control by the federal government, gives Canada an unfair 
trading advantage.  This will make the Canadian Wheat Board a 
target during the next round of trade negotiations at the World 
Trade Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this the best the Liberals could come up with?  There are 
approximately 110,000 grain farmers in the prairie provinces and 
parts of British Columbia.  The Canadian Wheat Board controls $5 
billion in sales annually. 
Even with the significance of these numbers it is hard to believe 
that the government has simply introduced this recycled 
legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just Reform MPs who are opposed to the legislation. As 
I mentioned earlier a majority of grain producer groups oppose 
Bill C-4.  In fact they have been busy since the House last 
debated the legislation.  The coalition against Bill C-4 has 
continued to pressure the agriculture minister to take the 
opposition amendments seriously.  The list of member groups 
opposed to the legislation includes, to name only a few, the 
Canadian Canola Growers Association, the Flax Growers of Western 
Canada, the Western Barley Growers Association, the Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business and the Western Canadian Wheat 
Growers Association.  How much more does the government want? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, almost 100 witnesses stood before the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture and Agri-food to comment on its 
predecessor, Bill C-72.  Virtually all farm groups appearing told 
the committee that this was a fundamentally flawed piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the government done?  In one word, nothing.  Like so 
many other Liberal promises the government's legislation is 
similar: long on style but short on substance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I want to serve notice that I will not be 
supporting this piece of government legislation.  I further urge 
members on both sides of the House to vote against Bill C-4 at 
third reading.  It is clear the government has been consistently 
wrong on how to best address the needs of Canadian wheat farmers, 
and this bill is no exception. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am happy to take part in the debate today on Bill C-4 at report 
stage, specifically on the matter of inclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I start to address my remarks to that section, I want to 
register as loudly as I can my very strong disapproval for the 
government using closure or time allocation to kill debate on the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely shameful the Liberals have done this.  They 
were the biggest group arguing against Brian Mulroney's use of 
closure in the 34th parliament.  It was shameful that Mulroney 
used closure as much as he did.  But guess what happens when the 
Liberals are in power?  They up the ante and even use it more 
often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On an item that is so important to the Canadian farmers we see 
Liberals using closure to close down the debate which is very 
consistent with the way the minister and the government have 
handled the issue in the last number of years I have been in 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we need a bit of history about this debate.  I want to 
put on record that my family and I have a 2,000 acre grain farm 
in Alberta.  We are under the Canadian Wheat Board area, unlike 
the member for Malpeque who has influenced the debate so much 
with the inclusion clause.  We are not growing potatoes in Prince 
Edward Island.  We are under the Canadian Wheat Board area so we 
know firsthand what the effects are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a growing mood over the last 15 years or so for 
people to want a choice on how they market their grain.  I know 
some constituents want to continue to use the Canadian Wheat 
Board to average their prices and accept the pooling method.  I 
respect the choice that they want to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hearing more and more people saying that they do not want 
to be part of that system.  They want to market their own grain. 
That rush of people is growing more and more as the government 
mishandles this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the debate all about?  I believe it should be about a 
matter of choice.  It was interesting when the member for 
Provencher talked about eastern Europeans who really settled the 
land in Manitoba where he is from.  A lot of people came to 
Canada, farmed and opened up the west.  What were they coming 
here for?  They were coming for new opportunity. They were coming 
so they could have some choice in what they did, not to be under 
the socialist system of eastern Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not ironic that the people who are trying to support the 
idea of maintaining the Canadian Wheat Board and its monopoly are 
largely coming from the board members themselves and the advisory 
group?   What does that tell us?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when eastern Europe went through dramatic changes 
socialist countries with failed policy, especially in 
agriculture, were breaking down the barriers, realizing that a 
market economy was the way to go, and moving to a market economy. 
At the same time a country like Canada with its Liberal 
government is moving to strengthen its monopoly over more crops 
grown by farmers for the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something happened.  The communist countries and Canada passed 
in the night a few years ago.  It is a failed policy in Europe. 
Why would it not be a failed policy here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the special panel hand picked by the minister to 
review what was happening in terms of what farmers wanted on 
grain marketing.  He did not do it willingly.  There was a lot of 
pressure on him to make changes.  His response was to hand pick 
this panel.  I think his former campaign manager was the chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The panel members travelled across western Canada, determined 
that they would hold on to the wheat board monopoly.  The 
evidence from farmers was compelling.  They said “I do not want 
that.  It is fine if my neighbour does, but give us a choice”. I 
attended some of those hearings and the percentage of people who 
said that was overwhelming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The panel had to write a report that reflected what it was 
hearing across the country.  Did the minister of agriculture at 
the time listen to his own hand picked panel?  He never even met 
with the panel.  After a year of study and travel around western 
Canada and a couple of million dollars of taxpayers' money the 
minister does not even read the report because he hears that the 
panel is recommending that farmers want choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of government do we have?  A monopoly situation, state 
controlled.  Does that not remind us of something we used to hear 
about in communist countries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did we hear from the farmers who attended the hearings?  I 
was at many of them.  I heard that they wanted choice.  I heard 
that they are not able to plan properly.  They have high input 
costs.  It is a big business these days.  On our farm machinery 
costs are probably half a million dollars.  They need to know 
what prices are for their product.  The farmers who are doing 
well are bypassing the Canadian Wheat Board because it is not 
reflecting their concerns.  They are bypassing the Canadian Wheat 
Board because the board does not provide them with the options 
they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Modern farmers are now growing crops which the board does not 
handle. If this board is left in place I predict that the amount 
of grain it will handle will continue to go down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The special panel made a report which the minister did not like. 
He took his own survey and said that there was overwhelming 
support for the board.  Then he instituted Bill C-72. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the agriculture committee travelled across the country and 
listened to farmers.  The member for Malpeque was a member of 
that committee.  I attended many of those hearings as well. 
Farmers were saying that they wanted choice.  Some farmers on the 
other side of the issue wanted to keep the Canadian Wheat Board 
in tact to market their grain.  They said “Don't touch it. Leave 
it as it is”.  I respect that opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Younger farmers said they wanted a choice.  There were the 
growing number of people who were making presentations.  I never 
heard anybody say they wanted more crops included under the 
Canadian Wheat Board mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Bill C-72 died and the sphinx that rose from the ashes of 
it became Bill C-4, all of a sudden there was an inclusion 
clause.  Crops were included that were not previously under the 
board:  flax, rye, canola and peas.  They can now be included. It 
was a red herring floated by the member for Malpeque, but it 
suddenly took on a life of its own and now it is in Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are not happy.  Farmers walked out on the Minister 
responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board about three weeks ago at 
hearings in Regina.  They will not accept this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to wonder who wants this monopoly power and why they 
want the monopoly to include more items than before.  I suggest 
it is the Liberal government that needs to maintain control.  I 
suggest the Liberals are faltering.  They realize that the only 
way to keep this is to keep the lid on it and not give the 
auditor general power to audit the books of the Canadian Wheat 
Board, as we requested, and not to let us have access to 
information in the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ninety-nine per cent of the Canadian economy runs on a market 
economy.  There are some exceptions such as power companies that 
have control because they are the only supplier. 
But then we put in things like public utilities boards to look 
after the public's interest and have hearings before they can 
have rate increases.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other side for farmers, what do we have? We have the 
Canadian Wheat Board and it says that any grain that is exported 
from Canada in wheat and barley has to go through the Canadian 
Wheat Board. Farmers cannot do it themselves. Supposedly they are 
not smart enough, I guess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet we are able to sell our canola, our flax, our rye, our oats, 
our peas, our clover, our hay and livestock every day on the world 
markets, and farmers are doing fine. So what kind of a piece of 
legislation do we have here? It just does not make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see the member for Malpeque wanting the Canadian Wheat 
Board for potatoes. Why does it not include potatoes? Why does it 
not include Ontario? Why does it not include Quebec? No, western 
Canadian grain farmers have to have big brother government do it 
for them. Even worse, we are going to include more of your crops 
so you are not going to have the flexibility to be able to 
operate. It is absolutely shameful and it should be withdrawn. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I do welcome the 
opportunity to speak on group 7 motions of Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This section of motions especially relating to the inclusion 
clause seems to have provoked a lot of yelling from Reform 
members. Sadly, their yelling is based on scare tactics and 
misinformation. Their comments are generating a lot more heat 
than light on the subject at hand, Bill C-4, and what it will do 
for the farm community. In their efforts to mislead western 
farmers, some members opposite have attacked me personally and 
where I live and what I produce. They do so on the basis that 
they believe I authored the so-called inclusion clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is I did not author the inclusion clause. Western 
Canadian farmers authored the inclusion clause through the 
hearings that we held in western Canada last spring. That is who 
authored the inclusion clause. They demanded choice in terms of 
putting other products under the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite talked about the member for Peace River. He 
said he was at some hearings. Yes, I will admit I saw him at some 
hearings. I was at them all. The members of the previous standing 
committee on agriculture were at them all. We heard what 
individual after individual farmer had to say to us in terms of 
wanting to strengthen the Canadian Wheat Board by having the 
opportunity through a democratic process to put more products 
under it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question why the vast majority of farmers want to 
see the Canadian Wheat Board strengthened and expanded. It is 
easy to see why they have such great faith in the Canadian Wheat 
Board, and I will turn to the study by Kraft, Furtan and 
Tyrchniewicz on a performance evaluation of the Canadian Wheat 
Board.  They conclude in their study: “The results show that 
Canadian Wheat Board marketing averaged an increase to the wheat 
pool account of $13.35 per tonne, or $265 million per year for 
the 14 year period over what would have been realized by multiple 
sellers”. That is a pretty good performance, and that is what 
farmers want to see more often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They believe strongly in the Canadian Wheat Board principles, 
single desk selling, price pooling, guarantee of prices and 
guarantee on borrowings by the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what has been said, what the inclusion clause allows 
is an opportunity for farmers with no choice currently but the 
open market to look at another option, that of single desk 
selling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not surprised at all when the Winnipeg commodity exchange 
came before the agriculture committee which I was at and attacked 
this bill strenuously. Of course it would attack it, because when 
the open market fails and the Winnipeg commodity exchange fails, 
it does not want farmers to have a choice to go another approach 
of marketing, which is single desk selling through the Canadian 
Wheat Board. That is the reality.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Peace River has said this many times as did the 
member from Prince George earlier.  I quote the member for Peace 
River: “There is a growing mood that people want choice”.  He 
talked about choice many times, and that is what the inclusion 
clause does.  It puts farmers in charge of their own destiny 
through a democratic process.  It gives them the choice of 
another option in terms of marketing.  That is what farmers 
demanded during our committee hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been called a potato producer so many times, although I 
do not grow potatoes, because I happen to currently live in 
Prince Edward Island.  This impression they are trying to leave 
is because I am a strong supporter of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
Because I do not live out west they think I do not know anything 
about it.  I would like any Reform member opposite to stack up 
against my list of staying at homes in western Canada over a 17 
year period in community after community in Manitoba, 
Saskatchewan, Alberta and B.C. and talking to farmers around the 
kitchen table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I went out west, first as president and organizer of the 
National Farmers Union, I to ask in my own mind why people so 
strongly supported the Canadian Wheat Board.  What was this 
instrument that they had such great faith in?  They talked about 
the history of how the grain companies used to rip them off and 
how the Canadian Wheat Board has been part of their salvation in 
terms of being one of the paramount marketing institutions in the 
world today since its beginning in 1935. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of this, I studied that extensively.  I spent time 
in the Canadian Wheat Board offices.  I spent time in farmers' 
homes and I believe very strongly that there is very strong 
support.  Votes on the Canadian Wheat Board have shown that there 
is strong support for the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud to stand in the House, having served for 11 
years as president of an organization mainly centred in 
western Canada, in support of the inclusion clause going into 
Bill C-4.  That is what farmers demanded and when farmers demand 
something this government tries to act on it and give them that 
choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak on one other motion, Motion No. 46, the access 
to information request.  The amendment under Motion No. 46 would 
require the Canadian Wheat Board to reveal far more information 
about its business transactions than does any of its competitors. 
The obligation to disclose commercially sensitive information 
would place the Canadian Wheat Board at a disadvantage when it 
negotiates contracts with international buyers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this bill, the new board of directors will have access to 
any and all information it wishes to see concerning the Canadian 
Wheat Board operations and sales contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other government operations that are not subject to 
the Access to Information Act.  The Export Development 
Corporation, which is also involved in international trade, is an 
example.  Producer elected directors will be able to decide what 
information could be released to producers without compromising 
Canadian Wheat Board operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that the Canadian Wheat Board has not 
been secretive.  In fact, it has been very open.  The Canadian 
Wheat Board is currently engaged in its annual grain day meetings 
where the commissionaires of the wheat board travel to towns 
across western Canada to meet with and answer the questions of 
farmers.  The Canadian Wheat Board has a 1-800 service to answer 
farmers' questions. 
It issues a detailed audited annual report which is second to 
none.  In fact, I asked at committee if we could such see a 
detailed audited annual report of the Reform Party.  I have not 
seen that come forward yet.  It is one of the most open annual 
reports of any organization.  It has opened its books up 
completely to independent academics so they could evaluate the 
board's performance.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  The member asks why all the wheat board 
advisory members do not support Bill C-4.  They all support the 
inclusion clause.  There is a little difference of opinion on the 
advisory board in terms of whether some of the things in this 
bill would weaken the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that this bill, with the election of a board 
of directors and in offering more choice through the inclusion 
clause, puts farmers in charge of their own destiny. The party 
opposite should be supporting farmers' taking charge of their own 
destiny.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I was 
not going to speak on this bill today, but when I heard some of 
the debate that was going on I felt implored to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I used to work for the National Citizens Coalition.  I talk to 
the people at home, because I realized they may be the only ones 
listening.  I remember when Andy McMechan's wife would call us at 
the National Citizens Coalition and tell us about how her husband 
was in shackles and in jail because he tried to sell his wheat 
independently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, they were facing financial hardship.  They were 
going to lose their family farm. She called in desperation to 
David Somerville and the rest of us at the National Citizens 
Coalition to ask us to help cover their bills.  They faced 
thousands of dollars in fines.  Their tractors and their trucks 
were seized.  Her husband was in jail.  She had no one to turn to 
for help, simply because her husband wanted to market his grain 
independently.  There was no wheat board to turn to because the 
wheat board was enforcing the monopoly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard members opposite say they do not like monopolies. 
They think monopolies are bad.  However, they support a monopoly 
which is state sanctioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just Andy McMechan.  There are other farmers out there 
who have had their properties seized.  Their abilities to conduct 
their business and to put food on the table for their families 
have been restricted by these policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members are standing in the House today to say they are proud of 
this bill when they know that some of their constituents, people 
on the prairies and grain marketers, are in jail, in shackles, 
facing tens of thousands of dollars in fines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the time I am honoured to stand in this House to 
represent the people of Calgary West.  However, today we are 
considering passing a bill which would entrench in law expanded 
powers for the wheat board. Its new powers would go beyond the 
control of wheat, to oats, barley, flax and other crops.  I am 
not proud of what this House is about to do.  The government is 
going to expand the powers of the wheat board and put more grains 
under its control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It boils down to free choice.  Andy McMechan was not allowed the 
free choice to market his grain independent of the wheat board. 
As a result he was deprived of his ability to put food on the 
table for his family.  He was fighting for the right, as were the 
other farmers who faced these restrictions, to have voluntary 
compliance with the board.  If they want to market their grain 
through the wheat board, that is fine.  But they had no other 
option.  They were put in jail and faced fines.  Their wives and 
their families were so desperate that they had to turn to 
non-government organizations for help.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unbelievable that we have that going on in this country. 
That they will not allow for free competition, that they are 
encouraging a legislated monopoly, and I heard another member say 
it today, indicates just how poorly run this monopoly is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk across the way about how, during the 1920s and 1930s, 
there were private monopolies.  No person who supports free 
competition supports a monopoly of any kind, whether it be 
government or private.  For them to go ahead and support the idea 
of a government monopoly that can put people in jail for wanting 
to market their grain independently, I do not know how they can 
sleep at night when they back something like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think in many ways, and this is unfortunate, it speaks to the 
arrogance, to the elitism and to just how out of touch how many 
of the people who stand and represent constituents in this 
Chamber are.  They can support a bill that would jail their 
fellow citizens for wanting to market their grain independently. 
Like I say, it is not a proud day when I have to stand and speak 
to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore the people across the way, because they are the only 
ones who can really make changes at this stage.  They have the 
narrowest majority of any government during this century aside 
from coalition governments.  For those who may be watching in 
their offices who represent rural constituencies and who know 
that vast chunks of their electorate do not support a monopoly 
bargaining on behalf of the Canada Wheat Board, please I implore 
them, they have no better opportunity than in this bill here to 
stand up for their constituents and to not merely read off of 
ministerial talking points and to represent their constituents 
and come clean on this.  Otherwise they will have to go back to 
face their electorate in the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have an opportunity here that few governments and few 
backbenchers in governments are ever afforded and they have a 
real opportunity to stand up and make a meaningful contribution. 
If they do not take this opportunity, shame on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the folks back home, expanding jurisdiction basically means 
that the government wants to expand beyond the wheat board and be 
able to go into things like canola and flax and oats and barley. 
A government never asks for power unless it intends to exercise 
it.  This means it hopes to rule out competition on these 
products like canola, flax, oats and barley.  It intends to 
expand this monopoly beyond wheat and take it to these other 
grains.  Therefore it will be impacting far more farmers than 
what the wheat board already does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, they have an incredible opportunity here to help out 
and to safeguard those farming operations across Canada.  They 
owe it to them to stand up and stand for freedom on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people across the way speak of democracy and yet they 
forget about minority rights.  Just because 50% plus 1 of people 
decide they happen to be in favour on one particular plebiscite 
does not speak to minority rights.  The only time we must have a 
democracy and where people must follow one rule is when you can 
have only one rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would not be fair, for instance, for one person to say they 
have to pay only 10% tax and another person to say they thought 
it was appropriate to pay 20% tax.  You have to have something 
that is straight across the board, an even keel for all. 
Certainly in terms of a marketing organization for grain, you do 
not need to have everybody within one board.  They should be 
allowed to have dissenting opinions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those farmers who wish to market through the Canadian Wheat 
Board, God bless them in their pursuit, but how can others 
legitimately say they wish to see their neighbour jailed, put 
behind bars, their equipment seized, and fines of tens of 
thousands of dollars placed against their operations because they 
want to operate outside the board?  I am not proud today, knowing 
this type of legislation may pass in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, I speak to the fact that the auditor general cannot have 
access to audit the Canadian Wheat Board.  If you add up all 
these incriminations, that people are going to jail for wanting 
to market their grain independently, that the auditor general 
cannot look into the books, that they are encouraging a 
government monopoly, all these things, I implore backbench MPs in 
the Liberal Party, please, they have an opportunity to stand up 
against this. 
If only a handful were to take a stand in their caucus they could 
seriously change and amend this legislation.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Cumberland—Colchester-transport; the hon. member for 
Calgary—Nose Hill—fisheries. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, what we have heard today from the Reform Party is 
the triumph of ideology over common sense.  I know Reformers do 
not like the fact that an agency within the government purview 
works and works for those for whom it is designed to work and is 
one which is supported by the majority of those farmers who use 
it because we know that it is supported by the majority of 
farmers who use it, in spite of the continual denial of that by 
the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It works, as has been made clear many times, indeed by every 
credible study of the wheat board's activity.  Mention has 
already been made of the study by Kraft and Furtan, two of 
Canada's most prominent agricultural economists.  They point out 
that each year farmers make $265 million more selling wheat 
through the wheat board than they would selling it through the 
private grain trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do Reformers have against farmers being $265 million better 
off each year selling their wheat than they would be through the 
private grain trade?  What possibly could be a problem with that, 
except that the Reform Party does not want those farmers to make 
those extra profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a study by another one of Canada's most prominent 
agricultural economists. I know the Reform Party hates the fact 
that these good economists say the wheat board is doing a good 
job. Andy Schmitz who is known all over the world as one of the 
most prominent agricultural economists also pointed out that the 
wheat board increases the returns to barley producers by $72 
million a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would the Reform Party have against barley producers making 
$72 million more a year than they would if they used the private 
trade?  Why would Reformers be opposed to that?  Because their 
ideology, their crazy right-wing, neo-Conservative ideology does 
not want that to fit.  They do not want that to work, but it does 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year there was a plebiscite by farmers across western 
Canada, those who were interested in the barley trade. 
Sixty-three per cent of those farmers, including the majority of 
farmers in those areas represented by Reform Party MPs, voted in 
favour of the Canadian Wheat Board and barley.  It was even 
difficult to get 63% of the population opposed to the GST, but 
63% support the wheat board and barley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will Reform Party members not listen to farmers who support 
the wheat board in large measure?  Sixty-three per cent support 
the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes no sense to choose an ideology over common sense. Yet 
that is what the Reform Party is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear also some of the most peculiar, indeed almost crazy 
statements by the Reform Party.  The Reform Party member for 
Cypress Hills—Grasslands, for example, compared life in Canada 
with the wheat board to life in the former Soviet Union.  He 
recommended that we read the <I>Gulag Archipelago</I> if we want 
to find a Soviet parallel to Canada with the wheat board.  It is 
at least extremism if not craziness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are all like that but only some of them speak out in these 
terms.  The Reform Party member for Skeena said that Canada is a 
police state because we have the Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really does make us wonder when this blind right-wing, 
neo-Conservative ideology, this extremist rhetoric prevails over 
common sense.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  You are absolutely wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chris Axworthy:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member says I 
am absolutely wrong. Do they think that I am wrong when all the 
studies point out that the wheat board works for farmers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get to the question of inclusion. They have also made 
crazy statements about this.  What objections could anyone have 
to farmers being asked to decide whether they want their product 
to be marketed through the wheat board?  How could that be 
anything other than a genuine democratic vote, a genuine respect 
for democracy? That is all this is doing, saying to farmers if 
they want to use the wheat board to market their product, they 
can do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see anything unreasonable about that, yet Reform Party 
members are going apoplectic about the possibility that people 
should have the right to decide to use the wheat board. Why do 
they get in that state? Because they just do not want the wheat 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talked about dual marketing. That is just the code, a step 
along the way, to getting rid of the wheat board, which is of 
course exactly what they want to do. Why do they want to get rid 
of the wheat board when it makes sense for farmers, when it 
returns to farmers a premium year over year, hundreds of millions 
of dollars more than without the wheat board? Because their 
ideology does not like it.  Ideology, common sense. Ideology 
prevails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time Reformers responded in a common sense way, gave up 
their crazy opposition to things that work and supported things 
that support Canadian farmers. Canadian farmers will continue to 
support the wheat board. We have to make sure the Liberal 
government continues to support the Canadian Wheat Board. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to 
stand to speak today to the debate on this group of motions put 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is very timely that we take into consideration 
actually a group of motions, because that is exactly what 
Reformers are trying to do. They are trying to lump in a whole 
bunch of issues, cloud the entire issue so that they do not 
understand it and they are hoping and praying that nobody else 
will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Categorically their attempts have failed to confuse those who do 
not support the wheat board. They have failed to confuse those 
who would try to follow in those particular paths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from the member for Calgary West who asked this House 
to support a great Canadian institution by basically rendering it 
immobile and ineffective through their motions. However, this 
House will not do that. This House will protect a great Canadian 
institution for the benefit of producers whom it serves, and that 
is exactly what we intend to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several members of the Reform Party suggested in this House that 
what really will happen here is that this Canadian Wheat Board as 
being an instrument of the federal government, as they declare, 
will actually be under sanction, particularly under threat by 
international forces, by international trade tribunals because it 
is an overly effective trade mechanism for the farmers of western 
Canada. That has basically been the allegation on the floor, that 
the Canadian Wheat Board will be under threat by foreign players 
because it is too effective an instrument in terms of 
international trade. It has an unfair trading advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Put this into perspective. We have heard from the hon. members 
opposite that the Canadian Wheat Board is an ineffective 
organization, that it does not work in the collective best 
interests of farmers. Yet these same members say that the 
Canadian Wheat Board will be under attack by international 
interest because it is too effective a competitor in the 
international marketplace. That just does not seem to make sense, 
quite frankly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member for Calgary West probably spent a little 
too much time down in the United States of America following Mr. 
Newt Gingrich's bandwagon, and I think he knows exactly what I am 
talking about.  When he starts to defend the United States of 
America's ability to come in and try to dismantle a great 
Canadian institution, probably for its benefit and not for the 
benefit of western Canadian farmers, I am a little suspicious of 
that. 
I wonder exactly what is the intent.  Quite frankly, I think the 
Canadian Wheat Board has to be strengthened and should be 
strengthened, which is what Bill C-4 is about to do.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition and a number of groups that oppose Bill 
C-4 have said that the federal government has ignored the Western 
Grain Marketing Panel and its recommendations.  They have accused 
the government of not listening to the panel that was selected. 
This is clearly not the case.  I would like to indicate the 
extent to which Bill C-4 reflects the recommendations of the 
Western Grain Marketing Panel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many aspects of the bill, such as those providing more 
flexibility payment options for farmers, would allow the Canadian 
Wheat Board and its client producers to do many things it cannot 
do today.  However, the decisions to implement or not to 
implement these services would rest where it should, with the 
farmer controlled board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the panel's specific recommendations regarding 
the Canadian Wheat Board, the first recommendation was that the 
amendments should accommodate restructuring the governance of the 
Canadian Wheat Board in accordance with a number of specific 
guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly Bill C-4 would restructure the Canadian Wheat Board 
from being a crown corporation with five appointed commissioners 
only, to a mixed enterprise where farmers would control the 
majority of the board of directors.  I will get to that a little 
more when I talk about the specific recommendations of this 
panel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The panel's second recommendation was to permit the Canadian 
Wheat Board to make cash purchases.  That is in Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third recommendation as to permit the Canadian Wheat Board 
to make payments to farmers for grain storage and for carrying 
costs.  That is in Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth recommendation was to allow deliveries to farmer 
owned condo storage without regard to the delivery quotas or 
contracts.  That is in Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth recommendation was to permit the Canadian Wheat Board 
to purchase grain from other than an elevator rail car or from 
other origins.  That is in Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sixth recommendation was to allow for pool accounts to be 
terminated or paid out at any time following closure of that 
pool.  That is in Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The seventh recommendation was to allow for the assignment of 
negotiable producer certificates.  That is in Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The eighth recommendation was to clarify the board's authority 
to utilize risk management tools including futures and auctions 
in dealing with the farmers and customers.  That is in Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recommendations that deal with the powers of the Canadian 
Wheat Board that came from the Western Grain Marketing Panel are 
all contained in Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The panel recommended that the Canadian Wheat Board should be 
governed by a board of directors of not less than 11 and not more 
than 15 elected and appointed members.  It went on to recommend 
that the board should be composed of a majority of farmers, a 
minimum of three representatives from the trade and a minimum of 
two representatives from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4 follows that recommendation very closely.  There would 
be 15 directors with a two-thirds majority elected by farmers. 
There is no requirement in Bill C-4 that the trade be represented 
on the board of directors as a number of groups have expressed 
concern about individuals with financial interests in the grain 
trade being on the board.  The government would appoint five 
directors from within the industry, the financial sector, 
academia or other backgrounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another recommendation of the panel on governance was that there 
should be a modern corporate structure under which a chief 
executive officer would be hired and would be responsible for the 
overall operations of the Canadian Wheat Board, reporting to the 
board through its chairperson.  This recommendation has been 
largely fulfilled in Bill C-4.  There would be a chief executive 
officer responsible for overall operations.  There would be a 
chairperson of the board.  The one difference is that the chief 
executive officer would be a member of the board itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another recommendation from the panel was to ensure a rapid and 
smooth transition to the new governance structure.  The panel 
recommended that the first members of the board of directors 
should be appointed.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This recommendation was in Bill C-72, but when that bill did not 
pass it was decided that, in order to live up to the commitment 
to have the board of directors with elected members in place by 
the end of 1998, Bill C-4 could dispense with the interim board 
of fully appointed members.  That change in Bill C-4 has been 
well received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another recommendation was that the Canadian Wheat Board 
advisory committee should continue to function until all farmer 
members of the board are elected.  In Bill C-4 the Canadian Wheat 
Board advisory committee would continue until its term is up, 
which is expected to be the same time as the new members of the 
board of directors will be ready to take office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there was a recommendation that a mechanism be 
established which makes it possible for the Canadian Wheat Board 
to begin development of a capital base.  Bill C-4 goes part way 
in that direction in that there is a provision for a contingency 
fund that is limited to three uses.  It could not be used to make 
investments in facilities, but the contingency fund partly goes 
in the direction of this recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look objectively at the 13 recommendations that were made 
by the panel with respect to the Canadian Wheat Board, Bill C-4 
in many cases follows them exactly.  In other cases it follows 
them quite closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4 is the mechanism for farmers to decide themselves 
through whom they elect to the board of directors, or in some 
cases through a vote of farmers, to what extent wheat and barley 
would covered under the Canadian Wheat Board or in an open market 
system with or without the participation of the Canadian Wheat 
Board.  As well there is a provision in the bill that provides a 
process for farmers to add oats, canola, flax and rye to the 
jurisdiction of the wheat board with or without export control 
provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just summarize.  With respect to the organization and 
operational tools of the Canadian Wheat Board, Bill C-4 follows 
very closely the recommendations of the Western Grain Marketing 
Panel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let it never be said in the House that the government does not 
listen to advice given by producers and those who are interested 
in the Canadian wheat industry.

give their voice.  I have gone to extensive efforts to find out 
exactly what the people of Wild Rose would like for me to say 
today.  I am going to make every effort to represent them in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of what they are saying across the House, Wild Rose 
grain growers are not in favour of Bill C-4.  They do not want 
it.  There are a lot of things about it that they do not like. 
If they are going to amend it there are some things they would 
want to see in it which obviously this group is not going to 
include. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that concerns farmers in Wild Rose is that the vote to 
decide whether we have Bill C-4 will basically be that of the 
Liberals.  We know they support the entire bill because they have 
been told to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not imagine that have been many wheat board town hall 
meetings in the city of Toronto lately.  I am quite certain they 
have not had very many in Montreal.  Our Bloc friends would not 
have a lot of wheat board meetings in any of their ridings.  Yet, 
all members of Parliament from those areas will not hear the 
voice of the west.  They will hear the voice of the leaders in 
the front row who say to them “When you come to vote on Bill C-4 
you will vote what I tell you to vote. That is the way it is in 
the Liberal Party.  You will vote the way you are told”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thankful I belong to a party that gives me full privilege 
to vote according to the way my constituents want me to.  I know 
how the farmers in Wild Rose want me to vote on this issue.  I 
will be representing them, even though no one else is willing to 
listen to western farmers.  After all, that is who we are talking 
about: western farmers.  That is who is being affected.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking to some of my colleagues across the way in the 
street awhile ago.  I mentioned that they should consider what is 
being said in the west and not listen to the rhetoric or their 
own caucus leaders.  They should listen to what is being said in 
the west and vote for those people because the bill affects them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One member made an interesting comment.  She said  “No, this 
wheat board.  You are all in”.  She said that it was like a 
dental plan, that if we were to have a dental plan for Canadians 
they would all be included.  I asked if that would include 
Ontario, Quebec and the Atlantic provinces.  She said 
“Absolutely”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then I said that all the farmers must be rushing from Ontario 
and from Quebec to get to Winnipeg to sign up for the wheat board 
because it is so great.  I would like to see the repercussions if 
the government were to announce that all grain growers throughout 
the country, including Ontario and Quebec, were to immediately 
come under the Canadian Wheat Board.  I would love to see the 
response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the opting out clause.  The member for 
Yorkton—Melville and the member for Portage—Lisgar would love 
to be with us, but today they are in a courtroom with a farmer 
who is also fighting for the right to sell his own product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the things we see around us, the paper on our desks, the 
chairs, the books and whatever is made, are the product of hard 
work.  At the end of the day producers can market their goods the 
best way they choose.  However, a grain farmer in western Canada 
cannot do that.  The government tells them how to market their 
barley and wheat because of these kinds of bills. Farmers simply 
want the option to use the wheat board or to use some other 
mechanism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the Conservative Party had the wisdom to open the 
continental barley market.  During those years farmers 
flourished.  Barley farmers phoned me in 1993 to tell me how well 
they did.  When we do some checking we also find that Canadian 
Wheat Board marketers got off their backsides and worked hard 
because they now had some competition and did better than they 
had ever done.  That is a good sign to me that competition is 
healthy and that it ought to be considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another farmer is being arrested because he tried to sell his 
grain.  I was at Andy McMechan's trial and I was at Bill Cairns' 
trial.  I watched them being chained and shackled and taken off 
to jail.  At the same time I saw a violent offender being given 
community service.  The policies and legislation of my colleagues 
across the way makes that possible.  Two rapists are walking free 
because of the wonderful way socialists and Liberals think that a 
rapist can walk free and get community service.  However, a 
farmer trying to demand the right to look after his own produce 
goes to jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only that but I saw the farmers get consecutive sentencing. 
I have been trying to get consecutive sentencing in the House for 
a long time.  Clifford Olson murdered 11 people and he got one 
life sentence.  Bill Cairns tried to sell his grain on two 
occasions.  He got 60 days and 90 days consecutively.  “We will 
show those rotten crooks, those mean people, those dangerous 
offenders who dare try to sell their own produce”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They worked hard.  They sowed their grain.  They planted it. 
They hoped to get the right moisture. They worked hard to get it 
into the bin, and suddenly it is not theirs any more.  It belongs 
to somebody else.  They have no way of marketing their produce 
without going through the government's Canadian Wheat Board. They 
want the option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read from an article of which I am sure most people in 
the House are aware.  It concerns the Privacy Act and is entitled 
“Canadian taxpayers hold $7 billion liability through Canadian 
Wheat Board—high profile panel wants to end government 
secrecy”: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian taxpayers hold a $7 billion liability through the 
Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) and have paid millions of dollars on 
behalf of foreign grain purchasers in order to hold this 
liability to its current level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the CWB does produce an annual report which provides a 
limited amount of information, its exemption from the federal 
Access to Information Act means taxpayers and farmers are unable 
to independently evaluate its operations and performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much the CWB fitness instructor gets paid, details of 
financial returns realized from the sale of wheat and barley in 
the 1960s and 70s, and a breakdown of demurrage costs paid by 
farmers over the years is just some of the information a high 
profile agricultural committee wants the federal government to 
disclose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A detailed synopsis of the $7 billion taxpayer liability and the 
transactions that led to this debt are also being requested. The 
outstanding amount owed is equal to $1,000 for every family of 
four in Canada.

Toronto and Montreal, but they are not very interested.  They 
might be interested in knowing that as taxpayers they are also 
being burdened with the load. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This group of people want to put an end to the secrecy at the 
Canadian Wheat Board but the government will not allow it.  In 
fact when these farmers came to Ottawa last week, the agriculture 
minister, his secretary and no one else would meet with them. 
They do not want it to become open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question that the farmers in Wild Rose are asking is, what 
is it they do not want us to know? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of those members had the gall to say to me one day “We must 
keep a lot of things secret because most farmers do not really 
know the proper method they should use to market their grain”. 
He said that if some information were disclosed to the farmers 
they would use it wrongly and it would not be helpful.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I find it rather hypocritical and want to read for the sake of 
the record some of the comments which Liberals made with respect 
to the matter of closure while they were in opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cite for the record today the now Liberal Minister of Foreign 
Affairs who was reported in the Toronto <I>Star</I> as saying on 
April 1, 1993 “It displays the utter disdain with which this 
government treats the Canadian people”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote from <I>Hansard</I> of November 16, 1992 when the now 
Liberal government House leader said “I am shocked.  This is 
just terrible.  This time we are talking about a major piece of 
legislation.  Shame on those Tories across the way”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what was said by Liberals and today we have closure on 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Kingston and the Islands, who is now the 
Deputy Speaker, said “What we have here is an absolute scandal 
in terms of the government's unwillingness to listen to the 
representatives of the people in this House.  Never before have 
we had governments so reluctant to engage in public discussion on 
the bills brought before this House”.  How appropriate that is 
for this occasion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the same individual who is now the Deputy Speaker said 
“I suggest that the government's approach to legislating is 
frankly a disgrace.  It cuts back the time the House is available 
to sit and then applies closure to cut off the debate”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, that same member from Kingston and the Islands said 
“This is not the way to run Parliament.  This is an abuse of the 
process of the House”.  That is exactly what is now being done 
by the Liberal government this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was hoping that as a result of an amended Bill C-4 we would 
have a viable, modern, democratized Canadian Wheat Board which 
would allow some market choice, some voices of moderation and a 
reasonable position.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead in cynical fashion the Liberal government has, by its 
bill, not respected the farmers as mature adults able to make 
wise choices.  They can make choices for themselves.  It is not 
like they are little kids and we need to do it for them because 
they are not wise enough to do it for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation will not bring about that voluntary 
participation in the Canadian Wheat Board.  Farmers will not have 
that freedom to choose, to exercise their mature adult will. 
This bill, as the minister knows, gives farmers no options of 
that sort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thousands of grain farmers have told the government what they 
are asking for and what they want.  They want that choice.  They 
want the choice of marketing for themselves.  It is not that 
others would have to, but it is only if they wished to do this 
they could do so.  Bill C-4 simply ignores those farmers.  It is 
a feeble attempt by this Liberal government to appear as though 
it is responding to farmers' demands for change.  It is a kind of 
charade, but it has dodged the real issue of marketing options 
for farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister attempts to placate producers with this legislation 
but they are not fooled.  It will backfire.  The Canadian Wheat 
Board's tight grip on the sale of wheat and barley has an 
extremely divisive effect back in the constituencies in the west 
among Canadian farmers. A much better approach could have been 
taken by the minister responsible for the wheat board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a controversy that will simply go away.  All farmers 
are getting more and more frustrated because the minister will 
not deal with the situation.  The minister has taken an all or 
nothing attitude instead of paving the way for farmers to choose 
how to sell their grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inclusion clauses in the bill leave no room for compromise. 
It is unbending and a cruel joke.  This means that a grain is 
either in or out.  Far from preserving the Canadian Wheat Board, 
it ultimately will destroy it as one producer group after another 
chooses to get out from under its thumb. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has ignored recommendations from its own Western 
Grain Marketing Panel.  We heard some selective quotes from the 
member opposite about some of the things the government did 
follow in some fashion but not citing those where it did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In July 1996 after a year long study the panel told the 
government that the board's monopoly on the sale of wheat should 
be reduced and that its monopoly on the export of feed barley 
should end.  That was one of the recommendations of the panel 
which was not cited by the hon. member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that all or nothing kind of display, the plebiscite that 
the minister then fixed or rigged earlier this year permitting 
barley growers gave them little choice.  The question was did 
they want to go or stay with the wheat board and nothing in 
between.  What kind of choice is that when there could have been 
other options and a fairer way to word the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are more frustrated than ever.  That barley vote was not 
unlike the referendum in Quebec where they determined the outcome 
by the wording of the question.  Farmers were fully aware at the 
very outset, from the wording of the question, what the 
determination would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The election of 10 members to the board has been referred to 
often here.  That is not enough.  A fully elected board of 
directors is mandatory if the voice of farmers is truly to be 
heard.  This hybrid kind of board will be, as we have said before 
in a speech in the <I>Hansard</I> record, like the offspring of a 
donkey and a horse, a mule.  It will be unproductive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example as has been cited, if just three directors shift 
their vote to align with the five government appointed members, 
the majority of farmer elected directors would find themselves 
outvoted.  That my friends is not a wise choice.  It is not a 
choice for farmers across our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ability of those elected directors to represent the farmers 
who elected them is also in doubt.  Just like CSIS, Canada's 
secretive spy agency, the Canadian Wheat Board does not have to 
answer to the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found it interesting to hear the member for 
Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar citing these studies in terms of all 
the benefits and all the extra dollars accrued to farmers by way 
of the Canadian Wheat Board operations.  I am not sure where 
these studies all come from in that we do not have access to 
information.  Even 30 years afterward, why would anyone need to 
withhold that information from us if there is nothing to hide? We 
do not presently have a need to have the wheat board audited by 
the auditor general.  How can those directors act freely if they 
are bound by some oath of secrecy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the Bloc member's motion. It is a good one. Motion 
No. 46 under this Group No. 7 would bring the wheat board under 
the jurisdiction of the Access to Information Act which is good 
for farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also concerned that the directors could be denied liability 
protection if they were to speak and act freely on behalf of 
farmers, which is what one would think the wheat board is all 
about and what it should be doing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Directors would only be covered it would seem for liability if 
they act in the best interest of the corporation.  Any 
instructions given to the Canadian Wheat Board by the federal 
government are defined as the best interest of the corporation. 
If a director does not follow government directives, then they 
may well be liable because they are not looking out for the 
interest of the corporation. The mandate of the wheat board 
should be to look out for the best interests of farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government as we know has also neglected to tackle the 
Canadian Wheat Board's role in grain transportation in this bill. 
There is an impending crisis in the system of grain 
transportation and the Liberals are either unwilling or 
unprepared to do anything about it. This is the very best as it 
stands before us now unamended that the Liberals could come up 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are approximately 110,000 grain farmers in the prairie 
provinces and part of British Columbia and the Canadian Wheat 
Board controls $5 billion in sales.  Given the significance of 
those numbers it is hard to believe that the government has 
simply introduced this recycled legislation. I am for recycling 
but not in this regard. We need some reformed legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost 100 witnesses stood before that agriculture committee to 
comment on the predecessor, Bill C-72. Virtually all of the farm 
groups appearing told the committee that it was a fundamentally 
flawed piece of legislation.  We need reformed legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the report stage of this bill the Liberals rammed it through 
committee in less than two weeks despite overwhelming objections 
by producer groups.  Witnesses were forced to present views in a 
confusing round table format, providing MPs with little 
opportunity to analyse thoroughly the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The presence of Reform MPs through the course of this debate has 
really been quite tremendous.  The Liberals were for the most 
part conspicuous by their absence, at times not even present in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wheat board minister obviously found little support in that 
Regina meeting and was booed off the stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Grain producer groups opposed to Bill C-4, the coalition against 
Bill C-4, have continued to press the minister to take the 
opposition amendments seriously.  Numbers of coalitions listed on 
numerous occasions over these last days oppose this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 21, and this is the case which was referred to 
before, the minister discussed in a fairly contemptuous fashion 
the matter of directors when in fact this has not yet been 
passed. This shows a disregard for Parliament and really in my 
view a contempt of Parliament.  A number of those groups invited 
to that Regina meeting walked out protesting the meeting. Again 
that is a very graphic testimony to the fact that this Bill C-4 
is a fundamentally flawed piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would say the farmers I have talked to, although 
not all agree, do want reformed legislation of the sort that 
includes the amendments that the Reform Party has put forward. 
Regrettably this bill instead of being known as the act to amend 
the Canadian Wheat Board may tragically in history go down as the 
act to end the Canadian Wheat Board. That will be a sad day.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am happy once again to speak on behalf of my 
constituents and all farmers across the west who are really after 
only one thing in this debate:  freedom of choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it has not been made clear by all the members who have spoken 
over the last days and months that the government still fails to 
understand what is bothering thousands of farmers who attend 
meetings to express their frustrations with this bill, then let 
me make it absolutely clear.  Western producers demand a say in 
how the products of their labour are dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite will claim that this venue is being given to 
them by this bill in the form of a semi-elected board.  They do 
not explain why this board cannot be completely elected. They 
fail to make a logical case for why its president must be a 
creature of the government or why it must continue as a western 
Canadian monopoly that forces otherwise free citizens to hand 
over their property with compensation based on arbitrary and 
secretive business dealings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Yorkton—Melville has put forward an amendment 
to allow farmers to opt in and out of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
His amendment will put the freedom of choice into the hands of 
the producers so that with proper notice they can decide to 
participate in the board or seek a better deal elsewhere if that 
is what seems in their best interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some might argue if we have farmers opting in and out and 
deciding one year to include a particular grain and a few years 
later to take it elsewhere, that we will undermine the ability of 
the board to conduct its business over the long term. But this 
amendment prescribes certain limits. The farmer must opt out for 
a minimum of fives years and give two years notice of opting back 
in. 
This is not a case of leaping in and out on a whim.  This is a 
case of letting well informed and self-motivated farmers decide 
their own future.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Brandon—Souris earlier today made an excellent 
case on the position of oat growers in western Canada since oats 
have been taken out from under the board.  Some might argue that 
if everybody is acting independently this will undermine the 
pooling concept and lead to chaos.  Certainly our colleagues on 
the left will throw up their hands and say that Reform is 
advocating a return to the 1920s, just before the depression that 
made some of these government organizations necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are the ones who are stuck in the early decades of this 
century when farmers were lucky to have telephones.  The modern 
reality is that farmers have access to more knowledge in a few 
seconds than some of our colleagues have obviously taken 
advantage of in the last few years.  The days of government 
paternalism are gone.  They have been swept away by the Internet 
and the satellite dish.  It is about time the government got the 
message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All those who support the Canadian Wheat Board are just as free 
to continue to use its services as they are now.  If the Canadian 
Wheat Board is the great provider that they desire, obviously 
they will be encouraged to continue to stay there.  If large 
numbers of farmers vote with their feet to find a better service 
elsewhere, this should be a clear indication that changes are 
called for in the board or even in the government's approach to 
what it tries to do for these producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have myriad examples of government departments believing that 
it is in their best interest to keep information to themselves 
rather than let private citizens make up their own minds about 
what they want.  The more compulsory a government action is, the 
less it wants anybody to know what it is up to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have amendments before us to put the activities of the board 
before the auditor general and to make it open to the Access to 
Information Act, both of which the government rejects.  Along 
with today's motion to arbitrarily limit debate we cannot help 
but believe the government and the wheat board have something to 
hide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fearing possibility that farmers might truly have a democracy 
and decide for themselves, the Reform Party does not want to see 
destruction of the wheat board.  We simply believe that it must 
behave the way a public service should:  voluntarily, openly and 
with full accountability to the producers it is meant to serve. 
If it is not strong enough to stand solidly on its own merit and 
falls by the wayside, the producers have spoken.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, before I commence my debate with respect to this 
issue I wish to raise a matter that arose in the House on Monday. 
It pertains to the member for North Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made a comment in the House to which I responded from my 
chair.  The matter he raised was a suggestion that the whips 
order their MPs how to vote.  I wish to withdraw a comment I made 
in respect to his comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that is the case in every party, especially not 
in the NDP, but at that time I used the word lie, and 
<I>Hansard</I> picked it up.  I wish to withdraw that word out of 
respect for this institution, but I still maintain that his 
comment was not accurate with respect to the NDP.  I wanted to 
get that on the record at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP at this point, as most people know, believes that Bill 
C-4 before the House is flawed legislation.  It undermines the 
Canadian Wheat Board as we know it.  The NDP tried to improve the 
bill in committee, but the Liberal majority refused to accept our 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-4 proposes a number of issues which we do not support. As 
a result of three or four key issues, we will not be voting for 
the bill.  I wish to take some time right now to inform the House 
of why we will not support the bill, in particular the clauses we 
are discussing right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the bill proposes a cash buying option.  In our view this 
will destroy a fundamental pillar of the wheat board. It will 
undermine farmers' confidence in it.  The wheat board would buy 
grains under cash buying from anyone, anywhere, any time at any 
price.  We believe this disrupts the board's long practice of 
buying grain from farmers at announced prices and distributing 
profits to all on an equitable basis.

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason we are opposed is that Bill C-4 proposes a 
contingency fund which would cost farmers as much as $575 million 
in check-offs.  It is our view that is not needed at this time, 
particularly because farmers cannot afford it.  A contingency 
fund is not necessary if Ottawa continues to provide financial 
guarantees to the board, guarantees that have been seldom used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituency of Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre has a 
significant number of farmers.  They are squeezed right now with 
input costs.  They have fuel cost crunches for spring seeding. 
They have fertilizer cost crunches for their inputs affecting 
this coming season.  They are very concerned about the 
transportation increased costs as well as a result of the 
minister responsible for the wheat board doing away with the Crow 
benefit, which has taken about $350 million to $375 million 
dollars a year out of the Saskatchewan economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was taken out of the economy after the bill which 
established the railway to the west coast, passed by parliament 
over a century ago, provided for a Crow benefit in perpetuity. 
The reason they did that was not because they were shortsighted 
in terms of their forecast for inflation or value of the dollar. 
They gave the CPR billions and billions of dollars in alternating 
sections of land across the western part of the country.  They 
gave the CPR the mineral rights to those lands so that in future 
the revenues from the land and the minerals the mining and oil 
companies produced would have provided more than adequate 
compensation to the railways in a very generous way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government and its predecessors, the Tories, allowed 
the CPR to hive off the land and sell it to Marathon Realty.  The 
profits have gone away.  They have allowed, persuaded and 
encouraged the CPR to take its Comincos, its mining companies, 
its Pan Canadian oil company, the second largest oil company in 
Canada, and hive them off into subsidiaries and not use those 
revenues or profits to sustain the railways and the 
transportation to western farmers, to our western population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Literally billions and billions of dollars have been hived off. 
All we have left is a stand alone branch line kind of railway 
system in western Canada.  The railways are now saying that they 
are not sustainable on their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the billions and billions of dollars in assets are returned 
to the CPR there will be more than adequate transportation in 
they country.  That is where we have a problem.  Canadians do not 
understand the fact that Liberal and Tory governments in the last 
100 years have allowed and encouraged assets to be removed from 
the CPR which were meant for, intended and provided by the House 
of Commons and the Parliament of Canada for the maintenance of 
the railways and a transportation system for western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we see CNR going south and expanding in the United States at 
the expense of what is happening in Canada.  Billions and 
billions of dollars were hived off into Marathon Realty, Pan 
Canadian, Cominco, the shipping and airlines.  They are all gone. 
All the assets are gone and the poor old railway says it cannot 
make a profit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food is now the minister in 
charge of the wheat board from Saskatchewan.  He encouraged all 
this.  He put the nail in the coffin in terms of some of the 
transportation problems that western Canada now has.  Farmers 
will never forget that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason we oppose Bill C-4 is that it claims to put 
farmers in control of the wheat board's destiny.  The Liberal 
government will continue to appoint the chief executive officer. 
This makes talk of a farmer controlled board in our view a 
travesty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can a farmer controlled board not have accountable to it its 
chief executive officer?  Anybody in business will know that the 
chief executive officer has to be accountable to the board.  The 
board knows what is going on and the CEO reports to the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has made it a political issue. The minister who 
has screwed farmers on the Crow rate will now screw them on this 
matter with respect to the wheat board.  I do not think farmers 
will be very happy about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support many parts of the bill.  We support the provision for 
a possible inclusion of more grains under the wheat board's 
jurisdiction.  This inclusion allows farmers to decide in a vote 
to remove grains from the board's authority.  It is only fair 
that farmers can vote to include extra grains as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Agribusiness and the Reform Party are a bit concerned about this 
matter.  The Reform Party embraced the referendum principle.  It 
should understand that if there is a referendum among producers 
to exclude or include something perhaps the referendum decision 
should be honoured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform philosophy is always do as I say and not as I do. 
Reformers say one thing to one part of the country and the 
opposite to another part of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the fundamental principles of Reformers is that they 
believe in referenda.  Yet, when it comes down to the inclusion 
or exclusion referendum, they think it is bad.  They only want 
one as opposed to both. They want the exclusion referendum but 
not the inclusion referendum.  Reformers believe they know better 
than farmers, that they know better than the 60,000 farm families 
in Saskatchewan. I do not believe that for one second.  Neither 
do the 60,000 farm families in Saskatchewan nor the farm families 
in Alberta or Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a bit of a problem.  The organizations that are opposing 
the Canadian Wheat Board, a strong institution supported by our 
party, are good farm organizations like the National Citizens' 
Coalition.  One Reform member used to work for the National 
Citizens' Coalition.  I challenge the member to name 10 citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will name a few citizens who belong to this organization: 
Conrad Black, Imperial Oil and Pan Canadian that has just 
plundered and raped our oil resources from railway system and 
hived them off for its shareholders all over the world.  These 
are the real citizens of Canada that support the National 
Citizens' Coalition which supports the Reform Party.  Its chief 
executive officer is Mr. Harper, former Reform member of 
Parliament from Calgary.  I have a great deal of respect for Mr. 
Harper but his philosophical and ideological position is in 
lockstep with the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one example but there are other significant examples. 
The Winnipeg Commodity Exchange, the Winnipeg Chamber of 
Commerce, oilseed producers or processors and Cargill are all 
great people who support the abolition of the wheat board.  They 
want to see the wheat board totally dismantled so they can go in 
there and finish the plundering of farmers that the CPR has 
undertaken and the Liberals, the Tories and the Reformers are all 
partners in.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
here we are in the final 20 minutes of debate on the bill under 
closure.  It is absolutely outrageous that we are facing closure 
again in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All through the last parliament we had closure, closure, 
closure.  The Liberal government has set a record for closure. In 
the last parliament alone it moved closure more times than in the 
entire Mulroney period prior to the Liberals.  We thought that 
was an outrageous record, but this government has demonstrated 
itself to be totally incapable of understanding the principles of 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are in the last 20 minutes of debate on an important 
bill.  When we look at the schedule through to June we have 
February, March, April, May and June.  We have five months in 
which to be talking about important bills like this one, bills 
that Canadians are interested in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what is happening?  The government is moving closure on a 
very controversial bill.  When we look at the schedule we must 
ask ourselves what is the rush.  Over the next four months there 
is nothing but a litany of boring, inconsequential, insignificant 
and irrelevant nonsense on the schedule of what we have to debate 
over the next few months.  It is boring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the people in the real world it is boring and frustrating. 
When they look at the schedule that is coming down the pike, they 
wonder why we are not talking about the Young Offenders Act, 
which they have been pleading with us for 20 years to do 
something about. 
What are we doing? We are moving closure on an important bill and 
moving to boring insignificant stuff.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They ask us why are you not talking, for goodness sake, about 
the immigration and refugee problems we have in this country.  We 
cannot talk about that because, amazing but true, Liberals think 
that immigrants to this country should not have to speak one of 
the official languages. They are quite happy for anybody to come 
here. They support the recommendations in the report that say 
that international agencies overseas should pick our refugees for 
us and send them here, even if they are incapable of settling 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at things like this and the people in the real 
world outside, the voters of Canada, want us to be debating these 
things, what is happening? We are having our time cut short. We 
are moving on to things that are technical in nature, technical 
bills, boring bills, insignificant bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The speaker before me from the NDP mentioned that the Reform 
Party believes in referenda and enacting the will of the people, 
and we do. There was a plebiscite run for the farmers in 
connection with this bill, not directly related but indirectly 
related, but it was flawed in many ways. First of all, it was a 
plebiscite, not a true referendum, and it had a carefully 
engineered question. There was no discussion about how that 
should be organized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really gave the barley farmers, who were the only ones 
involved, an all or nothing option. It reminded me of that 
advertisement on television right now where the man comes into 
the office and says tell me about RRSPs, and the adviser says 
yes, just put your head here between the vice and I will tighten 
it a little.  That was exactly what was happening to those barley 
farmers. They had their heads put in a vice where they had no 
option but to give the answer that the government wanted them to 
give. When we look at Bill C-4, we have to ask what is the rush. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder the Liberals did not want to write property rights 
into the charter of rights and freedoms, because when you look at 
what they are doing in this bill, they are preventing people from 
selling their own property on a free market. What sort of way is 
that for a civilized country to conduct itself? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> It is a socialist way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  It is a socialist way, as one of my 
colleagues said. Fancy telling people they cannot sell their own 
property on a free market, they have to be controlled by big 
brother. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is wrong and there are so many contentious issues in this 
bill, we should have been able to properly discuss it, to spread 
it out over a bit more time where there was an opportunity to get 
full input that could make a difference to the bill.  Instead of 
that, we are faced with closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, we will be moving on to some pretty boring stuff next 
week. I was just looking for a list of some of the bills here, 
and I see I do not have it with me, but just reading the names 
alone is pretty shocking when, as I mentioned, we could be 
talking about something like the Young Offenders Act, getting the 
age lowered to 10, for example. Everybody out there for 20 years 
has been asking for that, or publishing the names of young 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went to a meeting in my riding a few weeks ago, a together 
against violence group. They had a group of young people there 
who had previously been young offenders, and we discussed the 
issue of publishing names. Every one of them agreed that it would 
have been a tremendous disincentive for them to continue to 
commit crimes if they had their names published in the newspaper, 
if they had the public embarrassment that they were violating the 
rules of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are things people want us to be talking about. They want 
us to be talking about automatically upgrading to adult court 
for serious crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next week we have, for example, Bills C-21, C-20, C-19, S-4, 
C-6, C-8, C-12, S-3. That is a list of all the bills we are going 
to be looking at.  Unfortunately I do not have all the 
descriptions here, but they are certainly not worthy of the rush 
we are exhibiting with this closure on this bill here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I would just like to say that I am appalled that we 
have once again run into this problem of closure where democracy 
goes out the window and we get the Prime Minister sitting over 
there with a silly smile on his face, happy that he is once again 
forcing us to abandon debate on an important bill so that he can 
rush through an agenda that suits the socialists at the other end 
of this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on behalf of Bill 
C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments contained in Bill C-4 are based on nearly three 
years of extensive consultation and discussion with western grain 
farmers to determine what kind of grain marketing organization 
they want.  Western Canadian grain farmers have asked to retain 
the Canadian Wheat Board but they also want a more democratic, 
accountable and responsive Canadian Wheat Board, one that is 
truly in their hands, allowing them to shape the Canadian Wheat 
Board to meet their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the proposed changes in Bill C-4 actually provide 
for.  The proposed changes in Bill C-4 would put more power into 
the hands of producers than they have ever had before throughout 
the Canadian Wheat Board's 63 year history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed changes would modernize the governance of the CWB. 
They would improve the accountability to the producers and 
through the creation of a producer elected majority board of 
directors and, most important, the marketing changes proposed in 
Bill C-4 are enabling.  They would give the farmers the tools and 
the power necessary to shape the CWB's marketing structure to fit 
their present and their future needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address some of the questions that have been 
raised to clear up some of the misconceptions that have arisen 
around Bill C-4 and its proposed amendments to the CWB act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some farmers have asked if they would have more control under 
the new system of CWB governance.  The answer is yes.  The 15 
member board of directors would be comprised of 10 producer 
elected directors and 5 federal appointees.  In essence the 
farmer elected directors would enjoy a two to one majority on 
this board.  Directors would have effective control of the 
strategic direction of the new CWB and would be able to reflect 
the views and the needs of farmers in future operational and 
marketing decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These elected directors would not be subject to dismissal by the 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board.  Only those 
who elected them would be able to accomplish this through a 
subsequent election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-4 all directors would  be entitled to complete 
disclosure of all CWB facts and figures, bar none.  That is 
transparency.  They would be able to examine the prices at which 
grain is sold and the premiums achieved and all the operating 
costs and whether the CWB is operating effectively. With their 
full knowledge of the CWB and its global competition the 
directors would be in the best position to assess what 
information should be made public and what for commercial reasons 
should remain confidential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So why is the board of directors not 100% producer elected? That 
was another question asked.  Under the proposed legislation the 
government would continue to maintain a substantial financial 
commitment to the CWB.  The government would continue to 
guarantee the CWB's initial payments, its borrowing and its 
credit sales made under the credit grain sales program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This represents a strong case for the government's having a role 
in appointing some of the members of the board of directors.  In 
addition, the CWB has the public policy responsibilities. For 
example, the CWB is charged with issuing all wheat and barley 
export licences for all of Canada, not just the prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard the question why is the CWB not legally obliged to 
get the best price for farmers' grain. 
The CWB does seek to obtain the best prices possible.  In fact, 
it is a matter of policy. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT78"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT78"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1710

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, making this the corporation's legal objective would be 
difficult because the CWB seeks to obtain the best price for 
producers jointly through pool accounts.  It is not always 
possible to show, after the fact, if higher returns could have 
been realized for individual producers because a different set of 
marketing decisions may have been made.  Therefore, to make the 
CWB legally responsible to achieve the best price for individual 
farmers would result in countless legal challenges being made to 
the board's marketing decisions.  It would sort of be like 
dealing with it by 20:20 hindsight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking to the future, the board of directors would be 
responsible for ensuring that the sales programs would be well 
managed and that the CWB operated in the best interests of the 
producers.  This would be preferable to taking a legalistic 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the CWB need to establish a contingency fund?  What 
would this money be used for?  These are more questions which 
have been asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A contingency fund would be developed in order for the CWB to 
make adjustments to the initial payments during the crop year on 
its own authority, without the delays involved in getting 
government approval, to provide for potential losses in cash 
trading operations and to provide for an early pool cash-out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contingency fund would provide the CWB with the ability to 
adjust the initial payments and to get money into the farmers' 
hands more quickly. I am a farmer.  I know how important that 
last statement is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the history of adjusted initial payments the related risk 
would be minimal.  It would be less than the related benefits to 
farmers.  It would be up to the board of directors, with its 
two-thirds producer elected majority, to determine if, when and 
how the contingency fund should be created.  How it is set up 
will be the responsibility of the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can the Auditor General of Canada not examine the CWB's 
books? The CWB currently retains an independent firm of chartered 
accountants to audit its operations.  Through its pool accounts 
the CWB is managing farmers' money, not government 
appropriations.  Therefore it has always made sense that a 
private sector auditor, rather than the auditor general, audit 
the CWB's books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-4 the CWB would cease to be an agent of Her Majesty 
and a crown corporation.  It would become a mixed enterprise. 
This would reduce even further the justification for involving 
the office of the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, some of the private sector users of financial reports 
take comfort in the fact that private sector auditors, unlike the 
auditor general, are liable under the law for negligence and 
other professional misconduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed changes in Bill C-4 are balance and fair.  The 
government realizes that the changes contained in Bill C-4 cannot 
hope to satisfy all parties.  I think we have all heard that in 
the House today in what has been a polarized debate among 
representatives of the western grain producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, nonetheless, feels that the proposed changes to 
the CWB would equip farmers with the tools and the power to shape 
the CWB as they see fit so that it can meet the needs of the 
farmers of today and the farmers of the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I 
understand that the time should now be expiring as a result of 
the motion this morning. 
Because there was a further deferral transferring the vote to 
Monday, there is no need to have the 15 minute time period for 
the bell.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I think if you would seek unanimous consent to add 
back the 15 minutes to the time, or at least the time required 
for the opposition House leader to make his speech up to a 
maximum of the 15 minutes which should have been there to begin 
with, we would be favourably disposed to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this is going to be tough with the Liberals here trying to shake 
me loose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two issues here for those of us who do not know a lot 
about wheat farming, indeed who do not know much about farming at 
all in this country and there are many who do not.  The first 
issue is one of democracy and how democracy works in this country 
and the second issue is of law and order.  I want to speak 
briefly on both of those.  I do not think I will take up the 15 
minutes but one never knows.  Perhaps I will give the House 
leader of the government five minutes to sum up his side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of time allocation in a democracy is one which one 
could consider takes a lot away from our democracy today and it 
does.  Time allocation or closure is about the right of an 
individual to speak in the House of Commons.  It is about the 
rights of individuals to hear in the House of Commons not just 
from one party but from all parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This case, Bill C-4 referring to the wheat board, is an issue we 
think everybody, whether they are farmers, whether they live in 
the city or wherever they live in this country, should be able to 
hear about it.  It is an issue of the right to speak for others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have farmers in our caucus and probably there are farmers in 
all the caucuses here.  Some of my colleagues are wheat farmers. 
I think where they come from this is about the right to speak for 
the farmers in their areas who are concerned about Bill C-4 and 
about a monopoly of the wheat board.  This bill is really about 
the rights of farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is again calling for time allocation or closure 
on an important bill.  This has only been done twice I believe in 
this 36th Parliament, the other being on the Canada pension plan 
bill, another major issue in this country.  Minor bill after 
minor bill comes through this House and we seem to find the time 
to be able to debate those.  But when an important issue comes 
up, what the government does in effect is it restricts the right 
to speak out, it restricts the right of people to hear, it 
restricts the right to speak for others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And it has certainly restricted the rights of farmers across 
this nation. I guess I can understand why there are no elected 
Liberals on the prairies because that is the feeling a farmer 
would get: Where am I best represented?  The results of elections 
are obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members are now rating me.  At least I got a one and someone 
gave me a one and a half.  When you rate somebody in this country 
you have to have some standards upon which to rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are talking about standards and rating that is exactly 
what the farmers do. 
If we had the farmers rating who in this House best represented 
them, we would see a 10 on this side and perhaps one-half a point 
on that side.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the second issue in this House as a 
non-farmer, as an individual who depends on his colleagues for 
comments about the true effect of Bill C-4.  I want to talk about 
law and order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something dreadfully wrong in this country when we put 
our farmers in jail for trying to sell their product and at the 
same time I find myself fighting day and night to put bad guys, 
real criminals in jail and find very little success at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there are rules that are given to farmers for selling 
their product, but must the first option be to put a farmer in 
prison because he does not live by a rule, that he wants to sell 
his product, that he wants to be productive?  Must that be the 
Liberal way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to draw an analogy here.  For the Liberals who do not 
know what an analogy is, I am going to draw a comparison, 
something similar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my community a fellow by the name of Darren Ursel raped a 
young lady.  He went to court.  The judge said “Well, it is your 
first time and you said you were sorry.  Well, I guess you will 
not do it again.  You do feel remorseful.  And you were tender at 
times”.  He gave this fellow a conditional sentence, no time in 
jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really wonder what the wheat farmers across this country are 
thinking when they compare that to what happens when one of their 
own ends up in prison for trying to convince the government here 
that there is another way to sell wheat.  I just cannot imagine 
how a farmer ends up in prison and a rapist ends up walking the 
street.  For a person like me who is not a farmer, I look at it 
and I say there is something dreadfully wrong in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two Reform members who are not here today, who are out 
once again in court fighting for the rights of farmers.  I think 
it would be wise for members on the opposite side to get out 
there a little bit, get into these communities in the prairies. 
I know they will not get elected in the prairies, but it is not 
bad to show up once in a while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a good idea to go out there and listen to what 
happens in these court cases.  I am absolutely certain that 
members opposite would come back into this House and say the same 
as we are saying.  Listen to what is happening in this country. 
They are throwing farmers in prison while they are leaving 
rapists on the street. That says very little for a government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill continues a monopoly that has existed for some time. 
We will get outvoted in this House of Commons because there is a 
majority government.  It is a fact that the only time farmers 
will get a restriction of a monopoly, get to act the way they 
want to act, get to live the way they want to live, get justice 
the way they want justice is to wait until we upset the Liberal 
government in an election.

has been three days straight here that farmers, like the 
gentleman behind me, have been fighting day and night in debate 
to try to get things changed, while those on the opposite side 
insist that the letter of the law is more important than the 
right of a farmer.  That is wrong. It is very wrong. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
the opportunity to speak briefly to what is happening in this 
House because I am very concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned because during a time when our country is being 
torn at the seams and there are a lot of presumed regional 
differences, we have the threat of a large region of our country 
having its wishes and its aspirations ignored.  The Liberals have 
the power and we concede that.  They won the election.  They have 
the majority of the seats.  But it is unfortunate that they are 
misguided in their evaluation. They keep coming back to this 
statement that the farmers want what they are doing here. 
Unfortunately it is based on incorrect data. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason it is based on incorrect data is because of a prior 
strategy and a prior program that the minister and possibly the 
bureaucrats had.  Consequently when a question was asked of the 
farmers, the question was not such that the farmers could respond 
the way they wanted to.  It is a question of asking is there a 
will to solve the problem.  Instead, they gave the farmers but 
two choices:  Do you want the wheat board or do you not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of the farmers want the wheat board. That is what 
we are here representing. There is a majority, we believe, that 
want the wheat board. But there are also a large number of 
farmers who feel that the wheat board could do better for the 
farmers that choose to use the wheat board if there would be some 
competition. I do not believe that the monopoly of the wheat 
board is a necessity nor is their health threatened if some small 
number of farmers when opportunity presents itself choose to use 
a different form of marketing their own products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke on another part of this bill the other day.  I will 
repeat what I said then.  For example, a farmer raises his grain 
totally at his own expense and with his own investments.  He sees 
one place where he can get $5 a bushel for a grain that the wheat 
board is offering him $3 for, and the farmer can get the $5 
immediately instead of waiting for those final payments from the 
wheat board.  It seems to me eminently reasonable, and most 
prairie farmers agree with this, that the farmer on that 
occasion, having found a market for his product, should have the 
freedom in this country to market his product where he so 
chooses.  That would happen to be the one with the best price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have is a majority government in this House, most of the 
representatives of which come from areas where the Canadian Wheat 
Board Act does not apply. 
I am not saying they are not qualified to speak to this.  I know 
the other day there were some members of the Bloc who took 
exception because they thought hey, we are Canadians. Absolutely 
they can speak to it and yes, it is a Canadian question.

<A NAME="LINK239">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from December 5, 1997, consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-208, an act to amend the Access to Information 
Act, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise to comment on Bill C-208 which would amend the Access to 
Information Act to add an infraction to that act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically, the bill states that a person who with intent 
to deny a right of access under this act destroys or alters a 
record, or falsifies a record or makes a false entry in a record 
or does not keep required records is guilty of an indictable 
offence and may be imprisoned for up to five years or fined up to 
$10,000 or both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin my comments by stating clearly that I support the 
general goal of this bill and I commend the hon. member for 
Brampton West—Mississauga for having introduced it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some experience with respect to access to information.  I 
dealt with the act in my former capacity as mayor of the 
municipality, chairman of the hydro-electric commission for 
Kitchener—Wilmot and especially as chairman of the Waterloo 
regional police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act as it now stands makes an offence of obstructing the 
work of the information officer and commissioner and provides a 
penalty for that offence.  The act also authorizes the 
commissioner to disclose to the Attorney General of Canada 
information relating to the commission of an offence against any 
law of Canada by any officer or employee of a federal government 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain events that occurred during the Somalia and the blood 
inquiries have drawn public attention to the fact that the Access 
to Information Act contains no penalty for this sort of action. 
One can argue then that these events clearly illustrate and 
underscore the need for an infraction in the Access to 
Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a provision of general application in the Criminal 
Code.  Section 126 of the Criminal Code states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every one who, without lawful excuse, contravenes an act of 
Parliament by willfully doing anything that it forbids or by 
willfully omitting to do anything that is required to be done is, 
unless a punishment is expressly provided by law, guilty of an 
indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not 
exceeding two years. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could be argued that section 126 of the Criminal Code might 
apply to the situation of somebody deliberately destroying a 
document in order to thwart the access act, in so far as a 
destruction would result in the person willfully omitting to do 
anything that the act in this case requires to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to an interesting point which is also my main 
concern with respect to Bill C-208. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT83"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT83"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1735
<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 126 creates an indictable offence, which is the most 
serious type of offence in the Criminal Code. The section 126 
offence carries a maximum penalty of two years. I believe that 
the seriousness of an indictable offence in section 26 is one of 
the reasons it might be necessary to add a specific offence to 
the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this cases, the specific offence of deliberately destroying 
documents subject to the Access to Information Act should not be 
quite as serious as an indictable offence with a maximum of two 
years imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not what Bill C-208 proposes. Rather, it proposes to 
create a specific offence in the access act. But this specific 
offence not only would not carry a lesser maximum penalty than 
the one attached to the offence in section 126, it would in fact 
carry a heavier penalty, a maximum penalty of five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to outline that the Criminal Code provides 
offences in three types, summary convictions, indictable offences 
and hybrid offences that the crown can elect to prosecute either 
as an indictable offence or as a summary conviction offence. The 
summary conviction offence carries the lightest penalties and the 
indictable offences, of course, carry the heaviest. With hybrid 
offences the attached penalty depends on the procedure selected 
by the crown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important point is that when an accused is prosecuted by 
indictment he can choose to be tried before a judge and jury, 
which can be a very slow process. In addition, the accused is 
entitled to a preliminary inquiry when the offence is an 
indictable one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the hon. member wants to mark the seriousness of 
the offence by making it an indictable offence. However, it may 
also be counterproductive if it results in the crown not 
proceeding and prosecuting with that offence because in light of 
the particular circumstances of the case it is felt that it would 
not be worth the costs and efforts of the justice system, or when 
they view the penalty as disproportionate to the crime, taking 
into account the circumstances of the offence and the motives of 
the offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also wonder how much benefit and how much additional 
protection society would get from sending the offender in this 
case to jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look for a moment at the list of some of the Criminal 
Code offences that are hybrid, and for which the penalty would be 
lighter than a straight indictable offence when the crown 
proceeds by summary conviction: for example, criminal harassment, 
more commonly known as stalking, uttering threats, assault, 
assault causing bodily harm, unlawfully causing bodily harm, 
assaulting a police officer, and sexual assault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These offences are serious offences, but making them hybrid 
allows some discretion for adjusting the procedure and the 
penalty to the circumstances of the offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that destroying documents, while undoubtedly 
serious, is not more serious than assaulting a police officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think a comparative study of Criminal Code offences should be 
carried out in order to classify a specific offence of destroying 
documents in the access act and determine an appropriate maximum 
penalty in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I view the creation of a penalty for deliberately 
destroying documents to thwart the Access to Information Act is 
an important issue to be looked at in the context of an overall 
review of the access legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate that I support the goal of Bill C-208, which is to 
add to the access act the penalty for deliberately destroying 
documents that are subject to that act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has worked hard on this, but I am unable to 
support the proposal of Bill C-208, which is to create a penalty 
that would be a straight indictable offence with a maximum 
penalty of five years in jail.  This, in my view, is simply too 
heavy a penalty, and providing for such a serious offence might 
be counterproductive in relation to the objectives.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a privilege to participate in the debate on Bill 
C-208, an act to amend the Access and Information Act introduced 
by my hon. colleague from Brampton West—Mississauga. I want to 
commend her for her hard work in bringing this private member's 
bill forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Reform Party believe that government must be 
accountable to the Canadian people. For too long governments have 
been ignoring their constituents and, once elected, stop being 
accountable to the very same people who elected. 
The affairs of government are often done in complete secrecy.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Reform Party believe that Canadians have a stake in 
government affairs as duly representatives and must ensure that 
our actions are open to public scrutiny.  The Access to 
Information Act was introduced with just that intent, to ensure 
that information collected for public purposes, paid for by the 
taxpayers of Canada, remained accessible to them.  I will speak 
about that in a moment and give some specific examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that has not been the case.  There are numerous 
examples of the Liberal government taking it upon itself to 
decide unilaterally what is good for Canadians without talking to 
them.  It decides what the public should know and what it should 
not know.  The Somalia inquiry is one example.  We have talked 
about that for a long time.  The Krever inquiry is another 
example which was mentioned by my colleague from Alberta today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an example with which I am more familiar.  It is a 
recent example about which I have been questioning the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans over the last two weeks.  I have been 
pushing the government to release the foreign observer reports 
which the minister refuses to make public.  We want to know what 
he is hiding from the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These reports contain vital information pertaining to the 
fisheries crisis, yet the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is 
hiding behind the Access to Information Act, saying that he would 
be breaking the law if he were to release them.  That is what he 
said, that he would be breaking the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read into the record the section of the act 
which the minister is referring to, and he has done so in 
writing:  “Subject to this section, the head of the government 
institution shall refuse to disclose any record requested under 
this act that contains financial, commercial, scientific or 
technical information”, and that is what I believe he is 
referring to, “that is confidential information supplied to a 
government institution by a third party and is treated 
consistently in a confidential manner by a third party”.  That 
is what he is hiding behind.  Yes, it sounds pretty reasonable. I 
can decide what is good for the public and what should be allowed 
to be released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go on.  Subsection 6 states:  “The head of the 
government institution may disclose any record under 
this act”—and he has received lots of written requests—“or 
any part thereof that contains information described in 
paragraphs 1(b), (c) or (d)”, which is what I have just read, 
“if that disclosure is in the public interest”—and I do not 
think that is too hard to defend—“and it relates to public 
health, public safety or the protection of the environment”.  Lo 
and behold, the environment is being destroyed by the offshore 
trawlers.  It is well documented. Our resources are being 
depleted.  Yet this minister refuses to disclose the reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again commend the hon. member for bringing forward this 
private member's bill.  Information is vital to members of 
public.  They pay for it.  They have a right to it.  Yet we have 
a minister who wants to offer information in confidence.  He 
continues to say “I will give it to you in an in camera 
session”.  I want to emphasize that it is not me who wants this 
information, it is the public.  It not only wants it, it has a 
right to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to move forward to make sure the public is allowed to 
obtain this information.  Even his own colleague, the hon. member 
for Gander—Grand Falls, recognizes the vital importance of this 
information and was condemning this minister for withholding 
these documents from the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, the minister has offered an in camera session.  The 
Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans is now drafting a 
report.  We will be making recommendations to the government on 
the state of the east coast fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are about to table the report.  It is in its final stages. 
The information is overwhelming with respect to the offshore 
fishery.  I think that will be well noted.  That is why we are 
after this.  We are after this for the interests of Canadians and 
fishermen.  Nobody has a personal private agenda, which we have 
been accused of.  We are here to represent the people of Canada, 
whose tax dollars paid to train these observers.  They paid for 
them yet they are not allowed to see what is going on.  It is 
absolutely appalling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another example.  I have a constituent who, 
unfortunately, is the widow of one of our military personnel, 
Master Corporal Rick Wheller, who was killed during a military 
exercise in April 1992.  It was a very sad accident.  For over 
five years since his death his widow Christina has attempted to 
obtain truthful answers from DND regarding the circumstances and 
the safety regulations.  Again this has to do completely with 
access to information. 
She has made numerous requests and has been promised these 
reports.  The reports she has received had missing pages, blanked 
out information, and the list goes on and on.  I could go through 
the dates she has been there and the promises.  She was promised 
a report last December by senior officials of the department. 
They will not release it.  To date, she has not received this 
information.  It is an absolute disgrace.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This widow of one of our military people wants to know what 
happened to her husband.  It is five years later and the minister 
will not release the information.  She still does not have it. 
It is an absolute disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers want this information.  It is access to information. I 
commend the member for introducing legislation that, if anything, 
will go further in making sure these records are not destroyed 
and are protected.  We have seen incidents where they have been 
shredded or have gone missing.  It is very important that the 
public has access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are just a few examples.  Without all the facts we are not 
able to provide solutions to this crisis.  We are looking for 
solutions.  We are trying to stand up for the taxpayers.  We want 
a government that knows what is good for Canadians and their 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-208 proposes to amend the Access to Information Act.  It 
would provide sanctions against persons who destroy or falsify 
government records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just given two examples of this.  I have been fighting 
with the minister of fisheries to get a public document.  He 
wants to stand behind the very act we are talking about. 
Shamefully he will not give us the information.  I have spoken to 
many people and they all agree it is in the public interest and 
is destroying the environment.  Now we have an act that is giving 
the minister discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It states that the minister may.  I would like to amend it 
further to state the minister must.  Now we have an act that 
gives the minister of fisheries and any other minister discretion 
on what they would like to release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least this bill will ensure the information is not destroyed. 
I hope all my colleagues are listening.  This boils down to 
information the public pays for and is entitled to.  We should 
ensure that the safeguard of this information is fundamental.  We 
should stand up and fight for people who have a right to what 
they pay for.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased today to speak to Bill C-208, an act to amend the Access 
to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first like to point out that the entire matter of 
access to information is of special interest to me.  This is why I 
eagerly accepted the invitation of my Bloc Quebecois colleagues to 
speak to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 1 last year, I spoke in this House in favour of 
another bill, Bill C-216, which was also intended to amend the 
Access to Information Act by broadening its application to include 
crown corporations. 
At the time, I read a variety of documents on the application of 
the Access to Information Act and I noted, like a number of us 
today, that it requires certain amendments to ensure that it serves 
the intentions of its authors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to let the member for Brampton West—Mississauga 
know that the Bloc Quebecois supports the bill she introduced, 
since it improves the Access to Information Act by providing severe 
penalties for certain infractions.  The act we are dealing with 
today was passed in 1982, and it came into effect the following 
year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gives Quebeckers and Canadians the right to access 
information recorded in any form whatsoever, for the most part 
relating to government institutions with a few important exceptions 
I have already listed, Crown corporations in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like our fellow citizens, we as members of Parliament 
regularly make use of the Access to Information Act to obtain more 
information on how our institutions operate.  That act constitutes 
an invaluable tool in our work and provides numerous answers for 
our constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-208 represents an interesting advance, an improvement 
to the act, by penalizing severely anyone who attempts to destroy 
or falsify documents, or neglects to retain them.  The penalty for 
such offences would be a maximum imprisonment of five years and/or 
a maximum fine of $10,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will agree with me that these are worthwhile amendments, 
since they represent an unequivocal sanction of any person 
attempting to flaunt the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been much said that the Access to Information Act is a 
toothless piece of legislation that does not meet today's 
requirements.  None other than the present Privacy Commissioner, 
John Grace, is among the critics. 
The Privacy Commissioner has a variety of concerns, but where the 
object of this bill is concerned, he has spoken out strongly 
against the lax enforcement of the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After seven years of observation in his capacity as Privacy 
Commissioner, Mr. Grace has drawn some very worthwhile conclusions 
for the purposes of our examination.  In particular, he points out 
that it lacks effective enforcement mechanisms.  In his 1995-96 
annual report, he lists three serious incidents which serve as 
typical examples of someone's blocking the right of access to 
government documents by destroying or falsifying documents, or by 
camouflaging them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three departments were involved: Transport Canada, National 
Defence and Health Canada.  In each case, public servants falsified 
documents, or simply destroyed them. 
I do not want to be a prophet of doom, but I think the 
commissioner's discoveries are but the tip of the iceberg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His 1996-97 annual report on the tainted blood scandal sounded 
the alarm on a number of terrible cases.  The general remarks of 
the information commissioner on the act he applies are not, 
therefore, surprising.  Allow me to read you his remarks, which 
summarize our position on the question, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The access law has proved itself toothless to respond in 
any punitive way beyond exposing the wrongdoing. 
While exposure is far from being entirely ineffective, some 
penalty provisions in the access law are overdue. Nothing 
should focus the mind of any would-be record destroyer more 
than one conviction or one penalty levied upon a public 
official for such behaviour. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we support the amendments to the Access to Information 
Act in Bill C-208, I have to say they do not go far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his latest annual report, the information commission 
revealed that a number of offences were the responsibility of 
senior officials, who used their authority to have their 
subordinates destroy or falsify documents.  In all fairness, the 
distinction should be made between the person doing the act and the 
person making the decision, and this distinction is not provided 
for in Bill C-208. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, in addition to the destruction or falsification 
of a document, provision should be made for the fact that ordering 
destruction or falsification of a document or using the threat of 
reprisal against a person who refuses to obey such orders 
constitute offences.

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are other situations not covered in the bill to which we 
are giving our full attention today.  The maximum sentence of five 
years for an offence as provided for in the bill is consistent with 
the recommendations made by the information commissioner in his 
1996-97 annual report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By making it a criminal offence for anyone to commit such an 
act, we are adding a dissuasive force that should be enough to make 
a number of potential offenders think twice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the good points raised in Bill C-208, broader 
reflection is required if the necessary improvements are to be made 
to the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this end, we hope to have the opportunity eventually to 
discuss Bill-286, which suggests a broader reform, with particular 
attention to falsification and destruction of documents and to 
access to confidences of the Privy Council, which is also 
accountable to the people of Quebec and of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Access to Information Act is like a jewel without a box. 
As the information commissioner put it, legislation considered 
toothless is rapidly depleted of content, if not totally cast 
aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is high time that we, as parliamentarians, take action 
before it is too late.  Let us not wait for several more reports 
from the information commissioner before introducing the necessary 
amendments to the Access to Information Act. 
And the reason we must do this, even though all these amendments 
will have no real impact without a stronger institutional will, 
expressed at the highest echelons of the federal administration, is 
so that the act as implemented will embody its underlying ideals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore urge all parliamentarians to support Bill C-208.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to participate in the debate on Bill C-208, to amend 
the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by commending my colleague, the member for Brampton 
West—Mississauga.  She has done us all a great service in 
raising this issue and bringing the bill before the House.  By 
all I mean not only the people in the House of Commons but the 
people of Canada.  It gives us an opportunity to talk about the 
importance of access to information, access to information 
legislation and having a access to information commissioner.  The 
flip side is the protection of personal privacy and the regime 
that we put in place for making sure that we have openness and 
transparency in government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the Ontario legislature I was proud to be part of 
a government which in 1985, as its very first piece of 
legislation, brought forward the access to information and 
protection of personal privacy legislation.  It was a first for 
the province of Ontario.  From that experience I know that no 
piece of legislation is ever perfect.  The only thing that is 
ever carved in stone, unlike the wonderful ice and snow 
sculptures on our front lawn, are the gargoyles in this beautiful 
Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislation is living and it must be reviewed from time to time. 
My colleague has brought forward an important issue.  The people 
of Canada not only deserve and need to know what government is 
doing, but government needs to know that it has an obligation to 
give information.  Government is not only the elected officials. 
Government is those people who work in the bureaucracy and public 
service.  It has an obligation to ensure that the public is made 
to know and has access to that which is in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there have some problems.  Certain events during the 
Somalia and blood inquiry have drawn to the public attention the 
fact the Access to Information Act contains no penalty for the 
destruction of information. 
That is what this piece of legislation is about.  It proposes 
that an infraction be added to the existing act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My own personal commitment to freedom of information and access 
to information should be unquestioned.  On September 30 I raised 
the issue in a question to the President of the Treasury Board 
who has responsibility for access to information in the Government of 
Canada.  I raised a question because of a report that had been 
tabled by the access to information commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern was that in his report the access to information 
commissioner also identified problems.  One problem he identified 
was the lack of timely access.  It was taking too long to get the 
information after a request was made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that he identified was the concern that often it 
was the identity of the requester which determined whether or not 
the information was going to be given.  In other words, who was 
asking for the information was a part of the judgment in the 
decision as to whether or not the information could be released 
in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe these are problems.  I do not think it should matter 
who is asking for the information.  If it is possible to release 
the information and protect the personal privacy requirements of 
the legislation, the information should be made available 
regardless of who is asking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope we see an amendment to the access to information 
legislation as it exists today.  It might be possible to amend 
the bill to include the policy that already exists in the privy 
council office where the identity of the requester, the identity 
of the individual or the organization asking for the information, 
is protected.  It is not known in the minister's office or in the 
senior bureaucratic offices who is asking for the information 
when the decision is made about release of the information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very good policy.  I hope we see it either transformed 
into an actual part of the statute or a regulation that could 
accompany the statute. However I certainly believe it should be 
the policy of every government that it does not matter who is 
requesting the information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe that timeliness is very important.  Delayed 
information should not be used as a way of limiting the public's 
right to know those things.  It has a legitimate right to have 
that information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also very strong on the protection of individual and 
personal privacy.  It is a value that I hold dear and that I believe 
in.  In the information technology age it is a challenge to have 
access to the information we need to do the research we do at the 
same time as protecting an individual's right to privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe the right to privacy is absolute.  Nothing in 
this world or in the House is ever clearly black and white. I 
have said often I think we live in a world where there are shades 
of grey.  Sometimes there is a legitimate public policy reason 
why we should have the ability to determine available information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I had a call from a constituent who was very upset 
because she had filled out a customs form and as a result had 
been informed by the employment insurance office that she had 
collected employment insurance illegally.  She had left the 
country on holiday for a few weeks.  When she returned she was a 
good citizen and filled in the customs form.

<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I told her that the people of Canada believe people who are out 
of the country on holiday should not be eligible to collect 
employment insurance benefits.  That is a correct policy.  I also 
think it is appropriate for the department of revenue to share 
information about people who have left the country.  In the name 
of good practice and more than good practice but effective use of 
the resources of individuals, taxpayers want to know the laws are 
being obeyed and upheld.  I believe it was appropriate for that 
information to be shared between departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today is supportable in principle but I have 
a few problems with it.  As I said, no piece of legislation is 
ever perfect.  I would like to offer one of the problems I have 
with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the existing Criminal Code offences are defined by three 
categories.  There is a summary conviction offence which carries 
the lightest penalty.  Then there are indictable offences which 
carry the heaviest penalty and allow a person to elect trial by 
judge or jury. Then there is the hybrid offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this piece of legislation the member has chosen the 
indictable offence route.  Given the state of the courts in the 
provinces my concern is that with indictable offence we would see 
our courts further clogged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The access to information legislation is under review by the 
Treasury Board and by the Department of Justice. I hope they take 
into consideration as part of the review the issues I have raised 
and most particularly the issue raised by my colleague from 
Brampton West—Mississauga. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be an offence for the destruction of documents.  As 
a result of this debate and the support in principle I would 
have for the legislation I hope we see changes to make our Access 
to Information Act better so that the people of Canada and the 
public interest could be well served.  I compliment my colleague. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak to Bill C-216, an act to 
amend the Access to Information Act and specifically crown 
corporations.  I certainly commend my colleague from 
Nanaimo—Alberni who presented the bill to the House.  He has 
shown leadership.  I also commend to Theresa Stele who has done 
an enormous amount of work on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-216 is long overdue.  Repeatedly in the House the issue 
has come up.  In fact it has been debated ad nauseam.  But have 
we found any changes?  No, we have not.  Why?  Because this 
government and government before it have repeatedly demonstrated 
a lack of any political will and therefore integrity in their 
desire to make crown corporations more transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see today from the widespread acceptance we have in 
the House, the nature of the bill has found acceptance among 
members of Parliament across party lines and among members of the 
public.  The public wants value for money in part by making sure 
that the money it gives to government to spend on its behalf is 
going where it should be going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will help to do that by ensuring that one will be able 
to see behind the veil that surrounds crown corporations 
currently and ensure that access to information exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Access to Information Act applies to many other aspects of 
government.  It is a cornerstone of democracy.  It is as 
unfathomable to me as it is to other members of the House to know 
why access to information has not been applied to crown 
corporations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a litany of crown corporations, everything from Canada 
Post Corporation to the Canadian Development and Investment 
Corporation, the Canadian National Railway, the Export 
Development Corporation— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Colleen Beaumier:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I would like some clarification.  This debate is on Bill 
C-208 and I heard the hon. member mention Bill C-216. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could I have some clarification as it is not really germane to 
Bill C-208? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  We will continue the 
debate on Bill C-208. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Bill C-208 it is, Madam Speaker.  The 
nature of the subject matter has not changed.  Just the number of 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, the public demands a window into crown 
corporations.  Some of them are operating efficiently.  Some are 
not. The public has a right to know which are and which are not. 
Also the employees who work long and hard in these crown 
corporations have a right to know that they are working in an 
organization that can be as efficient as it can be.  They have a 
right to know that their organization can perhaps be operating 
more efficiently and to know where waste is occurring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we bring that about, the government must clearly understand 
that everybody will win.  The public will win.  The employees 
will win. The House will win.  We will be enabled to rectify 
problems before they get out of hand and improve the efficiency 
of these corporations.  It begs the larger question as to why 
some crown corporations are not privatized, but that we shall 
leave for another day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Access to information should also be occurring in a timely 
fashion.  According the rules of the House and the access to 
information in our system, the government and the institution in 
question have an obligation to answer within 30 days.  However, I 
would venture to say that if government members have the same 
frustration we have the 30 days do not occur. In fact repeated 
stonewalling takes place time and time again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will mention one particularly egregious situation within the 
ministry of aboriginal affairs.  Members from aboriginal 
communities come to us as members of Parliament, asking us to 
investigate situations on their reserves that at times are 
extremely serious.  We have an obligation and a desire to ensure 
that moneys are spent where they are supposed to and that moneys 
go to where they are intended, particularly in aboriginal 
communities where moneys are allocated for counsellors, teachers, 
health, medication and schools.  Anybody in the public would want 
to make sure moneys go where they are supposed to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When questions arise concerning moneys not going to where they 
are supposed to go, aboriginal grassroots people come to us if 
they are unable to get information from the leaderships in their 
communities.  We ask for information but the information is 
rarely forthcoming in a timely fashion and sometimes does not get 
to us at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who pays the price, I would venture to say, to protect some 
people?   Who pays the price for the failure to investigate these 
situations?  It is the grassroots people who we are trying to 
help, the people who are in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand for a moment why ministers would fail to 
answer a request for information made with the intent of trying 
to help the people most in need.  They should take it as a clue 
that there may be problems and want to investigate it with the 
most vigour they can.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of addressing these problems and investigating with the 
greatest amount of vigour, we see subterfuge, we see obfuscation, 
we see a lack of answers.  This process is an injustice to the 
people who need the answers.  It is an injustice to this House 
and the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only ask that this government for once demonstrate 
leadership that other governments have failed to do on this 
issue.  In doing so it will clearly demonstrate to the Canadian 
public a strong desire and commitment to improve crown 
corporations, to make them more efficient, to show an intense 
responsibility to the Canadian taxpayer and for the taxpayer's 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will win by adopting Bill C-208.  It will 
demonstrate to all members in this House a desire to finally 
listen to the backbenchers, to finally listen to the good ideas 
that come from members across this House and across party lines 
that this country can be a better place for all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in this important debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-208 is an act to amend the Access to Information Act. 
Incidentally, it makes no reference to crown corporations.  The 
intent of these amendments is to provide sanctions against anyone 
who improperly destroys or falsifies government records in an 
attempt to deny access to information under the Access to 
Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to congratulate the hon. member for Brampton 
West—Mississauga for her efforts in putting this bill forward. 
This caucus agrees with the sentiments expressed in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Access to Information Act was proclaimed 15 years ago.  In 
an earlier speech the hon. member for Brampton West—Mississauga 
said “in the 14 years since its inception, government 
bureaucracy has been sabotaging the intent of the act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I reviewed the files in preparation for my remarks today, I 
came across a yellowed document from 13 years ago.  It is a copy 
of a presentation made to a national forum on access to 
information by Ken Rubin from Ottawa.  He is extremely well known 
for his efforts regarding access to information.  An Order of 
Canada should be struck for him someday because he has played a 
very important role in the history of access to information. Mr. 
Rubin worked to get the Access to Information Act which he has 
used very well to ferret out information from government 
departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his remarks Mr. Rubin said “Users of access to information 
must suffer for this rare privilege by being put through all 
kinds of hurdles and rules that emphasize information hide and 
seek”. I have other clippings that document the frustration that 
our information commissioners have had in trying to pry public 
information out of unwilling government departments and agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These cases of departmental stonewalling and obstructions are 
one thing but recently the situation has become more serious.  It 
is by now completely obvious that certain government departments 
and agencies have both destroyed and falsified information 
covered by the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know that defence department officials have altered 
documents relating to the Somalia inquiry. We also know that 
health officials have destroyed records on the tainted blood 
tragedy.  This is clearly intolerable in our democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current information officer, Mr. John Grace, has called on 
the federal government to punish civil servants who intentionally 
destroy documents to avoid telling the truth to the public.  This 
is the intention of the bill as we understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear that I am not saying that many, most or 
all civil servants have been involved in any kind of document 
tampering or destruction.  I also understand that in the Somalia 
case this destruction of documents occurred because senior 
officials ordered it done.  But there certainly have been 
incidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must admit that information which is the property ultimately 
of the people of Canada, information that they have paid for and 
continue to pay for through their taxes, information that they 
have the right to see has been wantonly destroyed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we wish to make it clear that this practice 
should not be tolerated any further and that the hon. member's 
bill is an important step in that direction. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is certainly a pleasure to rise today on the act to 
amend the Access to Information Act, Bill C-208. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that this is one of the most important tools we have 
to work with as members of Parliament to help us access 
information which is not readily available in other 
circumstances, not only us, but corporations and individuals 
throughout the country.  It is the key to the confidence in our 
system and it also is the key to checks and balances which are so 
important in a Parliament like this one where government does 
have an awful lot of control over all information and can hold it 
back should it decide to. This gives us access to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of access to information, I tried to find out to whom 
the access to information officer reports and I could not get 
access to the information. It was kind of interesting.  I called 
several offices and I could not find out to whom he answers. 
Finally I did find out from the Library of Parliament and also a 
very helpful official in the access to information office that 
the access to information commissioner actually reports to the 
President of the Treasury Board and then through the Speaker to 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was really concerned about that because recently I tried to 
access information. I tried to use the services of the ethics 
commissioner. When I went to a meeting with the ethics 
commissioner, the first question I asked the commissioner was 
“What is your term of office and how are you hired?” He said 
“I am here at the pleasure of the Prime Minister”.  I think the 
results of his conclusions on the question that I asked put him 
in a conflict of interest because he only keeps his job at the 
pleasure of the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to learn that at least the access to information 
commissioner is actually hired by Parliament and voted on. So it 
is very helpful and gives me a great deal of confidence in the 
commissioner, as opposed to perhaps the little less confidence I 
have in the ethics commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyway, back to Bill C-208. It is the shortest bill I have ever 
seen. The point is very simple.  Up until now the access to 
information bill has had no punishment, it has had no sanction. 
It has had no way to punish people if they have destroyed, denied 
access or altered documents or anything.  There was no teeth. 
There was no enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-208 provides that deterrent, that enforcement tool. It 
makes denying information, destroying information or altering 
information a criminal offence with a maximum penalty of five 
years imprisonment or a $10,000 fine. That is a pretty serious 
deterrent compared to what is there now. There is no deterrent if 
an official destroys information or refuses access to someone. 
There is no sanction.  There is no punishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very timely.  We can be sure that if somebody, as they 
approach the shredder with the document that they should not be 
shredding, thinks of the five years and the $10,000 penalty, they 
will think twice about it. It is a very important tool. It does 
provide us in Parliament with the tools to make sure that the 
government is accountable, and it gives people confidence in 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A further amendment that we would like to see, although we are 
supporting this in the Conservative Party, is an amendment that 
gives at least limited access to documents of the Privy Council. 
I realize there are some documents that should not be available 
and we could not have total access to everything, but there are 
documents that we would really think are appropriate to have 
access to through the access to information office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, all things considered, the Progressive Conservative 
Party strongly supports Bill C-208.  We congratulate the drafters 
of this bill. We hope those same people will now move over to the 
code of ethics amendments and will draft amendments to ensure 
that the ethics commissioner also has to answer to Parliament 
instead of having his job at the pleasure of the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude my remarks by saying that the Conservative Party 
supports this bill entirely and we will be voting in favour of 
it.

concerns about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a bit of concern for what the hon. member for

when access to information documents are destroyed.  He is 
correct that there is certainly no argument that events, say 
Somalia or the blood inquiry, have drawn public attention to the 
fact that the Access to Information Act contains no penalty and 
that there is clearly a need for an infraction in the Access to 
Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I went one step further than the hon. member for 
Cumberland—Colchester.  I went to the Criminal Code to find out 
if anything could be done. I had a look at the Criminal Code, 
specifically section 126, and this is what it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone who, without lawful excuse, contravenes an Act of 
Parliament by wilfully doing anything that it forbids or by 
wilfully omitting to do anything that it requires to be done is, 
unless a punishment is expressly provided by law, guilty of an 
indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not 
exceeding two years. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, section 126 of the Criminal Code might apply to 
the situation of someone deliberately destroying a document in 
order to thwart the Access to Information Act, in so far as the 
destruction would result in the person “wilfully omitting to do 
anything that it requires to be done”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have a look for a moment at what my colleague from 
Brampton West—Mississauga is proposing in Bill C-208 which would 
amend the Access to Information Act to add an infraction to the 
act.  Specifically the bill states that a person who, with the 
intent to deny a right of access under this act, destroys or 
alters a record, or falsifies a record, or makes a false entry in 
a record, or does not keep required records is guilty of an 
indictable offence and may be imprisoned for up to five years or 
fined up to $10,000 or both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to my main concern with respect to my colleague's 
bill.  Section 126 creates an indictable offence, which is the 
most serious type of offence in the Criminal Code.  Section 126 
often carries a maximum penalty of two years.  The seriousness of 
an indictable offence in section 126 is one of the reasons it 
might be necessary to add a specific offence to the Access to 
Information Act.  In this case the specific offence of 
deliberately destroying documents subject to the Access to 
Information Act should not be quite as serious as an indictable 
offence with a maximum of two years imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what my colleague's bill proposes.  It proposes to 
create a specific offence in the Access to Information Act. This 
specific offence not only would not carry a lesser maximum 
penalty than the one attached to the offence in section 126 of 
which I spoke.  It would carry a heavier maximum penalty of five 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to outline that the Criminal Code slices 
offences up into three different categories.  There are summary 
convictions, indictable offences and hybrid offences that the 
crown can elect to prosecute either as an indictable offence or 
as a summary conviction offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Summary conviction offences carry the lightest penalties and 
indictable offences carry the heaviest.  With the hybrid offences 
the attached penalty depends on the procedure selected by the 
crown.  An important point is that when an accused is prosecuted 
by indictment, he or she can choose to be tried before a judge 
and jury, which can be a very slow process.  In addition, the 
accused is entitled to a preliminary inquiry when the offence is 
indictable.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the hon. member wants to mark the seriousness of 
the offence by making it an indictable offence, but I would have 
to ask my colleague if it might also be counterproductive if—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I really appreciate this opportunity in this extended 
question period to bring up a subject I brought up on December 
the 4 about responsibility, about accountability and about 
obligations, that is the federal government's obligation with 
respect to certain federal-provincial agreements to do with 
highways in Nova Scotia.  It has now extended to New Brunswick 
since I brought this up in December. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government and the provincial governments sign 
agreements.  When the provincial governments do not honour them, 
when I raise it in the House, the hon. minister replies all 
highways are a provincial issue, ask the province.  But the fact 
is this is not about highways.  This is about 
specific federal-provincial agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to this multimillion dollar agreement, it says a 
management committee shall be established as of the date of 
execution of this agreement and shall consist of two members, one 
member appointed by the federal minister, one member appointed by 
the provincial minister.  The management committee will be 
responsible for administration and management of this agreement. 
They will review and approve all projects.  They will change any 
projects on schedule B.  Annual reports will be approved. 
Approval of the proposed contracts and their modifications where 
they affect the financial commitment of the present agreement 
relating to any projects included in schedule B.  It says the 
decisions of the management committee shall be in writing and 
shall be acted on only if taken unanimously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the management committee is one member from the federal 
minister's department and one from the province, and all 
decisions must be unanimous.  That means the federal government 
in this case is responsible on these issues, and again this is a 
question about accountability, responsibility and obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I brought that up in December, the same thing has happened 
in New Brunswick, and it is exactly the same agreement with the 
same words.  The federal government must acknowledge and must 
realize its obligation to police this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, the federal government said it will put 50% of the 
money into a highway if the province puts 50% in, and it agreed 
to do that.  Now the province has taken its 50% out, which means 
that 100% of the money provided by government is from the federal 
government.  That changes all the ratios.  It changes everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently got a report from the Department of Transport, the 
federal department. It says $32,474,270 has been paid on a 
specific piece of highway between Moncton and Petitcodiac, New 
Brunswick. That was before the end of March last year.  This year 
they have projected to spend another $5.7 million.  That is 
$38,174,270, and it says right here the money was paid out to 
somebody to build that highway, but the provincial minister says 
there is no taxpayer money in it, the highway has never been paid 
for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial minister says the money did not go to pay for the 
highway.  He says the highway is not paid for.  The federal 
minister's report card says they paid $38 million to somebody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the terms of this agreement the federal minister is 
responsible to answer to where the $38 million has disappeared. 
There is $38 million disappeared.  The feds say it went to build 
the road.  The province says it did not go to build the road.  But 
this $38 million cheque went to somebody and we would like the 
federal minister to take up his obligation in accordance with 
this agreement which is very clear.  He is a member of the 
management committee.  There are only two on it.  All decisions 
must be unanimous and in writing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, if $38 million is going to go somewhere— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Order. The time has 
expired.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Transport.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is really unfortunate 
that the hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester does not 
recognize a dead end sign when he sees one.  In fact, he has not 
recognized this dead end sign and he smacked right into it a 
couple of times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister has stated to the hon. member on this very 
issue, under the Constitution of Canada the responsibility for 
provincial highways, including highway 104 in Nova Scotia, falls 
under provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transport Canada's only involvement in highway 104 is to match, 
as the hon. member has stated, dollar for dollar, $55 million 
with the province.  That, for the hon. member's information, is 
$27.5 million each. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The highway 104 western alignment project is one of a few 
projects funded through the Transport Canada-Nova Scotia 
strategic highway improvement program agreement signed in 1993. 
This agreement makes provisions for both the federal government 
and the province to each set aside about $70 million for a total 
of $140 million for highway improvements in Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to repeat for the hon. member, and it is important for 
the hon. member to recognize this, that this is where Transport 
Canada's involvement in the highway 104 project ends.  The 
province of Nova Scotia is the responsible authority for this 
project.  It is the province that decides on the alignment, the 
design, the construction standards, the tendering process and how 
to finance the construction costs of the provincial system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotia chose to use a public-private partnership concept, 
and good for it, as a means to construct and finance highway 104 
and agreed to allow the developer to charge tolls to the users of 
the new highway.  The federal government is neither a party to 
nor responsible for Nova Scotia's public-private agreement with 
the developer.  As I stated earlier, the government's only 
involvement—

<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, in October I asked the minister about the Liberals' 
failed Atlantic groundfish strategy or TAGS program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians had better hope the TAGS program is not typical of 
Liberal strategic brilliance because if our well-being were to 
rest on that kind of strategy, we would be in bad shape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The TAGS program failed miserably to provide a meaningful future 
for Atlantic fishers.  Now just released is the government's 
post-TAGS review report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Harrigan and his team have provided a comprehensive and 
forthright report.  It contains no praise for the government. 
The report clearly reinforces the scathing comments of Canada's 
auditor general on the terrible mismanagement of the TAGS 
program.  It also confirms what Canadians in Atlantic Canada have 
been trying to get through to this government for years.  After 
four years of so-called government assistance, and after spending 
nearly $2 billion, there remain the same problems today as four 
years ago, only now with a couple of new ones thrown in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there was supposed to be job training so that fishers 
could get into new areas of employment.  Very little, nearly not 
as much as was promised, was spent on this job training.  In 
fact, the job training that was done was not linked to any 
realistic employment opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there was supposed to be a license buyout to remove 
capacity from the industry.  Virtually none of that was 
accomplished.  Now we have thousands of people dependent on TAGS 
for income support.  We have income support that was promised 
suddenly being pulled so that people who had planned and had done 
their financial forecasts on this income are being left in the 
lurch by a government saying sorry, we know we promised that this 
program would stay on but now we are not going to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation where people on TAGS who want to leave the 
industry to find meaningful work cannot do that.  We are not 
giving any meaningful assistance.  The community development 
projects that were supposed to be funded lacked any kind of 
realism and failed to use the talents and expertise from the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a real issue of government ineptness and gross 
mismanagement not only in the past of the government fishery, but 
now a lack of vision for meaningful alternatives for those who 
were affected by the government's incompetence. 
Here we have both Liberal and past Tory governments politicizing 
all their decisions and resulting only in waste, inefficiency, 
personal hardship and loss of personal independence by reducing 
people to rely on government handouts when they would rather 
work.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After months to reflect on their failed policies and programs 
following the loss of the Atlantic fisheries critical resource 
base, I ask the government whether it has any idea what people's 
lives are going to look like after the TAGS program is over? 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
Atlantic groundfish strategy was designed to cope with an 
extraordinary situation, a crisis of major proportions.  It had 
to be implemented within very tight time frames at a time when 
the government was facing severe fiscal constraints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the circumstances, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development's first priority was to ensure that basic human needs 
were met, so we directed our efforts at ensuring that individuals 
who had lost their livelihood and source of income received 
income support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this score TAGS has been successful.  More than 40,000 
clients were able to count on Human Resources Development Canada 
to provide them with income support in a timely matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, it is very clear that TAGS was far from a 
perfect program.  With the benefit of hindsight, many things 
could have been done differently but TAGS has helped Atlantic 
fishery workers.  Some 14,800 TAGS clients have adjusted outside 
the groundfish fishery and found employment outside the industry. 
Over 16,000 TAGS clients received job counselling and over 10,000 
TAGS clients had the opportunity to improve their job skills 
through various types of training, including literacy and basic 
skills improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>TAGS is expected to end in August 1998 and the Minister of Human 
Resources Development has just received a post-TAGS review report 
prepared by Mr. Harrigan.  The objective of Mr. Harrigan's report 
was to get a sense of how the end of the TAGS program would 
impact on individuals, families and communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very good report that brings out a number of important 
factors.  For instance, it confirms that we cannot have a one 
size fits all solution.  The end of TAGS will have a great impact 
on some families but very little on others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, the report gives the government a useful basis for 
discussion.  We look forward to the discussion with the 
stakeholders in order to come up with a solution for the long 
term.

House is now deemed adopted. Accordingly, this House stands
