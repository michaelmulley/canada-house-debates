	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to present a petition on behalf of 61 people in 
Deloraine, Manitoba. The petition calls on the government to 
amend the Income Tax Act to provide a child care expense 
deduction that is available to all families, regardless of the 
income level of the parents, the amount of child care expenses 
incurred, or the form of child care chosen.
<P>
	As members will be aware, my private member's bill, C-247, 
did just that. It is too bad that the government chose to defeat it, 
largely because of special interest group agendas and the fact 
that stay at home parents do not provide tax revenues for 
government coffers.

House of Commons a petition containing 1,375 names.
<P>
	The petitioners humbly suggest that there is a need for more 
crime control in this country, not necessarily more gun control. 
The petitioners also ask for the removal of the firearm registry 
from Bill C-68. The petitioners also ask Parliament to 
concentrate its efforts on the criminal element of our society and 
not to erode gun owners' rights in Canada. The petitioners ask 
that common sense prevail.

Subdivision of the CNR, which is now, thanks to government 
order in council, no longer protected to the year 2000. Virtually 
every resident along that line has signed this petition.
<P>
	The petitioners are asking Parliament to support Canada's 
rural way of life by rejecting the policy proposals of lifting the 
prohibition order on branch lines and developing agricultural 
and rural development policies for Canada in which rural 
citizens are considered to be human beings with spiritual, social, 
and economic needs and not just economic commodities or

that come from my constituency on this issue.

<P>
Question No. 136-<B>Mr. McClelland:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With respect to the old age pension (<I>a</I>) how much money is paid in old age 
pension to citizens of Canada now residing outside the country and what are the 
top five countries to which payments are made; (<I>b</I>) what residency requirements 
are necessary as a pre-condition to collecting old age pension; and (<I>c</I>) is it 
necessary to have paid taxes in Canada in order to collect old age pension while 
living outside Canada?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> (a) During 1994 approximately $177 
million in old age security, OAS, benefits was paid outside 
Canada. It is not known how much of this was paid to citizens of 
Canada because an individual does not have to be a Canadian 
citizen to qualify for OAS.
<P>
	The five countries to which the highest overall OAS payments 
were made in 1994 are in descending order:
<P>
United States-$92.2 million<BR>
 Italy-$17.8 million<BR>
 United Kingdom-$13.6 million<BR>
 Greece-$5.3 million<BR>
 Portugal-$4.7 million
<P>
	(b) To receive an OAS pension an individual must be a 
Canadian citizen or legal resident of Canada on the day 
preceding approval of the OAS pension application; or if no 
longer living in Canada, must have been a Canadian citizen or 
legal resident of Canada on the day preceding the day he or she 
stopped living in Canada. In addition, an individual must have 
resided in Canada for a minimum of 10 years after age 18. To 
receive an OAS pension outside Canada, an individual must 
have lived in Canada for at least 20 years after age 18.
<P>
	The amount of the OAS pension paid either within Canada or 
abroad depends on how long an individual has lived in Canada 
after age 18. A full pension is payable with 40 or more years of 
residence in Canada after age 18. A partial pension is payable 
with less than 40 but at least 10 years of residence after age 18, 
accrued at the rate of one-fortieth of the full pension for each 
year of residence after age 18.
<P>
	Individuals with less than 40 years of residence can qualify 
for a full pension under a former set of rules that is being phased 
out over a 40-year period which began July 1, 1977. A full OAS 
pension can be paid if, on July 1, 1977, an individual was 25 
years of age or over, and lived in Canada on July 1, 1977; had 
lived in Canada before July 1, 1977 after reaching age 18; or 
possessed a valid immigration visa on July 1, 1977.
<P>
	In such cases, an individual must have lived in Canada for the 
10 years immediately preceding approval of the OAS 
application. Absences in this 10-year period may be offset if the 
individual lived in Canada after age 18 and before the 10-year 
period for periods that equal at least three times the length of the 
absence. In this case, however, the individual is required to live 
in Canada for a full year immediately preceding approval of the 
OAS application.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="11719"> 11719 </A></B>
<P>
	The Old Age Security Act permits the inclusion of the old age 
security program in reciprocal social security agreements. Such 
agreements enable people who live or who have lived in the 
other contracting country to add periods of residence abroad, or 
in some cases periods of contributions, to periods of residence in 
Canada to satisfy the minimum eligibility requirements for the 
OAS pension, and the income tested spouse's allowance. For 
example, someone who lived in Canada for less than the 10 years 
required to qualify for a partial OAS pension in Canada would 
be able to use periods of residence in the other country to meet 
the 10-year requirement. As well, a similar provision would 
apply to someone who lived in Canada for less than the 20 years 
required for payment of the OAS pension outside the country.
<P>
	Once eligibility for the OAS pension is established in this 
way, the actual pension paid is based only on actual periods of 
residence in Canada.
<P>
	The answer to (c) is no. Payment outside Canada depends only 
on whether an individual has resided in Canada for at least 20 
years after age 18 or is living in a country with which Canada has 
concluded an international social security agreement.

	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-43, in clause 2, be amended by deleting lines 8 to 20, on page 2.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is distinct pleasure to address the 
questions before us today on the Lobbyists Registration Act.
<P>
	One of the pledges of the Liberal government was to rebuild 
trust in government which has been eroded to a considerable 
extent over the last number of years under previous 
governments. I use the plural extending to more than two.
<P>
	The amendment is very specific. The government labelled the 
report on this bill ``rebuilding trust''. Therefore our party has 
tried to come up with amendments-this will be true for the one 
before us now and for the others we are proposing-that work 
toward that goal.
<P>
	In a way we are trying to help the government to achieve the 
goals it stated but for some reason has now become unwilling to 
follow through on.
<P>
	We are moving an amendment to increase the openness, the 
accountability and the disclosure required under the Lobbyists 
Registration Act so citizens can see more clearly what is 
happening. In a very general sense hopefully the more they 
know the more we will move toward a true democracy since it 
seems we have lost the sense of true representative democracy.
<P>
	MPs are elected and sent to the House to represent their 
constituents but sometimes are not allowed to vote according to 
the wishes of those they represent; the decisions being made in 
smaller rooms elsewhere and the results being orchestrated from 
here. Obviously if people want to have their input into how 
government works they will find out where the decisions are 
made and then proceed to use that particular approach.
<P>
	How did lobbyists gain such a large force? The people have 
discovered that it is a way they can get to the root of where the 
decisions are made in government. It is not through the members 
of Parliament. They have essentially lost their representative 
function.
<P>
	The way one influences government policy is by getting to the 
decision makers. The decision makers are the top bureaucrats, 
the deputy ministers, the ministers and the Prime Minister. 
Backbench MPs on the government side ultimately feel that 
pressure. I have spoken to some who have expressed some 
consternation about the fact that they are not free to express 
their views in the House because of the element of party 
discipline.
<P>
	The amendment we are moving would require more openness 
and disclosure. Therefore when people become aware of how 
government is being influenced, hopefully the more they know 
the more they will dislike it and we will then be able to achieve a 
shift toward true representative government via members of 
Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	I found the work in the committee on Bill C-43 for the most 
part very interesting. It was a good committee. Our chairman 
was very capable and very personable. Sometimes he tried to 
push things through too fast. We had a committee that worked 
together and pulled him back. For the most part things went very 
smoothly until we came the end. Suddenly there was a dramatic 
shift on the part of government members. They stopped 
listening to reason and suddenly it was orchestrated from the 
back rooms.
<P>
	When the motion simply says to delete some lines and 
introduce new ones, it is not really clear to the average person or 
even to some members exactly what this motion proposes.
<P>
	Presently the bill exempts from registration requirements any 
meetings initiated by public office holders. In other words, the 
Lobbyists Registration Act says if you lobby government, you 
are supposed to register. That is an acknowledgement that there 
is a lobby group, organization, a business, a firm or a 
corporation trying to influence government.
<P>
	We found out that quite often the government makes an 
initiative to talk to lobbyists because it wants to find out 
something about a particular business sector or it has some other 
reason. It initiates the call.
<P>
	If it is a straight transfer of information, information 
gathering and if all of our amendments are accepted, that would 
not be included in a registration requirement. Where the 
lobbyist is trying to influence the government, however the first 
contact is initiated it ought to be disclosed. Bill C-43 as 
proposed by the government does not include that.
<P>
	We are saying there should not be an exemption from 
registration if a department official or the minister or anyone 
else in government initiates the communications. In other 
words, if there is communication taking place, the purpose of it 
is ultimately in order to influence government, however it was 
implemented.
<P>
	We need to be careful because if we do not permit this 
amendment, we will provide a very easy loophole. If we are 
rebuilding trust, the last thing we want is to provide a number of 
escape routes from accountability. The present bill has that 
escape route because it says that if a government official 
initiates the meeting, then registration is not required. Therefore 
what happens in that meeting may be greatly directed toward 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11721"> 11721 </A></B>
<P>
influencing government. A government official has asked for it 
but immediately the lobbyist is influencing government.
<P>
	It would not be correct to provide a means whereby the person 
doing the lobbying is now exempted from registration just 
because he did not take the first motion.
<P>
	I will quote a local columnist: ``Any lobbyist who cannot 
finagle an invitation from a public office holder is not worth his 
retainer''. That is true. If a lobbyist wants to influence 
government but wants to do it in such a way that is not disclosed 
all he has to do is, in the words of this columnist, finagle an 
invitation.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	That is very easy to do if one has a good lobbyist network. 
That is what these guys are about. This is their business. 
Therefore members can see where the lobbyist would meet 
casually with the government official and say: ``Invite me down, 
I would like to talk to you about some things''. There is a delay 
of a couple of days. Then he gets an invitation and now he is not 
required to register.
<P>
	There is some question as to whether this would inhibit 
government officials from genuinely seeking information. I 
need to have the members, when they are considering supporting 
us in this amendment, to remember that we are also proposing 
another amendment that really is necessary to understand in 
order to approve this one. We want to also change the definition 
of lobbying. Lobbying is not well defined in the present act. We 
would like to change it so that the element of influencing or 
attempting to influence government is an integral part of 
definition of lobbyist.
<P>
	That way if there is a genuine request simply for information 
there would be no requirement at all to register in any case. That 
is not a lobbying function. That would be a very normal routine 
of talking to some sector of industry for absent association in 
order to find information.
<P>
	This new definition, if we say it must include influencing or 
attempting to influence, would totally look after that. Therefore 
in supporting the amendment we are proposing the government 
would do well. It would be fulfilling its own red book promise of 
increasing transparency, increasing accountability, increasing 
the openness with which government operates so hopefully the 
result could be achieved. We want to make sure all aspects of 
government operations whether procurement or influencing of 
government policy be done in the open so people know what is 
happening. Hopefully they can renew their trust in the officials, 
in the MPs and in the cabinet ministers elected by them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to reiterate what 
the member for Elk Island said, that it was a great experience 
working on this bill in committee. We on this side of the House 
found it satisfying as well.
<P>
	The member's motion will not be supported by the 
government because we believe the bill covers the very thing the 
member says it does not cover. If a lobbyist were to lobby for an 
issue with a public servant even though the initiation was made 
by a public office holder on a totally different issue, it does not 
take away from the responsibility of the lobbyist to report that 
piece of lobbying in the context of a government initiated 
meeting.
<P>
	There is a balancing act between transparency and making 
sure there is a good working relationship between the 
government and the private sector in the interests of developing 
good public policy.
<P>
	We did say that in the interpretation bulletin from the registrar 
that the area the member is concerned about is crafted precisely 
to make sure there would not be any kind of loophole.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	The essence of the bill states clearly that if a lobbyist within 
10 days of registering is arranging meetings or attempting to 
influence legislative proposals, bills, resolutions, regulations, 
policies, programs, award of grants, contributions, other 
financial benefits, or award of contracts, must be duly noted.
<P>
	Another thing the member talked about in his speech was the 
need to make sure all of this information was open and 
accessible. All of these registrations, all meetings and all of this 
information would be available through computer access via 
Internet. Therefore there is no need for this amendment. The bill 
has gone a long way in advancing the transparency of the 
relationship between lobbyists and the Government of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, like my two colleagues who spoke before me, I will 
make a brief comment on the work done by committee members 
who considered this bill. I sat on the committee myself and 
attended most of its meetings. I followed proceedings very 
closely and listened to many witnesses. I can tell you that I am a 
little disappointed in the very partisan work done by government 
members.
<P>
	The attendance record of the government members was not as 
good as that of the representatives of the Bloc Quebecois and the 
Reform Party, so that it was extremely difficult to agree and 
achieve one of the objectives, namely to reassert the value of the 
work done by ordinary members of Parliament through 
exchanges between government and opposition members.
<P>
	When people opposite us keep changing from one meeting to 
the next, it is very difficult to resume a discussion or complete 
the arguments introduced one or two days before the last 
meeting. Yes, there were good exchanges at the committee level. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11722"> 11722 </A></B>
<P>
There is, however, room for improvement with respect to the 
attendance record of government members and how they could 
follow up the work done in committee.
<P>
	With regard to the objective sought by Bill C-43, I think that 
no one in this House can be against it. True, taxpayers and 
constituents from across the country have lost some confidence 
in the government for several reasons. One only has to look to 
the past to find many reasons to lose one's confidence in the 
government. Bill C-43 is designed to ensure a certain level of 
openness, to show everyone what the power brokers in Ottawa 
are really doing behind the scenes.
<P>
	In any case, the objective of Bill C-43 was to make all 
lobbyists-or influence peddlers as some people call 
them-accountable, to make their work on Parliament Hill more 
transparent, to show the people that, in the end, the government 
was justified in doing business with a given individual, in 
changing the regulations, in drafting a bill or anything else.
<P>
	This goal is commendable and the opposition agrees with it. 
The reason we agreed to work with the government was to 
achieve greater transparency. However, the bill we are debating, 
Bill C-43, is very disappointing in that it did not achieve this 
goal. Today, I am doing the same thing I did at the committee 
stage, when I suggested a number of amendments to promote 
more openness and bring about the desired transparency. It is 
one thing to have a goal, but efforts must be made to achieve it.
<P>
	I suggested a number of approaches-twenty or so-at 
committee level, but this government, government members 
who, by the way, had not even heard the evidence, attended our 
meetings and heard witnesses request specific measures, 
rejected every one of the amendments proposed by the Bloc 
Quebecois. They voted them down. Today, the government is 
given another opportunity to improve this bill through a series 
of amendments. We have 33 motions before us and I think that 
some of them would greatly help improve transparency, as Bill 
C-43 seeks to do.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	I urge the government to give serious consideration to these 
motions, to review the goals it set in its famous red book during 
the election campaign and then to look at Bill C-43 in order to 
determine whether or not these goals were met. I am convinced 
that it will come to the conclusion that, indeed, they were not. 
Now, the opposition is offering to help the government achieve a 
goal it has set for itself during the last election campaign.
<P>
	I must say however that Motion No. 1 may not be going in the 
direction that I just mentioned. Let me explain. I agree with the 
government that Motion No. 1 should not be passed.
<P>
	We must set Motion No. 1 in context and see what changes it 
introduces. It amends clause 2 of the bill, that is to say section 2 
of the present act, under definitions. It also affects subsection 
4(2) of the act, under application, which specifies to whom the 
act applies and particularly to whom it does not apply, because I 
think arrangements have to be made so that citizens can contact 
the government. I think that honest citizens who are looking for 
information, want to express their views before our committees 
and act openly and publicly should not be restricted in their right 
to contact the government to make representations.
<P>
	In fact, two exceptions to subsection 4(2) are already 
contemplated. The first exception concerns those who make 
representations before a Senate, a House of Commons or a joint 
committee. Several pieces of legislation are reviewed in 
committee, and it only makes sense that those who submit briefs 
and come to tell the committee what they think of a bill should 
not have to register. That exception is already included.
<P>
	The second exception deals with the case of a taxpayer who 
phones a public servant to obtain an interpretation regarding 
existing legislation. Again, it goes without saying that the 
person should not have to register, nor state his reason for 
contacting the government, since it is normal to communicate 
with public servants to obtain details regarding legislation.
<P>
	This amendment to Bill C-43, which the Reform Party wants 
to eliminate through its motion, would affect all those contacted 
by the government. During the review conducted by the 
committee, I referred to these situations as ``government 
initiatives''. Before awarding a contract or considering a 
specific measure, the government, for a number of reasons, 
usually contacts some organizations to get their opinion. It 
approaches various groups and asks them: ``Do you have a 
problem with this legislation? Would you be in favour of 
improving it in this fashion? Would you be opposed to such a 
measure? What do you think?''
<P>
	If an exception is not provided regarding clause 4(2) of this 
bill, people will stop providing such answers to the government. 
The witnesses heard by the committee clearly said that, if they 
have to comply with the provisions of Bill C-43, they, as 
officials representing mostly non-profit community 
organizations, will definitely stop providing opinions to the 
government and help it make choices. These people added that 
they would certainly not pay to reply to a government's request.
<P>
	So, that amendment, which is just about the only one accepted 
by the government, should not be set aside right away. It should 
be reviewed, and I ask the Reform Party to really consider the 
purpose of this amendment, which is the only one which was 
accepted by the government following the review of this bill by 
the committee.
<P>
	The amendment is very simple.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11723"> 11723 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	The bottom line is that any oral or written submission made to 
a public office holder by an individual on behalf of any person or 
organization will be exempt if it is in direct reply to a written 
request from a public office holder for advice or comment in 
respect of the specified provisions. Other clauses are also 
quoted to specify who the clause will apply to.
<P>
	The wording of the clause now before us guarantees that the 
fears the Reform member just expressed will not be 
substantiated, that there will be no bending of the rules or 
attempts to get around the law, because everything will be done 
in writing. And I think that, under the Access to Information 
Act, we as taxpayers can obtain copies of this information. 
Therefore, we can check the public servant's request and the 
organization's reply because they will be in writing. This 
applies to a direct, written reply to a request.
<P>
	Bill C-43 and the amendment proposed this morning, which 
the Reform Party does not support, would not exempt the 
information in cases where, following analysis or research, it 
was discovered that the public servant asked the organization 
whether it would support such and such legislation and it is 
obvious from the organization's reply that it would only support 
the government's proposal in exchange for such and such a 
contract or an amendment to such and such other regulation. 
Therefore, the organization in question would have to meet the 
requirements of Bill C-43.
<P>
	Motion No. 1, as it is written, quite simply moves that the 
entire amendment or the content of clause 4(2) of Bill C-43 be 
removed, and I cannot support such a motion. This and all of the 
reasons stated above is why the Bloc Quebecois, the official 
opposition, will vote against Motion No. 1.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
confirm my support for the motion before the House that Bill 
C-43, in clause 2, be amended by deleting lines 8 to 20 on page 
2.
<P>
	We want to ensure that the Lobbyists Registration Act is open, 
transparent and that it works for the benefit of all Canadians. I 
mean all Canadians, not the few who feel that behind the scenes 
they can influence government policy and government decisions 
to their own particular benefit.
<P>
	No greater example exists than the Pearson airport situation. 
It has been deliberated on in the House on many occasions over 
the last year or more. It was a deal struck behind the scenes by a 
government that, in its waning days, knew it was headed for 
defeat. It decided it would get all its friends rolled up into one 
neat little package and provide a contract worth millions of 
dollars over many years. One of the prime assets of the country, 
Toronto's Pearson International Airport, would be given to a 
select few at a cost to all Canadians. That is the type  of thing 
which we want to ensure is eliminated once and for all.
<P>
	We have also read the book <I>On the Take</I>. It is a litany of 
situations where, from beginning to end, government and 
individuals, behind closed doors, manipulate things in their 
favour. The innocent Canadian is left with nothing other than the 
bill to pay, which is in the millions of dollars. That is the type of 
thing we want to see stopped by this motion.
<P>
	It is a two-way situation. When individuals are talking to 
people in government, be they cabinet ministers, backbenchers, 
or senior civil servants, it is a two-way street. Therefore, we 
must register when the public servants talk to these people, not 
just when the individuals talk to the government. If I phone and 
leave a message for a deputy minister, a cabinet minister or the 
director of a department and find out that he is out and he returns 
my call, that does not need to be registered. If he returns my call 
it does not need to be registered. Had I had talked to him when I 
called the first time, there would be a requirement for it to be 
registered. However, if one leaves a message to have the 
individual call back, the government person is now talking to the 
individual and it does not need to be registered. It makes no 
sense at all. It is a two-way street. This loophole is so big that a 
747 could fly through it. In fact every day many 747s could fly 
through the loophole.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	If the government were serious about representing Canadians, 
about being open and transparent about lobbyists, about 
ensuring that Canadians deserve better and about wanting to be 
perceived as a government that is honest, reliable and 
trustworthy, surely it would want to support the motion.
<P>
	I cannot think why the government would not want to support 
the motion, unless it has devious things in mind and once it is in 
place it can tell Canadians that it has tightened up the Lobbyist 
Registration Act, made it more difficult, and requires more 
registration. It has left out the situation where bureaucrats, 
cabinet ministers, backbenchers or whoever talk to the 
individuals. That type of exchange has been eliminated from the 
registration act. Basically the legislation means nothing because 
the loophole is so wide it has destroyed the whole meaning of 
lobbyist registration.
<P>
	That is the point we are trying to make to the government on 
behalf of Canadians. If the government wants the registration 
act to mean something, surely it would want to support the 
motion.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, I begin this section of my participation 
today by commenting briefly on the process we went through. 
When Bill C-43 was first introduced last June we were 
relatively new in the House. I did not understand the full impact 
of what it meant to go from first reading directly into committee. 
Consequently we had a very good open discussion, I guess 
because most of the members of the committee were first time 
members of the House. We actually operated like a group of 
co-operating individuals for the most part, especially at the 
beginning of the committee. We tried to come together on a 
number of issues.
<P>
	I was really quite disappointed to find that some of the things 
we tried to do were subsequently defeated or were not accepted 
as ideas worthy of being put forward.
<P>
	In this grouping I will talk specifically about some of the 
motions. It would have been nice if we could have spent a little 
more time on all of them, but I will not be able to cover them all 
in 10 minutes. It is important for us as the House to adopt this set 
of amendments. Obviously I believe that or I would not have 
brought mine forward. In this instance I am eagerly anticipating 
that we will come to an agreement to accept the amendments.
<P>
	I will begin talking about Motion No. 2 because it is a very 
important one. We need to clearly define who a lobbyist is. This 
amendment very clearly specifies what a lobbying activity is 
and how it is defined so that there is no question.
<P>
	The problem with Bill C-43 and indeed the old Lobbyists 
Registration Act is that they are not clear as to precisely who is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11726"> 11726 </A></B>
<P>
required to register. We have said a lobbyist is a person who is 
clearly a lobbyist and there should be no question.
<P>
	This is the definition:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Every individual who, for payment, pursuant to a contract or other 
arrangement or as an employee, undertakes or as a part of the duties of 
employment is required to undertake, on behalf of any person or organization (in 
this section referred to as the ``client''), or on behalf of the individual's employer 
or the employer's client-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1055 ) </B>
<P>
	We want to specifically add the activity:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) communicate with a public office holder or advise a client how to 
communicate with a public office holder.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That person would be defined as a lobbyist. This is a critical 
part of the bill.
<P>
	If we fail to bring in a clear definition of who has to register, it 
does not matter what the requirements for disclosure are. The 
presumed lobbyist can ask whether or not he or she is required to 
register. If the conclusion is that he or she is not required to 
register then he or she will not register. The result will be no 
disclosure at all, which defeats the whole purpose of the bill. 
That would be a pivotal point in this group.
<P>
	We also want to include advice on how to lobby. Sometimes in 
order to avoid disclosure we could have a lobbyist who simply 
trains someone else. He or she does not make the contacts but 
does everything else. He or she indicates by the connections 
with whom to get in contact and shows the tree to follow in terms 
of making the connections. In other words, basically he or she 
orchestrates all of the work of the lobbying effort without 
becoming personally involved. We would include that also in 
the definition as given here.
<P>
	In the current definition there is a real loose word. It states: 
``Anybody who spends a significant of time lobbying''. The 
word significant is really one that is open to interpretation. We 
could have some people who because of the nature of their jobs 
spend 50 per cent of their time lobbying. They could actually 
spend less time than other people who spend 10 per cent of their 
time lobbying. To leave significant in the definition leaves it 
open and there is no clarity. This has the added problem for those 
people who are involved in lobbying to know if they should 
lobby. Neither will the registrar know by the definition whether 
or not there is a breach of the law. We should fix that one up.
<P>
	Turning to Motion No. 7, this amendment is also very 
important because it provides for disclosure of connections. 
This is one area where Canadians have taken the greatest 
offence. After a person has worked particularly in the higher 
echelons of government, and indeed in the higher echelons of 
the House as a cabinet minister, retires from the activity and 
becomes a lobbyist, there is a network which occasionally is 
very suspicious in the minds of the people. It could happen that 
what the people are thinking is not accurate. I admit that. 
However, if we provide for disclosure and openness, at least we 
can honestly say that we are not trying to hide  anything: these 
are the facts and they stand for themselves.
<P>
	In this motion we are simply asking that anybody who in their 
past has had employment with or been elected to office in the 
Government of Canada, a province or a municipality, because 
those are important networks as well, be required to disclose it. 
We are asking that people register by stating that they have held 
a position with a political party as an employee or have held an 
office with a political party. Let us not hide it.
<P>
	Undoubtedly someone will say in debate that it is on the 
public record anyway. Yes, it is. Anybody who has been a 
cabinet minister is on the public record. However it should be 
clear and concise.
<P>
<B>(1100 ) </B>
<P>
	When a person looks up the registration of a particular 
lobbyist it takes little effort for the person to simply delineate it 
in the registration. People can then see there is nothing being 
hidden.
<P>
	We are asking that even those who have been heavily involved 
in contributing to political parties disclose that. If an individual 
donated more than $1,000 in aggregate to political parties 
during the preceding year, then the amount being donated to 
each party should be disclosed. Again, this is a matter of public 
record. During an election campaign major contributors are 
made public. The lists are available to anyone who asks. All we 
are saying is this should be readily accessible. It is very 
important for us to consider these different parts.
<P>
	Another element in this group has to do with the tiers. As we 
know there are different levels of lobbyists. There are those who 
are simply professional lobbyists and work in a professional and 
client relationship. They get paid. There should no longer be a 
distinction among the different tiers. In other words, anybody 
who is there to influence government should be able to and 
should be required to give disclosure. We would like to say that 
whoever does it, whatever their level, it should be open. It 
should not be anything that is withheld from the people of the 
country.
<P>
	Another element which I think annoys many Canadians and 
that we can fix in this bill is the disclosure by companies or 
groups that receive direct government funding. It is really an 
enigma that we are elected as members of the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	During the campaign I certainly emphasized, and members on 
the government side said the same thing, that we were proud to 
represent our constituents. In reading the maiden speeches in 
<I>Hansard</I> by the 200 members here for the first time in this 
Parliament, almost every one said: ``I am proud to have been 
elected by the people in my constituency to represent them 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11727"> 11727 </A></B>
<P>
here''. That is wonderful. That is the way democracy should 
work.
<P>
	It annoys Canadians when the very people they send to 
represent them are not able to do the job, but their tax dollars go 
to fund lobby groups to influence high government officials to 
change government policy. Something is backward. They 
should use the MPs because they are paying a lot of money to run 
our offices and to have those people in place. Let them do their 
jobs or reduce the House of Commons to 20 people. They do not 
need us if we are not going to do our work.
<P>
	If there are going to be lobbyists, why should the taxpayers be 
funding the MPs offices, salaries and pensions and at the same 
time funding the lobbyists? In our system it appears the 
lobbyists have a greater influence on government policy than do 
the members of Parliament.
<P>
	Therefore, we are proposing as stage one that when funding is 
received from government it is going to be made public. If any 
lobbyist individually or through representation by an 
association or corporation receives direct government funding, 
that should be disclosed. That is step one.
<P>
	Hopefully step two would be that when this was sufficiently 
known, the people of Canada would revolt, of course in a 
friendly manner, at election time. They will elect Reformers 
who will say it is the responsibility of the MPs and not the 
lobbyists to represent the constituents. Hopefully with this 
openness people will at least become aware and will be able to 
make a rational decision.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	I would have a lot to say about some of the other amendments 
as well since I have been working on this for a year. However, I 
realize my time is up and I will yield the floor now to other 
colleagues who will speak on some other matters.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member is certainly welcome to 
ask for unanimous consent if he wishes a few more minutes to 
continue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, may I then ask for unanimous consent 
to have a few more minutes?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> How much longer does the member 
require?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Five minutes.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I love this good sense of negotiating 
here.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Lobbying.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> This was clear negotiation. No lobbying was 
involved here.
<P>
	One of the things we need to do is to make sure that there is no 
means of hiding the lobbying process.
<P>
	Right now what we are doing with the intent of this bill-the 
Lobbyists Registration Act started it, this bill amends it and its 
intent is to strengthen it. It is recognizing the reality of lobbying 
in our present system.
<P>
	As I have said, if we are going to have it, we need to be totally 
open. We need to make sure that the people of the country 
understand this. What we want is for the rules for lobbyists to all 
be the same.
<P>
	Presently the bill does not require the disclosure of who is 
lobbied. Therefore I come to another very important point. One 
of the amendments in this group-and I do not remember the 
exact number, perhaps it is Motion No. 17-indicates what we 
want to include in the registration of the lobbying process. It is 
not only which government department is being lobbied. That is 
what is being called for now. We also want to have specific 
individuals.
<P>
	Again, how general is this going to become? We need to 
recognize that just because a person makes a phone call, that is 
not lobbying. A person who talks to someone to ask who is in 
charge of a department, is not lobbying.
<P>
	We must go back again to the definition which says if you are 
influencing or attempting to influence government and you are 
being paid for it, that is the definition of a lobbyist. If that is 
occurring, then the people of Canada should know not only who 
the lobbyist is on this side but also who the government official 
is on the other side.
<P>
	What is there to hide? Why should we hesitate for a moment to 
say who the deputy minister was in the meeting to present the 
information? Why should we hide that? There is absolutely no 
reason. Again, the more information we can get to the people, 
the greater their trust will be in the whole process.
<P>
	Another one is, how much money passes the hands? 
Obviously this is a matter of great importance. In talking to my 
constituents I have found that they are very concerned about the 
total costs to run an MP's office. For example, there has been a 
lot of interest in my constituency about the fact that the average 
MP gets an additional present value of around $2,500 a month in 
order to provide for his pension benefits. They are interested in 
those things.
<P>
	Our question is, how much is being paid to lobbyists? People 
should know this. If it is a small amount, probably there is no big 
deal but if we are dealing with millions of dollars, that should 
raise a flag. People should know that.
<P>
	I would like to quote someone: ``I think fees and major 
disbursements should be registered''. Later in the same session, 
the same person said: ``What is wrong with a system that would 
disclose fees and major disbursements? After all, if the whole 
business of having a registration system is to identify who is 
doing what to whom so that the competing interest has a right to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11728"> 11728 </A></B>
<P>
know,  how do we know who is doing what to whom unless there 
is a price tag, unless there is a caveat at the end? At what cost?''
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	I am quoting the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell who, when he sat on this side of 
the House, said that we need to disclose these things. We need to 
make sure that the people know not only who is doing what but at 
what price. This is a very important aspect of the bill.
<P>
	I would also like to read another quote: ``One of the reasons I 
believe we must reform the act to declare lobbyists' fees is 
because at times''-and then he interrupted himself and said: 
``Just take the referendum. Millions of dollars were put through 
the system by lobbying firms advocating a particular point of 
view and very little of that was known''. That too was spoken by 
a member of the Liberal Party, the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood.
<P>
	Obviously, I am speaking of things that members on that side 
of the House agreed with when they were on this side. So let us 
stay with our principles and let us support these amendments.
<P>
	I appreciate the additional time, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to intervene in this debate. It gives me 
the opportunity, not having been a member of the committee or 
the subcommittee charged with the matters before the House 
today, to look back on earlier professional work in another 
capacity.
<P>
	Clearly this has been an excellent committee and a really 
outstanding subcommittee. This is a thoughtful, well-reasoned 
report. It reflects great credit on members from all parties who 
did the necessary research which led up to the conclusions. It 
says a great deal for the capacity of Parliament to evolve as a 
living institution and about the sort of new responsibilities that 
committees are being encouraged to take on. My compliments to 
the committee, to the subcommittee, its chair and its members 
for the work they have done.
<P>
	I believe the debate to date has been helpful, constructive and 
useful. Members of the opposition will pardon me if I make 
some suggestions on the preliminary definitional question.
<P>
	The life of the law, as Mr. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes 
reminded us, has not been logic, it has been experience. It is an 
error and perhaps the labours of Sisyphus, an eternal task that 
never reaches a conclusion, to attempt an a priori definition of 
lobbying.
<P>
	I think it is best, as the bill provides, to try to reach an 
operational definition, a definition in logical extensity, and to 
say what types of activities are to be subject to disclosure or 
registration, rather than to attempt an abstract definition in 
advance. It will be, in the end, up to the courts-the courts in the 
regular sense, the judicial sense, and the court in the original 
constitutional sense,  the high court of Parliament-to decide 
what is permissible and impermissible lobbying activity. Again, 
the effort to define in an abstract way is perhaps better 
redirected to spelling out in more detail the sort of activities one 
wants to cover.
<P>
	When I was first a student of constitutional law, lobbying was 
viewed as evil per se, a reprehensible, nefarious activity. The 
attitudes changed, however, with increasing sophistication as to 
what the legislative processes are about and what parliamentary 
decisions in contemporary democratic societies amount to. That 
is to say that one is balancing competing social interests.
<P>
	To do that job effectively one must identify those competing 
social interests. One must attempt some sort of quantification of 
the social value of those interests and that requires a detailed 
empirical record. One must then attempt to establish some sort 
of hierarchy of importance of the interests before leading to an 
intelligent, rational decision. The philosopher would tell you 
this is William James' conception of pragmatism, the pragmatic 
conception of truth. In constitutional law terms it is simply 
Roscoe Pound's sociological jurisprudence, the balancing of 
interests which is at the core of any rational judicial decision 
making today but not less of decisions within Parliament itself.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	The United States pioneered legislation on lobbying many 
years ago. Its emphasis is on disclosure: the bringing out into the 
open of particular interest groups involved in any piece of 
legislation and trying to assess what the interest groups 
represent. Are the interests they represent substantial as distinct 
from merely vocal? Does the vocality or the degree of force with 
which they are expressed balance their representativeness in 
social terms and their claim to validity in the economic or other 
terms in which they are being debated? Therefore the emphasis 
on disclosure is the key element.
<P>
	Every member of Parliament who does his or her job is subject 
to lobbying by various interest groups in the constituency or in 
the general region. Nothing is wrong with that. It really depends 
on the degree of control of the office and the degree of energy 
the member brings to putting the interest groups in proper 
perspective.
<P>
	When companies or trade unions wish to meet with me I 
welcome them. If it is a company I want to read the balance 
sheet, the annual report. I want to meet with the officers. If it is 
important enough I want to visit the plant. I want to see potential 
competitors. All of us do this. We recognize the value involved 
and the good faith and integrity with which people approach 
this.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11729"> 11729 </A></B>
<P>
	The only thing objectionable is covert lobbying, the covert 
exercise of pressure. I do not think for most of us this is what is 
involved.
<P>
	Reference was made to the Pearson airport issue. I would have 
thought that was less an example of lobbying than an example of 
the public contracting process and how not to operate it. Very 
clearly one thing is that in the lame duck period of any 
government, as the concept has emerged in the United States, 
public contracting of a high level of community involvement 
should be avoided at all costs or exercised with extreme 
discretion.
<P>
	I do not think it is an example of lobbying gone wrong. It is 
rather an example of the need to exercise extra control over 
public contracting when a government effectively has lost its 
mandate.
<P>
	Putting it in proper perspective, the bill recognizes the reality 
that interest groups will bring forward their particular cause to 
parliamentarians; two, that they are entitled to do so; and three, 
provided they bring forward proper information, properly 
researched, and that members themselves exercise the necessary 
care of reading those reports, trying to make assessments, 
seeking further information from other independent sources 
before making any decision, it is a valid and necessary part of 
the gathering of information in aid of legislation.
<P>
	Intelligent legislation demands that interest groups bring 
forward their claims and their causes. In that sense the 
committee has met the challenge and brought forward a 
thoughtful law that takes us a good deal along the way to 
solution of any problems that in the public domain might have 
been thought to exist.
<P>
	As I have said, I have no problem with professional interest 
groups, with companies, with trade unions, with other groups 
that come to me. I have more problems with umbrella 
organizations that claim to represent whole segments of society. 
These are the hardest ones to catch in the scope of legislation 
such as this because their operation in the political processes 
comes not through this reasoned process of bringing 
information in aid of legislation but more in terms of social 
context. Maybe there is room for covering this. I do not see how 
we could do it in the present law without destroying the very 
careful work, the very precise set of ground rules the legislation 
has established.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> What is the member proposing?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> I am proposing that we adopt the law as it 
stands. It is a good law. Let us see how it works. We can always 
try one year later to do something more.
<P>
	However, do not attempt to make a law that has a precise role 
and mission into an omnibus bill to cover just about everything 
else. Stick with the integrity of the law. Rest with the fact that in 
definitional terms of describing and identifying categories of 
conduct that must be registered this does represent an advance. 
The  search for the a priori definition, cute as it may seem in the 
privacy of a member's own office, is not realistic in terms of the 
dialectical and empirical process that will operate as courts, 
parliamentarians and parliamentary committees react to this.
<P>
	Again, I congratulate the committee on an excellent piece of 
work, the subcommittee in particular. It is a good law. In terms 
of comparative legislation it is an advance compared with 
similar legislation in other parts of the world.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, faced with a block of 22 motions like the one before the 
House today, I find it rather difficult to comment on every single 
one. What we have is two or three substantial motions, around 
which other motions have been grouped to provide more 
transparency, plus additional elements to achieve what 
Parliament has set out to do with Bill C-43.
<P>
	To appreciate these amendments, including Motion No. 2, I 
think some background information might be useful to see what 
led Parliament to make this statement on influence peddling and 
lobbying. The Parliament of Canada has examined this question 
twice before. We had the Cooper committee's report in 1986 and 
recently, in 1993, we had the report from the Holtmann 
committee.
<P>
	These committees looked into exactly the same aspects of 
lobbying as the present committee did today, in 1995. It is 
interesting to note that the Holtmann report published a series of 
recommendations, the first few being the most significant. 
These recommendations said, more or less, that for legislation 
like the bill before the House today to be truly effective, it would 
be necessary to remove all distinctions between lobbyists.
<P>
	As you know, in the existing legislation, there are three types 
of lobbyists: the so-called Tier I and Tier II and a third group. 
There are in-house lobbyists, professional lobbyists and the 
others, organizations that lobby the government. The Holtmann 
committee concluded that lobbying was lobbying.
<P>
	Whether people want to influence the government to obtain a 
contract, lower the rates in certain regulations, get a permit or 
obtain government assistance for their organization, this is all 
lobbying. People try to influence the government for their own 
purposes, for the benefit of the company for which they work or 
for the benefit of an association or whatever. In its first three or 
four recommendations, the Holtmann report said that 
distinctions between lobbyists should be eliminated.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	I am sure you will remember this, Mr. Speaker. If I am not 
mistaken, the Liberals were to implement the Holtmann report 
from A to Z-this was a campaign promise made by the 
Liberals, by people acting in good faith, people who knew what 
they were doing in the enthusiasm of the moment-which means 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11730"> 11730 </A></B>
<P>
that indirectly,  and without exactly saying so, they made a 
commitment to eliminate all distinctions between lobbyists.
<P>
	In committee, however, when I started to realize that 
Canadians had been fooled once again, I was very disappointed. 
I heard members who had been part of the committee that 
produced the Holtmann report say the exact opposite of what 
they signed when they tabled the report, with respect to these 
distinctions, for instance. There are a lot of other examples, 
particularly with regard to categories, which was the important 
element of the Holtmann report. It was not just anyone who was 
opposed. It was the people, who, today, hold fairly important 
positions in the government and who could influence it and talk 
it into meeting its campaign commitments.
<P>
	But no. Throughout the whole time we heard witnesses in 
committee, some witnesses were in favour of eliminating 
categories, others were less so. The closer we got to the category 
of lobbyists capable of influencing government, in the back 
rooms of power, the greater the likelihood of their not really 
favouring the elimination of categories.
<P>
	On the whole, however, the witnesses were in favour of 
greater transparency. We were sort of the guinea pigs in a new 
approach to examining bills and we were given a little more 
freedom. We were part of a pilot project, in a way, considering 
this bill under a new set of rules. We therefore did not adopt the 
principle of the bill at second reading, and, accordingly, we were 
able to broaden Bill C-43 from what the witnesses said and from 
the input of each of the parties. Members' work had to be given 
greater consideration, etc. It was all very fine.
<P>
	Therefore, through a procedural swap and an exchange 
between members of the opposition and members of the 
government, we negotiated and we discussed, and I was ready to 
make a concession on the categories, so there would be only two 
instead of three. My first thought was to have a single category. 
However, it is better to bend a bit to achieve part of the desired 
objective than to risk missing it completely. So, I was ready to 
bend and to recommend to the members of the Bloc Quebecois 
that they support an amendment that would reduce the three 
categories to two. There would then be the category of in-house 
lobbyists (corporate) and professionals and the category of 
in-house lobbyists (organizations). All lobbyists would then be 
in two categories.
<P>
	Before Christmas, this was accepted by just about everyone 
around the table. After Christmas, well, I do not know who had 
been making telephone calls, or what lobby had exerted 
influence or what, but everything was off. The amendments 
proposed to the committee were rejected by the government. 
Today, with Motion No. 2, the government could rectify the 
situation. Motion No. 2 now before us this morning is a carbon 
copy, or just about, of what I presented in committee in order to 
eliminate categories of lobbyists and have only one.
<P>
	I do not imagine that anyone here has anything against 
lobbying per se. It does not matter whether organizations are 
non-profit or profit making, if they lobby in an attempt to 
influence the government, they have to abide by the rules.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	To get approval for a single tier of lobbyists for all 
organizations, including community agencies, that is the 
purpose of clause 4(2) of Bill C-43, which I discussed earlier 
with respect to government initiative, which would eliminate 
people who might not agree to being recognized as lobbyists on 
the same terms as professional lobbyists. However, the 
government accepted the first amendment but did not accept 
what would have been consequential on the amendment, which 
was to have a single tier of lobbyists.
<P>
	I have a few examples that will show why it is important-and 
when I say lobby, I mean lobby-to make C-43 a bill that has 
clout, that has teeth, as they say. There were organizations like 
MATRAC, for instance. I do not know if you remember this, Mr. 
Speaker, but when cigarette smuggling was going on in January 
and February 1994, there was an organization called MATRAC, 
a non-profit organization that sought to have taxes lowered. I 
have no objection to that. We in the official opposition were in 
favour of reducing these taxes. However, MATRAC initially 
gave the impression of being a non-profit organization. In other 
words, it worked for the benefit of its members and did not enjoy 
any immediate benefit.
<P>
	It could be called a non-profit organization, which would 
come under the third heading in the bill before the House today. 
However, if we look a little closer at MATRAC, we realize that it 
was 100 per cent financed by the cigarette manufacturers in 
order to get taxes down. This is a clear instance of trying to 
influence the government on an important matter, tax revenues. 
Why have a separate tier for such a group? I am of the opinion 
that the act should deal with that by allowing a single tier of 
lobbyists. But no. I believe we must conclude that lobbyists on 
Parliament Hill have manged to influence the government with 
respect to a bill that was supposed to limit their influence. That 
is the obvious conclusion.
<P>
	They made certain commitments with respect to the tier 
system before the election. Now they are in government, they 
can implement what they promised to do, but they are not doing 
it. In addition, that would explain why we could create just one 
category to make the process more transparent and to give 
everybody in this country the impression that they are all being 
treated equally. But no, the government did not do this. The 
lobbyists got involved, phone calls were made, and the Liberals 
buckled. They buckled like the Conservatives did and like others 
before them have done since Confederation. And they will keep 
on buckling until they are doubled over. I cannot wait to see the 
day that happens in the House. I mean I will no longer be in the  
House when that day comes, but will watch the spectacle from 
the outside.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11731"> 11731 </A></B>
<P>
	One motion in this set of motions is extremely important, and 
that is Motion No. 7 regarding political affiliation. This is 
another amendment I proposed to the committee, and it would 
make it easier for taxpayers to identify which lobbyists are 
politically affiliated with the government or with any other 
party. For example, I helped organize party X's election victory. 
I would have to mention in my return that I contributed to the 
election campaign and that I was the political organizer of Mr. X 
or Ms. Y. I think that is what transparency is all about. What 
does the government have against making the process more 
transparent? I do not know. But if they were not against the idea, 
they would have included it in Bill C-43 and they did not.
<P>
	I will conclude my remarks, for I see that my time is up. This 
is yet another good example of this government's double talk: 
one tune before the election, another after. Once again, 
taxpayers will have to foot the bill for this, and they still will not 
know why Bill C-43 was introduced, which was to make the 
process more transparent in order to obtain answers to our 
questions.
<P>
	This has some implications for the Pearson issue. With Bill 
C-43, we will still be in the dark and will not know any more 
than what the newspapers have already disclosed regarding the 
matter. And that is deplorable.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a privilege for me to speak on Bill C-43 and to 
support my colleagues in the House.
<P>
	Rebuild trust in government, is that not a familiar term? In 
Manitoba last month I heard these words repeated because it is 
having a provincial election today. Mr. Mulroney in 1983 when 
he defeated the Liberal government of the day said we have to do 
away with corruption, rebuild trust in government, lobbyists are 
overdoing it, ripping us off.
<P>
	The hon. member for St. Albert mentioned a 747 flying 
through a loop. The ``Fifth Estate'' about a month ago showed 
how two lobbyists flew 34 airbuses through the loops the 
Conservatives had put out. A couple of lobbyists have received 
$20 million. They can be identified by their accounts in Swiss 
banks. When I heard that I assumed we were to have a 
government that would crack down on stuff like this and we 
would be debating it in the House the next day. I have heard 
nothing about it.
<P>
	Why do we want to pass the bill if we never want to do 
something about it by cleaning up the corruption? In Manitoba 
over the last month I heard about the terrible mess the 
Conservatives made of the health care system. They paid $4 
million to an American lobbyist to tell them how to fix their 
health care system and they do not have one.
<P>
	Why are we debating this bill? Why do we not have some 
action? We have had rules and regulations before. One very 
good example took place about a year ago in the subcommittee 
on transport. Every member, Liberal, Bloc and Reform, said to 
stop the backtracking. The backtracking issue over the last two 
years has cost us $60 million. We had total support from the 
committee to stop it. Who was lobbying the agriculture minister 
and the transport minister to continue with this? I talked with the 
railways and they said there was no way they had lobbied for it 
because they would be shipping grain regardless.
<P>
	I talked to the wheat board people. They said they did not 
export grain and that it was the registered grain companies that 
did that. I talked to the grain companies and they told me it was 
the wheat board that insisted they do it.
<P>
	I looked at the facts and found that we do not sell grain 
delivered to a foreign country. It is Appleby, Thunder Bay or 
Appleby, Vancouver. This backtracking has cost us $60 million. 
Are the American lobbyists lobbying our government to give 
them money to backtrack the grain so they can have it a little 
cheaper? This concerns me.
<P>
	We are passing bills. We are passing rules and regulations but 
nobody seems to want to enforce them. What good are we in 
Parliament when we all agree on doing something and then have 
lobbyists change the system? Now the WGTA will correct it. 
However, we have allowed it to go on for two years and we knew 
about it.
<P>
	I am beginning to wonder whether we should all stay at home 
and leave these lobbyists instead of sitting in Parliament day 
after day trying to pass regulations. I am sure we have laws on 
the books that would prosecute these people for ripping off the 
taxpayers, the only lobbyists we should be listening to.
<P>
	On the last day in the House on the gun legislation, what 
happened to the three members who finally listened to the 
lobbyists in their constituencies and had the guts to stand up in 
the House and vote no? They have been muzzled, shut up. When 
that hit Manitoba there was a backlash which I believe blew the 
election for the Liberals. Why would we elect people who are 
not even allowed to get up in the House to speak their minds and 
represent their constituents?
<P>
	They are some of the best backbenchers the Liberals have. I 
have worked with them.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	It is very sad when we have to witness this day after day and 
our country is deeper and deeper in debt.
<P>
	People who have the guts to get up and say something are not 
allowed to say it. It is time we realize that when there are 
amendments made that will be beneficial to taking corruption 
out of the system we should support  them, not because they are 
made by the Reform Party or the Bloc, but because they are good 
for the country.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, no one on this side of the House 
fears recrimination for standing up and speaking out on issues.
<P>
	Members have heard the Prime Minister say on many 
occasions that quite often we have a much better debate within 
our own party than we have in the House because sometimes the 
opposition does not get to the complexity and the depths of 
issues. The member who spoke previously really distorted this 
bill.
<P>
	I was one of the most outspoken members in opposition on 
amending the Lobbyist Registration Act. There were three very 
specific areas we amended in this bill. I will talk about where I 
feel I did not get everything I wanted.
<P>
	We have in the bill now things that make it much better. We 
now have in the loop all grassroots lobbying. That is important 
but was not a deal breaker for me. Another thing that really 
concerned me in opposition was communications techniques 
used by lobbyists. We knew lobbyists used polling and 
advertising. They sometimes spent millions of dollars in 
advertising and no one knew how the mood of the nation or the 
House was being affected.
<P>
	This bill was amended to include a declaration of all those 
communication techniques so those in the House who have to 
deal with a lobby coming at them not just from a lobbyist but 
also from the way a market can be manipulated now know the 
techniques being used.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> What about if you used the lobbyists for 
input. What if the government wants the input from the 
lobbyists?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> I will come back to 
that. Let me state the three things in the bill which the member 
did not mention when he said this bill did not have any teeth.
<P>
	Another thing in this bill has to do with contingency fees. The 
example the member used about the air bus situation, obviously 
it was not an hourly fee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Twenty million dollars, no matter what it is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> That was obviously a 
contingency fee and in this bill there is a provision to look at 
contingency fees.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Do something about it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member keeps saying do something about it. We are saying that 
it is in the bill. He has to read the bill and he will see it is there.
<P>
	I was a little disappointed with one area. I have been 
campaigning for six years on comprehensive tax reform. Five 
years later there is one little mention in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>. It is 
not easy to get things through the House and we do not always 
get everything we want.
<P>
	There were some substantial amendments to this bill that I 
think go a long way in creating transparency. I felt 
uncomfortable about the declaration of fees. We did not get that 
one through, but it does not take away from this being a good 
bill.
<P>
	I want to deal with Motion No. 7, which I am opposed to. It is a 
Reform amendment: ``Past political or government work and 
political contributions over $1,000 shall be disclosed''.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	I am totally opposed to the Reform amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> That does not 
surprise us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Let me tell you why I 
am opposed to this. What we need to do, and you are eventually 
going to discover this-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member has been here since 
1988. For the 400th time, I imagine, would he please put his 
remarks to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
humble apologies. In fact, I have been in this town since 1980 so 
I should know better.
<P>
	I am opposed to this motion because I believe that as members 
of Parliament our greatest challenge is trying to attract people to 
participate in the political process. I believe that our 
responsibility is to attract-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Your greatest challenge is trying to attract 
constituents.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, how 
tough. We all know how tough it is to get businessmen and 
women to knock on doors and get involved in the political 
process. It is not-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Ce n'est pas cela.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> I can tell you right 
now, Mr. Speaker, that probably not more than 40 or 50 members 
in the House can claim that they have more than 100 or 200 
businessmen and women knocking on doors and doing polls or 
getting involved in their campaigns. They might come along and 
go to a fundraiser but they will not actually go out to do the real 
slogging.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11733"> 11733 </A></B>
<P>
	A motion like this only discourages people from getting 
involved in the political process. One of the reasons it 
discourages people from getting involved is because we have a 
situation, regrettably, where because of the concentration of 
power-and most of the real concentration of power tends to be 
with the Conservative Party-quite often large corporations do 
not encourage their employees to get involved in the political 
process.
<P>
	We all know what happened during the 1988 election when 
large corporations not only took out full page ads saying: ``Vote 
for the free trade agreement'', they also wrote letters to their 
employees saying: ``Campaign for the free trade agreement''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> I thought you were going to change that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> We made some pretty 
good changes to the free trade agreement. Do not forget that.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> It was the wrong bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Do not ask me to get 
involved in the changes that were made vis-à-vis the 
environment or labour standards. The point is that we did make 
some amendments.
<P>
	The Reform Party amendment calls for past political or 
government work or political contributions over $1,000 to be 
disclosed. That works against getting people involved in the 
democratic process, not to mention the fact that it creates all 
kinds of paperwork. Absolutely nothing is hidden because the 
extent to which lobbyists have to register right now is 1,000 
miles of improvement in comparison to the previous bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak in support of the reasoned, intelligent proposals 
and amendments being put forward by my hon. colleague from 
Elk Island.
<P>
	Let us take a look at some of the situations being proposed by 
these amendments. First, we are talking about adding the names 
of everyone that the lobbyists attempt to influence to the list of 
the disclosure requirements. Quite simply, if a lobbyist is paid 
handsomely to achieve a desired goal, to win a contract, or 
whatever the case may be, we want to know whether that person 
has access to the minister, to the deputy minister or whether he is 
talking to the individual directors. We want to know to whom he 
is talking. Unfortunately the vast majority of Canadians do not 
have that kind of access to people at the decision making level.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	I cannot understand why the government is opposed to this 
type of motion. It seems perfectly clear to me and to the Reform 
caucus that we want to know who is being lobbied by these high 
priced lobbyists. They have unlimited expense accounts. They 
can wine, they can dine and they can go on trips. They have 
money to acquire  information. That is what a lobbyist does. All 
Canadians want to know how the money is being spent to try to 
win influence from a particular person.
<P>
	I spoke earlier about the book <I>On the Take</I>. I would hope that 
nobody else is on the take from that point forward but we can 
never be sure. One story after another in that book is of people 
on the take, from riding presidents, to political hacks, to past 
employees, to friends, to the Mafia, you name it. They were all 
in it and they were all running around Parliament Hill rubbing 
shoulders, buying favours and currying attention that they were 
getting on many occasions.
<P>
	When Canadians read that book and realize what has been 
going on they are shocked to the core that these types of things 
can go on in a democratic system such as Canada's. We are 
proud of our system. The system has to be opened up so we can 
see what is going on, so we can ensure that when these backroom 
deals, which benefit nobody except one or two people, are 
ferreted out, these people are held to account. It has to be 
prevented from happening again.
<P>
	If we are going to hold our heads high in government, one 
thing that we want to be able to ensure is that all Canadians have 
faith in the system. That is what we are trying to do with these 
motions.
<P>
	How about the motion to which the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood is so adamantly opposed? We are 
asking that lobbyists be required to report previous government 
or political employment, executive positions with a political 
party and if they have made a political contribution over $1,000.
<P>
	That does not seem to be an onerous requirement, yet he is 
totally and adamantly opposed. He says it will discourage 
people from getting involved in the political process. That is 
exactly what we want to say. When people are no longer sitting 
in the House, the day after they are defeated, we do not want 
them involved in the political process.
<P>
	After they have been defeated or have retired from politics we 
do not want to see them back on Parliament Hill talking to their 
friends and other people they know, saying: ``I am now getting 
paid a large amount of money by some corporation to win 
influence from my friends with whom I used to work''.
<P>
	I cannot understand why the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood would be so adamantly opposed to 
such a situation. He has been around since 1980. He just said that 
a few minutes ago. That is 15 years he has been in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> No, no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> He has been around here for 15 years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Has he been a member for 15 years?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11734"> 11734 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> I apologize. He has been a member of the 
House since 1988. No doubt he knows a large number of people 
because that is the way Parliament Hill works.
<P>
	We want to know that the day he is defeated or retired from the 
House is not the day we find him back on Parliament Hill 
collecting an even bigger salary, working behind the scenes and 
currying influence from his friends. That is what we are trying to 
say. We want to discourage people from getting involved in the 
political process when they are no longer participating in the 
House.
<P>
	A riding president, a member of the party executive have 
access to cabinet ministers, to the Prime Minister. If they do 
their jobs properly they win elections for cabinet ministers and 
the Prime Minister and for all the members of Parliament. They 
are volunteers. They work hard. We know the people in our 
constituency. No doubt that applies to every member in the 
House. Therefore constituency presidents and constituency 
executives have the inside track in contacting the people in 
power and we want to know if they are doing it.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	Then of course there are those people who have money in their 
jeans and may feel that by giving a donation to a political party 
that brings their name to the attention of the member. No doubt 
the member is grateful for the contribution and some people may 
feel they can buy influence that way. All we are asking is that 
these things be brought out into the open.
<P>
	Yet the Liberal government in its red book said it wanted to 
have an open and transparent policy on lobbyists. Now that the 
Liberals are on that side of the House they have changed their 
tune. We heard a quote earlier today by the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell who in 1991 said: ``What's 
wrong with a system that would disclose fees and major 
reimbursements?'' Now as the whip for the government side is 
he supporting our motion? No.
<P>
	The Liberals have this double speak system. When on they 
were on this side of the House they said this is patently unfair. 
They held their hands up in horror and said that it had to be 
changed. Now when they are on the other side of House only 
mild, ineffectual, little changes are all that they propose.
<P>
	We ask that the remuneration paid to lobbyists be part of the 
list of disclosure requirements. That is not a big thing. We have 
found out that there are millions of dollars changing hands to 
buy influence in this country. We would like to think that is the 
type of stuff that only goes on in other countries that have a 
much lower parliamentary tradition than we have. I do not want 
to make disparaging remarks about other countries so I will not 
name them. We know there are countries where bribery, money 
changing hands and currying influence is the order of the day 
and we want to ensure that in Canada that does not apply.
<P>
	We want all Canadians to know that the system ensures that 
does not work. We ask that this bill require these contingency 
fees, if they are not a salary, which can be very large, be 
disclosed.
<P>
	Again I go back to the Pearson International Airport fiasco 
where hundreds of millions of dollars are potentially being 
made or lost. Unfortunately it is the taxpayers who are going to 
lose and it is a small group of businessmen, including some 
Liberal people, who are going to win. All we want to know is 
who is getting paid what in this deal. It is not much to ask on 
behalf of the Canadian taxpayer who ends up paying, paying, 
paying and gets nothing, nothing, nothing.
<P>
	We want to ensure openness, transparency, fairness. We want 
to ensure that the individual taxpayer who is paying the bill gets 
a fair shake. It is not much to ask but obviously beyond the 
capacity of this government to provide.
<P>
	What else are we proposing? We are asking that anyone who 
receives funding from the government or a government agency 
discloses the fact, including the amount of that funding. Is the 
group itself doing the lobbying or has it hired a professional 
lobbyist? This is where we are paying government money to be 
lobbied to pay more government money. It has got to be the 
biggest insult of all to the taxpayer. The Liberal member from 
Wentworth has investigated some of these organizations and 
finds that by and large these groups exist to get more money out 
of government to pay their salaries so that they can come back 
and get more money out of government to pay their salaries. We 
are asking that this be made open.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	I think this type of motion, which suggests we want to know 
whether government is paying people to try to get more money 
from it, should be out in the open. I cannot think of any real 
reason the government would be paying under that scenario. If it 
is happening, we want to know about it. As I understand, 
according to the member for Hamilton-Wentworth it is already 
happening.
<P>
	The taxpayers are not aware of it. I am sure they would be 
lining up to get that kind of job, which would become 
self-serving and a continuing situation. They could go to the 
government and ask to be paid another $100,000 a year because 
they claim to represent <I>x</I> number of people. After receiving the 
money they could come back and ask what about next year, the 
year after, and the year after that. We are trying to stop that. We 
want to get it out in the open. These are the situations we are 
talking about.
<P>
	I could go on and on. Let this government know they made a 
commitment through the red book. We expect they would live up 
to that.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Fundy-Royal, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I had the 
great honour to report back to Parliament an amended Bill C-43. 
I think it represented a most historic moment in Canadian 
parliamentary democracy. I believe it has improved 
parliamentary democracy. The process we adopted in this 
particular bill improved democracy greatly.
<P>
	Bill C-43, an act to amend the Lobbyists Registration Act, 
was tabled by the Minister of Industry on June 14, 1994. As 
members know, it was immediately referred to our 
subcommittee, before second reading. That is before agreement 
in the House on the principles of the bill. I believe it was one of 
the first bills in Canadian history that has taken advantage of 
this new parliamentary procedure.
<P>
	These new procedures have allowed a committee of 
backbench members of Parliament, including opposition 
members, to take a government sponsored bill and amend it to 
its liking with basically no restrictions on how far members of 
Parliament could change the tabled legislation. All the members 
of Parliament really tested the new procedure.
<P>
	As chairman of the committee, I am very proud of the report 
we used and the powers we were given. Some of my colleagues 
feel they want more power. They wanted a greater opportunity to 
make changes. We listened very carefully. We worked as a team. 
I believe we produced a very good report.
<P>
	I was very impressed by the wide-ranging and open 
discussions of the various views expressed by all members of 
Parliament. We had over 75 witnesses who testified before our 
committee last fall and into the winter. We had some very lively 
debates. We had more than 50 individuals and organizations who 
also submitted briefs before our committee. At the end of the 
day, I believe a majority of the committee enthusiastically 
subscribed to some of the important amendments brought 
forward by some of our colleagues in the opposition ranks.
<P>
	I also believe that some of the opposition members came to 
accept some important improvements proposed by the 
government side. That is precisely what democracy is about and 
that is precisely what the new procedures were intended to 
achieve.
<P>
	In summary, I believe the experience was very valuable. I 
encourage the government to continue to use this new 
committee procedure as often as possible. I believe it can only 
result in better legislation. By giving members of Parliament a 
more proactive role in drafting legislation, it can only further 
the people's confidence in our democratic institutions. I think 
that fostering people's faith in their government is very much 
what this process is all about. But as the report was entitled, it is 
rebuilding trust in our institutions. It presumes that over the 
course of the last eight or ten years some cynicism has crept into 
the system by virtue of activities of certain members of 
Parliament over the course of the last Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	I see the members of our committee here today, and I am very 
impressed that all members are very committed to making those 
changes. We listened very carefully to members of both the 
official opposition and the third party when they put suggestions 
forward.
<P>
	Let me summarize some of the key elements. In fact there 
were 13 specific amendments that I believe the government has 
accepted for this bill. Bill C-43 as it was originally tabled had 
improved certain amendments on the lobbyists registration. I 
believe that our committee made some additional 
improvements. We significantly enhanced the transparency, 
which is so crucial in breaking the cynicism that has been 
associated with the lobby industry. We have significantly 
strengthened the powers of the ethics counsellor. All lobbyists, 
for example, are going to have to indicate if they intend to use 
grassroots lobbying in their attempt to influence the 
government. This was not in Bill C-43 as it was originally 
proposed.
<P>
	Consultant lobbyists will have to indicate if they are paid on a 
contingency fee basis. This is over and above the ban on 
contingency fees for lobbying on government contracts. Any 
organization that lobbies the government will have to reveal any 
amount they receive from any government. That is an important 
change.
<P>
	The ethics counsellor, as part as of an investigation, will have 
the power to disclose information on fees and disbursements 
associated with any lobbying activity, not only on government 
contracts. I am particularly proud of this amendment because I 
think it gives a significantly enhanced new power to the 
important role of our ethics counsellor.
<P>
	The ethics counsellor will not only have to report on the 
results of his investigations of a breach of the lobbyists code of 
conduct, but he will have to include the investigative findings, 
conclusions and reasons for the conclusions. That came out of 
the spirit of one of our colleagues from the opposition ranks.
<P>
	Finally, the ethics counsellor will have to make a separate 
report once a year, which will be submitted to Parliament, on his 
activities with respect to lobbying.
<P>
	Our committee has also amended Bill C-43 significantly as 
far as the lobbyists code of conduct-

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, I think that the hon. 
member for Berthier-Montcalm is right. We must focus on the 
amendments. I know that there are a lot but I think that, in the 
common interest, all hon. members should restrict their 
comments to the amendments before us. As the hon. member 
said, we will have an opportunity to go over all the issues at third 
reading.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have to remind my colleagues from 
the third party and the official opposition that I believe my 
comments do direct the larger issue. The larger issue is that at 
committee our colleagues in the Bloc and in the Reform had an 
opportunity to propose their amendments during that process.
<P>
	On balance, I have listened very carefully to the suggestions 
that have been made by my colleagues, and, with the greatest of 
respect, I believe our new process has worked very well. Also, 
while I understand the suggestions and amendments our 
colleagues proposed, I believe we listened very carefully and 
made some significant amendments, in fact 13 in total.
<P>
	I would respectfully suggest that we decline supporting those 
Reform and Bloc suggestions for the reasons I outlined earlier.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. There have 
been some consultations with all of the parties, and I think you 
may find unanimous consent for the following two motions. 
First, Motion No. 9 be amended, so that it would now read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That clause 3 of Bill C-43 be amended by adding immediately after line 44 
on page 3 the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(e.1) where, to the knowledge of the individual, the client is funded in 
whole or in part by a government, the name of the government or government 
agency, as the case may be, and the amount of funding received by the client 
from that government or government agency;''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	By way of explanation, this just adds the phrase ``to the 
knowledge of the individual''. That is the first motion to amend.
<P>
	The second amendment has to to with Motion No. 16. It is an 
amendment to the wording in the French. I regret that I am 
totally inept in the French language. Therefore, I would like to 
table that and perhaps prevail upon you, Mr. Speaker, to do the 
reading for me. I think it would do greater service to the 
language.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe the hon. member 
said that you would find unanimous consent. The Bloc 
Quebecois is not giving its consent to the two proposed 
amendments to motions, which deal more or less with the same 
matter. We are not giving our consent.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> As we do not have unanimous consent, 
there is no point in reading the motion in French or in English.

No. 9, but I thought that it had been voted on at the same time as

	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-43 be amended by adding after line 2, on page 13, the following 
new clause:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``4.1. Section 8 is replaced by the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``8. The governor in council may designate any person as the registrar for the 
purposes of this act''''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure once again to rise to 
address the issues before us in Bill C-43 and this particular 
amendment.
<P>
	I will respond briefly to the speech made by the chairman of 
our committee moments ago. We appreciated his leadership in 
the committee. It looked at first as if it were a good process. I 
now have some reservations about going to committee after first 
reading because in the end party discipline came to rule and we 
were unable to finish the way we had started.
<P>
	So that all members have a clear understanding of the purpose 
of the amendment, it says the governor in council may designate 
any person as the registrar for the purposes of this act.
<P>
	I want to make it very clear that what we are aiming at here is 
to have more accountability and less of the backroom politics 
which have plagued our parliamentary system. This distresses 
many voters and taxpayers. There are lobbyists who have in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11738"> 11738 </A></B>
<P>
some cases better access to the government decision making 
loop than the access enjoyed by members of Parliament. We 
need to take strong action in this matter.
<P>
	Bill C-43, the act to amend the Lobbyists Registration Act, 
now with this amendment basically designates two individuals 
responsible for the administration of the act. One is the ethics 
counsellor. That discussion does not fit under this amendment so 
I will simply say he or she is one of the very important elements 
in the administration which has to do primarily with the ethics 
end of it. The other is the registrar. The registrar will be 
enforcing the compliance of the act with respect to registration 
and disclosure.
<P>
	Once again, our goal is for the Canadian people to say they 
believe now those lobbying activities are transparent. They will 
be able to find out about them. They will be able to find out who 
is lobbying who, what they are being paid, what the conditions 
are, what their connections are.
<P>
	There will be a good check and balance against the kind of 
corruption which can so easily enter the open government 
system. What is happening today is a public debate. People can 
hear it; not only members of Parliament but any member of the 
public who wants to hear what is happening in the House has the 
ability to do so. They can watch it on television, they can read 
Hansard or they can read media reports.
<P>
	However, when it comes to lobbying, that is not public. 
Therefore we require a mechanism whereby lobbying is made 
open so that the taxpayers know what is happening just like they 
have the right to know what is happening here. In order to 
achieve that we need a system whereby the accountability of the 
registration system is also trustworthy. That is what we are 
addressing in this amendment. We are saying the appointment of 
the registrar should go far beyond being a civil service 
appointment. I am in no way casting any dispersions on any 
office holder here past or present when I say this.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	There may be perfect honesty and trustworthiness in that 
position but people are suspicious if they do not have real input 
into the appointment. Many of these public service positions are 
filled without even proper information being given to the 
Canadian people. I know that information is available but it is 
not publicized.
<P>
	We are dealing, as the title of the report says, with rebuilding 
trust. This amendment will provide that this be a governor in 
council appointment rather than a civil service appointment. It 
means there will be proper notice. It means there will be an 
actual public debate about the individual, his credentials and his 
trustworthiness.
<P>
	The process of giving the governor in council appointment to 
an individual also gives more credibility to the individual. In 
other words, it gives him a little more clout. He will be able to 
with good authority investigate where there seems to be a 
violation of the act. He will be more than just a person who has a 
job to fill. He will have a public role because a governor in 
council appointee will have to report and account for the way 
things are done.
<P>
	I cannot talk about the process extensively in this debate. 
However, I am disappointed in one thing, getting back to the 
process. We were given the impression that in committee at first 
reading there would be no problem with bringing forward 
amendments at second reading and at report stage which is 
where we are at now. We would have liked to bring in greater 
strength and authenticity to the position of the registrar. Because 
of this process, and this is one of the things now causing me to 
have second thoughts about its viability, we are prevented from 
going as fully in this direction as we would like.
<P>
	We would have liked to had the registrar make a public report 
and have the appointment in public and also that there would be 
a way for the registrar to really go after people who deliberately 
try to circumvent the system of registration.
<P>
	I am not sure the bill as it now stands will provide enough 
accountability and enough authority in the hands of the registrar 
to do that. I really hope it will happen. The way the bill is being 
written and without this amendment which strengthens that 
position somewhat I think we are leaving it to a great extent to 
chance which is not sufficient for the process we are looking at 
here.
<P>
	The whole registration system as administered by the 
registrar must be open. I am very pleased to see that in our 
committee the recommendation is that there will be electronic 
access to the information so that as individuals want to find out 
who is lobbying who, that information which is registered will 
have a wider accessibility. That is a very positive part of the bill 
and one which I am sure all members of the House would 
support.
<P>
	I want members of the House to apply their good common 
sense, listen to reason and support this amendment because it 
strengthens the authority and the position of the registrar, the 
position which is really pivotal together with the ethics 
counsellor in making these changes work.

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was not going to repeat what I said at the beginning, in 
my introductory remarks on Motion No. 1, when I took a few 
minutes to explain why the Bloc Quebecois had taken the stand 
it took at the committee stage of this bill and describe the 
general attitude of the hon. members who sat on this committee. 
But in the light of the comments made by the hon. member for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11739"> 11739 </A></B>
<P>
Fundy-Royal, who also chaired the sub-committee on  this 
bill, I will focus on the causes for my disappointment, since he is 
here to hear what I have to say, as will the minister opposite.
<P>
	I repeat, I am disappointed with this new consultation 
process. The main reason for referring the bill to committee 
before second reading was to allow members to play a more 
prominent role and promote dialogue between the government 
and opposition parties to enhance the contribution of members 
to the development of legislation. The idea was to give 
opposition members the chance to express their views on the bill 
now before us.
<P>
	Look at the changes to Bill C-43 as a result of this process and 
watch what will happen, at the end of the day, to the proposals 
made by opposition parties this afternoon. You will see that 
nothing changes. It comes to the same thing. So much so that 
when the minister appeared before the committee as our first 
witness, he told us that we had a free hand, that we were the best 
lobbyists there was to have the act amended, but he also gave us 
directions. While all his directions made it to Bill C-43, 
amendment proposals made at committee stage by the 
opposition, and the official opposition in particular, including 
twenty or so of my own fostering greater transparency, were all 
rejected. That is why I want to tone down this whole thing. I 
think we could revert to the old process, since this one is not 
much different anyway and comes to the same thing.
<P>
	Regarding Motion No. 19, I must tell the sponsor of this 
amendment straight off that I agree in principle with his 
amendment. I think that Motion No. 19 serves the purpose of 
fostering greater transparency. This is a commendable goal and 
we, Bloc members, will work toward and support this goal. 
However, what stands in the way of this motion being adopted is 
much more a technical consideration. Let me explain.
<P>
	Motion No. 19 seeks to amend section 8 of the existing 
legislation, the Lobbyists Registration Act. That act is in 
Chapter L-12.4 of the Revised Statutes of Canada. Section 8, 
which is under the heading ``Registry of lobbyists'', reads as 
follows: ``The Registrar General of Canada may designate any 
person employed in the office of the Registrar General of 
Canada as the registrar for the purposes of this Act''. Therefore, 
the section 8 currently in effect deals with the designation of the 
registrar. What does the registrar do? His role is to keep the 
registry of lobbyists. This is what the existing act provides. 
Based on its wording, section 8 designates the registrar.
<P>
	Motion No. 19 reads as follows: ``8. The Governor in Council 
may designate any person as the registrar for the purposes of this 
Act.'' The motion therefore refers to the Registrar General of 
Canada. The amended section in Motion No. 19 designates the 
Registrar General of Canada. But who will designate the 
registrar? As I said earlier, the underlying principle is good. 
Things would be  clearer if the Governor in Council were the one 
designating the Registrar General of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	This would ensure greater transparency. However, the 
amendment proposed by the member does not specify who will 
designate the registrar. Yet, this is extremely important, since 
the registrar is the one who maintains the registry of lobbyists. I 
believe the amendment proposed in Motion No. 19 is incomplete 
and thus we cannot support it, since it would create a vacuum 
regarding the implementation of the Lobbyists Registration Act.
<P>
	There is a legal principle which says that the legislator does 
not intervene uselessly. The legislator does not make a law for 
no reason. This is even more true in this case, where the 
legislator is represented by all of us here. Parliament does not 
make legislation to poke holes in its implementation. I sincerely 
believe that, if we support Motion No. 19, we will poke a hole in 
the legislation regarding who will designate the registrars. If we 
are going to create problems by amending the current 
legislation, we should stick with the existing section 8 of the 
Lobbyists Registration Act.
<P>
	As I said, the official opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, will 
oppose this motion, not because of its underlying principle, 
which we support and which has to do with ensuring greater 
fairness and transparency, but because it creates a vacuum in the 
bill. Consequently, we will vote against Motion No. 19.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Lincoln, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it certainly is 
a pleasure to speak on Bill C-43.
<P>
	I had the opportunity to sit on committee and participate in the 
discussions. The committee was very successful in putting 
forward a number of amendments that reflect what witnesses 
had communicated to it. The disclosure of grassroots lobbying 
and the disclosure of government funding for associations are 
just two of the many amendments which have been put forward 
with respect to Bill C-43.
<P>
	Specifically on Motion No. 19, section 8 as it exists in our 
present legislation reads: ``The Registrar General of Canada 
may designate any person employed in the office of the 
Registrar General of Canada as the registrar for the purposes of 
this act''. Motion No. 19 attempts to amend that with the 
following: ``The governor in council may designate any person 
as the registrar for the purposes of this act''.
<P>
	As the bill reads today, the registrar general is able to appoint 
a person that is employed in his office, a public servant. That 
public servant is bound by codes of conduct, Public Service 
Commission rules, Treasury Board, all of those provisions 
which ensure there is no political influence. There was no 
evidence in committee that political pressure had been exerted 
on this official, nor that the nature of the duties involved would 
make  this likely. If these duties justify parliamentary appoint-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11740"> 11740 </A></B>
<P>
ment in order to ensure the independence of the registrar, then 
countless other government officials should also be made 
independent.
<P>
	I wonder whether the hon. member with the intent put forward 
in this motion realizes that it already exists. There are 
provisions in the registration act where if we appoint a public 
servant, as is the present provision, that public servant is 
independent of any political pressure as the hon. member is 
alluding to because of the code of conduct that individual is 
bound by as a public servant. I am struggling with the intent of 
the motion. The opposition party did bring out a point which 
supported the fact that we would be unable to support this 
amendment.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	I will comment briefly, as other members have done, on how 
the committee functioned. The new structure in committee gives 
members of Parliament a great opportunity to affect legislation. 
We were able to do that with this bill by putting forward 13 
amendments. We can make changes and provide input which 
reflects what the witnesses asked us to do.
<P>
	There will now be a legal obligation for lobbyists to comply 
with the code of conduct and explicit authority for the registrar 
of lobbyists to issue interpretation bulletins. These are all things 
that improve the transparency and improve how the bill and its 
application will function.
<P>
	Let us look at the comments made earlier on how the intent of 
the bill was to improve transparency and the statement by the 
opposition parties that we are not doing that, we are not going 
far enough. Let us just take a moment to look at what we have 
done thus far.
<P>
	The ethics counsellor who has been appointed will develop 
the code of conduct for lobbyists. As I said earlier, there is a 
legal obligation to comply. In keeping with the spirit of 
increased powers for MPs, we will have the ability to review the 
code of conduct by the parliamentary committee.
<P>
	The ethics counsellor can investigate breaches of that code 
and submit a detailed report of each investigation to Parliament. 
This report can now include fees and disbursements that were 
paid. These are all things that lend to the transparency of how 
government works. Bill C-43 goes a long way in improving the 
transparency.
<P>
	With respect to Motion No. 19, the assumption behind the 
motion is that the registrar is vulnerable to political pressures. I 
find the arguments somewhat confused because the registrar, as 
stated by the Bloc in an earlier comment, is responsible for the 
administration of the lobbyists registry. As I said earlier, there is 
and was not any evidence in committee that political pressure 
had been exerted on this official.
<P>
	If we defeat this motion, as I hope the House will do, we will 
maintain in the bill the ability of the Registrar General of 
Canada to designate that public servant who is bound by the 
public service code of conduct to perform the duties required.
<P>
	What did the committee do? The committee did strengthen the 
powers of the registrar. The person will have the formal 
authority to audit the information contained in any return or 
document submitted and to issue interpretation bulletins and 
advisory opinions. We have strengthened that position. We have 
done so to allow the bill to work more effectively and to allow 
for that transparency.
<P>
	In summary, the registrar will have the authority necessary to 
ensure the effective implementation of the act. I hope that we 
will defeat Motion No. 19.

	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the House for allowing me to speak to the 
bill and the motions.
<P>
	We have talked in previous debate about the three-tier 
registration system for lobbyists. We have talked about 
increasing the transparency of how lobbyists operate. We have 
talked about increasing the authority and the autonomy of the 
ethics counsellor. I should like to focus my input on Motions 
Nos. 23, 25 and 31.
<P>
	Reformers were sent to Ottawa to try to influence the way 
government operates in the House of Commons, a return to 
ethics, integrity and honesty in the way the House of Commons 
and different government departments operate.
<P>
	In the eyes of most Canadians, politicians and government 
people in this plastic city, as it is called in my riding, are very 
much in question. The average Canadians has lost trust in 
government, lost trust in the bureaucracy of the public service 
and lost trust in the way the people entrusted to operate on their 
behalf operate.
<P>
	I will talk about integrity and trust, in particular the portion of 
the bill that deals with the ethics counsellor. The ethics 
counsellor, according to Bill C-43, will develop a lobbyists 
code of conduct. I do not share the same concerns about how 
lobbyists operate. Having been in the marketing business all my 
life-and I was a pretty good salesman-I look upon lobbyists 
as salesmen. They are selling concepts or ideas to the 
government on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11742"> 11742 </A></B>
<P>
behalf of  companies or interest groups. They are there to do a 
job. If they do a good job I am not uncomfortable with that.
<P>
	However, the part of the bill I am uncomfortable with is how 
the people in trusted positions react to lobbyists, whether they 
be the ethics counsellor, the registrar or employees. Guidelines 
must be put in place to ensure people in positions of trust are not 
privately influenced by lobbyists. In other words, it has to be an 
open and visible process so the people of Canada and 
parliamentarians are able to see clearly what is going on behind 
the closed doors of the people in trusted positions.
<P>
	I refer to the infamous Liberal red book or the red ink book, as 
we prefer to call it. The red book said that integrity in our 
political institutions must be restored. That is a very honourable 
statement but the proof of the statement must be in the pudding. 
How is integrity in our political institutions to be restored? That 
is the question people ask. It is fine, in the heat of an election, to 
make statements and even put them in writing. However 
following through on the statements is the most important thing 
a government can do and the most important thing the people of 
Canada are looking for.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	When Canadians see a statement in the Liberal Party red book 
that it is going to restore integrity in the political institutions, 
they are looking for some proof of it. The proof is not there.
<P>
	We have a situation where the Prime Minister can appoint an 
ethics counsellor. We beg to ask the question: Where is the 
integrity in that? It opens a door to many conflicts of interest. 
We in the Reform Party are firmly convinced that the 
appointment of an ethics counsellor, if integrity in our political 
institution is to be restored, must be approved by the Parliament 
of Canada. After all, every MP in this place represents the 
Canadian people. We were elected to come here and do a job. A 
position as important as the appointment of an ethics counsellor 
should be approved by Parliament as a whole.
<P>
	There are some examples already in the 35th Parliament in 
support of the Reform Party's demand that an ethics counsellor 
must be approved after debate in the House of Commons. Let me 
go through a few.
<P>
	Patronage is alive and well in the country and in the 
government. When the Prime Minister appoints another Liberal 
he says that he has to appoint Liberals. We question every day in 
question period the qualifications of some of the appointments 
made by the Prime Minister and his ministers. We say that they 
have the qualifications but we ask if they happen to be Liberal 
supporters, long time Liberal friends. That is a small example of 
patronage being alive and well. It is something the government 
said it was to do away with.
<P>
	Let me quote some other examples such as the minister of 
heritage affair. In October 1994 it was revealed that the minister 
of heritage wrote a letter to the CRTC on ministerial letterhead 
in support of one of his constituent's applications. In our 
opinion it was a clear conflict of interest in as much as the 
minister of heritage is responsible for the CRTC. The Prime 
Minister in his wisdom called it an honest mistake. We 
questioned that. We asked how many more examples of 
perceived conflicts of interest can be written off by the Prime 
Minister as honest mistakes.
<P>
	The Prime Minister refused to ask for the resignation of the 
minister of heritage as was demanded by many members in the 
House. He also refused to tell Canadians what the ethics 
counsellor had advised him to do.
<P>
	On one occasion the Prime Minister said that he had talked to 
the ethics counsellor. Then he said he had not talked to him and 
then a staff member had talked to the ethics counsellor for the 
Prime Minister.
<P>
	Under the present guidelines of the ethics counsellor we in the 
House will never know what happened in the minister of 
heritage affair. Canadians have seen a perceived conflict of 
interest swept aside with some talk about an honest mistake, that 
maybe he should not have done that but should have done this 
instead.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	If we had an ethics counsellor, truly independent and 
responsible to Parliament rather than the Prime Minister, there 
would be a clear obligation on the part of the ethics counsellor to 
report an incident such as I have described to Parliament and 
there would be no question as to what happened.
<P>
	We can talk about the post office scandal and the perceived 
conflict of interest between a Liberal senator and president of 
Canada Post and a developer. We can talk about the direct to 
home satellite flip-flop just discussed in the House the other 
day.
<P>
	What we want in Motion No. 23 is to force the ethics 
counsellor appointment to be approved by Parliament and that 
he or she would serve 10 years. In that case the ethics counsellor 
would no longer be at the whims of the Prime Minister as to his 
appointment and removal. Setting a term limit would ensure he 
does not become entrenched in a self-made empire, which 
happens all the time in this place.
<P>
	The red book promises an independent ethics counsellor. 
Under Bill C-43 he is not independent. This amendment would 
truly make him independent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11743"> 11743 </A></B>
<P>
	Motions Nos. 25 and 31 would require the counsellor to table 
his code of conduct to Parliament for approval and for debate. 
The counsellor would report directly to Parliament, not to the 
Prime Minister.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 25 and 31-this is very important-create 
accountability, legitimacy and autonomy within the ethics 
counsellor's department. I believe these last three words, 
accountability, legitimacy and autonomy, are very important to 
this bill and I urge members to give their support.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I believe the group of motions we are currently 
considering is the most important, because it focusses on the 
essence of the problem and of the goal of transparency. The 
amendments, the motions presented by the opposition relate 
directly to this.
<P>
	This is why I am extremely happy to see all the Liberal 
members and ministers listening very attentively to what I have 
to say. Let them take notes and they will realize that the 
objective of the motions put forward by the Bloc Quebecois, 
Motions Nos. 22, 28 and 29, is indeed in line with the purpose of 
Bill C-43 with respect to transparency.
<P>
	I believe that, if we are really to convince Canadians and 
Quebecers that Bill C-43 does indeed increase transparency and 
is not some dubious undertaking, it will be with the help of 
Motions Nos. 22, 28 and 29.
<P>
	Motion No. 22 concerns the appointment of the ethics 
counsellor. I do not want to go over this whole issue, but I think 
and I believe everyone across from me will agree that the elected 
representatives are the people who sit here. If someone is to 
report to somebody or account for something to somebody, 
anywhere in the entire system, it is to the duly elected 
representatives.
<P>
	But they still have to be able to choose this person-the ethics 
counsellor. Bill C-43 gives a lot of power to the ethics 
counsellor. Some witnesses even told us that the ethics 
counsellor should be someone extremely powerful. Powerful for 
whom or for what, if we, the elected representatives have no say 
in the choice or in the appointment of this individual and, more 
importantly, if he or she is not required to report to the House 
and is not accountable to the elected representatives?
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	We are now being told that his job is to watch over 
parliamentarians' chastity. I would like to have a say on the kind 
of work to be done by this ethics counsellor. I would like to have 
a say on his appointment and his reports to the House.
<P>
	As it now stands-and I think that most critics will agree on 
this-, Bill C-43 has no teeth. One of the reasons why this bill 
does not achieve the objectives set in terms of transparency is 
that the ethics counsellor will have to report only to the Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	I see hon. members opposite shaking their heads in 
disagreement and indicating to me that Bill C-43 still provides 
for some safeguards. The ethics counsellor will release his 
findings. That is not enough. Not only do we have no say in his 
appointment, but the ethics counsellor will only justify his 
findings. That is the purpose of Bloc Quebecois Motions Nos. 28 
and 29, which provide that the ethics counsellor must conduct 
his investigations publicly.
<P>
	We must keep in mind that the ethics counsellor will act in 
matters involving public money. I would not say anything if the 
ethics counsellor could look at contracts involving two private 
individuals or companies. I do not need to know the 
circumstances, how much they paid for a given piece of land, or 
why the contract was signed. However, when one of the parties 
is the government, when one of the parties spends taxpayers' 
money and makes laws or regulations that will have an indirect 
impact on the population as a whole, I think it is a different 
matter.
<P>
	When I sat on the committee, people told me that, even though 
I am a lawyer, I asked for things that even the Bar Association 
could not ask for. I reminded these people that, whenever the 
Quebec Bar Association investigates a lawyer, it is no longer a 
public but a private matter.
<P>
	The ethics counsellor is responsible for reviewing an issue 
like the Pearson Airport deal, which everyone in this House is 
familiar with. This is not a matter between two private parties. 
The ethics counsellor will have to look go over the telephone 
calls, the letters, the contacts, the meetings. We could have had 
information. The people could have received information they 
do not have at this time.
<P>
	I think that the Canadian people have a right to know what is 
being done with their tax money. We are paying enough taxes. I 
think we should know what our money is being used for. The 
only way to get to the bottom of this whole matter of lobbying 
would be through public inquiries. This way we would know 
which ministers and members of Parliament were involved and 
who contacted a particular civil servant. We need to know. It is 
not enough to go by findings on which the ethics councillor will 
base his conclusions.
<P>
	Let me give you a very simple example. If the only part of 
court judgments to be released were the conclusions, whether at 
the Superior Court, the Quebec Court or another court, few 
people would be able to find grounds for an appeal. Basically, 
disagreement would be expressed regarding the conclusions. 
But why did the judge come to these conclusions? How does one 
know what the judge's decision is based on? To appeal a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11744"> 11744 </A></B>
<P>
decision, one  needs to know who testified in the case, what they 
said, what evidence was introduced, what the charges were and 
so on. And where is all this information found? In the judgment.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Why the judgment? Because most of the time, perhaps 99.9 
per cent of the time, trials are public. While private parties are 
involved, 99.9 per cent of trials are public and we get to know on 
what basis the judge made his decision.
<P>
	This is plainly a public matter involving public funds, and the 
government, which claims to be transparent and which came up 
with Bill C-43 to show its hands were clean and it was fulfilling 
an election promise, introduced a bill whereby we will have no 
say in the selection of the ethics councillor and, moreover, we 
will never know a thing about his activities.
<P>
	That is what this government is about, a Liberal government 
that cannot even manage to fulfil the simplest of promises made 
in its red book concerning transparency and lobbyists, when it 
had promised to implement to the letter the recommendations of 
the Holtmann report on greater transparency. I can see that what 
we are saying here is painful to them because it is the truth. This 
government is good at hiding problems without ever solving 
them. It is hiding something. Bill C-43 is further evidence of 
this.
<P>
	You will understand therefore why these motions are so 
important and why the government is reacting this way to my 
comments. The fact is that we have put our finger on the real 
problem and the problem is over there.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with 
my hon. colleague from the Bloc that this is undoubtedly the 
pivotal group of the items we are discussing today.
<P>
	As I mentioned in my earlier intervention, the ethics 
counsellor and the registrar basically will be the people who 
administer this act and the revisions to the Lobbyist Registration 
Act. The ethics counsellor is undoubtedly the one who will make 
it work or allow it to fail. It will not be due to his or her work. 
Subsequently it could be anyone. It is possible their work could 
be undermined simply because this legislation is inadequate.
<P>
	It is not really what the ethics counsellor does but the freedom 
he has which will determine whether his reports will be received 
with trust by the Canadian people or whether they will be 
suspect. This is what I am speaking about.
<P>
	The word independence is mandatory here. Imagine a court in 
which a judge ruling on a matter is part of the family of one of 
the people in the dispute. I am not a lawyer but I think it is 
against the rules. A judge cannot sit on a case which involves a 
member of his family.
<P>
	Liberals are in government but next time it will be the 
Reformers and then they will obviously have a need for an ethics 
counsellor. There should clearly be no connection to the 
Liberals. When Reformers are in power after the next 
election-I hear no objections so I take it the House approves of 
the idea-the ethics counsellor should have no connection to the 
Reform Party. There should be not only a perceived 
independence but an actual independence, or else the ethics 
counsellor will not be heard.
<P>
	When is the ethics counsellor needed? Primarily when there is 
an item in dispute. If everything is tickety-boo, as we say, if 
everything is running smoothly, there is no need for an ethics 
counsellor. People are not suspicious and everything is fine.
<P>
	The ethics counsellor comes into importance when there is a 
perception that something has gone awry.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	In this Parliament, even after the Liberals ran under the 
platform of more accountability, more openness, more 
trustworthiness, a number of questions have been raised. There 
are really only two possibilities. Either the suspicions and 
accusations are accurate and something has gone wrong, or the 
suspicions and accusations are not accurate, which means the 
people involved are innocent of the suspicions.
<P>
	If we have an ethics counsellor who is basically answerable to 
the government of the day and not to Parliament as a whole, nor 
to the people, then we will have an ethics counsellor who is 
totally unable to put the matter to rest. If there is something 
untoward and he is answerable to the Prime Minister, he now has 
lost his freedom to be totally open and honest in describing the 
situation. He will not be able to make his friends or his family 
look bad, so there will be a restriction there. If the people are 
innocent and he so declares, the public will not believe him. It 
will be perceived by the people-probably incorrectly-that he 
is part of a cover-up, he is part of trying to put the matter to rest 
without necessarily disclosing the truth.
<P>
	I would like to remind the members opposite that I am not 
trying to persuade them of something they do not believe in. At 
least their words are that they believe in this. I would simply 
quote from the Liberal red book, quoted often here. I do not 
think we have any reason to distrust the integrity of the people 
who wrote this in their book as part of their election platform: 
``A Liberal government will appoint an independent''-I 
emphasize that word-``ethics counsellor to advise both public 
officials and lobbyists in the day to day application of the code 
of conduct''.
<P>
	That is the Liberal aspiration. Frankly, it is our aspiration as 
well. It is what Canadian people are asking for. If we agree, then 
I am sure we will have consent to the motions before us, which 
will provide that independence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11745"> 11745 </A></B>
<P>
	There are several of these motions here. The first one is really 
a choice we have between accepting Motion No. 22 or Motion 
No. 23, because they are very similar. Both provide that the 
ethics counsellor be appointed by governor in council but 
subject to the approval of the House of Commons and to be 
removed by the same authority, rather than just being an 
appointee of the Prime Minister with all of the implications of 
that closeness, answerable to him-a necessity to make him 
look good, a necessity to try to cover up. Whether it is true or 
not, it has that appearance.
<P>
	The ethics counsellor must have a method of appointment so 
that there is absolutely no connection. He must be totally 
independent.
<P>
	I want to move on, because the time is limited and we have a 
number of items in this grouping that I want to address. I would 
next like to talk briefly about the code of conduct itself, which 
the ethics counsellor will be administering. He of course is 
responsible under this act for developing the code of conduct 
and then administering it. I would like to say something about 
that code of conduct.
<P>
	It is almost impossible to legislate goodness. Sometimes 
governments try to do that. I have said in public meetings, 
especially when we talk about gun control, criminals, and the 
Young Offenders Act, that there is probably not a law we can 
pass that will make people good. I believe that. However, we do 
have to have laws that will restrain those who are not good. That 
is the objective of a law.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	When we think of the flaws in the human psyche we are trying 
to prevent here, it has to do with office holders and their 
relationship with lobbyists. If we are going to have a code of 
conduct that is going to be fair, that is going to satisfy the needs 
of the Canadian voters and taxpayers, that code of conduct also 
will have to have a certain degree of independence. There will 
have to be a development of that code that has a broad support.
<P>
	I would like to recommend Motion No. 25, which says that the 
ethics counsellor as proposed now will be producing the code of 
conduct but that it will be approved by both Houses. Both the 
House of Commons and the other place will have approval of 
this code of conduct.
<P>
	Indeed, I would even go further and say that it would be very 
judicious of us to give that code of conduct wide reading. It 
should be published in the papers so that the people know what 
level of expectations we have of ourselves. Then they can 
comment on it and we can get feedback from the people.
<P>
	We need to provide for not only independence of the ethics 
counsellor but also independence of the code of conduct. That 
will come through open debate and free votes, as promised in the 
red book, on that issue in the House of Commons. So all 
members, if they see a flaw in the code of ethics, will have the 
freedom to move an  amendment to it and to vote against it 
unless that amendment is made.
<P>
	These are necessary things. They are absolutely mandatory. 
Without the acceptance of these amendments, the code of 
conduct, the ethics counsellor, the whole of Bill C-43 will 
essentially come to naught.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a few minutes to respond to 
some of the things I have just heard.
<P>
	I had something to do with the drafting of the 1987 report, the 
Cooper committee, the legislation that appeared afterward, and 
then of course the Holtmann committee, which reported to this 
House early in 1993.
<P>
	The member across who just spoke is missing a few points. I 
know he is sincere in what he is doing and in what he is 
proposing. For that I commend him. I am sure he means very 
well. There is, however, something wrong with the logic of what 
is proposed by the member. The member is saying that only an 
officer appointed by this House and the other place could in fact 
be truly independent in terms of administering a code of conduct 
for lobbyists. There is something very flawed with that. 
Members will know that if that were the only test for 
independence of judgment then no judge in this country would 
truly be independent. If it were the only test for independence, 
then the director of competition policy would not be 
independent, and so on.
<P>
	Of course members will say that one of the differences is that 
judges have tenure. That is obviously true, but it is not true of all 
positions where there are quasi-judicial bodies. Therefore the 
member is wrong when he says that only an officer of the House 
administers in an independent and non-partisan way. What he is 
doing, notwithstanding his obvious good intentions, and I credit 
him for those again, is creating and setting a stage whereby it 
will be difficult for anyone having this function to operate 
independently because of the aspersions that are cast perhaps 
even inadvertently today and in this debate.
<P>
	There are a number of people who make rulings. I can think of 
the CRTC. I can think of the director of competition policy as 
one person who reports to the same minister. Does anyone say 
that these people operate in a way that is not independent? Does 
anyone suggest now that their judgment is tainted because they 
were appointed by the government?
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	In this case, the person was appointed by the government in 
consultation with the opposition. There has been that 
consultation. I remember the Prime Minister specifically 
mentioning it on the floor of the House. The consultation was 
made with the two opposition parties.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11746"> 11746 </A></B>
<P>
	Someone was just heckling who obviously-and I will try to 
be kind-not having had the benefit of hearing the whole debate 
in this House today is pretending to be outraged by-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> If the whip of the government is 
suggesting that the member who heckled him was not present for 
the debate, he knows as well as I do that is an improper 
statement. I would ask him to be more careful about what he is 
saying in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> No, Mr. Speaker, I was not suggesting that. I 
was implying that perhaps he was not listening to my comments 
previously, for whatever reason. I will let the House decide what 
the reasons were; I did not attribute them.
<P>
	The member, who was not listening to my remarks previously, 
for whatever reason, would know that in fact the government's 
effort in this bill, including the acceptance of amendments from 
the opposition and amendments proposed by the parliamentary 
committee, is evidence that we have tried as a government to get 
the input of all members of the House and from people outside to 
produce a good report to present to this House in an effort to get 
something unanimous. We wanted to get something that 
Parliament as a whole could live with in terms of a piece of 
legislation.
<P>
	As critical as I was of the previous government, Mr. Speaker, 
as you will no doubt recall, you will remember that when we 
produced the bill that is presently the law of the land in regard to 
lobbying, I supported the bill in the end at third reading and 
recommended, as the critic, to my colleagues to do so. I thought 
it was important that whatever law we had on the statute books 
dealing with lobbyists be supported by all of Parliament.
<P>
	At that time the New Democrats did not support it, and I 
thought that was wrong, because it was sending the wrong 
message. The message would have been sent, had I not 
supported it and recommended that support to my colleagues, 
that the law was inherently flawed and those administering it 
could never do a proper job. I do not think that was true, 
notwithstanding the partisanship that was there at the time. I 
know a little bit about being partisan.
<P>
	Today we have taken that law that existed, we have taken the 
Holtmann committee report, which was unanimous, adopted 
virtually the whole thing in the bill that we have before us, and 
we have added to it amendments proposed by members of the 
Reform Party, government members, and people who have come 
to testify before the parliamentary committee.
<P>
	We have added from where we started off, which I do not think 
was even a bad law. Yes, we said that five years later we had to 
redraft it, taking into account new situations and how the bill 
had worked.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	However, I believe that a bill on the registration of lobbyists 
can only work if the members of this House want it to work. I 
personally think that this is a good bill and that the proposed 
amendments are appropriate. If the members opposite think 
about it for a moment, they will certainly come to the same 
conclusion.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The bill was improved.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that it was 
improved. Again, the hon. member may not have been listening 
carefully when I said a little earlier that we accepted 
amendments from the parliamentary committee and from the 
government, and that today we will even accept some from one 
of the opposition parties. We incorporated these changes to an 
existing bill, and we also took into account a report tabled in this 
House by a parliamentary committee.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	That was a unanimous report. The member opposite may think 
that he has the monopoly on virtue. Good for him. However, 
those who were here during the previous Parliament also 
believed in what they were doing. Together, we proposed what 
we have today, and we even included all the amendments I 
mentioned earlier.
<P>
	I believe this bill deserves the support of the House. When the 
bill comes back at third reading and when we vote on it, we will 
have to ensure that the ethics counsellor, who will be 
responsible for the application of all these rules, can rely on the 
support of all parliamentarians. Otherwise, it will mean that we 
sabotaged the bill ourselves. We have to make it work. This is 
about parliamentary integrity. This issue does not only concern 
the government: it concerns all of us in this House, as well as 
those in the other place.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We can make this bill work. The way to do it is to co-operate. 
We are not just dealing with an issue that involves government. 
It is Parliament, both houses of this institution. If we do not 
work together to support the bill, then I suggest it will not work 
and it will be the fault of those who have chosen not to give it 
their support.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, allow 
me to briefly comment on the chief government whip's 
comments before moving on to my comments on certain 
amendments or certain motions in amendment, in particular 
Nos. 22, 28 and 29 which were introduced by my colleague from 
Berthier-Montcalm.
<P>
	The chief government whip has just talked about the 
co-operation, openmindedness, and responsibility that 
parliamentarians have regarding this bill. Let us put this into 
perspective. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11747"> 11747 </A></B>
<P>
First of all, we are talking about keeping better tabs on 
lobbyists. Let us not forget that the government manages and 
spends close to $160 billion annually. I think that it would be 
worthwhile to tighten  the controls on those who influence the 
government's decisions.
<P>
	He also told us that this is the responsibility of all 
parliamentarians and not just government members, the Cabinet 
and ministers. This is pretty well the spirit of the proposed 
amendments. The issue is having the House nominate the person 
who will be ethics counsellor, which is in line with what the 
whip was saying. In this case, we are told no; let us choose the 
person who will be answerable to the Prime Minister, not only to 
the government, but to the Prime Minister. And there, he went 
against what he was suggesting earlier.
<P>
	The current debate seems in a way to be an attempt to get out 
of a commitment that they regret having made now that they are 
in power. One must understand party funding, for example 
Liberal Party funding, to understand that, once under the direct 
influence of lobbyists, it is less desirable to keep better tabs on 
lobbyists than it was when they were in opposition. A 
remarkable change in attitude.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> And well noted.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> And well noted, indeed. Regarding this issue, I 
would like to quote a few sentences from the red book. During 
our first months in this House, the first months of the election 
campaign-our ears were ringing with the contents of the red 
book, the famous red book. The book talks about the integrity of 
the government and the trust relationship between it and the 
population. The book says: ``The integrity of government is put 
into question when there is a perception that the public agenda is 
set by lobbyists exercising undue influence away from public 
view''.
<P>
	I discussed this bill with some of my constituents and certain 
colleagues, and none of them feel that the bill changes this 
perception. On the contrary, because in the meanwhile, we 
noticed-some of us did our homework-that lobbyists had 
even influenced this bill in order to reduce its impact as much as 
possible.
<P>
	And now, if I may, I intend to quote the Canadian Press which 
said that, according to information obtained under the Access to 
Information Act, it would show that lobbyists had stepped up the 
number of meetings during the months preceding the tabling of 
this bill and that some had vowed to start legal proceedings if the 
new legislation obliged them to disclose their political 
connections.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	This was information obtained under the Access to 
Information Act, so it is not pure conjecture. In <I>La Presse</I>, there 
was a revealing headline: Lobbyists manage to get rid of 
constraints Ottawa would impose on them. The lobbyists came 
out as winners in the struggle around a bill that was supposed to 
regulate their dealings with the government. Now people 
opposite talk about restoring the people's trust. There is a 
serious problem.
<P>
	Motion No. 22, standing in the name of the hon. member for 
Berthier-Montcalm, proposes to have the ethics counsellor 
appointed by the House and to make him accountable to the 
House. I think that is perfectly normal. After all, we are elected 
by the people, who put their trust in institutions, not only in the 
person of the Prime Minister, and they expect Parliament to have 
a say in these matters. The government is doing everything it can 
to avoid this, although the government whip was no doubt 
entirely sincere in his desire to empower parliamentarians and 
ensure that everyone feels bound by this bill.
<P>
	The House has before it a number of proposals to improve a 
bill that is not bad but could certainly stand some improvements, 
but the government is reluctant to make genuine improvements. 
Why? Perhaps we should start wondering whom it may have met 
in the past few days, weeks and months. There may have been 
people who convinced it to change its mind and who had every 
interest in doing so.
<P>
	Since this government came to power, we have had several 
cases that remain to be clarified. There is the Pearson airport 
affair. There was also the case involving the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, and here we had a telling example of the 
powers of the ethics counsellor. Three weeks after the Prime 
Minister asked him for an opinion, he very discreetly took steps 
to cover the minister's tracks.
<P>
	When all is said and done, the role of the ethics counsellor 
would appear to be to cover for the government in matters that 
raise some controversy. The ethics counsellor is used to make 
the government look good. They say: Look, the ethics 
counsellor said there was no wrong doing. The fact is, the ethics 
counsellor is accountable to the Prime Minister and his job 
depends on the good will of the Prime Minister. There is a 
serious problem here.
<P>
	The motion moved by the Bloc Quebecois suggests 
appointing this person for a period of seven years. As a result, he 
will not always have connections with the party in power. There 
will be changes in governments, and that will give him a certain 
amount of independence. That will mean more power, 
particularly because he will not be accountable to anyone who 
could decide from one day to the next to dismiss him on the basis 
of the opinion.
<P>
	Some information should be made more public and not simply 
left as conclusions of a report. He is asked to report on his 
investigations, but only the conclusions are made public. In 
some cases, it would very interesting to know more than just the 
conclusions, to know how they were reached. This is another 
important step in response to the wishes to the whip and the 
entire Liberal government, which has been saying since its 
election that it wants more transparency, that it wants political 
action to be as transparent as possible. The waters look pretty 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11748"> 11748 </A></B>
<P>
cloudy to me, as if an effort is being made to create some  
confusion and prevent people from seeing the real picture.
<P>
	I will not get into the whole question of the scandal 
surrounding the deductibility of lobbying costs. In the end, the 
public is indirectly paying the lobbyists to influence decisions 
according to certain specific interests. This warrants serious 
consideration.
<P>
	It seems to me it would be in everyone's interest to make 
Parliament credible. It is also what the Reform Party would like 
to some extent and I think what the government whip would like, 
but his hands are tied-I think everyone is basically good, but on 
this, his hands are tied somewhat. People put their trust in 
individuals and in political groups and expect Parliament to play 
a role.
<P>
	In this regard, I hope with all my heart that the government 
will support this amendment, which will give us a better bill in 
the interest of all taxpayers.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	It must be remembered that the government spends $160 
billion a year. This is a lot of money. We must make sure that this 
money is not spent in the interests of a few privileged 
individuals with good connections with previous, present or 
future governments, or even with corporations the government 
is closely connected to through their funding of political parties. 
These are the reasons why we must make sure we succeed.
<P>
	I would like to quote Mr. Reisman, a committee witness who 
supports the recommendation made by my colleague from 
Berthier-Montcalm. He said: ``If we get into the business of a 
code of ethics to govern the behaviour of the members of this 
industry, it ought to be kept out of partisan politics as far as you 
possibly can. I think one good way of doing that is to make the 
appointment an appointment by Parliament, rather than by the 
government of the day''. There it is. The Bloc members are not 
the only ones to think that way.
<P>
	This may not be a guarantee in itself, but it certainly helps, as 
he more or less suggested when he said: ``You are more likely to 
get someone more objective. If he is appointed by Parliament, I 
think he should report to Parliament-which is the 
recommendation in any event-and be accountable to 
Parliament''. There are other reasons why he should be 
accountable to Parliament.
<P>
	So this seems to be a fundamental point on which everyone, 
including the government, should agree.
<P>
	In conclusion, I expect this government will abide by its 
commitments. I hope they will not bring in a legislation simply 
to mask their change of heart when moving to the other side of 
the House. I hope they will meet the initial commitments made 
at the beginning of the election campaign and written in the red 
book, bible of the Liberal Party, and that they will support the 
recommendations of my colleague, the member for 
Berthier-Montcalm. These give the government an  
opportunity to respect its own commitments and restore the 
bond of confidence that existed between the Canadians and their 
institutions so that the ethics counsellor will not simply be a 
coverup for the Prime Minister, his ministers or government 
members when they get into difficult situations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to begin by talking about just how this code of conduct is 
developed, why and what happens to it.
<P>
	Currently the code of conduct is developed in the same 
manner as it has been, but it is approved by the House of 
Commons. The ethics counsellor tables his report with the 
Registrar General. The Registrar General who receives this 
report is currently the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services.
<P>
	I have some problem with the ethics of that in itself because of 
a lot of the dealings I have had in this House with the particular 
minister who receives that report. I dealt with an issue just 
yesterday in question period with that minister. I question very 
much the avenues that were taken to disburse federal funds 
through a provincial road program. Even a member opposite 
called the disbursement of those funds misappropriation. I have 
a real concern with these kinds of reports going directly to a 
minister rather than to the House. After all it is the House of 
Commons that has to deal with the ethics, is it not, and not the 
Prime Minister or not a minister?
<P>
	I want to raise another issue and that is an individual who is a 
member but is not a minister who I have long said should come 
under the auspices of an investigation by the ethics counsellor. 
Again I question. If you cannot be entirely ethical as a party or a 
minister how in the name of heaven does one get to receive 
reports from an ethnics counsellor and deal with them?
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	It is just not the right way to do it. All members of this House 
have the right to receive the reports directly. They have the right 
to make the appointments. They have the right to set the 
standards. I cannot comprehend why this government, after all 
the talk about ethics during the election, has turned around to 
table something which says that the appointments should be 
made by the Prime Minister and the report should be given to a 
minister. It is hogwash.
<P>
	Why is it that the Liberals do not want the ethics counsellor to 
report to the House of Commons? What is wrong that we cannot 
understand that it should come to the members? If we can 
understand the longstanding traditions of a traditional party, the 
difficulty it has is that it does not trust itself or its own members. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11749"> 11749 </A></B>
<P>
It does not want to be put into a position of being embarrassed 
down the road.
<P>
	I would like to say one more thing about the minister with 
whom I was dealing yesterday. I found out that there is a 
federal-provincial agreement on roads in Nova Scotia. I found 
out that the minister and the Minister of Transport deliberately 
made a deal to transfer moneys from a federal highway program 
to a provincial highway program. They made a deal on it.
<P>
	Why did they make the deal? It happens that the money they 
wanted to take from the federal program is going to the 
minister's riding. The federal road they had the money for is 
considered one of the most dangerous roads in this country. The 
road the minister had the money transferred to in his own riding 
happens to be a road for tourists. It is a make work program. I 
have a great deal of difficulty understanding the ethics of that 
manoeuvre. So do the people of Wentworth Valley in Nova 
Scotia.
<P>
	How on earth can I comprehend this government taking the 
very same reports from an ethics commissioner and giving it to 
the very same minister who made the transfer? Talk about 
ethics.
<P>
	What happens if an ethics counsellor or an ethics 
commissioner in this person's government makes a report which 
chastises somebody from the government? The Prime Minister 
takes that report and downplays it. We in the House probably 
will not even get the report. The public will never see the report. 
On it goes. If he makes the mistake of divulging what is in the 
report, he gets canned. That is why this counsellor must report to 
the House of Commons and not the Prime Minister.
<P>
	We can look back at all of the processes we have gone through 
on ethics in this House. For instance, there is the ethics having to 
do with patronage appointments. Time and time again the 
government talks about ethics and patronage appointments. 
What does it do day after day? It gives all its hacks, everyone it 
can, patronage jobs. The Liberal I defeated in my riding just got 
his plum. That is ethics over there.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cannis:</B> Wait until you see what is coming.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It has nothing to do with ethics. He is 
qualified.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member 
says: ``It has nothing to do with ethics. He is qualified''. These 
folk only have to know the individual I defeated to find out if he 
is qualified. They should have had a good look at him. The 
difficulty with them is that they do not know what ethics are. 
How can an ethnics counsellor report to the Prime Minister 
when they have no idea what ethics are?
<P>
	Suffice it to say one of the most important issues for 
Canadians today is ethics. Another important issue for 
Canadians is integrity. Politicians across the country suffer in 
the eyes of Canadians because they do not believe they have 
integrity.
<P>
	There is an easy way to try to help the situation. The 
counsellor should be appointed by the whole House of 
Commons, not just that group. I question the ethics of some of 
its members and will continue to do so.
<P>
	It is not good enough to legislate integrity. We have to believe 
in it. Will the government look at the amendments on the table 
and vote for them in favour of objectivity, in favour of integrity 
and in favour of informing the people of Canada in the proper 
way? Or, will it be business as usual from a traditional party and 
in some cases a traditional party that has already proven it has 
questionable activities, particularly the ones I mentioned 
before.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to make a couple of comments.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Not her again.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> I am sorry my hon. friends are so disturbed and 
that my intervention might upset them. Given that the hon. 
member made comments about route 104, I thought it might be 
an idea to set the record straight about Nova Scotia. Being born 
there is not quite as good as growing up there and living there, 
although it is good to be born there and we are glad he was.
<P>
	The Nova Scotia solution offers the quickest, safest and most 
cost effective redevelopment of highway 104 possible. The 
important issue is safety. I know the highway. We cannot lose 
sight of the necessity of safety because of those who engage in 
petty and partisan bickering.
<P>
	By working in co-operation with the private sector the Nova 
Scotia government is protecting and promoting the interests of 
the taxpayers by levering private sector funds, by creating jobs 
and by providing for a safe and competitive transportation 
system. I think the people of Nova Scotia-I do not know about 
my hon. friend-deserve nothing less.
<P>
	It is not about $26 million. It is about a $110 million project 
that runs right through Cumberland-Colchester. That is not bad 
from any standard.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-43 gives us the opportunity to ask ourselves: Who 
exactly is running this government? Is it the people through its 
elected representatives or is it private interests, corporate 
interests? The people of Canada are concerned. For a long time 
they called for a law governing lobbying activities on 
Parliament Hill, even before the arrival of Conservatives and 
Liberals, because they know that lobbyists exercise undue 
pressure.  They know that patronage exists within the 
government, as well as waste and corruption. They know it, 
although they do not have 
<P>

<B><A NAME="11750"> 11750 </A></B>
<P>
any concrete proof, but there are signs, gestures, and recent 
events that show without any doubt that lobbyists manage to 
extract favours from the government by undue pressure. For 
example, there is the Pearson airport case which involved 
millions of dollars, and even today the people of Canada do not 
know what the players, the lobbyists and the various interests 
actually did.
<P>
	The case of the Minister of Canadian Heritage was mentioned. 
Although he is the minister responsible, he interfered with the 
CRTC and this, of course, raised the question of the role played 
by the ethics counsellor within the government, a person who 
was not even consulted by the Prime Minister in this case.
<P>
	In the case of BST, a hormone developed by Monsanto, we 
read in the papers that this company had people, lobbyists, who 
met with officials of Health and Welfare Canada and offered 
some 2 million dollars to convince them to approve BST for use 
in Canada. These are but three recent cases among the very many 
which prove the abusive role of lobbyists in Canada.
<P>
	I will come back to this with an even more distressing case.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
30(5), the House will now proceed to statements by members.
<P>
	The hon. member will have the floor after question period.

	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to relate a success story in my riding of 
Lambton-Middlesex based not on government handouts but on 
true community spirit and the refusal to let a dream die.
<P>
	On March 11 pledges from a variety of local service clubs for 
about $125,000 were announced toward the construction of 
additional facilities at the Brooke-Alvinston-Inwood 
Community Centre complex.
<P>
	After no government grant money was available, organizers 
decided that the project would not go ahead if it meant an 
increase in tax dollars for local ratepayers. Instead, based solely 
on the generous contribution of thousands of dollars from a 
variety of service clubs in the riding, plus the donation of 
material, products and volunteer assistance, ground breaking 
will begin this spring.
<P>
	This project exemplifies the rural community spirit that is 
alive and well in the riding of Lambton-Middlesex.
<P>
	My congratulations to all participants in this very worthwhile 
community project, and a special mention to Doug Redick, 
chairman of the building committee, and Ian Lehrbass, the arena

National Volunteer Week, I am pleased to pay tribute to the 13 
million devoted and dynamic men and women who have chosen 
to get involved in our society, particularly by helping those less 
fortunate.
<P>
	However, it seems that the federal government has a whole 
other view of volunteer work. Whereas a brochure from the 
Department of Heritage highlights the importance of their 
action, the government has no qualms about drastically reducing 
assistance to volunteer agencies. Indeed, their budget is 
dropping from $1,066,000 in 1993-94 to $65,000 in 1995-96.
<P>
	We, in the Bloc Quebecois, condemn this shameful decision. 
Not only did the federal government miss an opportunity to 
really support these groups, but it has also been indifferent to the 
have-nots in our society.

	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
at the Reform Party policy convention in October, 1994 the 
delegates passed two resolutions. First, if elected the Reform 
Party will introduce legislation by which the criminal use of 
firearms will be severely punished and the right of law-abiding 
citizens to own and use firearms will be protected. The 
amendments introduced to the Young Offenders Act by our party 
include stricter penalties for crimes using firearms.
<P>
	The second resolution stated the Reform Party supports the 
rights of citizens to protect themselves and their property 
against criminal acts using all reasonable means and that the 
right to do so has priority over offenders' rights.
<P>
	This resolution has been marketed to the gun lobby as the 
Reform Party's answer to gun control. It is a motherhood and 
apple pie statement that could only confuse the people who 
would believe this is a Reform Party position against the gun 
control act, yet another example of Reform Party pretence.

	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday, April 24, over 2,000 protesters rallied on 
Parliament Hill for the 25th time to remember and pay tribute to 
1.5 million Armenian victims of the first major genocide of the 
20th century. This genocide was planned and executed by the 
Ottoman Empire on April 24, 1915 as a brutal and final solution 
to the Armenian question.
<P>
	The Permanent People's Tribunal in Sorbonne, France 
considered the Armenian genocide in April 1984 and ruled that 
it was an international crime for which the Turkish state must 
assume responsibility.
<P>
	We must not allow the international community to simply 
dismiss Ottoman Empire crimes against the Armenian people.

	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
on March 20 of this year the Republic of Hungary and the Slovak 
Republic signed an historic treaty in Paris. One highlight of the 
treaty is an agreement between Hungary and Slovakia to refrain 
from the threat or use of force against one another's territorial 
integrity and political independence.
<P>
	Another highlight of the treaty is the confirmation that the 
protection of national minorities and the rights and freedoms of 
individuals belonging to a national minority are a matter of 
international human rights. In this sense the problems of 
minorities are not exclusively an internal  affair of states but 
rather a matter of legitimate interest for the international 
community.
<P>
	This treaty sets an example for all the world. From African 
nations to the former Yugoslavia the world is witnessing a 
dangerous rise of ethnic conflicts. This treaty provides an 
example of what nations can achieve with negotiations, not 
guns; with discussion, not destruction.

expenses of all federal ministers. This piece of news had already 
angered taxpayers, who expected the Liberal government to 
keep its promises and stop wasting taxpayers' money.
<P>
	Well, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has done it again, 
spending over $200,000 on redecorating and refurnishing his 
headquarters in Ottawa.

furniture, when his own government is cutting billions of dollars

	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadian parents and families are being threatened by 
a movement to repeal section 43 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Section 43 presently permits parents and teachers to use 
reasonable discipline on children should the circumstances 
warrant. Repeal would reduce parental authority and replace it 
with state authority.
<P>
	This government interference would undermine the integrity 
and viability of Canadian families.
<P>
	Today in the news there is a case in London, Ontario of an 
American tourist charged with assault for spanking his 5-year 
old daughter. In Calgary a triple amputee mother was similarly

<P>
	The justice and health departments have been reviewing 
section 43. The government has to come clean with Canadians as 
to its intentions. Polls tell us Canadians do not want more 
government interference in their homes and families. It is the 
parents who know what is best for their children, not interest 
groups, bureaucrats or so-called experts.

I am sure all members of the House will join with me in 
opposing attempts by various media organizations to allow 
public viewing of the Paul Bernardo video tapes.
<P>
	The public showing of these tapes would not serve the public 
interest. This is not, as the media claims, a matter of free speech. 
The Bernardo trial will be open to the media and to the public.
<P>
	Attempts by the media to gain access to the video tapes are 
simply an effort to boost ratings at the expense of the victims' 
families. The families of the victims have suffered enough 
without having these videos broadcast. This is a prime example 
of tabloid journalism at its worst.
<P>
	I hope the courts turn down the media's request. I call on the 
media to show some restraint and consideration for the feelings 
of the French and Mahaffey families. They have suffered 
enough.

killed many people and destroyed many cities, villages and 
lives.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>]

	All wars are cruel and we always lose whatever the outcome.
<P>
	In 1943, the Canadians landed in Sicily. Old Sicilians living in 
Vancouver still remember with gratitude the summer day when 
they were liberated by the Canadians.
<P>
	On this 50th anniversary of the end of the war in Italy, I wish 
to thank the thousands of Canadians who liberated families like 
mine, ensuring the freedom we enjoy today. Many died but their 
sacrifice will not be forgotten.
<P>

this situation is profoundly disturbing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is difficult to imagine societal circumstances that would 
lead individuals to commit such atrocities. The massacres in 
Rwanda are the perfect example of what can occur when we let a 
society develop in a climate of hatred and intolerance.
<P>
	These killers show a flagrant lack of respect for human life. 
We should all draw important lessons from this massacre and 
think about our society's values.

	No society is immune to intolerance or hatred. However, it

before the House a bill which will help suppress an ugly side of 
our society. Bill C-41 will not protect the innocent people of 
Rwanda but it will stem odious acts affecting Canadians.

<P>

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing,

Advisory Council on the Status of Women indicates that many of 
our country's middle aged women will be poor when they retire 
from the workforce.
<P>
	These women, between 45 and 54, stayed at home to raise 
children, care for their spouses and in many cases their elderly 
parents, and volunteered countless hours in their communities. 
Because they did not enter or re-enter the workforce until their 
mid-thirties or early forties, their retirement benefits are very 
low. For these women the future is particularly bleak.
<P>
	This study comes at a time when the federal government is 
about to reform the retirement income system. Ironically it is 
one of the last documents released by the council, its mandate 
having been ended with the last federal budget. As we well 
know, the social security reform process is really the Liberals' 
definition of slash and burn just like the Tories.
<P>
	It is vital the government seriously take into consideration 
this very important information when it reviews options for 
changing Canada's pension system. The women who dedicated a 
good portion of their lives in caring for others deserve to live 
their retirement years in comfort and dignity. They do not 
deserve to be repaid for their service with a ticket to the 
poorhouse.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to convey to 
all members of Parliament who donated flags for the Cornish 
fishermen the sincere thanks and appreciation of Canada's High 
Commissioner to Britain, the hon. Royce Frith.
<P>
	According to the High Commission office there was wall to 
wall press coverage in England: ``In all our memory Canada has 
never had such a positive profile''.
<P>
	Through the combination of a minister of fisheries who was 
relentless in his defence of Canadian sovereignty and 
conservation, a Prime Minister with the diplomatic skills to 
strengthen that position and the cross party support of members 
of Parliament and Senators, Canada has taken a leadership role 
in the international community to preserve marine resources.
<P>
	This was the message that Royce Frith received as he handed 
out the flags donated by parliamentarians to British fishermen 
and their families. He told each recipient where the particular 
MP was from and why they had donated the flag.
<P>
	On behalf of the High Commission office I have been asked to 
tell all MPs who donated their flags they would have been 
extremely proud of the outpouring of affection and support for 
Canada. It was a moving experience and all who received the

	No one was fooled by the latest shift toward association. The 
common political and economic structures proposed by the Yes

cheaper, to upgrade and reinforce them instead?

Fortunately, while this infighting is going on among separatists, 
the federal government is tackling the real priorities:

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this morning the federal cabinet postponed its 
decision on direct-to-home satellite services. For the time 
being, it preferred not to go ahead with directives that would 
benefit Power DirecTV by reversing a decision by the CRTC.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Why did his 
government intervene directly in this matter, supporting the 
interests of Power DirecTV, which is owned by Power 
Corporation, when Power DirecTV should have gone to the 
CRTC, the same as its competitor Expressvu did and, in fact, 
was obliged to do?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the CRTC's decision has been widely discussed, even 
in the media. For the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition, I 
may add that newspapers as diverse as the <I>Globe and Mail</I> and 
the Toronto <I>Star</I> gave substantially the same advice.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Toronto <I>Star</I> reads: ``Ottawa should endorse the panel's 
report without hesitation and instruct the CRTC to move quickly 
to let the competition begin''. In the <I>Globe and Mail</I> we have 
similar advice: ``The government acted in the public interest by 
creating the review panel, which did its work well''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, considering the position taken by daily 
newspapers as diverse as the Toronto <I>Star</I> and the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I>, perhaps the Leader of the Opposition would consider 
agreeing with the government's policy.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, am I to understand that the Leader of the 
Government refuses to answer himself because his son in law's 
interests are at stake?
<P>
	I will nevertheless address my question to the Prime Minister. 
After all, he is the Prime Minister, Mr. Speaker. And this is a 
fundamental issue which concerns Canadian content and the 
future of international communications, am I right?
<P>
	So now my question for the Prime Minister, if there is still one 
in this government. Would he agree that the retroactive impact 
of his proposed directives would have the effect of penalizing 
Expressvu which, unlike Power DirecTV, is able to provide all 
the guarantees for Canadian content prescribed by the CRTC?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is very unfortunate that the Leader of the Opposition 
seems to think that he has to get down to the level of personal 
attacks on the Prime Minister in order to deal with an issue of 
policy.
<P>
	It is very clear on this issue that in the face of concerns 
expressed in the broadcasting sector by groups such as the 
Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, ACTRA, the Canadian 
Conference of the Arts and many newspaper editorials, they are 
all urging the government to act.
<P>
	It would appear that in the mind of the Leader of the 
Opposition the government should not fulfil its responsibility to 
bring about good public policy because someone happens to 
have some relationship to a relative of the Prime Minister. 
Although that seems to be what is in the mind of the Leader of 
the Opposition, this government was elected with the 
responsibility for public policy. We are prepared to answer on 
the basis of good public policy and that is what we are doing. It 
is consistent with what the public is urging us to do.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, when a government is about to commit a violation 
of this magnitude of its arm's length relationship with the

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. In his report, 
the Official Languages Commissioner deplores the difficulty 
that the federal government has providing services in both 
official languages. He says that this year's review of various 
offices shows that the situation leaves much to be desired, 
except in Quebec. All too often, service in the minority official 
language is mediocre if not non-existent.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister, who claims that francophones 
can live anywhere in this country and prosper, explain that year 
after year the federal government continues to fail to provide 
French-language service to francophones outside Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we received a copy of the Official Languages 
Commissioner's report today, and it says that the situation 
improved in 1994. I do not deny that we must constantly strive to 
improve the situation and that we must continue to monitor it. 
We have made staggering progress over the past 20 years in this 
area, and I am happy to see that the commissioner stated that 
1994 was the best year yet.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, those who saw the commissioner at the press 
conference would say that, actually, he looked rather depressed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> He had every reason to be.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> How can the Prime Minister not be 
embarrassed by the fact that even in Ottawa, the nation's capital, 
26 years after the Official Languages Act was passed, one out of 
three times a francophone requests a service, he or she cannot 
get it in French?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I said earlier that the situation is not ideal and that it 
has considerably improved. The government's policy is to put 
pressure on all federal government bodies and offices to use 
both official languages when providing services to the public 
and to public servants in the national capital region.

have insisted that they would settle for nothing less than the 
outright separation of Quebec from Canada, but a majority of 
Quebecers continue to reject that option. Now the PQ 
Government of Quebec says that it wants to explore the 
possibility of an economic and political association between 
Canada and an independent Quebec.
<P>

what the Government of Canada's position is on so-called 
sovereignty association?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

some day, to have Canadian citizenship, a Canadian passport, 
Canadian currency, a Canadian economic union and Canadian 
political union it is going to be the Parliament of Canada and the

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr.

<P>
	Obviously, it is important that Quebecers know how the rest 
of Canada feels about so-called sovereignty association before 
any Quebec referendum this fall. It is also quite evident that 
Quebecers will not get a clear view of Canadian public opinion 
on that subject through the BQ or the PQ.
<P>
	How does the Prime Minister plan to ensure that Canadian 
public opinion on sovereignty association is clearly registered

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

that the project being proposed is the separation of Quebec from 
Canada. Everybody in Quebec knows that Quebecers do not 
want to quit Canada. Even the Leader of the Opposition said that 
two weeks ago.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr.

question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Minister of Justice said that those who use 
firearms for sustenance purposes, particularly aboriginal 
people, will be exempted from the registration fees for their 
firearms, thus creating a double standard?
<P>
	How can the Minister of Justice claim to be in a position to 
check if those who own firearms use them for recreation 
purposes or for sustenance purposes, particularly among 
aboriginal people?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my statement 
yesterday was that the existing exemptions from the payment of 
fees for those who use firearms for sustenance will be continued 
in the new legislation. That statement is accurate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
does the Minister of Justice recognize that, by exempting certain 
firearm owners from paying the owner's permit, he creates two 
categories of citizens and totally contradicts his statement to the 
effect that the law must be the same for everyone and must be 
implemented everywhere?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find the premise of 
the question puzzling. We make categories in law all the time. 
We distinguish between kinds of firearms. We make exceptions 
for people who use firearms in their occupations, for example.
<P>
	For many years in the criminal law we have provided that for 
those who use firearms for sustenance purposes. It does not talk 
about aboriginals. It talks about Canadians. Canadians who use 
firearms for sustenance purposes are exempted from the 
payment of fees. That, of course, is a common sense approach 
and one which we will continue in the new legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Justice is attempting to link the horrific situation in 
Oklahoma City with the firearms situation in Canada in a 
pathetic attempt to gain support for Bill C-68. I am appalled that 
the Minister of Justice would try to capitalize on such a heinous 
crime in order to drum up emotional support for his gun 
regulations.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	In interviews yesterday, the minister defended the proposed 
firearms registry by saying that registration will provide 
information to police about whether someone is stockpiling 
firearms. Will the minister explain to the House how the 
firearms stockpiling in Oka occurred, how these prohibited 
firearms were acquired and how registration would have 
prevented this?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was while meeting 
with representatives of the Canadian Police Association last 
month that the advantages of registration in identifying 
stockpiling of firearms was first brought to my notice. I referred 
to it yesterday because of its power as a compelling example of 
the advantages of registration.
<P>
	As I said yesterday and as I firmly believe, if people are 
stockpiling firearms to create their own arsenal that is 
something the authorities should know about. We permit 
firearms in this country for good and legitimate purposes, 
whether it be hunting or farming. If someone has a collateral 
purpose and is stockpiling firearms that is something the 
authorities should know about.
<P>
	Registration will enable the authorities to have access to that 
information. The police want it. I want to know why the hon. 
member will not support the police in the work they are trying to 
do to achieve a safer country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, surely the 
Minister of Justice is not so naive as to believe that the 
registration of firearms will stop terrorist attacks the magnitude 
of Oklahoma City or the illegal importation of prohibited 
firearms.
<P>
	I ask the justice minister why his government does not use the 
millions of dollars planned for the gun registry and reinstate the 
RCMP counterterrorist unit which was abolished three years ago 
if he has any information that firearms or weapons of any kind 
are being stockpiled in our country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have succeeded at 
some measure already in this debate. We now have the hon.

	The Canadian Police Association, representing 35,000 front

Ottawa, including over $7,000 for art work, $1,800 for a love 
seat, and some $254 for a brass nameplate.
<P>

	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State (Agriculture

the expenditure for the renovations to the office of the Minister 
of Fisheries was not unreasonable, due to the simple fact that the 
office had not been renovated for a number of years.
<P>
	The current minister of fisheries wanted to use this office at 
200 Kent Street to conduct the department's business, unlike 
previous ministers who used their office on the Hill. What was 
done was reasonable. We also wanted to take advantage of the 
fact that the building owner wanted to do some repairs on the

my question is for the Prime Minister. Last year, we learned with 
dismay about the setbacks experienced by francophone parents 
and students in Kingston, who were prevented from building a 
French language high school. Because he wanted to make 
Kingston the showcase of Canadian bilingualism, the Prime 
Minister personally promised in May 1994 that a high school 
would be built as soon as possible.
<P>

Prime Minister explain that, one year later, nothing has been 
settled in this matter?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we said at the time that the situation in Kingston would 
get straightened out and that a high school would be built.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	Decisions were made in this regard and, according to the 
information available to us, there is no problem at this time. A 
piece of land has been agreed on but the school must be built. It 
cannot be done in just one week, it will take some time. 
However, all the administrative problems have been solved 
thanks to the close co-operation among the federal, provincial 
and municipal governments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the reason there are no problems is that there is no school yet.
<P>
	There was such close co-operation with Kingston that new 
problems surfaced again yesterday, in that children of French 
speaking members of the military would now be required to go 
outside the military base to attend a French language school.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister intend to come to the defence of the 
young people who would be required to go to a different school, 
thus preventing another act of discrimination against 
francophones in Kingston?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence

education on Canadian military bases was the responsibility of 
the Department of National Defence until 1987 when agreement 
was reached to discontinue that. There have been accords with 
various provinces to phase out DND's role of being responsible 
for education.
<P>
	It is the province of Ontario that is responsible for the school 
boards. It has made a decision which it considers to be practical. 
It is one which we do not agree with, in light of the discussions

<P>

point, with the program in place a little less than a year, we have 
already been able to process over 38,000 applications for 
assistance from the groundfishery.

	Over 25,000 of those people have received direct counselling

businesses. Several hundred are now working on a number of 
green resource conservation projects. Several hundred have 
been able to get work in other areas.
<P>

<P>
	In other words we are demonstrating that while we are facing 
a major tragedy, the collapse of the fishery, the federal

showing that Canada can respond by giving people some real 
hope when they face that kind of calamity.

will be among the lucky few to get work if and when the fishery 
recovers, but it is cruel of the government to hold out false hope. 
At the same time as Atlantic fishermen struggle to feed their 
families we see the minister of fisheries spending over $200,000 
on office furnishings.

who are facing the end of the fishery are now successfully 
making a transition to new jobs, new opportunities, through the 
help of their federal government. Third, we are helping to create 
a new economy in the Atlantic provinces and eastern Quebec to  
demonstrate that while fish is a very important staple the 
country can go beyond that and add new products, new services

and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what I 
have said, and I said it on that program, is that defence 
expenditures are not an instrument of equalization. There are 
other programs of the Government of Canada to attain those 
objectives.
<P>

<P>
	I did say that in any capital program we do our best to ensure 
there are regional benefits, that all regions of the country benefit 
proportionately.
<P>
	I underline for the hon. member that much of the defence 
industry is located in the province of Quebec. If he checks the 
records he will see that much of the capital spending that has 
been engaged in by ministers of defence in the past has been on 
industries located in his province.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have learned that a trade mission to the Far East last 
year led by the Governor General and the agriculture and 
international trade ministers also included representatives from 
the Tobacco Industry Marketing Board and was designed in part 
to promote the sale of Canadian tobacco products in that market.
<P>
	Will the minister of agriculture confirm that he believes the 
Canadian government has no problem promoting the export of 
tobacco?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada has 
significant programs in place in conjunction with the provinces, 
most particularly the province of Ontario, to encourage 
agricultural production away from tobacco through our tobacco 
diversification program.
<P>
	Since the implementation of the tobacco diversification 
program in 1987, the number of flue cured tobacco producers in 
Canada has decreased by some 44 per cent and the number of 
producers of burley, pipe and and cigar tobacco has decreased by 
about 80 per cent. It is obvious the program is working.
<P>
	Nevertheless it must be noted that tobacco production is legal 
in Canada and tobacco producers must be treated fairly along 
with all other Canadian farmers. If the hon. gentleman holds a 
different point of view, I suggest he go to Delhi, Ontario, in the 
constituency represented by the chairman of the House of 
Commons Standing Committee on Agriculture and explain to 
the farmers of Delhi his views with respect to tobacco 
production and what he would do to compensate the farmers for 
the kinds of losses he is proposing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, calling a spade a spade, tobacco companies go overseas 
to find other markets to sell tobacco, not something else.
<P>
	The Minister of Health has said in the House that she would do 
anything to prevent even one person from taking up smoking. As 
the minister knows, representatives of tobacco companies freely 
distribute their products to nightclubs overseas in an attempt to 
get young people addicted.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Health support the practice of the 
government in aiding tobacco companies to promote smoking 
overseas?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are doing everything in our power to help people 
overseas, as well as people in Canada, to sensitize them to the 
dangers of tobacco.
<P>
	Next week I will be in Geneva at a World Health Organization 
conference where we have put on the agenda the problem of 
smoking in the world. It is very important for the member to 
realize the effort the country is making in sensitizing people 
around the world.

	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	Last week a Conservative MLA in Alberta criticized the child 
support system for producing deadbeat dads and vindictive 
leech moms. Statistics show that single custodial mothers and 
their children are the most likely group of Canadians to live in 
poverty.
<P>
	How will our government ensure parents properly support 
their children no matter where they live in Canada and no matter 
who is the custodial parent?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, within coming weeks 
the government will introduce measures that will deal with child 
support to improve the present system in three important ways.
<P>
	The first will have to do with the method by which the 
amounts of child support are determined. At present that is left 
to the uncertain and expensive process of litigation. We will 
propose that such amounts be fixed by regulation on a statutory 
guideline or formula geared to income.
<P>
	The second element has to do with the tax treatment of child 
support both in respect of the consequence for the payor and for 
the recipient. Since the budget of 1994, and indeed since the 
judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal in Thibaudeau a year 
ago, that has been a matter of both public consultation and 
careful consideration. We will be making the position of the 
government clear on the issue in the weeks ahead.
<P>
	The third has to do with enforcement because the proper 
amount with the appropriate tax calculation is meaningless 
unless the order is actually paid.
<P>
<B>(1455 ) </B>
<P>
	I am working with my colleagues, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, the Minister of Finance, the Minister 
of National Revenue and the Secretary of State for the Status of

visitor's visa to Hafsa Zinaï Koudil, an Algerian film producer 
who was scheduled to present her film, ``Le démon au féminin'', 
this week at the Festival Vues d'Afrique, in Montreal.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration justify 
rejecting the application of this Algerian filmmaker who already 
received a death sentence from fundamentalist groups because 
of her film, which precisely denounces the rise of religious 
fundamentalism in Algeria?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we received one million 
applications from people all over the world who want to visit our 
country and we accepted 85 per cent of them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is nearly impossible for anyone to be responsible for all the 
applications. They number almost one million and 85 per cent of 
them get approved. Obviously one needs some degree of 
flexibility with respect to visa officers.
<P>
	If there is something special or particular about the case I do 
not mind looking into it, but I do not want to make it a habit so 
that all visa applications are automatically reviewed by a 
minister.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I still do not understand why the application was 
rejected. I wonder how the minister can justify his officials' 
decision not to grant a visitor's visa to this filmmaker, 
considering that, last week, he himself deemed appropriate to 
deliver a minister's permit to Randall Terry, the leader of 
Human Life International, who just served a five-month jail 
sentence in the United States, which clearly makes him 
ineligible to enter Canada. Is there a double standard?

	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the 
Environment.
<P>
	Over the Easter recess a United States appeals court 
overturned its 18-year ban on the lead replacement MMT in 
automobile gasoline. It is understood that in the next short while 
the minister plans to do the exact opposite and ban the octane 
enhancer.
<P>
	What impartial evidence does the minister have that clearly 
indicates MMT is harmful to the environment?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the U.S. court of 
appeal did not deal with the substance of MMT; it dealt with the 
process.
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency of the United States 
has no intention of licensing MMT for use. We do not want to see 
Canada and Bulgaria being the only two countries in the world 
that continue to allow the particular additive, unless the Reform 
Party member would like to see the cost of Canadian 
automobiles increase by approximately $3,000, which is what 
will happen if we do not get MMT out of the Canadian gasoline 
industry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question is for the Minister of 
Industry.
<P>
	The industry minister clearly knows that the oil and gas 
industry and the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association are 
on opposite sides with respect to MMT. He knows that the only 
wise course is to bring in a neutral third party evaluator.
<P>
	How can the minister justify to the oil and gas industry that 
banning MMT without any impartial evidence is indeed harmful 
to the environment, the health of Canadians or any of the new 
cars?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted the member is aware of the importance 
of the automotive industry to Canada. He will know, for 
example, that Canadian producers account for about 17 per cent 
of automotive production in North America, whereas we only 
consume about 10 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	Key to that is uniformity of standards between the U.S. and 
Canada. The member will know that MMT is not permitted in 
the United States by legislation. It is crucial that we have 
<P>

<B><A NAME="11762"> 11762 </A></B>

uniformity of standards. The effort we put into trying to ensure

question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Prime Minister will know there is great concern across 
the country about the transfer of health and social programs, the 
transfer legislation. There is no doubt, given that federal 
funding under this legislation will end in 2005, that people are 
rightly concerned it is the end of a national health care system.
<P>
	Would the Prime Minister put a moratorium on this transfer 
and ensure that public hearings are held across the country on 
this issue?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
</B><B>Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member's 
question does not really put forward the fact that the new 
transfer payment gives the federal government a much greater 
and stronger ability to continue to ensure the basic principles of 
the Canada Health Act are maintained by consolidating the cash 
transfers under the three programs into one solid fund. It used to 
be given separately for health, education and welfare. We now 
have the continuing ability to ensure that leverage is exercised 
and to make sure the accountability under those five principles 
of the Canada Health Act and the residency requirements of the 
Canada assistance plan are maintained.
<P>
	Contrary to what the hon. member is imputing in her question, 
the transfer payment strengthens the federal ability to ensure the 
responsibility of the provinces to live up to those national 
principles.

hon. member for the question.
<P>
	In my previous answer I cited statistics that showed over 
25,000 Atlantic Canadians are now engaged in programs. Let me 
now talk specifically about real issues.
<P>
	There is a family in Newfoundland I receive correspondence 
from who have left the fishery. The father has now established 
himself through a nautical training program as a mate on the 
Irving Oil line. The grandson and their daughter, through 
training in electronics, have now become active workers in the 
local television company.
<P>
	In North Sydney there is a group working on beachfront 
development under the green project.
<P>
	Perhaps most directly, I received a letter from a gentleman in 
his mid-forties who has been illiterate since he started working 
in the fishery 20 years ago. For the first time he is able to write 
letters directly to his sons and daughters across Canada and 
communicate with them.

challenge and have the motivation to change their way of life

	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-43, an act to 
amend the Lobbyists Registration Act and to make related 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11763"> 11763 </A></B>
<P>
amendments to other Acts, as reported with amendments, and of 
Motions Nos. 22, 23, 25, 28, 29, 30, and 31.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I said there were some very recent cases that have proved 
beyond a doubt that in Canada lobbying can be excessive, 
dangerous and costly and can have an impact that is rather 
disturbing to Canadians who, for some time, have been 
demanding a bill that would regulate the activities of lobbyists 
on Parliament Hill.
<P>
	In fact, in its red book, this government promised, as we all 
know and as many have said repeatedly, to introduce a bill with 
teeth. Of course we realize that, when the bill was being 
examined, lobbyists themselves managed to get certain 
proposals eliminated from the bill, to the extent that the bill 
before the House today has no real impact on the power of 
lobbyists. There has been no real increase in transparency. That 
is what we want and what the people want. Canadians want 
assurances that lobbyists will not operate in a way that 
constitutes abuse of power or undue favouritism.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois was the party that suggested a series of 
amendments, that made recommendations for the purpose of 
improving this bill. Motion No. 22 proposes that we should have 
an ethics counsellor who is not appointed by the Prime Minister, 
as is the case now, but elected by the House of Commons. We 
suggest that the ethics counsellor should be independent and 
only accountable to the House of Commons. This is one of the 
suggestions for improving Bill C-43 and giving it some 
credibility. It was also suggested that this bill be enforceable by 
the courts, that there be disclosure of fees and meetings with 
senior officials and ministers. These are all measures to 
strengthen Bill C-43, to encourage transparency in this area 
which is, as I said, quite troublesome in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	There was the Pearson scandal. There was the case of the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage interfering in a matter handled by 
the CRTC, an agency for which he is responsible. These are all 
cases which make the public suspicious. In addition, there was 
the BST case, where representatives of the Monsanto company 
offered Health Canada officials $2 million to approve BST.
<P>
	But, in my opinion, these are just drops in the bucket, despite 
the fact that they are already very serious incidents involving 
large sums of money. But the most flagrant abuse of power was 
when the federal cabinet decided last week to intervene in a 
decision which the CRTC made, according to its own standards 
in the usual fashion, in order to favour a company owned by 
Power Corp. We know that Power Corp. has a considerable 
influence over cabinet. We know that Paul Desmarais, chairman 
of Power Corp., has close family ties with the Prime Minister of 
Canada. To me, the fact that Paul Desmarais' son André is 
married to the Prime Minister's daughter is indication enough 
that there is such potential for abuse of power that cabinet could 
even intervene in the CRTC's decisions.
<P>
	If one adds to that the fact that the Minister of Finance used to 
work for Power Corporation, that he was vice-president of 
Power Corporation, it is obvious that this company has exerted a 
powerful influence on cabinet. These are cases of abuse. It is 
reported that André Desmarais, Paul Desmarais's son, was the 
main organizer of the Prime Minister's trip to Asia last year-a 
trip which was therefore organized by representatives of Power 
Corporation, who were so influential that it is during that trip 
that the Prime Minister changed his policy toward China. Just 
imagine, lobbyists like Power Corporation can have such an 
influence that they can make the Canadian government change 
its foreign policy.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I see that my time has expired. Thank you.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again I appreciate the 
opportunity to speak on this legislation.
<P>
	I believe that the members of the Bloc are not being fair, in the 
sense that they are not explaining to Canadians some of the real 
amendments that have been made to this bill, which have 
increased transparency way beyond the previous piece of 
legislation. The member says there are no increases in 
transparency. He obviously has not read the bill.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	I would like to take a moment on this whole notion of the 
Power Corporation. Let us talk about Mr. Desmarais. I cannot 
understand why the opposition casts aspersions on people who 
have had previous experience with leaders from the business 
sector, the entrepreneurial sector.
<P>
	I have a great difficulty with that. I was in the business realm 
before I came here. I worked for a large multinational 
corporation, Magna International. As members of the House 
know, when we take a position in cabinet or as a parliamentary 
secretary and we sit down with the ethics counsellor we are 
asked about our previous lives, about our relationships. It is all 
on the public record.
<P>
	The position members of Parliament take when they are on the 
government side, when they have had a previous experience 
with an industry or a corporation that deals with government 
from time to time, is that one absents oneself from decisions 
taken that directly affect that corporation.
<P>
	If transparency and accountability are the objective of this 
bill it would seem to me that in the case of the Power 
Corporation, which the opposition has mentioned several times 
today, or the Desmarais connection, to use the member's words, 
there is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11764"> 11764 </A></B>
<P>
probably more scrutiny on that relationship than any other 
relationship in the House because it involves the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Members of the opposition are trying to insinuate that in some 
way, shape or form this bill inhibits transparency or would 
diminish the exposure or the analysis or the relationship 
between members of Parliament and their previous lives or their 
continued relationship with previous organizations. I cannot 
figure out where they are coming from. As an MP who comes 
from that background, I do not want to hide my relationship with 
my previous employer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Why should there be any worry if you have not 
done anything wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> There is no worry. It 
is on the record. It is publicly known if one goes to the registrar. 
As long as I am not in here trying to lobby the cabinet or officials 
on behalf of my previous employer, I do not see where the 
difficulty is.
<P>
	I do not understand where the members on the opposite side 
are coming from. What I find distressful about the tone and the 
approach from the members opposite is that it seems to me they 
are suggesting if we had some kind of a relationship with the 
private sector or a high profile organization we are putting 
ourselves in a position where we cannot be a member of 
Parliament where we can be above reproach.
<P>
	I expect that all of my actions in relation to my previous 
employer to be scrutinized. I expect if I have received a 
campaign fund or received moneys from my previous employer 
to promote a particular cause or whatever, I do not have any 
problem with that being analysed. The opposition is really 
missing the point. It is saying that when one has a relationship 
with a major corporation that person's ability to do work as an 
MP is questioned.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	That is a sad state. I do not want my friends in the House who 
are lawyers, doctors or from other professions to take this the 
wrong way, but we need more men and more women who have 
had entrepreneurial experience, who have had business 
backgrounds.
<P>
	With that type of experience we might be able to re-energize 
that part of our responsibility which has to do with the economy. 
When opposition members single out relationships that existed 
either in the past or in the present with corporations or 
multinationals because I either worked for them or had a 
relationship with them, it casts aspersions on that relationship in 
a way that is counterproductive to why we are all here.
<P>
	The essence of this bill has to do with increasing the 
transparency, making sure all the activities of lobbyists and 
their relationship with the government are enhanced, 
documented, that we have an ability to get a sense of how we as 
members of Parliament are being lobbied and sometimes even 
manipulated. Does this bill meet that test? I believe it does.
<P>
	We have the appointment of the ethics counsellor, a new 
creation of this government, and as time moves on that position 
will evolve and be refined. The code of conduct for MPs we as a 
committee will work on, refine and improve. We have 
committed ourselves to that process and if we continue this type 
of debate eventually the final product will be something all 
Canadians and all members of Parliament can be proud of.
<P>
	The bill goes a long way in taking us in that direction.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is a 
principle in law which says that one should always be presumed 
to be in good faith. I do not wish to use the tabling of Bill C-43 
and its amendments as an excuse to go against that principle.
<P>
	Yet, I find it somewhat strange that a government which used 
any means it could during the 1993 election, namely in the 
famous Toronto airport case, and swore left and right that once 
elected it would impose an ethics code and put some order in the 
scheming of lobbyists on Parliament Hill, I find it strange that 
this government now puts forward those concrete proposals. I 
also found that strange when the bill was introduced. I was 
among the privileged who received a short briefing the morning 
the bill was introduced. I was there with the leader of my party 
when counsellors from Justice, Industry or Commerce-I forget 
which-gave us a crash course on the bill.
<P>
	I could already see that with the title of ethics counsellor the 
government had toned down those nice principles it defended in 
its red Bible, which was probably red with shame since the 
electoral campaign. The title ethics counsellor reminds me of a 
style of politics ``à la'' Pol Martin: you have recipes for 
favouritism and political influence. As the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell said earlier, the success of that 
law depends on all members and ministers. Therefore, why not 
acknowledge their wishes and appoint an ethics counsellor by 
means of a motion in this House?
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	You know, it is quite something to have judicial 
independence. This ethics counsellor will have to make rulings 
on quasi-judicial issues. He will have to make value judgments 
about the actions of members of Parliament. He will really 
perform a quasi-judicial function. The independence of the 
courts has always been recognized, whether they are judicial or 
administrative tribunals or, as we call them, quasi-judicial 
courts.
<P>
	But the party that is now in office does not want to get 
involved in this sort of thing. It seems peculiar to me that the 
Prime Minister is the only one to whom the ethics counsellor is 
accountable, even if I do not want to assume that he would act in 
bad faith. The judicial courts judges who were supposed to be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11765"> 11765 </A></B>
<P>
charged higher parking fees in the Justice Department buildings, 
in Quebec, rose up against this practice, not long ago, giving as 
an excuse  their need for independence, their need to cut all links 
with the administration or the executive, that is, the legislative 
power.
<P>
	I did not really understand their reaction at that time, but in 
this case, it is crystal clear. The only one who will be entitled to 
appoint the ethics counsellor is the Prime Minister. The only one 
to be able to call him to account is also the Prime Minister. 
Again, he can only be dismissed by the Prime Minister. Now, I 
am told that this counsellor will be impartial, that he will not 
feel that the Prime Minister is trying to appeal to his emotions, 
depending on whether his opinions are negative or positive.
<P>
	Really, all this is nothing more than a dog's dinner. Why not 
let Parliament, the House of Commons, all of us here make the 
decision through legislation about the appointment of this 
official. There is another side to these things. During the 
campaign, the Prime Minister talked about how this scheme 
would be nice, great, pure and neat. Now he comes up with a 
piece of legislation that is not clear and is stifled by its own 
interpretation. Bill C-43 and other bills, particularly Bills C-61 
and C-62 with their infamous clauses opening the doors to 
lobbyists as never before, look like an invitation to lobbyists 
saying: ``From now on the place is wide open, come and make 
your representations''.
<P>
	Let us consider clause 9 of Bill C-62: ``The designated 
regulatory authority-'' Now we have regulatory authorities. 
Who are they? They are public servants. ``-must evaluate and 
decide whether to approve the proposed compliance plan-'' 
Let us take, for example, the candy maker who decides to 
replace white sugar with brown sugar. He comes here and talks 
to the official who buys that idea, saying it is all right. Do you 
think that a provision like this one in clause 9 of Bill C-62 does 
not represent an invitation to abuse? With those compliance 
plans, one will be able to replace anything with anything, 
anytime, anywhere.
<P>
	If that is not an invitation to lobbyists to come to the Hill and 
do their job, I do not know what it is. Bill C-61, now, is even 
worse.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> With a donation to the party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> With a donation to the party, of course. Bill C-61 
is awful. For a given violation or offence, a penalty of $2,000, 
$1,000 or $500 can be meted out, or it can be waived entirely, at 
the discretion of a public servant who will decide if we are guilty 
or not and who will assess the degree of guilt depending on 
whether we belong to the right party or have contributed or not 
to the election fund. What are we to understand? Where are 
those great values of openness which the Prime Minister and his 
colleagues advocated in 1993? Why invite criticism so 
blatantly? The government could have simply recognized that 
the amendment makes sense and realized that it was about to 
make a big mistake. Why not be open to openness? Why not 
demonstrate openly that they are what they pretend to be? No, 
that was not meant to be.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	Liberals will fight tooth and nail and stop at nothing to reject 
the amendment moved by the opposition parties concerning the 
ethics counsellor. It is already bad enough that there is only one 
counsellor. But if he is going to advise us, it would be perfectly 
normal that we appoint the counsellor or at least suggest or 
refuse nominations. All those powers are taken from us, but we 
are told the ethics counsellor will be our counsellor. Do you not 
find all this very strange? I wonder where such an attitude is 
leading us.
<P>
	When the Pearson airport issue was raised, I told the House 
that cancelling the contract would cost at least $250 million. The 
transport minister, in the House at the time, jumped from his 
seat and said: ``That cannot be. It will cost $25, $30 or $35 
million at the very most. It is unthinkable that it could cost more 
than that''. Legal proceedings have already cost us $444 million 
and the matter is not settled yet.
<P>
	No, they are always the only ones in step, like in the army, 
they are always the only ones to know the truth and to 
understand everything, especially the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell with all his phone numbers. 
They are the only ones who are right. Do you not find this 
frustrating in the long run?
<P>
	We are simply asking them-since I do not want to call them 
hypocrites because apparently it is not a parliamentary 
expression-to stop burying their heads in the sand. They are all 
for women when we debate women's issues, but they are against 
women when we talk about the budget. It is always the same 
thing. The left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. 
While the right hand was saving money, the left hand was 
putting us $600 billion in the red. That is what the Liberal Party 
is all about. We talk about the old approach and a renewed 
approach, but it is one and the same.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> It is a good thing they only have two 
hands.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Yes, it is a good thing they only have two hands, 
but they do not seem to know what to do with their two ears. 
Even if they had no ears at all, it would not change anything, 
because as much as we try to make them understand and see the 
evidence for themselves, they do not understand anything. Give 
them more hands to replace their ears and they would be happy.
<P>
	This is our tongue in cheek way of saying that this debate is 
pointless, because they have already made their beds, they 
already know where they are heading and they are not listening 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11766"> 11766 </A></B>
<P>
to what we are saying here, even though it makes sense and even 
though the public's perception of the government is at stake.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to speak to this motion, which is to 
amend the Lobbyists Registration Act.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I deplore the fact that this bill does not go far 
enough in controlling the activities of lobbyists and reinforcing 
the openness of public activities. Yet the Liberal Party made 
many promises in its red book. I ask members to take a look at 
my copy of the red book. This is what is left of it because every 
time the Liberals introduce a bill, I tear a few pages out. Since 
they never keep their promises, my copy does not have many 
pages left.
<P>
	What did the Liberals say on lobbying in the red book? They 
said: ``The lobbying industry has expanded enormously in 
Canada during the nine years of Conservative government. The 
integrity of government is put into question when there is a 
perception that the public agenda is set by lobbyists exercising 
undue influence away from public view''.
<P>
	This is obviously the case with the DirecTV project which is 
presently being debated in this House in another context. There 
are still lobbies at work. However, we do not know much about 
them; they are not registered and we did not do everything we 
should have to ensure the desired transparency.
<P>
	According to the red book, ``the cosy relationship between 
lobbyists and the Conservative regime has contributed not only 
to public cynicism about politics but also to the sense of 
americanization of Canadian government''. So they also 
insulted our neighbours. ``Serious concerns have been raised in 
the minds of Canadians about some of their political 
representatives and some of the companies and individuals who 
lobby''.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	And it goes on like that. What are the Liberals doing now that 
they are in power? They said that they would make a law on 
lobbying. So, we are checking up on them. If we look at the 
famous committee report and at the bill now before us, we can 
see that the Liberals did not take any account of what they said 
when they were in the opposition, they dismissed that 
completely and, today, they introduce a bill that, except for a 
few minor points, could have been introduced by the 
Conservatives if they had been elected instead of the Liberals.
<P>
	And yet, the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, 
who sat on the committee, said some very interesting things. 
The government did not retain a single element of the report. 
The promises have evaporated. What did our friend across the 
way, the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, tell 
us? ``I do not agree with you when you say that all that is 
unimportant, that the question of knowing how much money has 
been spent on lobbying interests neither the concerned parties 
nor the public''. So, he was in favour of the disclosure of 
revenues. But is there anything about that in the bill? No. The 
Liberal Party has forgotten  about all that. But it keeps saying 
that the mushrooming of lobbyists is a cause for concern. The 
public has a right to know who does what and to whom. And 
must we add, at what cost? All that was included in the 
unanimous report of our committee. And it came from the mouth 
of the aforementioned member.
<P>
	Another Liberal promise concerned the appointment of an 
ethics counsellor. They promised to appoint an independent 
counsellor in consultation with all parties in the House and they 
said that he or she would report to Parliament. What do we have 
in this regard in the bill before us? Again, absolutely nothing.
<P>
	That is why we are proposing amendments so that things can 
be done exactly the same way as the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell was pointing out in the 
committee report when he was a member of the opposition. 
Section 10.1 of the act says that the Governor in Council may 
designate any person as the ethics counsellor for the purposes of 
this act. So we want to change that. We want to amend clause 5 
of the bill, which amends sections 9 and 10 of the act. We want to 
replace section 10.1 by the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``10.1(1) There shall be an Ethics Counsellor who shall be appointed by 
commission under the Great Seal after approval of the appointment by 
resolution of the House of Commons.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) Subject to this section, the Ethics Counsellor holds office during good 
behaviour for a term of seven years, but may be removed by the Governor in 
Council at any time on address of the House of Commons.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) The Ethics Counsellor, on the expiration of a first or any subsequent term 
of office, is eligible to be re-appointed for a further term not exceeding seven 
years''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is the way to fulfil a promise. That is the way to correct 
the very things that the previous government was criticized for. 
That is the way to give Canadians more confidence in the 
lobbying system, which is probably impossible in today's 
politics. Bureaucracy has become so cumbersome that it may be 
necessary to have lobbyists who are able to tell us on which door 
to knock, how to knock, how to open the door, how to dress, how 
to talk, etc. That is basically what lobbyists do when they lobby 
on our behalf so that we can obtain more easily what we ask for 
as a legitimate right and not as a privilege. People must not think 
that we are against lobbying. We know it is necessary, but we 
want the rules of the game to be clear. We want the rules of the 
game to be transparent. We want the credibility and the ethics of 
this person to be solid so that people put their trust completely or 
renews their trust in the men and women in politics.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	The government had the fine idea of fulfilling its promise and 
having someone appointed by the House, who would report to 
Parliament. Unfortunately, the Liberals never carried it out. 
Mitchell Sharp was initially appointed to advise the Prime 
Minister. They ended up hiring a personal adviser. Everytime we 
asked the Prime Minister or a member of the government about 
the famous role of the counsellor, we were told that he was  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11767"> 11767 </A></B>
<P>
consulted after the fact, and it was not entirely clear that the 
advice was actually given to the Prime Minister. Finally, we 
have no idea whether this helps the Prime Minister, except that it 
costs us a fairly substantial salary, which raises questions about 
the role of this counsellor, when we give him a particular role. It 
has not, however, raised the credibility of someone who was the 
Prime Minister's counsellor.
<P>
	This is why the Bloc Quebecois is proposing this amendment. 
Despite the remarks of my colleague, which I fully support, we 
have the impression of playing opposition here. People must not 
think we are playing games. We are trying to show the 
government that points in their legislation are unacceptable and 
could be taken further. We really have to amend the policy 
somewhat in order to improve things. We are not being paid to 
do nothing. We are being paid to express the viewpoint of people 
outside government, who do not have the same focus on things.
<P>
	The government could easily agree to change certain 
amendments and even carry out some of its promises. Can you 
believe it, we in opposition want to help the government? We 
tell the government to be as good as it promised, to keep its 
promises. What more could the public want from a government 
and an opposition that work for the collective good in order to 
protect the interests of the people?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I think it is important, in considering the motions 
proposed at the report stage of Bill C-43 on lobbyists' 
registration, to go back to the definition of lobbyist. Without 
reading the definition in the dictionary, I can say that a lobbyist 
is a person who gets paid to influence government decisions to 
the benefit of his employer, who can be a person or a company. 
For example, lobbyists are hired by the Canadian Bankers' 
Association to ensure that Canadian banks do not pay more 
taxes. Employers rely on public relations experts who make 
these kinds of representations. Another example is the courier 
companies that would like to break the monopoly enjoyed by 
Canada Post and make representations to that effect to members 
of Parliament.
<P>
	We can see right away that this has a very long history. It 
involves what I would call the dark side of a politician's life. 
That is why it is very important, in dealing with this issue, to 
preserve openness so that ordinary citizens can see very clearly 
that elected officials responsible for running the government are 
free of any dishonest or undue influence. Legislation in this area 
must be very clear and there must be specific rules to ensure 
openness. The key principle is that decisions must not only be 
proper, they must also be made openly and legally without any 
undue influence.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	This has an impact not only on the quality of decisions but 
also on the quality of democratic life in any society because 
citizens who believe that parliamentarians are influenced by all 
kinds of hidden forces on which they have little control may feel 
that their role as citizens is less important than it should be and 
that they may not take part in democratic life to the extent that 
they should.
<P>
	Yet it is very important, and that is the message conveyed by 
several of the motions before us. They are designed to improve 
on this bill because, as it stands, it contains very interesting 
principles, but the wording does not go as far as it should to 
ensure the kind of transparency to be expected regarding 
lobbying.
<P>
	Take Motion No. 22 for example. It specifies that the ethics 
counsellor should be appointed by the House. The difference 
between being appointed by the House or by Cabinet may elude 
laymen. But there is a very definite difference: Cabinet 
appointees are actually appointed by people they will have to 
evaluate later on. This is totally unacceptable.
<P>
	People know full well that, in their everyday life, if they hire 
someone to keep an eye on their property and their own 
activities, they control the way this person perceives them and 
does his job because they are the ones paying him. That is why a 
high degree of transparency is required, and it is recognized in 
every parliamentary system that individuals appointed by the 
House of elected representatives have greater credibility.
<P>
	Here is a case in point: the returning officer responsible for 
the entire electoral system of a country or province. If appointed 
by the government instead of the House of Commons as a whole, 
he will certainly have less credibility. The same problem arises 
here. That is why an amendment was moved to ensure that 
appointees will truly be serving the people of Canada, not the 
government, let alone the Prime Minister. This is not a chief of 
staff or a political adviser we are hiring, but a person who will be 
able to ensure that things are done within acceptable ethical 
limits.
<P>
	Similarly, to ensure transparency, the number one criteria in 
my view when it comes to lobbying activity, we must be able to 
hold public inquiries. We all recall the example provided by the 
Prime Minister, with his personal ethics counsellor briefing him 
on such and such situation in a confidential report. We could not 
even have access to the document per se. In such case, even if 
what the Prime Minister says and the report says is true and 
accurate, because there is not a strong enough colour of fairness, 
equality and transparency, the medium becomes the message 
and, since the medium as such is not believable due to its lack of 
flexibility, no effort is made to check that the content is 
sufficiently objective.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11768"> 11768 </A></B>
<P>
	I think that it would be in the government's best interests in 
the future to recognize the need for this kind of courageous 
action. Of course, we may find out that there is abuse-nobody 
is perfect on this earth-and we will deal with this in due course. 
But in the long run, this will improve the system by ensuring that 
the public in general can assess the situation, have access to 
facts and conclusions and, therefore, be truly in control of the 
system. It is important to have an amendment to that effect and 
that it be passed.
<P>
	Another amendment deals with the tabling of the ethics code. 
Let the rules of the game finally be laid on the table. What are 
the rules and regulations? What game is this? What constitutes 
acceptable behaviour and what does not?
<P>
	In this area, this democratic society of ours, one of the most 
developed democratic societies in the world, still has a long way 
to go. It needs to get out of the dark and the slightly ambiguous 
situations we sometimes encounter, such as the whole issue of 
Pearson International Airport.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	An act on lobbyists which would clearly define the various 
situations would have two positive effects. First, it would deter 
those who might be tempted to line their pockets when they are 
not supposed to, or who might be tempted to do things more or 
less legally. Second, it would give a clear picture to everyone.
<P>
	For these reasons, the opposition must ensure that the bill will 
be the best possible piece of legislation and that it will reflect 
the objective pursued. The government seems to have forgotten 
the principles which underlie its election promises. It now has 
an opportunity to amend the bill and ensure that it accurately 
reflects the commitment made during the election campaign.
<P>
	Let us consider the ethics counsellor, for example. If the 
counsellor is appointed by cabinet, then he is actually 
designated by those whom he must monitor. This creates a 
strange situation. The person responsible for saying that a 
minister acted inappropriately in a certain situation will have 
been hired by cabinet, which includes the minister in question. 
This puts the incumbent in an impossible situation. I am 
prepared to predict that, if the bill is passed in its present form, 
problems will surface in two, three or five years, and the next 
government will have to make changes and improve the 
legislation to make it more acceptable.
<P>
	I do wonder about this bill. Why does the government not put 
more distance between itself and lobbyists? Why does it 
perpetuate the impression that governments are more or less 
puppets controlled by secret groups? What is the purpose of 
acting like that? Since becoming a member of Parliament, I have 
come to realize that lobbyists can take up my whole day. They 
can ask to meet regularly with me. They can act so as to get a lot 
of my time, through visits and meetings, sometimes at the 
expense of my constituents. Why does the government  not 
clarify the whole situation and make our lives as members of 
Parliament easier and simpler by promoting direct contact with 
the public?
<P>
	I think the answer has to do with the way that federal political 
parties are financed, and particularly the contributions made by 
corporations, including Canadian banks. Indeed, banks are 
known to make large contributions to several political parties. 
The Bloc Quebecois does not accept money from corporations, 
but the law currently authorizes such contributions.
<P>
	If our elections act allows such donations, we are sure to find 
it difficult to pass a law to enforce tighter rules on lobbying 
because the people who contribute to election funds are the ones 
who hire lobbyists. Both acts would be at cross purposes. It is 
easy to understand why this Liberal government, after making 
terrific promises in its red book, is not able to deliver the goods, 
and comes up with such a toothless bill.
<P>
	To conclude, I urge government members to examine 
carefully the proposed amendments and more particularly 
Motions Nos. 22, 25, and 19. Passing those amendments would 
give us a bill that would allow once and for all adequate control 
of lobbyists and make it clear to Quebecers and Canadians alike 
that politicians are here primarily to serve them.

	The House resumed from April 24 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-70, an act to amend the Income Tax Act, the Income 
Tax Application Rules and related acts, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. parliamentary 
secretary had approximately 10 minutes remaining. He might 
choose to elaborate on his previous intervention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate having the 
opportunity to continue to talk about the debate on tax reform.
<P>
	Something that I believe concerns all members of the House 
of Commons today is the fact that the world monetary system 
does not seem to be functioning properly. In all the major 
financial institutions, the banks, are sections where they are 
dealing with derivative funds, working around the clock seven 
days a week. The flow of capital being perpetrated right now 
affects all countries, managed by a very few men and women in 
my judgment in an unaccountable way, is one of the major 
reasons why we have these major fluctuations in interest rates 
and in exchange rates.
<P>
	When we look at all the activity around the derivatives, 
around all the speculation on the stock market, we discover that 
the amount of productivity related directly to the manufacturing 
of a product or service is very small in relation to the amount of 
speculative movement within those markets. Somebody writing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11770"> 11770 </A></B>
<P>
in the New York  <I>Times</I> the other day said that for every $1,000 
exchanged on the stock market only about $1 is related directly 
to productivity.
<P>
	The more we get into this flow of capital, the more we come 
back to the fact that our basic tax act is in need of major reform. 
This is an area where all members of the House have to come 
together to address the problem in a comprehensive way.
<P>
	This is not a partisan issue. This is an issue that affects every 
person who generates income in this country. As we all know the 
current tax system is a disincentive to productivity. The harder 
one works and the more one makes on the gross income, it seems 
that the less one has left in one's pocket.
<P>
	What we see now, whether it be an individual or a corporation, 
is the flight of capital, the flight of talent out of our country. It is 
easy today to move capital around, move companies around by 
pushing buttons but we cannot move people around.
<P>
	We are a nation. We have built one of the greatest 
infrastructures in the world in terms of promoting our quality of 
life, whether it be our health care system, our educational 
system or our social safety net. All of a sudden, these things are 
in jeopardy. They are in jeopardy not because of waste and not 
because people are abusing the system. We must eliminate the 
abuse of the system, waste and overlap. No one is debating that.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	However, we face a more fundamental problem. Because we 
are now legislators who are on our knees to the capitalist 
markets, in my judgment we are becoming less liberal in the way 
we look after some of the disadvantaged people in our 
community. We are becoming less sensitive to the whole 
purpose of why we are here.
<P>
	We come to this Chamber not to dot <I>i</I>'s and cross <I>t</I>'s, we come 
to debate ideas that will either maintain or improve the quality 
of life in the country. Right now we are not controlling the 
agenda. The people who are controlling capital flows outside of 
sovereign states are the ones who are having the most effect on 
the decisions we make.
<P>
	Our whole thrust as the House of Commons for the last 10 or 
12 years has been deficit and debt. A lot of the deficit and debt is 
exacerbated by a world monetary policy which is not working 
and ultimately by a tax system which is not working. That is why 
I feel it is very important, as I previously mentioned, that we 
change the basic tax act.
<P>
	One of the things we must be aware of is the fact that our 
neighbours to the south are starting to look at comprehensive tax 
reform in a very serious way. In fact, just before question period 
today I was handed an article which was written in the New York 
<I>Times</I> by William Safire-

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-70, an act to amend the Income Tax Act, the Income Tax 
Application Rules and related acts, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the article in the New York 
<I>Times</I> talked about the new bipartisan spirit that is sweeping the 
United States Congress right now on comprehensive tax reform. 
It talks about Republicans Dole and Kemp and Democrats 
Bradley and Gephardt all working together on this issue. I note 
the last sentence of the article, which reads: ``This 25 per cent 
solution builds on the reform that Bradley and Senate finance 
chairman Bob Packwood, Republican, worked out in the 
mid-eighties and it need not wait for a Republican president''.
<P>
	What concerns me about the fact that the United States is 
seized with this issue is that if it implements this before we do, 
then once again we will not only be following, we will lose a 
tremendous amount of investment. Some of our larger 
corporations, high achievers, income earners and entrepreneurs 
are naturally going to flow to that market where they can achieve 
more in the way they earn their incomes. Therefore, we should 
somehow figure out a way to get involved in this debate in a very 
aggressive way.

	I read a paper just before Christmas written by an economist 
from the province of Quebec by the name of Pierre Fortin. He is 
now one of the most respected economists in the province and 
one of the advisers to the Bloc Quebecois. Obviously, he would 
give strategy on its future. He may not be a close adviser but he 
is someone who is listened to by certain members of the Bloc. 
He too is advocating this type of a system.
<P>
	The best way to handle the tax act of Canada is to go right back 
to basics and flush out all the special privileges, preferences and 
loopholes. If we added up the value of all the preferences and tax 
loopholes in the last 15 years that were given to foreign 
multinationals and the top 150 companies in Canada, we would 
see that those preferences or, as some would call them, tax 
grants, would add up to close to $500 billion which is equivalent 
to almost the national debt.
<P>
	I believe it is time for us, as a country, to get involved in this 
debate in an aggressive way.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood and I must say that I was quite 
surprised because he made a very sensible and thoughtful 
speech. The problem is that he stated exactly what we have been 
saying to the finance minister and the government for the past 15 
months. As we said before, we need to review the whole 
Canadian tax system, because it is full of holes and is preventing 
us from reaching our goals and ensuring social equity 
throughout Canada, in the East as well as in the West, and a fair 
balance between what individual taxpayers and private 
corporations pay.
<P>
	So, I want to ask my colleague from Broadview-Greenwood 
why the members of his own government do not understand his 
message, which I find quite sensible? Why can he not convince 
his colleague, the Minister of Finance, of the need, indeed the 
urgency to remedy the obvious deficiencies in the Canadian tax 
system, which allow high income earners as well as big 
corporations to benefit from loopholes such as the tax 
conventions signed with some tax havens?
<P>
	Why can we not abolish these loopholes? Could it be because 
his colleague, the Minister of Finance, is both judge and judged? 
It is a well known fact that he has a fleet of vessels flying the 
Panamanian flag, a flag of convenience, and may not have the 
same interests as his colleague from Broadview-Greenwood.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the finance critic for the Bloc Quebecois for the question. It is a 
question I have been asking myself for the last two years.
<P>
	I have been campaigning on the single tax system for the past 
five years. When I started the debate I did not understand the 
complexity of the tax act and its sensitivity toward progressivity 
for seniors and families with children. We designed and 
redesigned the tax form over 30 different times in order to try 
and have something that was doable. Having said all of that I 
really do believe our last effort on this project was very close to 
something that was doable and worked for everyone.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	I like to think I have a little bit of experience in selling to my 
colleagues in this House of Commons. I have worked hard for 
the party for 15 years now. I have discovered regrettably that the 
lobby system which exists around the tax act and the Department 
of Finance is the strongest lobby which exists in Canada. The 
men and women who have lobbied for a particular tax preference 
within the 1,400 pages of the tax act are all people who believe 
in their cause. I am not saying they are doing anything 
subversive or illegal, but their ability to lobby their cause and 
add their preference to the tax act is certainly more powerful 
than mine.
<P>
	I am not alone. Other members on this side of the House 
believe in comprehensive tax reform as well. I believe that only 
when we as elected members of Parliament come together as a 
fist, rather than going in 10 different directions, will we have the 
ability to move the officials in the Department of Finance. This 
is something the elected members of Parliament put here by the 
people can do, not the unaccountable bureaucrats in finance. 
That is the challenge.
<P>
	I do not mind saying to members opposite that there are some 
days when I wonder whether I am spinning my wheels. However, 
I want members to know that I really believe if we all work 
together on this, that it is achievable. Why will it be achievable 
now? It is no different from the music industry. How did some of 
the best talent in our country make it? They went to the United 
States, made a hit and came back as superstars.
<P>
	Now both the Republicans and Democrats in the United States 
of America are looking very closely at reforming the whole 
system. We will be consistent, traditional Canadians. If they 
implement it, we will follow rather than having the guts to take 
the lead.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to applaud the member for the work he has done over 
the years on the single tax. I know he certainly understands that 
we on this side of the House support it.
<P>
	He said there are days when he feels as if he is spinning his 
wheels. I would like to ask him specifically how he felt a few 
moments ago when someone from his caucus walked into this 
Chamber in the middle of his speech and said that time 
allocation was going to be brought in on this piece of legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11772"> 11772 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member and I sat together on this side of the House 
in the last Parliament. It was deplorable then for the Tory 
government to bring in time allocation.
<P>
	Could he explain to me if he feels like he is spinning his 
wheels right now because someone just cut him off with time 
allocation? This is debate, openness and democracy? Bunk. 
Could he address that please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is a 
very tough question for me to answer. There is only one answer 
and that is the answer one believes in. I have been in opposition 
where we have had the guillotine of closure put on us. I would 
say that we did not like it.
<P>
	Let me say first that the administration of this House because 
of the legislative agenda and because we do not sit as much 
requires this from time to time. We have brought in time 
allocation or closure on bills about 10 per cent compared to the 
previous government. I think you will find, Mr. Speaker, that 
any time we have brought in closure it was in the interests of 
making sure that the administration of certain pieces of 
legislation got through the system for a very specific purpose, 
but never in terms of shutting down debate.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	We on this side of the House, and I have said this repeatedly, 
would welcome good, tough, solid debate from the opposition. 
Quite frankly sometimes we feel that the best debate we have in 
this Parliament is among ourselves. We have actually talked of 
having a good intersquad game among ourselves in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	The bottom line is that we have brought in closure less than 10 
per cent in comparison to the Tories.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
this opportunity to speak to Bill C-70. I listened to the hon. 
member for Broadview-Greenwood, and I was both amazed 
and impressed.
<P>
	I was amazed to hear a Liberal member, an experienced 
member of the House of Commons who did a very thorough 
study of the tax system in Canada, say that the tax lobby is the 
most powerful lobby in this country and that there is no tax 
reform in this country because there are powerful interests that 
do whatever is necessary to influence governments.
<P>
	I am also impressed, because I see a Liberal member who is 
swimming against the tide as he tries to advance the cause of fair 
taxation in this country. I am impressed because, considering his 
experience, he must realize that his chances of succeeding are 
very slight. Nevertheless, he belongs to a group that is 
submitting a proposal for tax reform.
<P>
	I suppose that five, ten or twenty years from now, he will 
probably still represent the riding he represents today in the 
House of Commons and will probably be making the same 
speech and say: I have these wonderful ideas. I want to reform 
the tax system, but the big  business lobby, the lobby of the 
haves in this country is so powerful that I cannot do a thing. But I 
will persevere.
<P>
	So again, I have nothing but praise for the hon. member, and I 
would urge him to keep up the good work, because it is a very 
slow process, as the hon. member for the Reform Party said 
earlier.
<P>
	The purpose of Bill C-70 is to implement certain measures 
announced in the budget of 1994, not the budget tabled a month 
and a half or two months ago but the one that was tabled 14 
months ago. Now this is a good example of an institution that 
just ambles along, without realizing that some people in Canada 
are in a hurry for tax reform.
<P>
	There are people who look at our tax system, and right now, 
they are probably finishing their income tax returns. They will 
probably file them at the last minute because, like a lot of people 
here, they owe money to the government. Taxpayers do their tax 
returns, saying to themselves: ``It seems that Canada's tax 
system is not quite what it should be''. They look at their tax 
returns, saying to themselves: ``I get very few exemptions and 
tax credits''. The people filling out their returns perhaps work 
for someone else, so evasion is not an option.
<P>
	At the same time, the same people will see in the papers or on 
certain television programs that some people in this country are 
fortunate enough to have tidy fortunes, and to, it would seem, 
not have to pay taxes or to be able to take advantage of some 
form of tax evasion scheme, like family trusts, like tax credits 
such as the research and development credit, which in some 
cases may be used for praiseworthy pursuits but in reality boil 
down to a means of not paying a fair share of taxes.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	The citizens in question who are in the process of filling in 
their tax returns may still recall the Auditor General's report last 
year, which said it was astounding that we continue to tolerate 
that Canadian income tax laws still contain certain tax haven 
provisions.
<P>
	The Auditor General asked the government to review some 
tax conventions with certain countries, which permit businesses 
that we believe to be Canadian but are registered in foreign 
countries with laxer tax laws than Canada, to avoid paying taxes. 
I hope to be able to prove, in my speech, that Canada's Income 
Tax Act is very kind to the rich, but that there are other countries 
where it is even worse, where the tax legislation is even more 
lenient for those who make profits.
<P>
	It should be noted that usually these countries are not rich 
ones, but rather countries which are struggling and belong to the 
third world. They probably benefit in some way from having 
such tax provisions. But on second thought, one realizes that 
they probably do not derive huge profits from signing these 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11773"> 11773 </A></B>
<P>
conventions. According to the Auditor General, Canada 
probably loses vast sums of money in these transactions.
<P>
	How is it that, in the bill before us today, which enacts certain 
provisions contained in last year's budget, there is no definite 
provision concerning tax havens, and tax conventions? Why?
<P>
	I believe that the speaker who addressed the House before me, 
the member for Broadview-Greenwood, answered this 
question. It is because the lobby for rich Canadians is so 
powerful that the efforts of those who strive for greater and 
clearer fairness in the tax system are being defeated by people 
with huge interests.
<P>
	The member for Broadview-Greenwood, speaking of 
eliminating privileges, loopholes, and grants in the form of tax 
breaks, even gave the figure of $500 billion. This is a huge 
amount of money. I did not do the same research as he did. I trust 
him.
<P>
	That figure tells us that maybe there is a good part of the 
federal debt that we are trying to pay off, or rather that some 
people in Canada want to pay off by going after the middle class 
and even the less fortunate, through cuts in tax credits such as 
the age credit which has been slowly decreased year after year, 
for example.
<P>
	Let us say I am happy to see that, on the Liberal side, the 
social conscience of some members is still strong enough to 
make them denounce the present situation, although the Liberal 
Party has done so before.
<P>
	In the red book, the bible of the last election campaign, they 
proposed certain measures to increase the fairness of the tax 
system, certain steps which, according to the Bloc Quebecois, 
would revive trust in the taxation system, and would make 
Canadians believe there is justice in taxes after all. But once in 
office they no longer seem to be interested in such measures.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	The speech that the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood 
gave today, he could have given it with the same result when he 
was in opposition and the Conservatives were in office.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He probably did.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caron:</B> Yes, he probably did, maybe at that time we did 
not care so much about federal politics, but I believe that we 
might have supported it at the time, supported his efforts of 
clarification regarding the tax privileges some social classes 
enjoy in Canada. The speech he made today, he could have made 
it at the time of the Conservatives and he would have had the 
same result.
<P>
	People might consider his proposition favourably, like many 
of us did when we heard about it. They might look at it and say: 
``There might be something there, maybe we could do 
something''. But next year, when we are going to talk about new 
amendments to the Income Tax Act, we will probably say the 
same thing again. There are privileges in Canada. There are 
people who do not pay the taxes they should be paying. We 
deplore it, everybody talks about it, newspapers mention it, TV 
commentators mention it, and tax experts say so too.
<P>
	The other day, a tax expert was saying that the Income Tax Act 
is so dense and contains so many exceptions that it takes an 
expert to find one's way through it. A provincial finance 
minister is even known to have said that, with our tax system, if 
a big company pays taxes, it is probably because its accountant 
is not very good.
<P>
	So, when we are faced with these kinds of situations, I think 
that we cannot limit ourselves to proposals like those in Bill 
C-70, which deals with all kinds of things that are, in fact, 
secondary. As far as the exemption is concerned, I think that it 
might be the only provision which would be somewhat sensible 
for the working class. In the case of funeral arrangements, 
people would not have to pay taxes on the interest earned on 
amounts prepaid for these arrangements.
<P>
	This is not serious. I believe that Canada is in a very difficult 
fiscal and budgetary situation. Minor improvements such as the 
ones proposed in Bill C-70 are not going to solve anything. We 
have to look once and for all at the Canadian tax system that we 
have had for the last 20 to 25 years and which has not undergone 
the reform everyone expected. Canadians are waiting for some 
kind of reform. Taxpayers, Canadians who contribute to social, 
health and education programs are ready to continue to do so, 
but they want everyone to do his or her fair share and to realize 
that taxes due must be paid. But that is not the case nowadays.
<P>
	When we consider the case of banks and big business and, as I 
said a moment ago, the whole issue of tax shelters, we see how 
outrageous the whole situation is. Some would say: ``Well, you 
are not an economist''. If, for example, we increase corporate 
taxes, we are going to lose investments. That might well be but 
very often this is a point used to scare us, to prevent us from 
taking measures which would be significant, which would be 
necessary if we want Canada to have a sound tax system, if we 
want everyone to pay taxes according to their income and to 
prevent people from being in a situation where they can avoid 
paying taxes since this is essential to the survival of this country.
<P>
	It is not just a question of saving money for all taxpayers. A 
country where taxes are not considered fair and equitable is on 
the road to ruin. A country has obligations and must have 
sufficient revenues to meet them. It has the responsibility to see 
that the revenues are there and that they come from the 
population as a whole, not only the middle class and the least 
fortunate members of our society, but also from big corporations 
and well-off families. The more fortunate members of our 
society must also pay their share of taxes because they benefit 
from the central government and from its services.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11774"> 11774 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	No business in Canada would survive if we were in a situation 
where people are opposed to a certain extent to the tax measures 
because if they are not sure that justice is the same for everyone, 
that responsibilities are the same for everyone, people will be 
less and less interested in paying taxes. They will turn more and 
more to moonlighting, thus taking away the money needed by 
government. This would lead us to disaster. That is why I call 
upon the minister-I do not know if many members did, 
although all the members of the Bloc who spoke on tax issues 
did do so-, I call upon the Minister of Finance to show more 
social understanding and to initiate a genuine tax reform. I hope 
that we, the members of the Bloc, will see such a reform while 
we are still in the federal Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the account the hon. 
member for Jonquiere has just given. I believe he has clearly 
taken into account the fact that since its election in this House 
the Bloc has never missed an opportunity to ask for a review of 
the Canadian tax system.
<P>
	We asked for the abolition of family trusts and tax havens. We 
asked for some figures that were never made available to us. We 
talked about transparency every time we had a chance to do so, 
but without great success it seems. There even were some cases 
where members on the other side and even government members 
came to the same conclusion and rose in the House on that issue. 
My hon. colleague did the same thing today, apparently not for 
the first time but once more without great success. The member 
for Gander-Grand Falls himself denounces regularly, because 
he goes to Taxation, outrageous things that occur in taxation, 
among other things people who do not pay their income tax, 
which can be huge amounts.
<P>
	I would like to ask my hon. friend if the crux of the problem is 
not the fact that we cannot discuss those problems in this House. 
The crux of the problem is the fact that people who finance 
political parties are those who decide how the government will 
act. We know that some people give astronomical amounts of 
money here. There even was a bill introduced by a member of 
the Bloc in this House, although maybe not for the first time, on 
the necessity to have a popular financing of political parties. 
The bill was rejected.
<P>
	I wonder if my hon. colleague does not believe that the saying 
according to which he who pays the fiddler picks the tune is 
relevant to political parties who, receiving huge financial 
support from banks and other important institutions, are forced 
to pass tax laws which serve the interests of these contributors 
rather than fair laws for all? I would like to know where my hon. 
colleague stands on this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I always wondered why, according 
to the Chief Electoral Officer's reports that I often read in 
newspapers, some corporations or major banks were giving 
$50,000, $100,000 or even $150,000 to the Liberal Party's or the 
Conservative Party's election fund. It has always been a mystery 
for me since, as an ex-member of a provincial party that 
promoted and adopted a bill on political party financing, I was 
used to contribute $50, $100, or maybe $300 in the good years, 
or the election years. No one of those who acted as I did were 
getting any particular benefit for their contribution.
<P>
	In particular, I have often been surprised to see that some 
corporations were giving $100,000 or $200,000. My colleague, 
the member for Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, is telling me 
why. In fact, when those people give to some party's election 
fund, they are probably expecting some benefit in exchange. But 
it may be more subtle than that. I do not think it is necessarily a 
give and take process.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	I hope that I will never see a minister of the Crown award 
contracts or give favours for money. I think that would be too 
disgusting, and it is probably not done these days, at least I hope 
not. But I think that things are done in subtle way, because the 
big corporations, the ones that contribute significantly to 
campaign funds, affirm their position in a particular milieu, that 
is the haves, the people who, in all good faith, and I do not in any 
way condemn wealth, belong to a certain social class, to a 
certain milieu, and who want that milieu to continue.
<P>
	When we hear the statement made by the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood, we realize that this milieu organized a 
lobby for itself, to make representations to the government on 
its behalf and to have members of the milieu elected to 
government. Earlier, my colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe 
mentioned that the present Minister of Finance used to own-I 
hope that it is not the case any more-a fleet of ships sailing 
under flag of convenience. That does not surprise me. The 
Minister of Finance knows the system very well, but he must 
feel in all good faith that it is a good system. If it is good for him, 
it surely must be good for every one else. So, he is perpetuating 
it.
<P>
	So, be it through election funds, through having people 
elected, or through lobbying, I think it is the same system that is 
being perpetuated, and Canadians and Quebecers have had 
enough.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais (Madawaska-Victoria, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was with much amusement that I listened 
to my colleagues in the opposition, who repeated to a large 
extent what I said in my remarks in the first days of the first 
session of this Parliament. I had said that any measure of social 
justice must also take into account the tool the government has, 
that is the tax system, and review it to increase the system's 
fairness.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11775"> 11775 </A></B>
<P>
	The proof of this government's commitment to review the tax 
system to ensure that Canadians, at least the least fortunate of 
our fellow citizens, can benefit from measures that are fairer and 
more equitable, is the reform announced by the Prime Minister 
during and after the election campaign. He promised the 
removal or the reformulation of the GST, a tax that is paid not 
once a year but every day, and a rather heavy burden for 
Canadians with low and even middle incomes.
<P>
	I think this government shows on a daily and continuing basis 
its will to ensure greater fairness at the national level and 
particularly for people living in Quebec.
<P>
	As for Bloc members, I hope they will support the government 
when we bring forward measures to ensure greater fairness in 
the tax system, and to abolish the GST, a daily form of taxation 
imposed on the population and a heavy administrative burden 
both at the federal and provincial levels.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caron:</B> Mr. Speaker, the candor of my colleague for 
Madawaska-Victoria amazes me. She spoke of an announced 
fiscal reform.
<P>
	I do not know if it has already been announced, but it has not 
been announced very loudly since the present Liberal 
government came to power. Maybe it was announced in the red 
book, but there has been nothing more than promises since then.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	But I am happy to learn, for example, that the GST will be 
abolished. I heard it would be on January 1, 1996; according to a 
few items in the papers just before Easter, the government 
announced it would not be on January 1, 1996, but maybe 
sometime in 1997, 1998 or 1999. This promised reform is 
probably similar to the promise made when the tax on income 
was introduced during the war. It was supposed to be only 
temporary. That is what they said. Since the reform was 
announced, I hope my colleague for Madawaska-Victoria's 
wish, which is shared by all Canadians, will be fulfilled and that 
the much abhorred GST will be abolished one day. But I am not 
sure that we will still be around to see it happen.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I support the main provisions of Bill C-70. They have 
obviously been written in response to difficulties that have 
arisen out of initial legislation. They are designed to make life 
easier for taxpayers, eliminate ambiguities and remove 
inequities. As such, the provisions are laudable.
<P>
	A careful study of each provision in the bill was undertaken 
by Reform research. I spent some time looking at the findings. It 
turns out the laudable attempts to make the Income Tax Act 
more equitable and efficient do not offer a perfect solution.
<P>
	Some of the new provisions conflict with principles 
developed by Reform Party assemblies where grassroots 
Reformers have the opportunity to express their views and bind 
members of caucus. Most involve technical issues and it is not 
easy to apply simple principles.
<P>
	My colleague from St. Albert yesterday in his speech on this 
bill expressed Reform's objection to specific clauses of it. I will 
not repeat his analysis. Instead, I wish to take this opportunity to 
do two things. First, I will make the case for the revision of some 
income tax changes contained in the February budget. Second, I 
will take up the challenge by the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood and discuss an alternative system for 
taxation which would eliminate the need for complicated 
income tax provisions of the sort contained in Bill C-70.
<P>
	On the first topic let me read the contents of a letter written to 
the Minister of Finance by Carol Loughrey, chair of the 
Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants of Canada. A copy 
was sent to me as a result of my involvement in the issue. This 
involvement started when I asked the Minister of Finance a 
question in the House and he gave me a very unsatisfactory 
answer.
<P>
	I have received several letters from other affected parties such 
as professionals, tax lawyers and accountants. They agree with 
the points made in the letter by Miss Loughrey and simply 
elaborate on some of the issues she raised.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	Let me now read this letter:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am writing to convey the CA profession's disappointment and concern 
regarding the announcement in the budget that individuals with business or 
professional income will be required to have a December 31 year-end. We have 
three primary concerns: the removal of the ability to use natural year-ends, an 
even more compressed workload for our members and the lack of fairness in the 
changes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Natural year-ends</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Many businesses have year-ends other than December 31 because of the 
nature of their business rather than for tax planning purposes. The tax system 
should not impose a year-end that for these businesses make no business sense. 
For example, forcing a retail business to have a calendar year-end would 
impose a significant workload increase during their busiest season and would 
impede effective measurement and evaluation of their business performance.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Where a business wished to preserve a natural year end it could do so only by 
incorporating. For businesses which can incorporate this would mean additional 
legal and accounting costs. Many professionals, including chartered 
accountants, are prevented by law from incorporating. However, even where 
the professionals are permitted to incorporate, the budget will require them to 
maintain a December 31 year-end.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The workload of many of our members is by far the greatest during the first four 
months of the year. Our members are already strained coping with the demand for audit 
and accounting services, tax return preparation, including personal tax returns 
information returns such as T4s, T5s, workers' compensation returns, payroll tax 
returns and PST and GST returns. Moving  all professional and unincorporated </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11776"> 11776 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>business year-ends, and some incorporated business year-ends, to December 31 
will add considerably to that already compressed workload. We are concerned that the 
changes will seriously limit the ability of our members to properly serve their clients 
and could turn smaller practices into seasonable businesses.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Fairness</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The budget refers to the need to improve the fairness of the tax system by 
treating professional and business income the same as employment income. 
However, there are important ways in which income from a profession or 
business is not the same as income from employment. Professionals and business 
people assume risk by gathering business capital and investing in their business, a 
task that will be more difficult without the tax deferral; they lease or purchase a 
business location and business equipment; they employ others; they must protect 
against liability; they must carry on their business without benefit of 
unemployment insurance or protection against disability or severance. A fair tax 
system should recognize that the self-employed are not the same as employees 
and that they should not be treated the same.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We are also concerned about the fairness of the transitional provisions. We 
believe they are too restrictive and will impose an unfair tax burden. It would 
appear that the ten-year reserve will not be available in certain situations, such 
as where an individual changes firms or changes from being a partner to sole 
proprietor or vice versa. The loss of this reserve in such circumstances would be 
inequitable and would create a barrier to the natural movement of individuals, 
interfering with their ability to carry on their business or practice as they see fit 
or as conditions require. Furthermore, it is unfair that the income to be included 
over the transition period is to be taxed at the individual's highest marginal tax 
rate rather than the average rate and that individuals could lose one year of 
eligibility to make RRSP contributions. We believe that the fairness of these 
measures could be improved through additional transitional measures.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Finally, it is very troubling that the changes are retrospective. We are already 
within the 1995 fiscal calendar year-the changes will have a real and harmful 
impact on taxpayers who had arranged their affairs in accordance with the law 
as it stood before the budget.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In the last few minutes I have been reading a letter which had 
been sent to the Minister of Finance by the institute of chartered 
accountants.
<P>
	I fully agree with the technical assessment of the problems 
with the budget provisions identified in this letter and urge the 
Minister of Finance to make the changes in the Budget 
Implementation Act to correct the inequities and the 
inefficiencies created by this action.
<P>
	I want to add the following political judgment which people 
like the writers of this letter cannot express but probably agree 
with.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance justified his budget measures as a 
step for greater equity. We all know equity is in the eyes of the 
beholder. The letter I read referred to the difficulties that arise 
from the arbitrary lumping together of employment and 
self-employment income which is used to make this equity 
argument. I agree this is rather arbitrary.
<P>
	However, my main additional argument is this provision is 
simply a one time tax grab motivated by the desire to raise 
revenue, lower the deficit and avoid the need for spending cuts. 
The people of Canada in their taxpayer rallies and even in their 
presentations to the finance committee of the House made it 
abundantly clear they preferred spending cuts over tax increases 
to eliminate the deficit. Reformers agreed.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance thought he could raise taxes on what 
he considered to be a relatively small group of professionals by 
justifying the tax grab to the general public as a measure of 
increasing equity.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	The minister may have underestimated both the strength of 
the opposition from the affected professionals and their 
accountants and tax advisers. I hope he takes note of the 
legitimate objections I have raised.
<P>
	As an economist I see these objections as quantifiable costs 
that need to be examined in relation to the value of the one time 
tax revenue increase. I am convinced the ratio of social costs to 
benefits makes this tax provision one of the least efficient 
alternatives for raising revenue and more broadly eliminating 
the deficit.
<P>
	As I noted already, Bill C-70 stands in support of the widely 
accepted view that Canada's tax system is too complicated. The 
readjustment of accounting years for professionals just 
discussed is only another example.
<P>
	Every country's tax code becomes more complex every year. 
Inequities and inefficiencies of the existing code have to be 
corrected. Dynamic new developments in the economy and 
financial intermediations require adjustment. There are 
developments abroad that need to be reflected.
<P>
	Every country periodically faces the need for a major 
overhaul of its tax code when the complexity has become so 
large that it threatens to strangle incentive, drown the private 
sector in red tape and divert too many of the country's best and 
brightest accountants and lawyers into activities which 
essentially are socially unproductive.
<P>
	I believe, much like the member for Broadview-Greenwood, 
Canada has reached this stage. There are several members of the 
Reform caucus, in particular my colleague from Calgary Centre, 
who strongly support such efforts.
<P>
	The proposed overhaul of Canada's tax code should be aimed 
at the creation of what alternatively has been called a flat or 
proportional tax, a single tax. An intensive study of such a new 
tax system should start now, not just because of the excessive 
complexity of Canada's tax code but, more important, because 
of new developments in the United States.
<P>
	To make this point I cannot do better than read from a <I>Globe 
and Mail</I> editorial from April 24, 1995, unsigned:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11777"> 11777 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There is a time bomb ticking under the Canadian welfare state. It is not the 
debt, nor the aging of the population, though these are threats enough. It is the 
coming revolution in the U.S. tax system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Already, several large northeastern states have embarked on radical tax 
cutting programs. Now leading federal politicians in Congress and on the 
presidential campaign trail are promising not just to overhaul the federal 
income tax but to abolish it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Dick Armey, leader of the Republican majority in the House of 
Representatives, is pushing the most moderate-relatively speaking-reform 
plan, a flat tax that would eliminate most deductions and credits in favour of a 
single low tax rate for everybody. Mr. Armey figures it is possible to get the rate 
down to 20 or even 17 per cent this way without running up the deficit. The tax 
form would be the size of a postcard.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The immediate objection to this is that it would kill progressivity: that is, the 
principle that richer people should pay a larger share of their income in tax. But 
rising marginal tax rates are not the only way to make the system progressive; 
you can also do it through the tax base. Mr. Armey's plan would exempt roughly 
the first $20,000 of individual income from tax. Someone earning $25,000 
would pay Mr. Armey's 20 per cent flat tax on only one-fifth of his income, for 
an effective tax rate of 4 per cent. At $40,000, he would pay tax on half his 
income, for an effective tax rate of 10 per cent. At $100,000, the effective rate 
would be 16 per cent.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I have enough time to conclude with another excerpt:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Too radical? Dreamsville? Think again. Not only do the Republicans control 
both houses of Congress, but all of the GOP candidates for president have 
endorsed one or other of these proposals. This has enormous significance for 
Canada. We do not have to slash tax rates to U.S. levels. But we do have to stay 
within hailing distance. At 17 per cent, U.S. personal income tax rates would be 
a half to a third of the top combined rate in Canada. Indeed, a flatter, simpler tax 
system would be desirable in its own right. At the least, it would free some of the 
brightest minds in the country, now employed as tax lawyers and accountants, 
for more productive work.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	I would like to end my quotations here, except to mention that 
the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood is mentioned by 
name in this editorial, and I congratulate him.
<P>
	I would like to make a couple of comments in closing. Please 
note that in my short remarks I do not endorse the particular 
version of a flat tax described in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> editorial or 
advanced by the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood or by 
my colleague from Calgary Centre. The reason is, as is the case 
with many appealingly simple ideas, there are devils in the 
details and there is a danger that advocates of policies end up not 
telling quite all. For this reason, I urge the immediate start of a 
major study of the proposals for a simplified flat tax system.
<P>
	During the study and public hearings on the subject I think it 
will become immediately obvious that the widespread support 
for such a measure is based on false assumptions. Few people, if 
asked, will object to a new system that promises to lower their 
tax rate from the present high one. Often quoted are the marginal 
tax rates  on incomes in British Columbia, which are now around 
53 per cent for the federal and provincial rates combined. The 
most important false assumption is that the lower flat rate, 
normally discussed in this context, is deceptively low. In the 
Canadian system every federal rate will automatically be 
increased by about 50 per cent due to the provincial income tax 
laws, even if the provinces also adopt a flat tax system.
<P>
	The second and perhaps most fundamental point is that 
Canada's fiscal problems stem from overspending. Based on 
reliable estimates, the combined spending of all governmental 
jurisdictions equals about one-half of our national income. That 
is why tax freedom day falls in July.
<P>
	The government has to raise the revenue to pay for this 
spending. As it does, by definition, the average tax burden on the 
average Canadian will remain about 50 per cent of his or her 
income. No tax reform can alter this basic fact. People who are 
seduced into believing otherwise by the promise of a flat rate, 
much lower than the current marginal rate they pay, have to face 
the fact that the government has to get its revenue somewhere. 
Most likely, it will get it from exactly the same people and in the 
same amounts as it does now. There are no large hidden incomes 
that will be tapped by the flat tax and there are no magic 
solutions to the problem of overspending.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to note that the idea of a flat tax has been 
around for a long time. It once served as a basic model for 
reform in the United States and in Canada in the 1980s. As it 
turned out, by the time all of the trade-offs between efficiency 
and equity were studied thoroughly, both countries ended up 
with modified flat tax rates; that is, three broad tiers and 
relatively small marginal increases rather than the previous 
scale with many incremental steps and very high ultimate 
marginal rates. The idea that basic personal exemptions result in 
progressive average rates, as noted in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
editorial, did not carry the day during the deliberations in these 
two countries. I am worried that it may also not do so in the 
future if we have hearings again.
<P>
	These and the other concerns I have about the merit of a flat 
tax do not mean that the system should not be studied. The hope 
of eliminating the kinds of complex tax codes contained in Bill 
C-70 make it very worth while. In the meantime, I urge the 
proponents of the tax to be cautious in their advocacy, much as I 
have done in the past and in my brief discussion today.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before proceeding to 
questions and comments to the hon. member for 
Capilano-Howe Sound, it is my duty, pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake-the environment; 
the hon. member for Don Valley North-human rights.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11778"> 11778 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the member 
for Capilano-Howe Sound for entering the debate on 
comprehensive tax reform.
<P>
	I accept his note of caution when he spoke about overstating 
the accomplishments of a single tax. I think the member forgot 
to mention three very important fundamentals that would be 
achieved by a simple, fair, and efficient tax system. We always 
stated that the provincial rate would be added on to the federal 
rate, but I think there are three additional advantages the 
member did not cite.
<P>
	First, I believe that a simplified fair tax system where 
everybody is in the loop would reduce the underground 
economy. I think one reason we have an underground economy 
in such an exacerbated state right now is because our tax system 
has driven people underground. A simplified and fair tax system 
would reduce the underground economy, which would add more 
revenue to the treasury.
<P>
	The second issue that is fundamental to the system of a single 
tax system deals with what is happening in Hong Kong. They 
have a form of a single tax system over there, and it creates large 
pools of capital. When large pools of capital come into a country 
it puts downward pressure on interest rates. That downward 
pressure on interest rates means that capital is less costly for 
governments when they borrow it, which deals with the revenue 
or expenditure problem. It is also less costly for 
entrepreneurship. I believe that one thing entrepreneurship 
needs right now is cheaper capital and lots of it. That in turn 
would create an environment for investment and job creation. So 
the single tax has a direct impact on flows of capital, which 
would put downward pressure on interest rates.
<P>
	The third thing the member did not touch on in his address on 
tax reform has to do with productivity. With a fair tax system I 
believe people would work harder and smarter and therefore the 
cost of goods would go down, which would help our exports 
tremendously, which would increase the bottom line, not only in 
business but in corporate tax revenues to the treasury also.
<P>
	The member did not deal with those three specific features, 
which are part and parcel of the single tax system. Since the 
member is an economist, I wonder if he would consider they 
would be valid premises to work on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to respond to those 
ideas. Clearly, I did not have enough time to go into all the 
advantages.
<P>
	I have attended several conferences on the subject of the 
underground economy. The high marginal tax rate certainly has 
an effect on it, but the emphasis recently has been on the role of 
the GST. Clearly, they interact, but it would help.
<P>
	On the other hand, I have been quite convinced by evidence 
that was educed about the size of the underground economy and 
especially by some simulations made by the Ministry of 
Finance. It turns out that while it looks like it is very big, it 
really probably is no more than about 5 per cent of national 
income. However, this is not the time to discuss that. Maybe we 
could do it some other time.
<P>
	On larger pools of capital, I can give a personal view, which is 
not a Reform Party position. Long before I was a member of 
Parliament I used the idea in my lectures that if I were in charge I 
would lower the capital gains rate and the rate on corporations in 
Canada to 5 per cent and I would make Canada the Switzerland 
of North America. I have speculated that probably we could 
have had so much capital flowing in, especially during the 
period of the cold war, when we were under the protection of the 
Americans, that the revenue raised at 5 per cent would have been 
grater than the revenue we raise at our high rates at the moment. 
I think Americans are thinking about that as well. I am sure that 
if the Americans are going to lower their tax rate on corporations 
and we do not follow we will have exactly the opposite problem 
of what the hon. member is talking about.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	The issue in a strictly economic seminar is an 
oversimplification, in a way, in today's world of integrated 
capital markets. Money is flowing in at essentially a risk 
adjusted rate where we can borrow as much as we want to. Our 
problem is that we are not saving enough.
<P>
	To the extent that the lower tax rates on income would lower 
the incentive to consume and would encourage savings, we 
would probably lower the interest rate marginally. However, 
that would not be the main effect. Nevertheless, I appreciate that 
the member has called my attention to the idea that there is this 
effect on capital markets.
<P>
	Finally, he noted that productivity would increase. Indeed, 
most people agree that the high marginal tax rates on income and 
on capital have led to distortions in the decisions of individuals 
in the allocation of their time between effort and work, between 
savings and investment, which overall have resulted in a 
lowering of productivity. It is therefore agreed widely about the 
direction in which the incentives would go by lowering the 
marginal tax rates. There is little doubt about this encouraging 
more work, discouraging leisure, encouraging more savings and 
discouraging consumption. That would be all to the good.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11779"> 11779 </A></B>
<P>
	The problem is that econometric estimates of those effects are 
extremely difficult. Nobody really has been able to prove that 
there would be such a very large effort. I think the conclusion 
has been that the main effect of the high marginal tax rates on 
income and capital in the past has been to change the allocation 
of resources, which leads to distortions, which are essentially 
costly to society.
<P>
	Being a little bit cautious about this point does not mean that I 
reject the hon. member's suggestion. I think it should be 
considered as another plus of us studying and perhaps ultimately 
adopting a simplified, open, and cheap new flat tax system.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am happy to have this opportunity to participate in the debate on 
Bill C-70, an act to amend the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	The bill seeks to implement a number of measures that were 
introduced in 1994 budget, along with certain measures that 
have been announced by the government at other times over the 
last year.
<P>
	The fiscal challenge facing this country has been a topic of 
considerable debate, both in the House and across the country. 
Few dispute the scope of the challenge. Few dispute that 
difficult choices must be made. Few dispute that we must act 
decisively. As well, few dispute that fairness and effectiveness 
must be essential guiding principles of any and all steps that are 
taken to overcome our deficit challenge.
<P>
	These principles have guided the government as we have 
worked to restrain our spending. They guided the minister in 
crafting the budget that was presented in February. However, for 
the moment and for a discussion of this legislation, let me take 
hon. members back to the budget of last year.
<P>
	Spending cuts alone could not deliver the deficit reductions 
that were set out at that time. Spending constraints had to be 
complemented with some measures on the tax side. Doing so 
was simply a question of fairness. It was our vision of fairness 
that guided us as we looked at the tax system, addressing 
unsustainable tax preferences instead of imposing general tax 
increases on Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	In looking at the corporate tax regime, we sought to ensure 
that corporations paid their fair share of the tax revenues needed 
to fund government programs and to prevent certain businesses 
or sectors from taking undue advantage of certain tax 
provisions.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	With this in mind the budget last year proposed a number of 
measures to the rules governing the taxation of business income. 
Let me stress our goal was not to penalize the business sector, 
nor to impede the competitiveness of Canadian corporations. 
We believe it is essential to maintain a competitive tax system in 
today's global economy.
<P>
	We cannot disregard and we do not disregard the role of 
business in creating and sustaining employment; nor do we 
ignore the pressures faced by Canadian companies as they 
operate in fiercely competitive markets both at home and 
abroad.
<P>
	One fairness issue the budget addressed was the tax rules 
dealing with debt forgiveness and foreclosures. Under the old 
provisions of the income tax, many transactions involving the 
settlement of debt were not recognized in any meaningful way 
for tax purposes. The new rules provide a comprehensive basis 
to deal with debt settlement. In general they provide that 
forgiven debt amounts will be applied to loss carry forwards and 
expenses or partially included in the debtor's income. However, 
there are special relieving rules to minimize undue hardship 
from these new rules.
<P>
	Let me turn now to the tax treatment of securities held by 
financial institutions. Until now the Income Tax Act has not 
provided specific rules regarding the tax treatment of such 
securities. The measures proposed in this bill seek to reduce 
uncertainty in this regard and also to ensure the income derived 
from such securities is measured appropriately.
<P>
	The amendments provide that certain securities be marked to 
market; that is, the appreciation or depreciation in their value 
each year must be recognized in that year. In keeping with our 
goal of fairness, the amendments include a transitional rule that 
allows increases in income resulting from the new rules to be 
spread over five years. These new measures are generally 
effective after February 21, 1994.
<P>
	In addition, new rules are provided for debt securities not 
required to be marked to market. These rules deal with the 
measurement of income while the securities are held and the 
treatment of gains and losses on disposition.
<P>
	Bill C-70 also amends the rules for the taxation of resident 
shareholders of foreign affiliates. This action is being taken as a 
result of the government's ongoing monitoring of developments 
in this area. The changes expand the categories of income of 
foreign affiliates which must be reported as income of their 
Canadian affiliates.
<P>
	Another modification prevents the use of an affiliate's foreign 
active business losses to reduce Canadian shareholders' income. 
This change protects the shareholders but also protects the 
Canadian tax base. The amendments are generally effective for 
taxation years commencing after 1994.
<P>
	Let me turn now to six other tax measures announced during 
the months after the 1994 budget. First, this bill addresses the 
issue of eligible prepaid funeral and cemetery arrangements. 
That is I have heard from my constituents about. Under this 
legislation individuals making such arrangements will not have 
to declare interest on the deposits up to a $15,000 maximum 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11780"> 11780 </A></B>
<P>
contribution as income provided the deposit is not withdrawn 
for other purposes. The provider of eligible  funeral and 
cemetery arrangements is, however, required to include in 
income the total amount received from the eligible arrangement.
<P>
	Turning to the next measure, the bill proposes real estate 
trusts with publicly traded units be allowed to qualify as mutual 
fund trusts. This measure responds to representations from the 
real estate sector, which is interested in expanding the available 
methods of financing real estate. We believe the proposed 
change will facilitate the restructuring and refinancing of this 
sector.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	The third of these post-budget measures is the measure that 
will help mutual funds reduce overhead costs and improve 
service to investors. These amendments allow mutual fund 
corporations to convert to mutual fund trusts on a tax free basis 
and also allow tax free mergers of mutual fund trusts.
<P>
	The bill also proposes new rules to speed the resolution of 
objections and appeals, particularly by large corporations. 
Large corporations will now have to specify the issues under 
dispute, the amount of relief sought and the facts and reasons for 
objecting.
<P>
	Those of us who speak on the public accounts committee are 
well aware of the tremendous losses that can be incurred to the 
Canadian taxpayers by cases that go on far too long without 
enough rules to constrain the matters that can be brought into 
those cases.
<P>
	The rules also limit the ability of large corporations to raise 
new issues in the notice of objection where the objection relates 
to a reconsideration of an assessment. However, new issues 
raised by Revenue Canada on such reconsiderations may still 
give rise to notice of objection.
<P>
	We are trying to be fair on both sides without unduly exposing 
the Canadian taxpayers to risks through prolonged court cases 
on interpretation of tax legislation.
<P>
	In addition, this legislation will ensure the new requirements 
relating to notices of objection will not apply to assessments 
appealed to court before this legislation receives royal assent. In 
other words, we are not changing the rules retroactively which I 
think everyone would agree is only fair.
<P>
	The final measure I want to highlight deals with the tax 
treatment of dividend compensation payments and other 
amounts connected with securities lending. The Income Tax Act 
currently provides that the lender of securities not be treated as 
having disposed of the security under these arrangements. As 
well, payments to the lender as compensation for dividends are 
treated as dividends in the lender's hands.
<P>
	While these dividend compensation payments are generally 
not tax deductible, a special rule established in 1989 allows 
security dealers to deduct two-thirds of such payments. This 
legislation extends the use of the two-thirds rule, ensuring our 
securities industry remains competitive.
<P>
	However, the deduction of these payments will be somewhat 
limited and I can assure hon. members the government will 
continue monitoring these measures to make certain they 
operate effectively.
<P>
	Other changes clarify the effects of certain dividend rental 
arrangements and the means of securities dealers registered or 
licensed to trade in securities for purposes of the Income Tax 
Act.
<P>
	In closing, Bill C-70 amends the Income Tax Act equitably 
and fairly. It seeks to better target tax assistance delivered to 
certain business sectors while at the same time broadening the 
tax base and thus protecting government revenues and, as we all 
know, that means the revenues of Canadians. The legislation 
contained in this bill also clarifies a number of important issues 
related to the act.
<P>
	In considering the measures before us I have no hesitation in 
encouraging all hon. members to support the bill at this stage so 
that measures announced by the government during the last year 
can become effective to the benefit of the tax system and to the 
benefit of Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
before I get into this subject any further, in the limited time at 
my disposal, I must take a moment to situate this bill. Bill C-70 
implements measures from the budget, last year's budget, that 
is. It was tabled at first reading before this year's budget. It is a 
series of fairly technical measures, highly complex ones true to 
the image of today's tax system. We will be examining these 
measures further in committee, so I will spare you all the details.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	One measure was the focus of discussions before and after the 
elections and within the Liberal Party and has been raised by the 
Bloc Quebecois as well since the elections. It is the whole issue 
of foreign affiliates, commonly known as tax havens, raised by 
the Auditor General. This fairly voluminous bill contains 
various measures. A number are indeed positive. However, it 
does not go very far and it skirts a number of issues. This could 
be called a timid reform, which enables the government to say 
that it has satisfied some of the Auditor General's requests, but 
it does not go far enough. There is no mention of the list of 
countries with which we have tax agreements. Sixteen countries 
are listed as having agreements deemed to be sources of 
problems.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11781"> 11781 </A></B>
<P>
	The aim of tax agreements is to avoid or enable businesses to 
avoid double taxation. This is laudable and understandable. The 
problem arises when different countries have different tax rates. 
At this point we start talking about fickle businesses. They 
produce in various countries, sell their products from one 
business to another and with the cost transfers, manage to switch 
profits and losses between countries. This causes problems 
because profits are transferred to places with the highest rate of 
taxation and losses can be deducted in others.
<P>
	And then you have countries like Canada, where interest 
charges are allowable expenses. This makes matters worse and it 
is an extremely complex task to tackle corporations with 
operations in several countries. Slightly higher, stricter 
standards are set for them, to determine whether they are really 
producing, but the fact remains that it is not easy to figure out, 
particularly when rates vary widely. So, there is a need to look 
seriously into this and not in a piecemeal fashion as it has been 
the case for a while now.
<P>
	This brings to mind the whole Liberal approach to taxation. 
When they were in opposition and during the election campaign, 
the Liberals used to say that the way to deal with taxation was 
not piecemeal but comprehensively. So far, not much has been 
done in this respect. A piecemeal approach continues to be 
applied to very technical, complex issues. Sometimes positive 
measures are taken. Still, they miss the main point, that is to say 
streamline the whole system, make the tax system less complex 
and easier to understand, which furthers the goal of transparency 
and restores people's confidence in their institutions and elected 
representatives, particularly as regards this trust that was lost.
<P>
	I wish to take this opportunity to draw a parallel with a tax 
matter on which the government made a rather clear 
commitment, namely to do away with the goods and services 
tax. If you think back a little, originally, when this legislation 
was first passed, it was fiercely opposed by the Liberals in this 
place, the other place and everywhere. They opposed it even 
more strongly in the days and months that followed, going as far 
as promising, during the election campaign, to replace it within 
two years, that is to say by January 1, 1996, eight months from 
now. But there is no concrete proposal on the table yet. 
Considering how long it takes to develop and draft this kind of 
document and how quickly the GST was implemented, causing a 
great many problems, it is safe to assume that the government 
will be unable to honour and fulfil its commitment in the next 
eight months. Furthermore, this is another reform characterized 
by a piecemeal approach.
<P>
	I will get to elaborate further on this subject in the second part 
of my remarks, to be continued when debate is resumed. I just 
want to say for now that this bill contains some good measures, 
which we will consider in committee. There is one in particular 
that we will  consider thoroughly and it deals with foreign 
corporations. But we will do so bearing in mind that this 
piecemeal approach must end. A more comprehensive approach 
to taxation must be taken.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I declare Motion No. 1 
lost.
<P>
	The next question is on Motion No. 2. A vote on this motion 
also applies to Motions Nos. 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 24, 26, 27, 32 
and 33. An affirmative vote on Motion No. 2 obviates the need 
for a vote on Motions Nos. 3, 15, 16, 17 and 18 but necessitates a 
vote on Motion No. 11. A negative vote on Motion No. 2 
necessitates a vote on Motions Nos. 3, 11 and 16.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think you would find unanimous 
consent for the members who voted on Bill C-69 to be recorded 
as having voted on the motion now before the House in the 
following manner with Liberal members voting nay.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>]

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The next question is on 
Motion No. 22, in Group No. 4. An affirmative vote on Motion 
No. 22 obviates the need for a vote on Motion No. 23. A negative 
vote on Motion No. 22 necessitates a vote on Motion No. 23.
<P>
	Order, please. I hear comments regarding Motion No. 21. That 
motion was already put and agreed to.

Order Paper.
<P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INTERPRETATIONACT">INTERPRETATION ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP)</B> 
moved that Bill C-254, an act to amend the Interpretation Act 
(convention on the rights of the child) be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to bring forward this 
bill on behalf of all Canadian children. It amends the 
Interpretation Act to provide that every act of Parliament shall 
be construed and applied as not to abrogate, abridge or infringe 
any of the rights recognized in the convention on the rights of 
the child. It is as close as a private member's bill can come to 
introducing a children's bill of rights.
<P>
	At the World Summit for Children, held at the United Nations 
in 1990, 71 world leaders, the largest gathering of world leaders 
ever, discussed actions that could better the lives of children 
throughout the world. As a result of that summit, the United 
Nations developed the convention on the rights of the child 
which Canada ratified on December 13, 1991.
<P>
	I am proud to say that Canada took an active role in the 
summit and in helping to develop the convention which provides 
us with a set of standards that confirms the respect our society 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11794"> 11794 </A></B>
<P>
gives its youngest and most vulnerable and recognizes that they 
need special safeguards and care.
<P>
<B>(1840 ) </B>
<P>
	Responsibility for implementing the rights set out in the 
convention is shared by federal, provincial and territorial 
governments. International human rights conventions, even if 
ratified by Canada, do not automatically become part of 
domestic law. Canadian courts do, however, frequently refer to 
them in interpreting and applying domestic law and, in 
particular, in interpreting and applying the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	This private member's bill, if passed, would require the 
Government of Canada to interpret all legislation in harmony 
with the UN declaration on the rights of the child, which, as I 
say, Canada was instrumental in engineering. Essentially 
Canada's laws will comply with the convention.
<P>
	Canada must continue to be a leading force in protecting 
children's rights both at home and around the world. In order to 
do that we must ensure that our international commitments are 
treated seriously and that federal legislation complies with the 
convention that the government signed on behalf of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	The world summit and the convention were both predicated 
on the notion that children should have first call on the nation's 
resources in both good times and bad. In other words, Canada 
and the other countries that signed the convention should put 
children first at all times.
<P>
	A year before the summit, in November 1989, the House 
debated a motion in the following words:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House express its concern for the more than one million Canadian 
children currently living in poverty and seek to achieve the goal of eliminating 
poverty among Canadian children by the year 2000.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The motion was unanimously passed by the members of the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	At that time there were approximately 956,000 children under 
the age of 18 living in poverty. The subcommittee on poverty 
proceeded some time after that to address the problem, but did 
nothing very much to improve the situation of child poverty.
<P>
	Looking at the shocking reality of what has happened since, 
the situation has worsened. Recently, Statistics Canada showed 
that in 1993 child poverty reached a 14-year high, despite the 
fact that the Canadian economy had made a modest recovery. In 
1993 almost 1.5 million Canadian children, which is one in five, 
lived in some deprivation. Many of these children live not just in 
poverty, but are very poor. Clearly that is unacceptable. With 
only five years left until the year 2000 it is clear that the 
government must move quickly or the 1989 House of Commons 
resolution will be nothing more than empty words.
<P>
	Last year I tried to move the same motion but was refused 
support from at least the Reform Party and possibly others. In 
other words, we have regressed in terms of our commitment to 
Canadian children since 1989.
<P>
	The bill would go a long way to ensuring that the issue of child 
poverty and children's rights will be addressed. However, it will 
do more. It will ensure that the nation's children should always 
be put first, that they will be given the protection and assistance 
they need in order to grow to become happy, healthy and 
productive adults. It will enforce the concept that Canadian 
children be free from exploitation and abuse; that government 
action should be interpreted with regard to children in the best 
interests of the child; that children should have access to child 
care, health care and a standard of living that, at minimum, 
meets basic needs; and that disabled children should receive the 
same level of dignity and opportunity as other children.
<P>
	If we are going to put words into action, if we are going to do 
anything other than spout empty words, it is vital that the 
commitments which Canada has made on behalf of its children 
to the world community are enforced by the government.
<P>
	I would like to refer to some of the provisions and point out 
some of the problems that are faced in Canada with regard to the 
international commitment made when the UN convention was 
signed and when Canada committed itself to ensuring that 
children have the first call on resources.
<P>
	A provision in article 6 says that Canada and other nations 
shall ensure, to the maximum extent possible, the survival and 
development of the child. Canada has 1.5 million children living 
in poverty. Clearly we are a long way from recognizing and 
enforcing the commitment which we made to our children and to 
the world economy. Article 17 of the convention talks about 
education, clearly a core element in the development of our 
children.
<P>
<B>(1845 ) </B>
<P>
	In that article there is provision that Canada and other nations 
encourage the production and dissemination of children's 
books. After many attempts in the last Parliament to remove the 
GST from children's books, which the last government 
recognized as being detrimental to educational expectations, 
that GST still remains on books and this government has done 
nothing to reduce it. There are measures we can take there to 
ensure that the commitment we made with regard to education 
and the dissemination of education can be met.
<P>
	In article 18, Canada and all other nations agreed to take all 
appropriate measures ``to ensure that children of working 
parents have the right to benefit from child care services and 
facilities for which they are able''. We have seen the reneging of 
commitments with regard to child care, commitments that were 
in the red book. Over the years we have seen a clear derogation 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11795"> 11795 </A></B>
<P>
on the part of  the Government of Canada to respond in a critical 
way for the protection and benefit of children as well of course 
for those parents who need to work in order to maintain their 
families. With regard to child care, the government clearly is 
also not responding to the spirit and words of the convention.
<P>
	Canada also agreed to take all appropriate legislative, 
administrative, social and educational measures to protect 
children from all forms of physical and mental violence, injury 
or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or 
exploitation, including sexual abuse. The cuts to social 
programs, which continue under this government in spite of the 
aggressive opposition to the same cuts when this government 
was in opposition, mean that we cannot effectively say that we 
are responding positively to this provision of the convention 
either. We are not taking all appropriate legislative, 
administrative, social, and educational measures to protect 
children in this way. Indeed, we are going backwards.
<P>
	There are special provisions in article 23 to respond to the 
special needs of disabled children. In particular, it indicated that 
we commit ourselves to assistance that will be designed to 
ensure that the disabled child has effective access to and receive 
education, training, health care services, rehabilitation services, 
preparation for employment and recreation opportunities in a 
manner conducive to the child's achieving the fullest possible 
social integration and individual development, including his or 
her cultural and spiritual development.
<P>
	We all know from our own experiences across this country 
that we are far from responding positively to the needs of 
disabled children.
<P>
	In article 24 we have a commitment to recognize the right of 
the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
health and to facilities for the treatment of illness and 
rehabilitation of health. This government once again follows the 
Tories in cutting funding to health care, clearly making it more 
and more difficult for children to receive access to the highest 
attainable standard of health care, which this country committed 
itself to providing. Again, we are in breach of this convention.
<P>
	In regard to the pursuit of health care facilities for children, 
we agreed to combat disease and malnutrition, including within 
the framework of primary health care. Clearly, with 1.5 million 
children we have not addressed the concerns of malnutrition. 
Indeed, as those numbers increase we make it clear that we are 
going backwards rather than forward.
<P>
	With regard to social programs, Canada and the other 
countries recognized for every child the right to benefit from 
social security, including social insurance, and to take the 
necessary measures to achieve the full realization of this right. 
Once again, we have not responded to that obligation. We have 
been cutting social programs at the federal level, and many 
provinces have also cut their social programs, I might add, 
although not the provinces  of Ontario, Saskatchewan, and 
British Columbia, which are NDP provinces.
<P>
	With regard to article 27, we agreed to recognize the right of 
every child to a standard of living adequate for the child's 
physical, mental, spiritual, moral, and social development. 
Again, the fact that we have 1.5 million children living in 
poverty makes it clear that we have done nothing to deal with 
this question in the last budget. Again we saw the government 
renege on its commitment dealing with child poverty.
<P>
	In article 28 we see a commitment on the part of Canada to 
recognize the right of a child's education and in particular to 
make higher education accessible to all on the basis of capacity 
by every appropriate means. We again see cuts to 
post-secondary education funding in this budget of 10 per cent, 
the 10 per cent reduction on the health and social transfer. 
Again, how can we possibly be said to be responding to these 
international commitments when we make these cuts? Not only 
are we not responding to these commitments that we made, but 
of course we are undermining our ability to be competitive in the 
world economy in the future.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	We also have agreed to take measures to encourage regular 
attendance in school and the reduction of drop-out rates. There 
is much we need to do in order to address this particular 
problem. Again, we need a concerted full effort to address our 
drop-out problem.
<P>
	We have a commitment in article 23 to recognize the right of 
the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from 
performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere 
with the child's education or to be harmful to the child's health 
or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development. We 
have yet to take effective measures to bar the importation of 
products made by child labour in countries where that child 
labour is also illegal. I only need to point out the issue of carpets 
to know that we have not done all we could do in that regard.
<P>
	We also have committed ourselves under article 34 to 
undertake to protect the child from exploitive use in prostitution 
and other unlawful sexual practices. Anyone who spends any 
time in any of our inner cities will know that there are many 
children who are participating in the sex trade, again flowing 
from poverty, flowing from a loss of hope, things this 
government and this country should be able to do something 
about.
<P>
	There are provisions dealing with some changes this House 
made, against the wishes of the New Democratic Party, with 
regard to the Young Offenders Act. Canada made commitments 
with regard to young offenders in the convention. Among other 
things, we committed ourselves to making imprisonment of a 
child a matter of last resort and for the shortest appropriate 
period of time. In flagrant disregard for that commitment, this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11796"> 11796 </A></B>
<P>
House not very long ago increased sentences for young 
offenders.
<P>
	Last, Canada recognized under article 40 the right of every 
child alleged as, accused of, or recognized as having infringed 
the criminal law to be treated in a manner consistent with the 
promotion of the child's sense of dignity and worth, which 
reinforces the child's respect for the human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of others and which takes into account 
the child's age and the desirability of promoting the child's 
integration and the child's assuming a constructive role in 
society.
<P>
	Again, the changes this Parliament made, contrary to the 
wishes of the New Democratic Party and all those experts on 
children, flies in the face of this commitment too.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to say that what is being asked for here 
in this bill and what I am asking on behalf of all Canadian 
children is that this House recognize the commitments Canada 
made on behalf of all Canadians among its international peers to 
commit resources to children, to put children at the first call of 
Canada's resources, and to respond to the specific provisions 
contained in the convention.
<P>
	Canada has a long way to go. Indeed, I think we have gone in 
the opposite direction. It would be important if we made a 
change in direction, if we put children first and if we kept our 
word to the international community on behalf of our children.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, while this bill was not granted votable status in 
the committee, I wonder if I might ask for unanimous consent 
for it to be votable, in which case it could then be votable at 
some later stage.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
terms of the motion of the hon. member for Saskatoon-Clark's 
Crossing. Is there unanimous consent to make his motion

<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this 
opportunity to consider Bill C-254, which the member for 
Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing has introduced.
<P>
	Bill C-254 proposes to amend the Interpretation Act to 
provide that every act of Parliament shall be construed and 
applied so as not to abrogate, abridge, or infringe any rights 
recognized in the convention on the rights of the child.
<P>
<B>(1855 ) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-254 also deems the reservations and statement of 
understanding Canada entered upon ratification not to be part of 
the convention.
<P>
	Before commenting on Bill C-254, I will briefly examine the 
process that led to Canada's ratification of the convention.
<P>
	Members are no doubt aware that Canada played an active 
role in the world summit for children held in September 1990. 
At that time world leaders spoke of the need for action to better 
the lives of the world's children. Canada's efforts at the world 
summit and its involvement in drafting the convention on the 
rights of the child served as a catalyst for increased federal 
efforts on behalf of children in Canada. These efforts, which 
included such initiatives as the action plan for Canada, entitled 
``Brighter Futures'', began with the ratification of the 
convention on the rights of the child on December 13, 1991.
<P>
	Canada's ratification of the convention on the rights of the 
child followed extensive consultations with the provinces and 
territories under the auspices of the continuing committee of 
federal, provincial, and territorial human rights officials. Since 
1975 the continuing committee of officials on human rights 
examines questions concerning domestic implementation 
whenever Canada contemplates ratifying or acceding to another 
international human rights instrument. Consultations with 
national aboriginal representatives and organizations formed 
another important element of the consultations prior to ratifying 
the convention on the rights of the child.
<P>
	These federal, provincial, and territorial consultations are 
held because while the federal government has the power to 
sign, ratify, or accede to international instruments, many human 
rights matters fall within spheres of provincial jurisdiction 
under the Constitution Act of 1867.
<P>
	In Canada, international human rights conventions that 
Canada has ratified do not automatically become part of the 
domestic law so as to enable individuals to go to court when they 
are breached. Rather, each level of government is responsible 
for implementing in legislation or in practice those human rights 
obligations that arise within the constitutional powers it 
possesses. For this reason, Canada seeks provincial and 
territorial support before ratifying international human rights 
instruments.
<P>
	Toward this end, legislation was reviewed at the federal level 
for consistency with the convention on the rights of the child. In 
particular, federal officials considered whether changes in 
legislation were required or whether Canada should consider 
entering a specific reservation or statement upon the standing to 
the convention. With respect to the latter, the law of treaties 
provides that in making a reservation a state or a nation indicates 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11797"> 11797 </A></B>
<P>
that it is not bound by an obligation of the convention. In a 
statement of understanding the state explains how it  interprets a 
particular convention obligation where the nature of the 
obligation is unclear.
<P>
	Following the federal review of legislation and a similar 
review at the provincial and territorial level, Canada decided to 
enter two reservations and one statement of understanding to the 
convention on the rights of the child. I will speak to those two.
<P>
	Canada entered a reservation to article 37(c) to ensure that in 
determining the custodial arrangements for a young offender, 
the well-being of other young offenders and the safety of the 
public may be taken into account.
<P>
	Canada entered a reservation to article 21 and a statement of 
understanding to article 30 following consultations with 
national aboriginal organizations. Canada entered a reservation 
to article 21 to preserve customary forms of care among 
aboriginal peoples in Canada. By its statement of understanding 
to article 30, Canada seeks to ensure that in implementing the 
convention in relation to aboriginal children the child's right to 
enjoy his or her own culture, to profess and practise his or her 
own religion, or to use his or her own language are considered.
<P>
<B>(1900 ) </B>
<P>
	The Government of Canada takes seriously its obligation to 
implement the obligations of the convention on the rights of the 
child in Canada.
<P>
	However, implementing these obligations without reference 
to the reservations and statement of understanding which 
Canada entered to the convention, as section 39.1(4) of Bill 
C-254 contemplates, would not reflect the manner in which 
Canada determines the custodial arrangements of young 
offenders and the concerns of aboriginal peoples of Canada. In 
this way Bill C-254 does not reflect the result of extensive 
consultations with provincial and territorial governments and 
with national aboriginal organizations. Therefore, I cannot 
support Bill C-254.
<P>
	Bill C-254 also proposes to change fundamentally the 
relationship between domestic and international law in Canada. 
As I mentioned earlier, international human rights conventions 
that Canada has ratified do not automatically become part of 
domestic law so as to enable individuals to go to court when they 
are breached.
<P>
	Bill C-254 would fundamentally change the existing 
relationship between domestic and international law for matters 
within federal jurisdiction. Bill C-254 would fundamentally 
change the precedent setting. To go along with Bill C-254 would 
set some important precedents.
<P>
	In essence we would elevate some of Canada's obligations 
under the convention on the rights of the child, namely those 
obligations within federal jurisdictions, and make these directly 
enforceable before Canadian courts while other convention 
obligations, those within provincial jurisdictions as well as 
human rights obligations in other international human rights 
instruments, would not be so enforceable.
<P>
	Not only would we be creating distinctions between different 
international human rights obligations but we would be 
fundamentally changing how international law is applied in our 
domestic legal system.
<P>
	My difficulties with Bill C-254 do not, however, diminish the 
Government of Canada's support for implementing the 
convention in Canada. The Government of Canada in its first 
report to the UN on the convention on the rights of the child 
considers not only how Canada has implemented the convention 
to date but also discusses factors and difficulties we have 
encountered and sets out some goals for Canada in the future. 
The United Nations committee on the rights of the child will 
continue to supervise our government's performance, in 
particular our progress in meeting these goals.
<P>
	Therefore, it is important the government respect its 
obligations under the convention when creating legislation or 
policies which may affect the rights of the child. For this reason 
the Department of Justice takes the convention obligations into 
account when providing legal advice. Parliamentarians should 
similarly take the convention into account when enacting 
legislation.
<P>
	As well, Canadian courts have a role to play. Generally the 
courts presume legislation will be interpreted in a manner 
consistent with Canada's international obligations, including 
the convention on the rights of the child. Courts take 
international human rights instruments into consideration when 
they interpret the guarantees in the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms.
<P>
	Finally, courts may turn to international human rights 
instruments like the convention on the rights of the child when 
interpreting legal concepts relating to children.
<P>
	The speaker who proposes this motion had very good 
intentions. I cannot but agree with some of his expressions. 
Justice L'Hureaux-Dubé in the 1993 Supreme Court case Young 
v. Young addressed those questions of access and custody. The 
need to affirm the best interests of the child is a primary 
consideration in all actions concerning children, including legal 
proceedings.
<P>
	In Justice L'Hureaux-Dubé's view, this reference to 
international law assisted in demonstrating the best interests of 
the child test is of enduring value in Canada. The court plays a 
very important part in ensuring Canada's international human 
rights obligations are respected.
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	As parliamentarians we have a similar responsibility; 
however, Bill C-254 is not the means by which this 
responsibility should be undertaken. Bill C-254 seeks to 
directly implement some convention obligations into domestic 
law but not others. Bill C-254 rejects the results of extensive 
consultations which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11798"> 11798 </A></B>
<P>
have been held with provincial and territorial governments and 
aboriginal organizations.
<P>
	In government, in Parliament and in our courts Canadians 
must be vigilant and ensure the values and guarantees in the 
convention on the rights of the child are respected. The 
Government of Canada takes seriously its responsibilities to 
better the lives of Canadian children. Toward this end we will 
continue our efforts to meet the goals set out for us in Canada's 
first report on the convention on the rights of the child. In this 
way I hope to make the convention on the rights of the child a 
living, breathing document in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-254 
deals with children's rights. I am glad to participate in this 
debate as the official opposition's critic for training and young 
people's issues to support the good intentions the hon. member 
for Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing expressed regarding 
children's rights in his private member's bill. I find it a little sad 
that there will only be a debate, and no vote, on his bill.
<P>
	With issues such as sexual exploitation, child labour, health 
and education, social assistance, special care for handicapped 
children and especially when we consider that the bill is based 
on a convention signed by Canada and on a declaration of rights 
adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, it is a 
little surprising to see that the Liberal government, represented 
by its parliamentary secretary, has reservations about a bill of 
this kind. After all, it deals with rights which are, all told, quite 
basic.
<P>
	The official opposition does have reservations, however, 
about certain rights falling under provincial jurisdiction. Take 
education and health, for example, over which the provinces 
have exclusive power, as you know. This does not stop us, of 
course, from agreeing in principle with the provisions of the 
bill, since the Bloc Quebecois is clearly very much in favour of 
giving children the best education and health care possible.
<P>
	It is all well and good to wish to implement the principles of a 
bill based on a declaration of rights passed by the General 
Assembly of the United Nations on November 20, 1959, as I said 
earlier. All well and good, but how does one go about really 
implementing such a measure?
<P>
	I will now quote what the current Minister of Human 
Resources Development said on November 24, 1989, when he 
was an opposition member, regarding a private member's bill 
which also dealt with children's rights.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development, the hon. 
member for Winnipeg, said the following: ``I ask members to 
shed the speeches prepared by their departments. Open your 
eyes and your hearts a little, start looking at the reality of what is 
going on, and begin to talk about what is the real vocabulary in 
this country. A day does not go by in this House of Commons 
that we do not hear ministers or members of the Conservative 
regime talk about the deficit. That has become the icon of our 
times: the deficit. I never hear the Minister of  Finance talk 
about the real deficit in this country-'' and at the time, he said 
the real deficit was ``-those one million kids in poverty''. He 
went on to say: ``That is where we should invest. That is where 
the real tragedy lies. Ten years from now, these children should 
be our teachers, business people, politicians and journalists. 
They will never get there because they will never be able to get 
started. When one million children live in poverty, that is a 
considerable loss. That is the big deficit we have to deal with. 
But nothing is being done to solve this serious problem''. This 
was in 1989.
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	But what about children today, in 1995? How are they doing? I 
would like to quote the figures in the latest report from the 
National Council of Welfare for 1993, in Canada. What does it 
say? It says that in Canada 1,415,000 children live in poverty, 
which means that 20.8 per cent of Canadian children are living 
below the poverty line. There were one million in 1989, and now 
there are 1,415,000.
<P>
	In Quebec, 348,000 children live below the poverty line, 
which means 20.9 per cent or slightly more than the national 
average. So the situation is getting worse instead of better. If we 
take the figures for 1981, we see that, since that time, the 
number of poor children has doubled. In 1981, Statistics Canada 
set this number at 700,000. This is incredible!
<P>
	So if we have poor children in this country, it is because their 
parents are poor. There are no poor children without poor 
parents. So what has the Minister of Human Resources 
Development done since he was appointed a year and a half ago 
to remedy the situation, the same man who, in a speech in 
November 1989, condemned the Conservative government's 
failure to act in this respect? He said we should drop all our 
prepared speeches and start speaking from the heart and do 
something about the problem.
<P>
	We saw the minister make cuts in unemployment insurance 
totalling $2.5 billion, so that the Minister of Finance could 
balance his latest budget, meaning that the budget would come 
in right on target. This was done by cutting unemployment 
insurance. Mr. Speaker, do you really think that by cutting 
unemployment insurance, by hitting the families of the 
unemployed, we have helped to reduce child poverty in Canada? 
Everyone knows the answer to that.
<P>
	Was that the end of it? It was not just $2.5 billion. He also 
announced it would be $2.5 billion annually, in other words $7.5 
billion over three years. That was just the first year. So what 
does the Minister of Finance have in store for this year? 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11799"> 11799 </A></B>
<P>
Additional cuts which may get worse, starting with next year's 
budget. So we may be talking about a cut in social programs 
totalling $15 billion since the Liberal government came to 
power, in other words, the $7.5 billion that have already been 
announced and another $7.5 billion in the future.
<P>
	Social programs include more than just unemployment 
insurance. There is also, of course, the federal contribution to 
welfare which may be as much as 50 per cent. Will cutting and 
freezing transfer payments to the provinces for social welfare 
financing help reduce child poverty in Canada?
<P>
<B>(1915) </B>
<P>
	I think the answer is obviously no. There are other serious 
situations. In the end, however, many children are poor because 
of the increasing number of single parent families here. In 
Canada, 453,000 children live below the poverty line because 
their mother is the head of a single parent household. Ninety per 
cent of children living with single mothers are living below the 
poverty line.
<P>
	Worse yet, increasing numbers of couples with children are 
finding themselves living off only one salary. For those earning 
only minimum wage, the breadwinner would have to work 73 
hours a week just to stay above the poverty line. Does this 
situation indicate an improvement in the child poverty 
situation? No, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Unfortunately, beyond the speeches and beyond the principles 
and good intentions of the hon. member presenting this motion, 
there is the matter of applicability and implementation and, in 
the end, of the government's political will to really work to 
reduce child poverty.
<P>
	I would like to talk to you about a situation in Quebec. 
Particular efforts have been made in Quebec to protect young 
people. There are rehabilitation services. When I was a member 
of the committee on human resources development, I noted that, 
in many provinces, people asked us about services available in 
Quebec, which seemed to spark some jealousy in certain 
provinces. In a way, I say so much the better. True, Quebecers 
are very proud of their social programs in general.
<P>
	Many people talk about the rights of children. Of course, I 
agree with them but I think that we should start right here in 
Canada and in our democratic societies to teach our children 
about their responsibilities with regard to the rights of others, 
particularly the people in their families, their communities and 
their schools, and their responsibilities to themselves. We 
should make every effort to ensure that our children can improve 
their knowledge while learning how to exercise their right to 
criticize, even at a young age, public policies in Canada and 
everywhere else.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak in opposition to Bill C-254 as 
chair of the Reform Party's task force on the family. I am 
pleased to do so.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to amend the Interpretation Act to 
provide that every act of Parliament shall be construed and 
applied as not to abrogate, abridge or infringe any of the rights 
recognized in the convention on the rights of the child.
<P>
	I would like to devote the majority of my time in reviewing 
the significance of the convention on the rights of the child to 
Canada and its families.
<P>
	In May 1990 the Mulroney government signed the convention 
that was ratified by the House of Commons in December 1991. It 
officially came into force in January 1992. The intent of the 
convention is to provide a set of standards that confirms the 
respect our society gives to its youngest and most vulnerable 
members.
<P>
	The convention is nobly phrased and seems well intended in 
attempting to address the needs of children from all corners of 
the globe. But does it or is it even wise to attempt such a task? 
There are some very real inherent problems with the convention 
that I wish to address today. First, the convention creates a new 
international bureaucracy, the committee on the rights of the 
child.
<P>
<B>(1920) </B>
<P>
	Under the convention each signatory state is required to 
submit reports to this committee through the UN 
Secretary-General every five years and it is: ``to provide that 
Canadians become better informed of the obligations 
undertaken by Canada, to apprise them of measures taken by the 
various levels of government and to enlist their support and 
co-operation in efforts being made to promote the rights of the 
child''.
<P>
	The committee is made up of 10 experts elected for a 
four-year term from nationals of the signatory governments. It 
reviews the reports, makes suggestions and recommendations to 
the signatory governments and the Secretary-General as to what 
they think should be done. These reports and suggestions are 
passed through our internal guardian of family affairs-it has 
been known as the children's bureau-that then wields its 
interpretation on Canadian families.
<P>
	The process of representation is at best flawed. Who 
represents Canada at international conferences? Or for that 
matter, how can we know whose agenda is being put forward? 
How do they know whether grassroots Canadians agree to the 
principles that they endorse? Who are the elite that interpret the 
ongoing directives that come back?
<P>
	The record shows that Canada automatically signs many 
international conventions and treaties without really allowing 
for input or even the time to consider the long term implications 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11800"> 11800 </A></B>
<P>
of the agreements. Then too, I  would guess that our 
representatives are likely the very special interest groups or 
experts that determine our often flawed domestic policy 
direction.
<P>
	Children in this country face numerous problems. We have 
heard a few from members already; abuse, poverty and others. 
The solutions implemented, let us face it, have been an abysmal 
failure. Now this UN convention seeks to expand those very 
same solutions on even a grander scale.
<P>
	Presently a very real conflict is forming between international 
obligations and domestic policy as supported by Canadians. I 
would like to address this for a moment.
<P>
	Section 43 of the Criminal Code provides legal protection for 
parents and teachers who use reasonable physical discipline of 
children. The current justice minister has stated that the 
government is reviewing this section of the Criminal Code ``to 
determine that it meets the international obligations to which we 
now subscribe''. He refers, as have other vocal groups, to 
Canada's obligation under article 19.1 of the UN convention of 
the rights of the child.
<P>
	This is the agenda being pursued by the government, even 
though an overwhelming majority of Canadians support the use 
of reasonable physical force by parents in disciplining and 
correcting their children's behaviour. In March 1994, as 
reported in the <I>Toronto Star</I>, 70 per cent of those surveyed 
supported this view.
<P>
	Canadian parents are being threatened by a movement to 
repeal section 43. For example, a triple amputee Calgary mother 
has recently been charged with assault for spanking her 11-year 
old daughter. Today an American visitor to our country is in 
court answering charges for disciplining his five-year old.
<P>
	I support section 43 of the Criminal Code along with a 
majority of Canadians. I believe that parents and teachers 
should have legal protection to physically discipline children if 
they deem it necessary. A distinction has to be made between 
reasonable physical force in disciplining children and physical 
violence that constitutes abuse. In no way do I condone abuse 
against children. But if this section were to be repealed, parents 
and teachers would be powerless to impose authority by way of 
physical discipline on children even if circumstances warranted 
it.
<P>
	The bill being debated today advocates that every act of 
Parliament be interpreted within the context of the UN 
convention on the rights of the child. As with section 43, my 
main concern is the impact that these externally imposed duties 
and responsibilities of a foreign UN convention would have on 
parental responsibilities now and in the future.
<P>
	Article 3 of the convention would empower: ``public or 
private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative 
authorities or legislative bodies'' the responsibility to safeguard 
``the best interest of the child''. No mention is made of parents 
or families safeguarding the best interests of the child. All of 
these bodies will be able to interfere in family matters, driving a 
deepening wedge between parents and children. In this way 
parental authority is undermined and usurped by government 
and bureaucrats. Excessive and unjustified government 
interference already is at the source of many problems and 
difficulties Canadian families face.
<P>
<B>(1925) </B>
<P>
	Let me conclude with an anecdote. Last week I had the 
opportunity to meet with some of my constituents. They came 
from all walks of life and wanted me to hear them out and carry 
their concerns to Ottawa. One request relates to our discussion 
today.
<P>
	Two parents came to meet me with four of their seven 
children. The oldest of the seven is nine. While they shared with 
me their concern about this very issue their four boys waited 
patiently at the next table. Those boys' politeness and good 
behaviour were a testimony to the millions of families that do 
know better than the government or any bureaucrat will ever 
know how best to care for the best interests of their children.
<P>
	I believe the duties and responsibilities for the rearing and 
safeguarding of children rests within the family unit, 
specifically the parents, the mother and father and extended 
family members if that is the case. It not the responsibility of an 
international committee of experts to suggest or recommend 
what our governments, families and parents should be doing to 
assist or protect children. Parents can do that independently 
without the interference of an international organization or 
committee of experts.
<P>
	Government authorities should only be recognized when there 
is absence or real abuse of that parental authority. When will the 
government recognize it is our families that should be at the 
heart of every public policy debate? The best interests of our 
children are met by those healthy families.
<P>
	Governments must not replace families. Disaster is at the end 
of that path. Governments must strengthen families so that they 
can do what they do best: nurture future generations that will 
build a strong Canada.

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEENVIRONMENT">THE ENVIRONMENT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on April 3, I rose in the Chamber to put a question 
to the government relating to Canada's participation at the 
Berlin meeting on climate change. It was the second time in a 
week that I had raised the issue, hoping the federal government 
would announce a real action plan aimed at establishing and 
stabilizing our levels of greenhouse gases. I was not to be 
satisfied.
<P>
	The Berlin talks were the result of the June 1992 meeting of 
106 of the world's nations held in Rio de Janeiro. At that 
meeting Canada made commitments which sadly we have not 
kept.
<P>
	At the time of my last intervention in the House of Commons I 
reminded members that when we look at what has happened 
since the Rio meeting we do not have to look too far to see that 
nearly nine billion more tonnes of carbon have accumulated in 
the atmosphere and the evidence of climate change is mounting.
<P>
	In response to the crisis the Minister of the Environment even 
went so far as to say that if Canada and the other nations emitting 
greenhouse gases do not do something about this, climate 
change and global warming will create a situation in which 
floods will occur off the east coast of Canada and the tiny and 
beautiful province of Prince Edward Island will be all but 
submerged.
<P>
	It is hard for me to imagine that the Minister of the 
Environment knows about the possibility of this catastrophic 
event occurring but is not prepared to take immediate and 
dramatic actions to combat it.
<P>
	In Berlin the Minister of the Environment pushed the plan for 
trading technology between industrialized and developing 
countries, but she put forward few details on measures to reduce 
greenhouse gases. She was criticized and continues to be 
criticized because this is not an action plan at all. The minister is 
said to have blocked progress on an agreement that would 
contain specific goals and deadlines for further reductions. The 
minister seems to have loss sight of the fact that Canada is 
committed to cutting carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by 
the year 2000.
<P>
	It appears Canada will likely be up by 13 per cent above 1990 
levels by the year 2000. As a result there is no question a real 
action plan which contains timetables and targets is an absolute 
necessity if this critical world problem is ever to be properly 
addressed.
<P>
	For all intents and purposes the United Nations climate 
change conference wrapped up by accomplishing very little. 
Despite the urgent need for world action and despite the 
opportunity that Canada had to play a leadership role, the 
problem remains. More talks are needed to reach agreements for 
specific reductions.
<P>
	The minister has put on a brave face, claiming the agreement 
to set new objectives by 1997 is a step forward-to quote her 
properly, a big win for everybody. Surely she cannot really 
believe this, especially if she wants to avoid moving the entire 
population of the province of Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	When I read the news reports of the Berlin conference I cannot 
help but see the April 8 editorial that appeared in the Vancouver 
<I>Sun</I> which called the conference's conclusion a national 
humiliation. The Sierra Club indicated the results of the 
conference showed from Canada a shocking abdication of 
leadership.
<P>
	Canada did, however, show leadership recently in the turbot 
war. Canada was prepared to take drastic action in the name of 
conservation of the fish stock off the continental shelf. Where is 
this same leadership in the name of conservation of the earth 
itself?
<P>
	At the time of my question in early April there was media 
speculation that the federal government had lost its interest in 
the environment and had cut back federal spending in this regard 
to the point at which Environment Canada was no longer 
effective. This week we discovered that the much touted green 
plan was among those cuts and no longer exists.
<P>
	In this regard, when will the Minister of the Environment and 
the federal government take up the political will necessary to 
strengthen the federal role on domestic environmental issues so 
that we will once again have true and meaningful credibility at 
the international level?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the 
member for the Battlefords-Meadow Lake and give the 
perspective of the Minister of the Environment. I want to assure 
the member the accomplishments of the Government of Canada 
at the recent climate change negotiations in Berlin are proof that 
Canada has an essential role to play in finding solid solutions to 
environmental challenges both at home and on the international 
scene.
<P>
	The government and the environment have come out of that 
conference a clear winner in what is considered a significant 
step forward. Countries agreed in Berlin that current 
commitments contained in the framework convention on 
climate change are inadequate.
<P>
	All developed countries that signed the convention will be 
required to begin negotiations on the protocol concerning future 
commitments. Countries will be required to report on the 
emission reduction policy and measures as well as set quantified 
limitations and reduction objectives.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="11802"> 11802 </A></B>
<P>
	Also, countries have agreed on a pilot phase for projects 
which can be undertaken jointly between developed and 
developing countries. This concept, known as joint 
implementation, is an important opportunity for Canadian 
business. We now have the green light to pursue commercial 
emission reduction projects in other countries. This is good for 
global climate change objectives and good for business here at 
home.
<P>
	Canada's national action program on climate change tabled in 
Berlin sets out strategic directions which Canada will follow to 
meet our own commitment to stabilize greenhouse gas 
emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, a motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have 
been adopted.
<P>
	Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 
p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.34 p.m.)
<P>
