<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>LABELLING OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from May 5 consideration of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate on Motion 
No. 230, introduced by my colleague from Louis-Hébert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of those following this important debate, I will 
reread the motion as introduced: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should make 
labelling of genetically modified foods compulsory, and should 
carry out exhaustive studies on the long-term effects of these 
foods on health and the environment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has a duty, as far as food is concerned, 
to inform and protect the public.  The public has concerns about 
genetically modified organisms, which in the rest of my speech I 
will call GMOs, and the federal government therefore has a duty 
to inform and protect the public.  The government cannot 
continue to wash its hands of what is happening, like Pontius 
Pilate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be too easy to once again bow to the pressures and 
lobbies of the multinationals and not to worry about the 
worries, questions and concerns of a public which does not know 
whom to trust and is desperately calling upon its government to 
protect it from the feared invader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public is asking itself a number of questions, for instance: 
why are plants and foods being genetically modified?  To whose 
advantage is it?  What is in it for the consumer?  What effects 
do GMOs have on health and on the environment?  What effects 
will they have on agriculture, on the economy, on trade?  What 
are the social consequences of the introduction of GMOs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot address all of these questions in the time allotted to 
me.  Let us be clear, therefore. 
Right now, GMOs offer consumers no advantage.  They offer only 
uncertainties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers are entitled to exercise an enlightened choice in 
purchasing their food.  To be able to do so, they need proper 
labelling so they have access to a wide variety of products 
without fear that they may contain elements that might cause 
them concern about their health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eating habits have significantly changed in recent years.  In 
addition, everyone should have the information necessary to buy 
their food in accordance with their culture, that is their 
lifestyle or eating habits: foods that are organic, fat free or 
not genetically modified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of polls conducted since 1994 reveal between 80% and 
95% of the public strongly support labelling GMOs.  More recent 
polls in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada have revealed that 
people would be prepared to pay a little more for food that is 
not genetically modified or would prefer food slightly less 
beautiful or fresh, but not genetically modified.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the different parties have tabled petitions in the 
House from all over the country calling for the labelling of 
GMOs.  The Bloc alone has collected to date 43,000 signatures 
calling for a bill on the compulsory labelling of GMOs.  The 
minister of agriculture has himself received petitions from 
several thousand individuals and many letters asking him to make 
GMO labelling mandatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the government, which is getting ready to call an 
election to ask voters to renew its mandate, turn such a deaf 
ear to these requests, which are increasingly specific, 
justified and numerous? How can the government continue to 
ignore the public and to thumb its nose at it regarding the GMO 
issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The accurate and thorough labelling of food products would allow 
us to identify GMOs and to withdraw them from the market, should 
problems occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a commercial point of view, the monitoring of GMOs could 
allow agricultural producers to maintain access to export 
markets by meeting the national standards in effect in many 
European and Asian countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say a word on the need for research on the long term 
effects of GMOs, including in the areas of health and the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the federal government's responsibility to ensure food 
quality and safety. The government cannot ignore this 
responsibility and must, to fully assume it, conduct studies on 
the long term effects of GMOs on health and the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far, preliminary studies on GMOs have shown that these 
products have harmful effects on rats, butterflies and bacteria. 
Of course, these results do not allow us to conclude that GMOs 
necessarily pose a threat to human beings. However, these 
results mean that the government should go further in its 
research, particularly in the area of foods for human 
consumption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The use of genes from various species in foods generates 
concerns about food allergies. There is a possibility that the 
resistance to antibiotics found in certain GMOs may spread to 
other forms of life in nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Genetically modified seeds can pollinate plants in neighbouring 
fields simply because of the wind, insects and animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transmission of resistance to herbicides and insecticides 
could create super weeds or super insects, which would invade 
the fields and take the place of rare or more vulnerable 
species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The presence of GMOs in an environment where neighbouring farms 
are operated by organic farmers could contaminate their fields 
and cause them to lose their certification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do members realize the kind of dilemma the public servant who, 
in the course of an evaluation, discovers that the products were 
contaminated by GMOs will be facing? Will he keep quiet or will 
he withdraw the organic farm's certification? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, with regard to GMOs, there are too many questions and 
not enough answers. Workers in Quebec and Canada pay enough 
taxes each year for the government to take their concerns 
seriously and to put in the required funding for research so we 
can learn more on the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Clark said that the absence of evidence is not evidence of 
absence. The scientific community is divided on the effects of 
the introduction of genetically modified plants into 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many researchers, the scientific debate boils down to a lack 
of concrete evidence and sufficient data that prevents us from 
stating that GMOs are harmless. For others, the debate is about 
methodologies, scientific assertions and the objectivity of the 
criteria and parameters used by companies and governments to 
measure the impact of genetically modified plants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this to say that an incorrect assumption will produce a 
false result, and this result is being used to increase 
acceptance of new GMOs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The questions are serious, but the answers are long in coming. 
The future of agriculture, the environment, health problems and 
biodiversity are the main factors that we as parliamentarians 
must consider as we face the intrusion of GMOs into our lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the motion before us this morning, which is in 
its second hour, is intended to get members thinking.  It 
favours a preventive approach or a moratorium on GMOs, as long 
as procedures are not transparent and understood by the general 
public, and as long as labelling is not compulsory, so that 
consumers can make their own decisions about what they eat.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite all the uncertainty regarding GMOs and the absence of 
scientific studies with respect to their long-term effects, and 
despite the clear desire of the public for mandatory labelling 
of GMOs, the federal government is sticking to a policy of 
voluntary labelling, leaving the decision up to companies.  The 
stand it is taking internationally is primarily trade-oriented, 
and does not take sufficient account of issues of health, 
agriculture and environmental protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government should review its position or it will pay 
the price in the next election.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central 
to participate in the debate on Motion No. 230.  The motion calls 
for the compulsory labelling of genetically modified foods and 
for exhaustive study on the long term effect of these foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents and I share the concerns being address in this 
motion.  In fact, on behalf of the constituents I represent in 
Surrey Central, B.C., I presented a similar private member's 
motion on October 15, 1999.  My Motion No. 204 called on the 
government to require foods to be labelled so that Canadians 
could have a choice before consuming these products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue here is choice and informed choice.  We want to be 
able to choose what we are going to eat or what we put into our 
bodies.  People not only want to know what they have the right to 
know, they do not want to guess what they are eating. That is not 
too much to ask.  Many of my constituents have contacted me to 
express those views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was serving as the official opposition deputy health 
critic, I received a great deal of information concerning this 
matter.  While on a trip to Australia I came across some 
newspaper articles which contained ample information. That was at 
a time when this parliament did not have any debate, but the rest 
of the world was talking about these issues.  My motion was aimed 
at having some sort of debate in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read part of a letter I received from two of my 
constituents, Mike Koolen and Heather Fox.  They wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that enough study has been done to prove that 
genetically engineered foods are safe for the environment or for 
human health.  I find it appalling that our government is willing 
to turn its population into guinea pigs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the right to choose what I will eat and I am against our 
government taking away my right to choose between food... 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As such, I want to add my voice to that of other Canadians who 
are pushing for the right to choose what we eat. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These remarks are indicative of the kinds of fears that have 
been instilled in people's minds as a result of the technological 
advances in the way we grow the food we eat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me for a moment look at the positive side of genetically 
modified foods.  For years and years we have traditionally used 
genetic modification to improve foods, crops and animals.  As an 
example, I think of new varieties of garden corn which have a 
short growing time and which can grow in a cool climate.  These 
are early ripening varieties.  As you now, Madam Speaker, 
strawberries grown in your part of Quebec are very susceptible to 
cold but genetically altered varieties have been used for a long 
time so that they are not susceptible to cold.  They can tolerate 
cold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have the capability at the microscopic level to 
manipulate the genetic tree, and we have been doing it for years 
and years. 
We have the ability of intervention at the molecular level.  We 
are even capable of taking DNA from one species and linking it 
with the DNA of another species.  There are some scientific 
concerns on this issue and some scientific debate. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1120"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's debate is timely and worthwhile.  On the positive side, 
genetic engineering could give us seeds and crops that would not 
require pesticides or herbicides.  Most people concerned about 
the environment would say that is positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was astonished to read that about 200,000 people die just 
because of a deficiency in nutrients, particularly vitamin A. 
Science has now given us the tools to produce enough food to feed 
the earth's population and to make quality foods that meet the 
vitamin and mineral requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could also seed land that is less fertile to bear crops and 
be productive.  Those are just some of the potential benefits but 
not all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the negative side.  What do individuals see as 
potential hazards in this area?  There are potential hazards, of 
course, from eating or being around such genetically modified 
foods but the effects on the human organism are yet unknown.  We 
could have wild strains overwhelming some of our natural strains, 
having unsuspected effects on domestic plants.  On this 
scientific debate there is some legitimate argument on both sides 
and we should be open to those discussions and arguments.  There 
is much we do not know about the long term effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the consumer who has a concern about genetically 
modified foods should have that information available.  I also 
believe that people who do not want to take genetically modified 
foods into the body, such as a crop, a cereal or a product, 
should have that choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the problem?  It is technically very difficult to label 
all genetically modified foods.  For instance, pasta has 
constituents that come from various sources and a genetically 
modified component would be very difficult to isolate.  Even in 
the food processing plants where juice is extracted from foods, 
it is very difficult to isolate some of the different loads 
coming from different farms.  I am not saying that it could not 
be done but it would be very difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be better to label food that is free of genetic 
modifications rather than all those that have genetically 
modified components in them.  We want some kind of labelling so 
consumers have the right choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than doing it the other way around, it could be done in 
an easier and more economical way so that consumers do not have 
to pay for the expenses and, at the same time, it serves the 
purpose.  It is just an idea.  This would give those who want to 
make a choice the ability to do so.  Those who do not want to 
have the pesticides, herbicides or certain genes in their growing 
process could choose that strain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandatory component of the motion we are considering today 
is something that smacks of bureaucracy and of people telling us 
what to do.  I favour small where small will do when it comes to 
bureaucracy.  I would much prefer a process driven by the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have learned that some businesses have voluntarily started 
separating or labelling these products.  For example, Loblaws has 
quietly made plans to stock its first genetically modified free 
products in some stores.  It will have separate shelves.  It will 
have genetically modified foods on one shelf and genetically 
modified free foods on another shelf.  It will be similar for 
modern foods.  Loblaws has also indicated interest by stating 
that its genetically modified free products and its genetically 
modified products would be separated.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As an individual, I would much prefer a process driven by the 
market.  I could then choose foods that are not genetically 
modified.  That is the process I would choose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of science is where I think we should try not to be 
political.  It should be based on pure science, not on politics 
or fearmongering.  Good science is science that can stand close, 
careful scrutiny.  Therefore the principle that I would use on 
this issue is to make the consumer aware by giving them 
information based on scientific fact and letting them make the 
choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of a long term study that my colleague suggested also 
makes eminent sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I would like to say that consumers not only want 
to have the choice but they have the right to have the choice 
based on scientific evidence.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Madam 
Speaker, first of all, I would like once again to congratulate 
the hon. member for Louis-Hébert for moving this motion in the 
House. This is a very important issue for all Canadians and I 
appreciate having the opportunity to discuss it again. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion addresses two very important aspects of the question 
of genetically modified foods.  It calls for mandatory labelling 
of all food products, in part or in whole, to be labelled.  That 
is a matter which is totally supported by members of the New 
Democratic caucus.  We have indicated our support in this debate 
pursuant to this motion as well as by the introduction of our own 
motion within the last couple of weeks in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do believe, as the member for the Canadian Alliance has just 
indicated, that this is a matter of choice.  It is about giving 
consumers the right to make decisions about what is in the best 
interest of their own health and well-being.  To us it is a 
fundamental question around which there should be no dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of the motion is just as important as the 
question of labelling, which is the investment by government into 
research and science to determine the long term impact of 
genetically modified organisms on our health, on our soil, on our 
environment and on our society generally.  That is an area I want 
to focus in on this morning because it is an area where we can 
see the most significant neglect on the part of the federal 
Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addressing this subject, I would also like to point out that 
it is one thing for the Alliance to suggest that we should have 
labelled foods and that we should provide information on 
genetically modified products, but it cannot be rationalized in 
in an overall policy context if in fact this party does not 
understand the investment required in Health Canada.  It cannot 
in the same breath suggest that Health Canada can be cut back 
further and that in fact, this whole move toward deregulation and 
offloading of responsibilities outside of the purview of the 
federal government can be tolerated.  One cannot on the one hand 
speak for a proactive position on the part of government in terms 
of informing consumers and on the other hand not acknowledge the 
role of government in ensuring the safety of food in the 
marketplace today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely important for us in the House today to call 
upon members of the Canadian Alliance to revisit their position 
of supporting industry's agenda to reduce the role of government 
and in fact allow for products to go on the market without any 
guarantees of safety.  That, in our view, is absolutely 
unacceptable, intolerable and must be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get back to the federal government's responsibility in 
terms of genetically modified foods.  In the course of these 
debates over the last couple of months in the House, we have 
heard that this government has been very vigilant and has taken 
every step possible to ensure that any products that have been 
genetically modified and on the market have been tested and 
proven to be safe.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the case.  There is no basis in fact for that kind 
of statement.  What we are dealing with yet again, when it comes 
to the federal government and health care, is a wonderful act of 
illusory politics.  This is a case of absolutely creating the 
appearance of action when there is no evidence to support those 
kinds of statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point to couple of examples to make that case.  All of 
us will recall back in 1997 when the present health minister was 
appointed.  His first action was to kill the drug research lab 
and to cause the loss forever of the only independent research 
body in government when it comes to drugs.  The government was 
also on the verge of dismantling the food research lab.  Except 
for the outcry of 200 scientists and many consumers across the 
country, the government would have proceeded down that path. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the labs in the food research purview of government were 
closed.  The government and the health minister promised to open 
some of those labs.  In 1997 the health minister issued a public 
release saying that he would open a number of labs that had been 
closed which were important to the protection of Canadians when 
it came to the safety of the foods they eat, including a lab to 
study the development of methods for the detection of genetically 
modified organisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was promised in 1997.  Today it is June 2000 and no such 
lab has been reopened.  No orders have been given by the health 
minister to resume this important work.  Our health protection 
branch continues to operate on an underresourced and understaffed 
basis, without any significant focus to the long term impact of 
genetically modified foods on the health and well-being of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure how Liberals across the way are not up in arms 
over this kind of development.  I hope that after today they will 
put all the pressure they can on the health minister to live up 
to his commitments, because we do not have that kind of capacity 
in the government today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also mention to members of the House that when we have 
tried to get to the bottom of the statements indicating that 
massive research is being done and all these protections are 
being taken, there are no details provided and no information 
forthcoming to show that this is actually the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I resorted to an order for return to get information about what 
the government was doing in terms of research on genetically 
modified foods.  As of October 19, 1999, the government has 
reported that there is “currently one ongoing research project 
on a topic related to genetically modified foods with a planned 
expenditure in 1999-2000 of $166,389”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the sum total of the government's commitment to long 
term, scientific based, independent research into the whole 
impact of genetically modified foods.  The government cannot get 
away with trying to tell the people of Canada that foods are safe 
when it has taken no steps to offer those protections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, what do we get?  We get a propaganda machine that kicks 
into place to try to persuade Canadians that everything is safe 
and not to worry.  We get a little coloured leaflet that goes to 
every door in the country at a cost of about $25 million 
containing a blatant, incorrect statement.  I know I cannot speak 
any more strongly in terms of parliamentary language to indicate 
just how inaccurate the information is, but it makes the 
statement that everything on the market basically is safe.  I 
will quote from the booklet: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before any product derived from biotechnology can be marketed in 
Canada, the government of Canada requires that it undergo 
thorough laboratory and field testing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not true.  That research is not done.  It has not been 
done and it is not being done now.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of the debate today is to say government has a 
responsibility to ensure within government that there are 
laboratories, scientists and independent capabilities to do 
ongoing, indepth research and investigation into the impacts of 
genetically modified products.  It is a disservice to the 
Canadian people to pretend otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see my time is almost up.  There is so much more to say, but 
if there were anything that needs to be said today it is that the 
government is not being truthful to the people of Canada.  It 
owes it to the people of Canada, especially in the wake of 
Walkerton, to do everything possible to ensure that the food we 
eat, the water we drink and the drugs we have to take are safe 
beyond a reasonable doubt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the case now and it is incumbent upon the government 
to take charge of the issue, to reinvest in our scientific 
capacity in the health protection branch and to take every step 
possible to ensure that all genetically modified products on the 
market are safe beyond a reasonable doubt.  That is leadership. 
That is ensuring that the health and well-being of Canadians come 
first. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am very pleased to have this opportunity to respond to Motion No. 
230.  The motion of the hon. member for Louis-Hébert has two 
parts.  The first would make labelling of genetically modified 
products compulsory.  The motion also calls for the government to 
carry out “exhaustive studies on the long term effects of 
genetically modified foods”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by saying that the Government of Canada's 
commitment is always to safety first.  The well-being of 
Canadians, animals and our environment is our highest priority. 
Canada has an enviable reputation around the world for the safety 
of its food and the rigour of its food inspection system. 
Canadians rightly trust the regulatory system which has been 
vigilant in ensuring that our high standards are maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question of labelling of foods, our federal legislation 
calls for Health Canada to set the requirements for mandatory 
labelling.  The data requirements for the safety assessments of 
all foods are established by Health Canada, which also conducts 
premarket reviews of new foods including those derived through 
biotechnology.  Every such food goes through a stringent review 
process before being allowed on the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, or CFIA, is to 
carry out inspection and enforcement activities relative to the 
food safety standards set by Health Canada.  The CFIA is also 
responsible for the environmental safety assessment of a number 
of agricultural products such as plants, animal feed and 
veterinary vaccines including those derived through 
biotechnology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind everyone that current labelling regulations in Canada 
require that all food products, including those developed through 
biotechnology, be labelled where a potential human health or 
safety issue has been identified, or if foods have been changed 
in composition or nutrition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Labelling decisions are made by Health Canada and are based on 
the results of its food safety evaluations.  I am sure the hon. 
member would agree any authority for labelling must be based upon 
science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me address the first part of the motion before us by 
reminding the House that several initiatives are now already in 
place to study the question of how and when to label a 
genetically modified food.  The government believes that all food 
labelling must be credible, meaningful and enforceable.  We are 
actively engaged in consulting with Canadians to score how 
labelling can best serve the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have strongly encouraged the establishment of a Canadian 
standard for the labelling of foods derived through 
biotechnology.  This standard will include provisions for 
definitions, labels, claims and advertising, and compliance 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian General Standards Board, under the sponsorship of 
the Canadian Council of Grocery Distributors, is in the process 
of developing the standards through open and inclusive 
consultation.  Representatives and individuals from a broad range 
of Canadian interests have formed a committee to work on the 
standard, which is expected to be complete within the next six to 
twelve months.  My hon. colleagues should be aware that by 
endorsing such a thorough process to develop a labelling standard 
Canada is indeed a leader worldwide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to bring to the attention of the House that 
the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food has already 
begun its series of hearings on the labelling of genetically 
modified foods.  Canada is also assuming a leadership role in the 
development of international standards governing how and when 
genetically modified foods are labelled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada chairs the Codex Alimentarius committee on food 
labelling, otherwise known as the CCFL for good reason.  At the 
recent Codex meeting in Ottawa, Canada was recognized for its 
success in chairing the CCFL working group that drafted key 
options and recommendations for the labelling of 
biotechnologically derived foods. 
Once again Canada has been tasked with leading the group that 
this year will look at which of these options can be turned into 
Codex guidelines and then be implemented.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that work is under way to address the information 
needs of Canadians on the issue of labelling.  We believe that 
Canadians want labels that are meaningful.  It is the goal of the 
government to ensure that information provided to Canadians 
enables them to make informed choices.  I reiterate that the 
House should not support Motion No. 230 on the basis of the first 
part of the motion on labelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now address the second part of the hon member's motion 
which recommends that exhaustive studies be carried out on the 
long term effects of genetically modified foods on health and the 
environment.  The safety assessment of conventional products and 
of products derived from biotechnology are both subject to 
stringent health and safety requirements under Canada's food and 
safety system.  I re-emphasize that food safety and consumer 
protection are priorities for the Government of Canada.  We are 
strongly committed to the safety of Canadians, animals and our 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a strong reputation as a producer of foods that are 
consistently safe, clean and of high quality.  We have built that 
reputation by putting very rigorous regulatory systems in place. 
Our approval systems are science based and transparent.  The 
decision of the government to accept or reject a product is based 
on sound science and fact.  Our regulators include experts in 
nutrition, molecular biology, chemistry, toxicology and 
environmental science, to name just a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been recent studies calling into question the safety 
of biotechnology derived products.  We hear a lot of talk about 
junk science.  Canadian regulators do not accept junk science, 
poor science or half science when evaluating products of 
biotechnology.  The regulatory system assesses products on a case 
by case basis.  The research and safety required for evaluation 
directly addresses the potential risks of the product to human 
health and the environment.  If there is any question as to the 
safety of these products they are not approved.  The government 
continually reviews the effectiveness of its approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada takes pride in advocating our science 
based approach around the world.  We rely on the need for 
scientific research to settle questions related to long term 
health, safety and environmental issues.   We are committed to a 
regulatory system that meets the highest standards of scientific 
rigour.  This commitment is reflected in the establishment of two 
important groups, an expert panel and an advisory committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Royal Society of Canada has appointed an expert panel to 
examine future scientific developments in food biotechnology and 
to provide advice to the federal government accordingly.  This 
forward thinking body will advise Health Canada, the Canadian 
Food Inspection Agency and Environment Canada on the science 
capacity that the federal government will need to maintain the 
safety of new foods being derived through biotechnology in the 
21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Royal Society of Canada named its expert panel this past 
February.  In examining the leading edge of this technology the 
panel will recommend what new research, policies and regulatory 
capacity will be needed to ensure the Canadian standards of 
safety remain as stringent for the next generation of 
biotechnology derived foods as they are today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of challenges and opportunities are associated with 
biotechnology that require detailed consideration and public 
discussion.  Food biotechnology presents Canadians with 
challenges but also unprecedented opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recently formed Canadian Biotechnology Advisory Committee or 
CBAC will bring stakeholders and interested parties together to 
advise the government to raise public awareness and to engage 
Canadians in an open and transparent dialogue on biotechnology 
issues.  Canadians want to take part in the dialogue on food 
biotechnology.  The CBAC will actively create opportunities for 
Canadians to participate in its activities and discussions.  This 
will include an interactive website for interested Canadians to 
review, consult and provide input into this topic among many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The work of the expert panel of the Royal Society of Canada will 
contribute to a balanced and consultative process where all 
questions and concerns can be thoroughly considered.  The 
government looks forward to the contributions the expert panel 
and CBAC will make in furthering the dialogue on biotechnology 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure the hon. member for Louis-Hébert that the government 
will continue to undertake the necessary steps to ensure the 
health of Canadians, animals and our environment.  I would add 
that the assessment of any genetically modified plant or crop is 
rigorous and comprehensive.  It requires significant scientific 
data to be provided and evaluated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regulation through sound science is an essential step in the 
continued safe production of biotechnology derived foods.  The 
2000 federal budget confirms this priority in Canada's regulatory 
system.  The $90 million investment in the regulatory system for 
biotechnology products will help Canada, the CFIA and other 
regulatory departments to continue to enhance and evolve their 
safety first regulatory approach to keep pace with the next 
generation of scientific discoveries.

of the Government of Canada to supporting the regulatory system 
for the benefit of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can take great pride in the steps the government has taken. 
We should remember that Canada was the first country in the world 
to actively engage a broad range of stakeholders in this issue. 
These initiatives have become the model for other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last week, on June 5, the United Kingdom announced the 
establishment of its Agriculture and Environment Biotechnology 
Commission which will look at developments in biotechnology. 
This commission has a mandate that was decidedly similar to that 
of the CBAC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have initiatives under way to ensure that Canada is well 
positioned for the future.  The Canadian public is already 
strongly engaged on the issue of genetically modified foods.  The 
government is adopting a balanced and consultative approach to 
the labelling of these foods and we are letting Canadians know 
that our top priority is health, safety and the environment.  We 
have incorporated these values into our regulatory system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons I urge my colleagues to vote against Motion 
No. 230. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to debate genetically modified foods.  I 
was a General Motors dealer for years in the car business and 
every time I hear GM foods I wonder if General Motors would like 
it to be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here to talk about genetically modified foods.  It is a 
subject that makes most people nervous.  It makes most consumers 
nervous.  The people I talk to around my riding are very 
concerned not only about genetically modified foods, but also 
that we may lose our original foods.  If there are enough 
genetically modified foods produced, then we may eventually lose 
the original type of food we had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminds me somewhat of the debate in the Miramichi last week. 
There was a world conference on salmon fishing.  The big problem 
was the possibility that the original Atlantic salmon would 
disappear because of the impact of aquaculturally raised salmon. 
If aquaculturally raised salmon mixed enough with wild Atlantic 
salmon, then eventually the wild Atlantic salmon would disappear. 
That is a comment I hear often from people in my riding.  They 
are concerned about genetically modified foods and that this may 
happen with other foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The term “genetically modified foods” concerns consumers and 
farmers especially.  They do not know where to turn.  They do not 
know whether to use traditional agriculture or to branch out and 
take a leap forward into genetically modified foods.  They are 
not sure which is safe for them.  They are not sure which is safe 
for the land.  They are not sure which is safe for consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole country is looking to the government for leadership on 
this issue.  It is an issue that must be addressed and the 
Department of the Health must provide the regulatory system to 
control this whole subject.  Labelling is part of that, but it is 
not enough.  It does not go far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will be held accountable because the fear of the 
unknown is what bothers most people and most people do not have a 
clue what the impacts of genetically modified foods are.  How 
would they?  We do not have even a definition of genetically 
modified foods yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The onus is on the government to deal with this situation.  I 
applaud the hon. member for bringing forth this motion requiring 
labelling, but it is not enough and it does not address some of 
the main issues.  It just is not clear enough.  The motion states 
that the government should carry out exhaustive studies on the 
long term effects of these foods on health and the environment. 
Although I applaud the move to labelling, what this bill states 
cannot be defined.  Exhaustive studies on the long term effects 
cannot be defined, and it would be very difficult to do 
exhaustive studies on the long term effects without stopping the 
process now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that genetically modified foods have 
helped the Canadian agricultural industry become competitive in 
the global economy and helped farmers to make better use of their 
land and provide more food for a world that needs food.  However, 
it is absolutely mandatory that the government take every step 
possible to address the definition of genetically modified foods 
and to protect consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many agencies that have already voluntarily agreed to 
supply labelling for genetically modified foods.  The Canadian 
Food Inspection Agency and Health Canada held an off the record 
technical briefing for reporters in October and said that food 
companies are permitted to label genetically modified foods, but 
there are no plans to make it mandatory. 
In response to that some agricultural and retail organizations 
have offered to do it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sustainable agricultural practices are another big topic for our 
country right now, how we can maintain our land and ensure it is 
able to produce the foods we need.  Some of these genetically 
modified foods help guarantee that our agricultural business will 
be sustainable.  We do have some positives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have new markets that we never had before.  Some of our 
agricultural industries are able to supply products which were 
never available before in the world.  Some of our research 
laboratories and companies in Canada are world leaders in this 
field.  There are pros and cons to this whole subject, but again 
the onus is on the government to provide the regulatory situation 
to deal with this new concept to ensure that consumers have food 
security and that the industry is controlled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Council of Grocery Distributors and the Canadian 
General Standards Board have launched a project to help develop 
the standards for voluntary labelling.  Maybe this would be the 
way to go, with the government as back-up.  The ministers of 
health have announced their intention to establish an independent 
expert panel to examine future scientific developments in 
biotechnology.  The first thing they have to do is define 
genetically modified foods.  Without that definition, regulations 
cannot be written to control labelling or any other aspect of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to conclude by saying that it is extremely critical for 
our future.  We may be making mistakes now that will affect us 
for a long time.  We may be deteriorating our food base, or we 
may be enhancing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, it is up to the government.  It has the power, it has the 
resources, and it has the responsibility to deal with this issue. 
That is where it should be.  It should not be left up to a 
private member's bill to say that we need exhaustive, long term 
studies before we can do anything.  The bill does not say whether 
we should stop the genetically modified process while we are 
doing the exhaustive studies or whether we should continue.  It 
is up to the government, not a private member's bill, to deal 
with this very, very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are watching this very closely.  We will hold the government 
accountable for the process and for the ability to regulate and 
provide the regulations.  Generally speaking, so far genetically 
enhanced foods have benefited the agricultural sector and 
biotechnology does offer an opportunity to improve our 
environment and improve our food quality.  However, it is not 
appropriate for this very, very important subject to be dealt 
with through a private member's bill, which has no definition of 
even the subject of genetically modified foods or some kind of 
timeframe for this exhaustive study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the Progressive Conservative Party will be holding the 
government accountable to ensure that the regulatory process is 
in place and followed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased today to rise in this important debate on the whole 
issue of the labelling of genetically modified foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must first of all commend my colleague from Louis-Hébert, who 
undertook her initiative on this issue a year ago. Today, she 
has already gathered throughout Quebec 60,000 signatures on the 
petition supporting her initiative, that is legislation 
requiring the government to label GMOs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was listening earlier to my Liberal colleague talking about 
transparency. 
I heard him talk in his speech about concepts, theories, great 
philosophical considerations, but he did not talk about any 
concrete measure to support my colleague's initiative. I was 
astounded when he said he had great confidence in the Canadian 
Food Inspection Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague approached the Commission d'accès à l'information 
to try to become acquainted with the process regulating the 
Canadian Food Inspection Agency, to learn how one determines 
what is a GMO and what is not.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, I heard the Liberal member say that everything 
hangs on the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. I have my opinion 
with regard to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, because I 
have been called upon a few times to participate in some 
missions overseas. What are they doing with the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency? They are making it into a propaganda 
instrument, what I often call a “Canada approved” seal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they are overseas, government representatives are great 
democrats, incredibly open-minded. Back in the House, the 
government no longer practices democracy but information 
control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberal member has a paper on the process used to 
determine what is a GMO and what is not, I strongly call upon 
him to pass it on to us and most of all to tell the Canadian 
Food Inspection Agency to inform us on the process, because we 
do not know it yet. The steps we are now taking show that there 
are seven or eight ministers involved in the GMO issue and 
nobody has been able to explain the process fir determining what 
is a GMO and what is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can go even farther. In this government, there is a new trend. 
They now talk in terms of risk management, on such a serious 
issue as genetically modified foods. They might take a risk— 
that is how the Liberals think—and then they will see. That is 
risk management, and on an issue as important as this one. 
At the present time, there are a few countries which are 
following this risk management approach, which is a kind of 
compromise to avoid having to confront and settle the question 
of GMOs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I insist that the Liberals, the Progressive Conservatives and 
the Canadian Alliance change their minds on this.  The work of 
my colleague, the member for Louis-Hébert, as well as that of my 
party, the Bloc Quebecois, aimed at tabling this legislation so 
that there will be mandatory labelling of GMOs is but the 
beginning of a process aimed at clarifying matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that we are calling for at the present time is to have 
labelling made mandatory and to have the government invest the 
essential resources, both financial and research resources, into 
lending some credibility to Agriculture Canada and the Canadian 
Food Inspection Agency, so that they are not put in a position 
of being both judge and jury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust that the Liberals will understand the importance of this 
debate. We are already aware that there have been problems with certain 
crops, because Canada is lagging behind many of the other 
countries as far as monitoring GMOs is concerned.  I have 
already said, and say again, as do some of the farmers in my 
riding, when the day comes that people have any doubt whatsoever 
about whether our products contain any GMOs, in this era of 
global trade, the shipment of wheat or any other product that 
has been genetically modified will not get out of the country. 
This will mean significant losses for the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The European Union, Japan, Brazil, even the United States, have 
started work on mandatory labelling, on specific means to ensure 
identification of what is a GMO and what is not. Meanwhile, once 
again here in parliament, in the statements by ministers, in the 
Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food, the discussion 
is still around concepts and theories, and not concrete 
measures, things that might make both the agricultural industry 
and the consumer feel more secure?

farming, and, because of the government, they stand to loose a 
great deal of that money. We are working hard to get a 
certification program for organic farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of the great risk associated with genetically modified 
plants, it is absolutely essential that the government take 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say a word about the behaviour of Liberal 
members since the beginning of this debate, especially since we 
succeeded in having the Standing Committee on Agriculture hold 
public hearings. We realize how unaware they are of the import 
of this debate and all the consequences of this crucial issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the House of the countries that have taken 
concrete steps. In April 2000, the European Union submitted 
regulations on which plants are genetically modified. Mexico has 
followed suit. As soon as 2001, Japan will implement a mandatory 
labelling policy. Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, and even India 
have also taken action. These countries are now conducting tests 
to sort out the mandatory labelling issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, with the Liberal government, we are talking about 
concepts and theories, and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency 
which is supposed to give us an incredible level of security in 
our health controls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A moment ago, when I was listening to the remarks of my 
colleague opposite, I had the impression he was reading a speech 
that had been written from beginning to end by Health Canada. 
This is to say that these people are not serious and that they 
do not understand the scope of the GMO issue. When the economic 
and health consequences will be known, those who already oppose 
compulsory labelling will be held accountable at the next 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public is aware of this issue. People have been asking many 
questions. They want to know what is in their food. It is 
fundamental. Producers want to know what kind of seed they are 
planting. This is also fundamental. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government still refuse compulsory labelling of 
GMOs when Canada's main trading partners have adopted it? There 
will be an imbalance somewhere down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it is reducing the issue to one of risk management, of 
losing millions in exports, and of managing possible risks to 
the health and safety of producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that in the coming days, the Liberals will discuss the 
matter, change their mind and rally to the position of the Bloc 
Quebecois, which is more realist and concrete, which provides 
for safety measures and, most importantly, promotes a cause that 
is very important for today's society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The time provided for the

in the opening to her recent book <I>The Nature of Economies</I>, 
Jane Jacobs writes, “To be heard, a book needs a collaborator: a 
reader with a sufficiently open mind to take in what the book is 
saying and dispute or agree, but in any case think about it”. 
May I suggest that speeches in this place have the same 
requirement. They need a collaborator, they need an audience with 
sufficiently open minds to take in the message of the speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sad to say that oftentimes on a issue of such fundamental 
importance to Canadians as the environment, when those concerned 
with its preservation and restoration rise to speak, few are 
really willing to listen. 
Many in this place say they care and many make fine speeches 
themselves, but words are a poor substitute for action.  All of 
the rhetoric in the world will not save a river, a fish, a 
forest, nor will it protect a child from a hazardous contaminant. 
Our words will not protect species at risk, only our actions can.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any movement to restore, preserve or protect the natural 
environment is often faced by an onslaught of criticism from 
industrial interests. They are quick to say this will cost jobs. 
They are quick to accuse those seeking to protect the environment 
of being alarmists.  They put forward a false dichotomy of 
environment versus economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of endangered species, they cite the wicked spotted 
owl as the single cause of job losses and the closing of 
communities within the forest industry in the United States. This 
is not true but such mythologizing serves their needs.  Such 
alarmism pays dividends to those who are fundamentally 
uninterested or even opposed to protecting the environment and to 
protecting species, many of which are threatened by the 
activities of the industries in question. What many fail to 
recognize is as E. O. Wilson states, “that the planet's 
biological wealth is the basis for our material and cultural 
wealth”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago EcoSummit 2000 brought medical doctors, 
scientists, aboriginal leaders and policy experts to Ottawa to 
meet with parliamentarians and discuss the effects of water borne 
pollutants on human health. The special guest speaker at the 
Monday evening session was the noted American environmentalist 
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Professor Kennedy reminded us in a very eloquent and passionate 
speech that we cannot separate the environment from the economy. 
They are not in contradiction to each other nor are they factors 
to be balanced one against the other on some mythological 
teeter-totter of government policy making. They are entwined.  To 
quote Professor Kennedy, “In 100% of the situations, good 
environmental policy is identical to good economic policy”. 
Identical.  We must always remember, environmental injury is 
deficit spending.  It is passing the cost of our generation's 
prosperity and loading it onto the backs of our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The human animal is part of nature, yet too many see humanity as 
a separate entity.  As a result we try to tame nature.  We try to 
civilize and domesticate nature.  We make war against nature. 
Yet we continue to ignore the fundamental aspect of our humanity. 
We are in nature and nature is in us.  We cannot control nature. 
We are merely part of a wider natural system. Humans can only 
intervene in processes of nature. If we respect the rest of 
nature, if we learn from nature, then it is possible to conduct 
human activities in harmony with nature.  If we show no respect 
and continue to act through greed, brashness or ignorance we will 
face dire consequences.  As Jane Jacobs said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing is more unforgiving of error than nature. If we poison 
our own water and air with hormone-mimicking chemicals...nature's 
solution for maladaptation is extinction. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we respect nature we can begin to understand the incredible 
services it provides. For those who must, putting a monetary 
value on nature's services is difficult for many reasons.  What 
price can be assigned to the last drop of water, the last gasp of 
fresh air?  But it is not impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his book <I>Natural Capitalism</I>, Paul Hawken estimates that 
biological services that flow directly into society from the 
stock of natural capital are worth at least $36 trillion U.S. 
annually.  Yet these fundamental services are rarely understood 
and grossly undervalued.  Why must we protect nature?  We must 
protect nature because it enriches us. As Professor Kennedy said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It enriches us economically, yes, it's the base of our economy, 
the economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment.  But 
it also enriches us culturally, recreationally, aesthetically, 
spiritually and historically.  It connects us to one another; it 
connects us to our history and our culture.  Human beings have 
other appetites besides money, and if we don't feed them we are 
not going to grow up.  We are not going to become the kinds of 
beings that we are supposed to become.  We're not going to fulfil 
ourselves or our destinies. When we destroy nature we diminish 
ourselves, and we impoverish our children.

protection of wildlife species at risk in Canada. Already serious 
concerns about this bill have been raised not only by 
environmentalists and conservationists and environmental lawyers, 
but by scientists and industry representatives.  Incredibly many 
concerns are shared by these various groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Bill C-33 passes the second reading vote, it will then 
proceed to the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable 
Development.  As part of parliamentary procedure, witnesses will 
be called before the committee which will hear their 
presentations on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will do nothing to protect species at risk unless this bill 
leaves committee as a good, effective piece of legislation.  The 
House must support legislation that is strong, fair, effective 
and makes biological sense.  Unfortunately Bill C-33 is wanting. 
Legislation must also be enforceable and it must be enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment committee of this session of parliament has a 
fine tradition of being open minded and thoughtful as it listens 
to the many expert witnesses who come before it.  The environment 
committee has a practice of serving the interests of Canadians by 
taking tough stands to protect our natural heritage. I expect 
that the environment committee will continue to act in the public 
interest to protect our nation's commons and will also honour 
parliamentary tradition in remembering its responsibilities to 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members of the House, as I have many times in the past, 
of this place's origin.  The true test of any democracy is its 
ability to give voice to all its members.  Wealth and position 
cannot be the criteria for participation in a democracy.  The 
power of democracy is in its articulation of the public interest 
and its action to protect the common weal.  Indeed, as our 
colleagues from earlier times during the beginning of the 
evolution of parliamentary democracy represented the common 
person, not just the rich and not just the nobility, we too must 
represent all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we look down, we see that the floor of the House is covered 
in a green carpet which reminds us of democracy's humble 
beginnings. Ordinary people would meet on the grassy green 
commons of their villages to discuss and debate the concerns of 
the day.  We can trace a connection to nature all the way back to 
the very birthplace of our parliamentary tradition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it that our ancestors so wisely understood that we of 
this House in so many ways have sadly forgotten?  It is that we 
are of nature.  We have been given a public trust to protect the 
commons, a commons that includes those who do not vote: children, 
the unborn and the natural world around us.  This is a duty we 
cannot ignore.  I call on all members of the House to ensure when 
this bill goes before committee that it is properly amended.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
1992, Canada played a leading role in Rio, to promote the 
development of the Convention on Biological Diversity. As a 
matter of fact, Canada was the first industrialized nation to 
ratify this convention after the Principality of Monaco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the underlying elements of the convention is precisely 
the enactment of legislation to protect species at risk. The 
convention requires that the member States pass such an act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government made many promises in that regard, 
including the one made in the red book and confirmed in the 1997 
election and those made in the Speech from the Throne for 1996 
and that for 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that we brought before the House Bill C-33, which we 
are debating today, to protect species at risk. This bill is 
succeeding to Bill C-65, which died on the order paper in 1997, 
when the election was called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the second reading of a bill is to try to 
establish the limits and the criteria that we, as members of 
Parliament, have set to improve the bill when it is sent to 
committee. I think that this bill will require some fundamental 
amendments. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We start with listing.  Listings are made initially by a 
committee called COSEWIC, the Committee on the Status of 
Endangered Wildlife in Canada.  It has been working for something 
like two decades.  It has identified 339 species at risk over 
that time.  Instead of using the existing list of 339 species and 
incorporating it into the new act, we are going ahead as if the 
list does not exist.  We are starting with an initial list of 
zero.  Instead of being recognized as being the final list 
produced by scientists of the highest repute who have worked 
tirelessly over the last two decades, the list will now be 
subject to the discretion of cabinet.  I find that terribly 
ironic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Putting myself in the place of a cabinet member—and I used to 
belong to cabinet—I am supposed to rule on a list produced by 
scientists who have been studying the subject for years and who 
are well aware of what they speak.  We are supposed to accept the 
discretion of cabinet ministers, most of whom are completely 
unfamiliar with the subject and who will have the discretion to 
list species at risk or decide not to, and the political 
considerations of course will rule.  The minister of agriculture 
will say one thing, the industry minister will say another, the 
minister of natural resources and so forth and so on.  The 
minister of the environment will have to fight for his territory 
to say it is worth listing a certain species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not even starting with the roll of the list of the 339 
species identified by COSEWIC.  That is a glaring fault in the 
law.  Without a listing there cannot be protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protection of habitat and the listing are synonymous.  They 
are twins.  One cannot go without the other.  If we wait for 
cabinet decisions, which take endless time to come forward, we 
will not have any listing for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we come to habitat.  All scientists, all people in general, 
all Canadians realize that habitat and species go together.  If 
we do not have habitat we will not have species.  If we destroy 
or damage habitat, we destroy or damage species.  It is very 
obvious.  Yet in regard to habitat, which is a critical element 
of any law for the protection of endangered species, we have made 
habitat again discretionary. 
It will be cabinet that will decide whether habitat protection 
may or may not be included in the act.  It is even a retreat from 
the previous bill, Bill C-65, which never left the discretion in 
the hands of cabinet.  In Bill C-65 the provision was to the 
effect that cabinet shall list and protect habitat when there is 
good cause to do so.  Now it may.  It is another glaring 
omission.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context it is worth citing certain provincial laws. Very 
often we criticize the provinces for not having definite laws, 
but I would like to quote a few of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Brunswick Endangered Species Act of 1996 states:  “No 
person shall wilfully or knowingly destroy, disturb or interfere 
with the critical habitat of a member of an endangered species”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The P.E.I. Wildlife Conservation Act states:  “No person shall 
destroy, disturb or interfere with, or attempt to destroy, 
disturb or interfere with the habitat of an endangered or 
threatened species”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario Endangered Species Act states:  “No person shall 
wilfully destroy or interfere with or attempt to destroy or 
interfere with the habitat of any species or flora or fauna 
declared in the regulations to be threatened with extinction”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Manitoba law states:  “No person shall destroy, disturb or 
interfere with the habitat of an endangered or threatened 
species”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our neighbours to the south have had an endangered species law 
for many years, since 1973.  It states:  “With respect to 
endangered species of fish and wildlife listed pursuant to this 
act, it is unlawful for any person to—take such species within 
the United States”.  It also explicitly prohibits habitat 
destruction in areas of federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big difference is that in the case of all these laws that I 
cited, the onus of proof is clearly a very important and onerous 
burden on the person who destroys habitat.  He or she is judged 
to be guilty unless he or she proves otherwise.  Whereas in our 
new law, we would have to wait for cabinet to decide whether it 
may or may not protect habitat and incorporate it within the act. 
We fail completely compared to the laws that I have cited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then must view the question of federal jurisdiction and the 
safety net.  In our own areas of jurisdiction we are again so 
timid as to apply discretion all over the place.  There is an 
opinion from Justice La Forest, whose reputation and stature do 
not need to be underlined.  He has said that Canada, the federal 
government, has complete jurisdiction over birds that migrate and 
also over cross-border species.  We do not need to be timid, but 
even then we have applied discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have applied all kinds of discretion, so that in effect we 
would have to consult with everybody, consult with cabinet 
ministers, one to the other, and consult with the provinces 
before we even make a decision regarding the habitat of species 
that is clearly within our jurisdiction. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was in Quebec, I had the honour of tabling the Quebec 
legislation on threatened species. I know what it is all about. 
At the department, we had worked with one of the experts, Lionel 
Gaudreau, to whom I would like to pay tribute today. He had 
explained to me why the habitat and the list of threatened 
species had to be considered for automatic protection. 
Unfortunately, this protection has been restricted and tainted 
lately. I hope that the act will be maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, what we need here is to pass clear, convincing and, 
above all, decisive legislation, as the United States and some 
provinces did.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I urge my colleagues that, once this bill is 
referred to the Standing Committee on Environment and 
Sustainable Development, we improve on all its major principles. 
Otherwise, the bill will be too weak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential that we improve the bill and strengthen it when 
it is referred to the committee. This is the wish that I want to 
express out loud to all the members in the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the previous two 
speakers, both of whom I have the utmost respect for.  I very 
much appreciated their comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question concerns species at risk that move across 
international boundaries.  Would the member inform the House if 
he is aware of sources in the United States which have indicated 
in a very harsh and critical way their views of this legislation 
in terms of not being able to protect species that move across 
international boundaries, either Canada and Alaska or Canada and 
the southern states? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member no 
doubt knows, not only all of the leading environmental groups in 
the United States, but a lot of organizations representing people 
at large have pointed out that Canada is lacking very badly in 
this regard.  Cross-border species must be protected according to 
the convention, according to NAFTA and according to all binding 
agreements between our two countries.  For us to do this in such 
a timid fashion as to leave it to discretion is unacceptable to 
both the United States and Mexico, both of which have very strong 
endangered species legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot consider that birds and other wildlife which cross 
borders from the north to the south every winter are not under 
federal jurisdiction.  It makes no sense at all.  Of course we 
have to protect wildlife under our jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Robert Kennedy Jr. pointed this out in eloquent terms to the 
House.  It was sad to hear an American giving us a lesson in 
Canada.  He said that our endangered species legislation is weak 
and must be improved, bona fide and strengthened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the hon. member that one critical area is 
cross-border species. 
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to congratulate the member for his very fine speech.  I am 
sure that all of us are aware of the leadership that he shows on 
environmental issues and with his presence on the Standing 
Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask for a clarification or an expansion on some of the 
points he has raised with regard to the involvement of the 
parliamentary standing committee in the process of hearing 
witnesses and the amendment process.  A lot of us in the House 
hear about how impotent some backbenchers are.  One of the key 
roles that members of the House have to play is on a 
parliamentary standing committee.  All of the members on both 
sides of the House are aware that a parliamentary standing 
committee reports to parliament and to you, Mr. Speaker.  Could 
the hon. member make a few comments on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the committee is an 
ideal place to strengthen legislation.  It is completely 
independent of thought, or it should.  It represents all parties 
in the House in a far more congenial atmosphere than exists in 
this place, where the atmosphere is much more adversarial. 
Committee members have a duty to try and see the flaws of 
legislation. 
There are very few in this case.  There might be five items that 
need to be strengthened.  If we were to do this, we would do 
parliament, cabinet and the minister a big favour.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope members on all sides of the House will join together to 
identify the few areas, some of which I have been spoken to, that 
need to be strengthened.  I do not think there are many of them 
and I think we can do it by working together in a constructive 
spirit of co-operation.  We should rejoice that there is a law, 
but there are certain critical flaws.  Let us get together and 
work within the committee to make sure the flaws disappear.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am 
very happy today to speak to Bill C-33, but more specifically to 
the amendment proposed by my Progressive Conservative colleague 
from Fundy—Royal. First of all, I would like to say that the Bloc 
Quebecois is in favour of this amendment which is proposing that 
this bill be hoisted for six months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why? I think that we must give a brief history of the struggle 
to save the endangered species. In 1995, there was a first bill 
sponsored by the present Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
Nevertheless, this bill caused such an uproar that it had to be 
withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the election of 1997, Sergio Marchi introduced Bill C-65, 
which can be considered as the ancestor of Bill C-33. The 
protests were as vigorous as for the preceding bill. The federal 
government was then criticized by the provinces for the sweeping 
powers that it gave itself as far as the protection of 
endangered species is concerned. The Liberals allowed Bill C-65 
to die on the order paper and are now bringing the matter of 
endangered species up again with Bill C-33, which is supposed to 
be better, according to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that we must ensure better protection for endangered 
species. Still, we need to ask ourselves whether Bill C-33 
really offers an additional, enforceable protection. Is this 
bill really going to contribute to improving the protection of 
our ecosystems and the endangered species in those ecosystems? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my speech was interrupted last time, I had an opportunity 
to read the hansard and I would like to comment on some 
interesting points raised by the hon. member for 
Edmonton—Strathcona, of the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made a very interesting analogy, which is a good illustration 
of what I want to say.  He compared Bill C-33 to a wall rather 
than a bridge between various stakeholders. Rather than tapping 
into the scientific knowledge of researchers and the general 
population, the federal government is trying to go it alone with 
its bill. Instead of calling upon outside knowledge, the 
government is acting alone, as if it had the monopoly on truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several provisions of Bill C-33 show evidence of that. 
Members can find many provisions in Bill C-33 that say “To the 
extent possible, the responsible minister will seek the support 
of provincial and territorial ministers”. That is right, “to the 
extent possible”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I deplore in this regard, as the hon. member from the 
Canadian Alliance did, is that there is nothing set in stone. 
The obligation to seek support is not an essential condition to 
the implementation of this act. The federal government might 
very well act alone and not seek any support.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same vein, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Environment said that “where voluntary measures do not work, 
other governments are unwilling or unable to act, the federal 
safety net will be invoked.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means many things. These words are, to say the least, 
ambiguous coming from a government that limits itself to 
rhetoric, as the Minister of Environment said before the 
Standing Committee on the Environment 15 days ago. However, when 
this rhetoric is put into a bill, the cat finally comes out of 
the bag. The Big Boss, the Minister of Environment, complacently 
believes that he is the only one to possess the truth. 
For his benefit, I will quote Albert Camus, who once wrote “the 
need to be right is the greatest of weaknesses”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, an answer given by the minister made me smile. Answering my 
colleague from Edmonton—Strathcona, he said “That party—the 
Canadian Alliance—not that it understands the constitution, 
should understand that there are certain areas of provincial 
jurisdiction that we should respect. It does not, but we do”. 
How ironic—and I would use another word without hesitation, if 
it were not unparliamentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Liberal terminology, the definition of the provincial 
governments' will to act could lead to confusion. In fact, they 
do not define the word will as I do. The federal government 
could tell the Quebec government that it will have to protect 
without delay 150 species at an excessive cost that Quebec may 
not be able to afford. 
By putting Quebec in front of an impossible task, the Liberals 
could tell people “See, Quebec refuses to act”. And then what 
would happen? The federal government would intrude in a 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the preamble says that jurisdiction over the 
protection of species is shared, that is not reflected in the 
provisions of the bill, which itself does not reflect reality, 
which is that protection of habitats is essentially a provincial 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, everything leads us to believe that the minister has 
the authority to impose his vision of the protection of species 
at risk on the provinces when he sees fit. In other words, the 
bill will have de facto precedence over existing provincial 
legislation, even where habitats are totally under provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out the duplicity of Liberal members 
who tried to promote and make us accept Bill C-33. They even 
invited professor Robert Kennedy Jr. who shared his vision of 
environmental policies, a centralizing vision giving all powers 
to the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say, he was quick to refer to Bill C-33. I find it 
regrettable that a foreigner, who incidentally is an intelligent 
and respected person, was asked to interfere like that in 
Canadian affairs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, a policy requiring the various levels of government 
to co-operate is much more appropriate to solve environmental 
issues. Provincial governments are in a much better position to 
know about regional issues than federal public servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I deplore the fact that the Quebec government's specific 
character is not being taken into consideration when it comes to 
the protection of species at risk. Moreover, this specificity is 
not exclusive to Quebec, as other provincial governments already 
have such legislation. Quebec's legislation on species at risk 
has been in effect for nearly ten years and it works very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem, although I hope with all my heart that this will 
not be another clash between Quebec and Canada, that Bill C-33 is 
not a response to Quebec's success.  The federal government is 
jealous of our progressive legislation and is trying to take it 
over.  Why is the federal government interfering in 
jurisdictions where it has no business? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's petty attitude is all too apparent. I 
remind the Liberals that, after the 1995 referendum, they passed 
a motion recognizing Quebec as a distinct society.  If they were 
consistent, they would not be trying to interfere like this in 
the jurisdictions of the provinces and of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the words of the poet Paul Verlaine:

buffeted by the autumn winds, they cry over lost dreams and pin 
their hopes on spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the stormy weather continues for the federal government, what 
spring might bring is a new country called Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also remind government members that most environmental 
groups are also opposed to Bill C-33.  Those who should by rights 
be the government's allies consider this a dangerous and 
unnecessary bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the Minister of the Environment has been inundated by 
protests and criticism since the bill was introduced.  Most 
stakeholders think that Bill C-33 does not have enough teeth. 
Even organizations representing industry feel that the bill does 
not provide increased protection for species, nor does it make 
clear what they need to do to protect species living within 
their areas of operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representatives of the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association and 
of the Mining Association of Canada have indicated that the government 
should have adopted a firmer approach on the issue of federal 
lands and natural areas where its constitutional responsibility 
is not questioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth noting that, in its present state, Bill C-33 scares 
representatives of some industries who think the issues of 
compensation are insufficiently defined and who find the fines 
and prosecutions excessive in cases where the species has not 
been killed deliberately.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the main problem raised by environmental groups seems 
to stem from the fact that decisions concerning the listing of 
species will be taken at the discretion of the minister and the 
Cabinet and not by scientists.  For that reason, some activists 
say that C-33 is a total failure and that it will not protect 
Canadian species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some others, like the lawyers of the Sierra Club, qualify their 
assertions but still deplore the weakness of the legislation and 
the ignominy of giving to politicians such discretionary power 
over the listing of species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My criticism of the Minister of the Environment lies with his 
piecemeal approach, evaluated at the discretion of Cabinet and 
supported by legal and binding recourse if no agreement can be 
reached, instead of an overall approach that favours 
negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, the principle of providing greater protection to 
endangered species is one the Bloc Quebecois supports readily. 
However, Bill C-33 is not the best way of doing it.  Because of 
intrusions into areas of provincial jurisdiction, we oppose it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we recognize that responsibility for the environment is 
shared between the federal government and the provinces, we 
think the federal government is ignoring this fact.

instead to take over jurisdictions that do not belong to it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, and I could cite others, we believe the 
government should go and do its homework and propose a new bill, 
in six months, that will lend itself more to a consensus with 
environmentalists and the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The job of defending and protecting the environment has become 
extremely difficult at a time of triumphant economism and 
unbridled productivism.  There has never been so much confusion 
between growth and development.  There was no call to add 
Canadian nation building for the purposes of centralization. 
Bill C-33 illustrates once again that only the appetite of the 
most voracious predators equals Ottawa's appetite for power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I am pleased to support the amendment proposed by my 
colleague from Fundy—Royal. I invite all members of this House 
to do likewise, in fact, I implore them to do so.

it is a known 
fact that the government of this Prime Minister is looking every 
day for confrontation with Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, last Saturday in Drummondville near my 
riding, the majority of the Liberal Party of Canada riding 
association presidents asked the Prime Minister to put an end to 
this confrontation.

the protection of wildlife species at risk.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It so happens that the Canadian Constitution that was patriated 
by this Prime Minister in 1982 clearly says that sedentary 
animals, the hare, for example, which lives on a very small 
territory of no more than one square kilometre, are under 
provincial jurisdiction, while animals that roam across the 
North American continent are under federal jurisdiction, and 
Quebec accepts that. Why does the Minister for the Environment 
want, once again, to grab powers that belong to the provinces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see Bill C-33 as a new source of confrontation. When will the 
Prime Minister and the Cabinet respect once and for all the 
provinces and Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague, the member for Jonquière, who 
is our critic for the environment, if she could tell us how she 
intends to try to bring back the Minister for the Environment to 
his senses, now and in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member for 
Frontenac—Mégantic, my assistant on the Standing Committee on 
Environment and Sustainable Development, is very concerned 
about the environment. It should be realized that Bill C-33 will 
create a major confrontation, not only with Quebec, but also with 
the other provincial governments that have their own legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must urgently tell this government—and I hope that all members 
of the House, will do so; at least the members of the Bloc 
Quebecois will—to go back to the drawing board. It is time the 
federal government stopped passing laws that interfere in 
provincial jurisdictions. 
It is not perfect as the government member and former Quebec 
Minister of the Environment said. The provincial laws are not 
perfect, but at least the provinces have the merit of having 
laws to protect threatened species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this government is saying “Move over. We are taking over. 
What you have already done no longer exists”. Moreover, it is 
not just the Minister of the Environment who will have such an 
attitude. All the other ministers will define their priorities, 
including the Minister of Industry, the Minister of Natural 
Resources and so on. Enough is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are again witnessing the government' haugtines. It thinks it 
knows everything and is above everyone else. 
Personally, I think the provinces have already taken a big step. 
It is the federal government that should follow the provinces' 
lead. This is how, from the Bloc Quebecois' perspective, this 
government should act with regard to its policy and its 
legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
before the House adjourns for the summer, the legislative 
process is put in high gear for many bills. I was wondering why 
the government wanted Bill C-33 passed before the summer recess. 
I was driving to the riding of Berthier—Montcalm in my car when I 
suddenly heard the answer on the radio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a comment I am making, and I would like the member, who 
has studied the issue and who follows the minister closely on 
this issue, to tell me whether I am mistaken or whether I got it 
right. On the radio, there was a short segment about Canada's 
wetlands and all the animals that live there. It was a message 
paid for by the federal government, so it was nothing more than 
propaganda on what the government does in that area. 
I thought, would it not be nice if the federal government could 
add to that that it passed a bill on species at risk? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be nice to go into the election campaign with such 
a bill, and to be able to say so on this short segment or on any 
other segment paid for by the federal government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a way for the government to tell people that it is so 
good, that it is so smart and that it protects species at risk. 
Even though this is not its jurisdiction, even though this could 
alienate the provinces and even though Quebec does extraordinary 
things in that area, it does not matter. The federal government, 
our big brother, has money and it uses our tax money, taxes paid 
by Quebecers and Canadians, to pay for its propaganda. I think I 
got that answer on the radio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know from the member, who is very familiar with 
this issue, which she follows closely, and who does excellent 
work in the area of the environment, whether or not I am right 
with regard to the federal government's motivation in wanting to 
pass Bill C-33 at all costs before the summer recess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague 
from 
Berthier—Montcalm and tell him that he is definitely a visionary. 
He was bang on target with this. This is exactly what the 
government wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the third time that the government is trying to bring 
forward a bill respecting the protection of wildlife species at 
risk. It did it first in 1995, then in 1997, and now, in 2000, 
it is back at it again, although it knows quite well—and the hon. 
member for Berthier—Montcalm is right—that habitats are under 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, this segment the member heard is blatant intrusion into 
provincial jurisdiction. The bill ignores that. 
The Liberals even want to interfere with the habitats of 
wildlife species at risk, which are recognised as a provincial 
jurisdiction. There are federal lands, yes, and they are right 
to deal with those lands. However, they have no business on 
provincial lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that my colleague for Berthier—Montcalm is a visionary 
and that the government is up to something. I regret to have to 
say it, but I do not know what the government is up to. It is 
looking for a place to be, an issue to take a stand on, or an 
attitude to show off. I do not know what it is up to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe all Quebecers and all Canadians think that, after two 
mandates and three years into their second mandate, the Liberals 
do not know what to do anymore. They are contemplating an 
election. 
We do not know why, because there is no reason for it.  They are 
looking for all kinds of bills that will give them an in with 
the taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, I do not think this is the way to go.  This 
government must learn that the important thing is to ensure that 
the provinces' areas of jurisdiction are respected and that 
endangered species are clearly covered by legislation while 
respecting provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wish the bill were drafted in such a way. 
That is why the Bloc Quebecois is supporting the Progressive 
Conservatives' amendment calling for a six month hoist so that 
the government may take the time to sit down and think it over, 
to say to itself “That is right, the thing makes no sense.  This 
is a problem that needs to be addressed, but it must be done 
co-operatively”. 
That is not a concept that the Liberals appear to be familiar 
with.  I think that I will write the word co-operatively out for 
them and explain how it is written and what it means.

that I will share this speaking spot with my hon. colleague from 
Churchill River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that there are some mixed feelings as I stand to make 
a few comments regarding Bill C-33 today.  It is a piece of 
legislation dealing with endangered species that we have been 
requesting for many years.  As a matter of fact I can remember, 
going back almost 20 years, groups making representations to 
committees and to us as individual members of parliament saying 
that we need to have such legislation.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States has had endangered species legislation going 
back to 1973.  People were making the case that we needed to have 
it in Canada, particularly in areas where there is the migration 
of animals or migratory birds going between Canada and the United 
States.  After years and years of lobbying we finally now have a 
piece of legislation, Bill C-33, before us which is known as the 
Species at Risk Act or SARA.  It is a long overdue promise now 
before us, but I must say, and I say it with some reluctance, 
this is actually not a very good piece of legislation at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose it is better than nothing but not much better.  As a 
matter of fact it may not even be better than nothing because it 
gives the impression that the government has actually done 
something to take some serious steps toward ensuring that species 
at risk will be protected in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech said that the government would introduce 
legislation to ensure that species at risk and their critical 
natural habitat were protected.  The reality is this legislation 
does not do that.  It does not ensure that species will be 
identified and protected.  It certainly does not ensure that 
habitat will be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two fundamental elements of any kind of endangered species 
legislation, that is the identification and protection of the 
species and the identification and protection of their habitat, 
are not included.  They are absent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is puzzling that it is left to the Minister of the 
Environment or to politicians to decide what species are at risk. 
With all due respect to my parliamentary colleagues, I am not 
sure we are experts in this field.  Well known scientists have 
documented the fact that there are 351 species at risk presently 
in Canada.  These scientists are eminently qualified to make that 
determination.  Now we will turn it over essentially to cabinet. 
They are a nice group of people but they are not really equipped 
to determine what kind of species ought to be identified at risk, 
let alone whether or not the habitat should be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be fair, we might have a good Minister of the Environment or 
there might one in the future who would lead this discussion in 
cabinet, but what if we had a crummy minister of the environment? 
What if a red neck anti-wildlife type of person who was made 
Minister of the Environment and as a result— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian:</B>  It will never happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  It has happened.  We could look at 
Ontario, for example.  Ontario has had as many ministers of the 
environment as we change socks on an annual basis.  Quite frankly 
they are, by their own admission, not qualified to be ministers 
of the environment.  They do not know much about it.  Let us 
imagine if that were the case here.  This legislation would be a 
complete mockery.  Therein lies a crucial weakness in the 
legislation, the fact that we have to take away the aspect where 
politicians will be the final arbitrators of this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a role to play for politicians.  There is a role to 
play for elected representatives.  However when the legislation 
is passed, if in fact it gets passed in the next little while, 
there will not be a single identified species at risk.  In other 
words, we will have to start all over again to develop this list. 
What a crazy process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is embarrassing about it is that our two NAFTA partners, 
Mexico and the United States, have had legislation in place, the 
United States since 1973 and Mexico since 1992.  Both acts are a 
whole lot stronger than this one.  They are concerned about the 
fact that the government says that this has nothing to do with 
species that migrate across interprovincial or international 
borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a moose is wandering around in the forest it does not realize 
it is crossing a border.  A border will not stop it from going 
into Alaska or elsewhere in the United States.  It will not stop 
it from going between Saskatchewan and Alberta or wherever.  Of 
course moose do not behave in that way.  When ducks or geese fly 
around they do not stick to one provincial area.  They are 
crossing provincial boundaries and crossing international 
boundaries.  The legislation does not acknowledge that fact.  It 
does not provide that kind of protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister says that is not their jurisdiction. 
If it is not federal jurisdiction whose jurisdiction is it? There 
are very puzzling elements in the legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in 1992 hon. members will remember that Canada was the very 
first western nation to sign the biological diversity convention. 
That convention requires Canada to pass legislation protecting 
endangered species and their habitat.  That was back in 1992 and 
nothing has happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are now in the year 2000 and legislation has been 
introduced, but I have yet to find a single person who likes the 
legislation.  I have yet to see a single group of people who like 
the legislation.  A vast array of environmental groups have 
lobbied us.  They have visited our offices here and our 
constituency offices.  Many of them are personal friends.  They 
say the legislation just is not on, that it has to be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, even groups like the Canadian Pulp and Paper 
Association and the Canadian Mining Association say the 
legislation needs to be strengthened.  When we have the mining 
association and the pulp and paper or the forestry industry 
saying such things, we have to ask who supports the legislation. 
Before the government brings in legislation we would think 
somebody somewhere would support it.  Even one group or one 
person.  However so far nobody supports it except the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to change the legislation when it gets to committee.  As 
some previous speakers have indicated, it is an all party 
committee.  I think we are all determined to improve the 
legislation.  I have identified a couple of problem areas.  My 
colleagues from Churchill River will undoubtedly reveal some 
other concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should consider that the disappearance of habitat is 
responsible for 80% of the species that disappear.  We are all 
aware from popular literature that as a result of the paving over 
of the countryside, the vast amount of cutting in the forests and 
the occupation of many wilderness areas as a result of tourism 
and travellers that the habitat of many of our species is 
disappearing.  This is something we have to come to grips with, 
as well as the issue of compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, when we protect a particular habitat there has to be 
both a carrot and a club.  The carrot would be to encourage 
people to work to preserve habitat.  If they fail to do so there 
has to be some kind of club that will penalize them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we take productive lands out of use in order to protect a 
habitat some compensation has to be there.  I am thinking 
particularly of the comments of the cattlemen's association to 
this point and the people indirectly involved who would lose 
their means of employment as a result of a protective initiative 
being taken.  They too have to be compensated in some form. These 
are some of the clarifications we will pursue in committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to speak to Bill C-33, the much anticipated Species 
at Risk Act.  In our opinion this is an appropriate title for a 
very weak act because it truly highlights that our species will 
be at risk with the current form of legislation before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleagues from the committee and my hon. colleagues in 
the House on both sides have said that the bill by no means 
addresses everyone's expectations and that there is a lot of work 
to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the record I would like to state that our guiding principle 
was a resolution brought to us at our biennial convention.  It by 
no means waters down any commitment for comprehensive federal 
endangered species legislation.  It must be in co-operation with 
all other governments including provincial ones. Traditional 
aboriginal knowledge and aboriginal communities could help.  The 
guiding principles has been the identification and listing of 
species at risk by an independent committee of scientists.  This 
list would be based on scientific evidence as the primary 
consideration and not on political interpretation of data. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT26"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT26"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1310

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our worst fears by far have come to light with the Species at 
Risk Act.  Bill C-33 is certainly not based on the listing and 
identification of species at risk.  It will not be done wholly or 
confirmed by an independent committee of scientists.  There will 
be a role for the politicians and the executive council of the 
federal government to play in identifying and sanctioning the 
lists of species at risk.  That is of great detriment to this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another guiding principle that we highlighted was a 
comprehensive and nation-wide natural habitat protection 
initiative.  This includes protection of species that range or 
migrate over Canada's domestic and international borders.  As my 
hon. colleague mentioned, there is no protection in this act to 
deal with international boundary migration or interprovincial 
boundary migration.  There is even question in terms of federal 
boundaries or federal jurisdiction that will be further watered 
down and susceptible to interpretation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This major piece of legislation will be worked on in the legal 
system.  It will be translated and interpreted by legal minds in 
light of legal challenges.  We challenge the committee in its 
deliberations to look at the draft and ensure the issue of 
jurisdiction is covered.  We must not be tying our hands on 
federal jurisdiction or federal crown lands.  We have species at 
risk from coast to coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would not impede us in any way to work with the positive 
initiatives, as the other members have mentioned, of other 
provinces to identify species at risk or endangered species in 
their jurisdictions.  We must work with those provinces.  We must 
work with the communities and the industries that would like to 
see a major departure from a lack of legislation to a strong 
piece of legislation that will protect species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another major guiding principle for us that was challenged on 
behalf of our membership was the inclusion of stakeholders in the 
development of species recovery plans, the provision of adequate 
support for those whose livelihood is disrupted by a species 
recovery plan and the provision for a just transition of workers 
and communities which may be affected by recovery plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the whole issue of stakeholders and compensating 
for any loss of land, livelihood or industry that may occur, the 
government should take a respectful view.  In light of the major 
changes in protecting our biodiversity in the country and in the 
world, we may have to take major steps and make harsh decisions. 
We must ensure that we are compassionate to the people impacted 
through loss of livelihood, lands, community and industry that 
may occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These three guiding principles have helped us in our view.  When 
we analyze Bill C-33 we find that the Liberal government lacks 
leadership on all three of these components in the Species at 
Risk Act before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any species at risk must be based on respectful consideration of 
lands and landowners.  This is certainly not reflected in the 
act.  It dwells on it, but there is certainly nothing substantive 
that could make people sleep easier once the act is in place and 
protects species.  If it happens that any of those species were 
found on their property they should have respectful 
consideration.  That respectful consideration is not entrenched 
in this act.  It must be spelled out clearly.  It must point out 
the protocols to be followed in relations between governments and 
landowners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue the Liberal government has missed in the provision 
of leadership is science based decision making. Canadians know 
all too well the government's record in profit and politics.  As 
we read the headlines time and time again, politics sometimes 
serves the best interest of the ministers' or the Prime 
Minister's decision making, and sometimes to the detriment of the 
environment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment is sometimes not viewed as an election winner at 
voting time.  Certainly people do not stand up to democratically 
represent species or animals.  They certainly do not stand up to 
say they represent the land or the species that live on the land. 
Most voters usually stand up to be counted for their interests 
and those of their family and children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message for all Canadians is that we must make a direct 
connection to the land, the water and the many species which our 
lives depend on.  Let us speak in their best interests and not 
only for our personal or family's interests.  Democratically we 
represent Canada literally from coast to coast to coast.  All 
living things within it should be represented in the House of 
Commons and it should be reflected in an act that is designed to 
protect the species of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act must also include specific references, which is a very 
crucial rule not only in scientific knowledge but also in 
aboriginal traditional ecological knowledge.  It has now been 
recognized that this knowledge has weight and interpretation and 
the translation of it should not be missed in terms of the 
specific or immediate scientific knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal traditional knowledge plays a major role in setting 
the assessment of the ecological cycles. These are not necessarily 
monthly nor according to food, financial, budgetary or calendar 
cycles.  Some ecological cycles last for 5, 7, 10, 15 and 20 
years.  That knowledge may not be readily available in the 
scientific manuals or journals of the day, but it is entrenched 
in the knowledge of many traditional land users, in our 
communities and in our stories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industries have been created such as trapping, fishing and 
hunting.  A lot of people are aware that these are industries and 
also are a very big part of the livelihoods of our communities. 
Not only is hunting, outfitting and fishing a viable tourism 
option, but it is also a very sustainable living. Acquiring some 
foods in that way displaces the high cost of hamburger and 
potatoes. A lot of traditional people depend on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adequate funding mechanisms for biodiversity sciences and 
cataloguing of information from across this great country is also 
required.  Research and development is needed for understanding 
the lands and waters.  The Hudson plain which surrounds Hudson 
Bay, one of Canada's largest watersheds, is an example. There are 
huge freshwater bodies in the Hudson plain but there is no 
scientific picture in that area.  There is no collection of data 
from the traditional communities incorporated into a data bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact of climate change just on the water studies of that 
region is an immediate necessity.  There are also the 
transboundary pollutants, just like persistent organic pollutants 
that have been studied in the far north.  The mid-Canada north 
should certainly be respected in that area. That is why the 
Hudson plain should be seriously looked at.  It is a huge 
spawning ground for many of our fish.  Migratory birds are in 
those regions at this time rejuvenating their species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the committee will certainly have to roll up their 
sleeves in order to make a sound species at risk act for the 
country.  There are high expectations not only in this country 
but there are challenges internationally.  Canada has made 
international commitments as is evidenced by the convention on 
biodiversity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to protect our species at risk. Let us do it in a 
meaningful way, but let us create a piece of legislation that has 
the power to make these promises as strong as possible for the 
betterment of our future.

a pleasure to speak to Bill C-33, the species at risk legislation 
which has been brought in by the present government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the other members who have commented on the legislation, I 
regret to say I am a bit critical of it.  I am critical of it 
because of some obvious flaws in the legislation and because of 
the government's apparent lack of will and the half-hearted 
attitude it has brought to this legislation, and its total 
inability to bring all the stakeholders on side. Not only are 
business and industry disrespectful and not supportive of the 
legislation, but the environmental groups and lobbyists are also 
disrespectful and not supportive of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to start my speech with some comments taken from 
the speech of our party's environment critic, the member for 
Fundy—Royal.  I would like to quote a paragraph from his opening 
remarks. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has 351 species that are recognized as endangered or at 
risk. There is no federal law to protect these species. The 
government's proposed species at risk act, known as SARA, is long 
overdue. It is a long overdue promise, but it is very 
disappointing. This legislation is even weaker and less effective 
than Bill C-65, the 1996 federal endangered species bill, which 
died before the 1997 election. This new bill is unacceptably 
ineffective in several key areas, particularly habitat 
protection.  The main threat facing endangered species is the 
destruction of their habitat, the places where species breed, 
where they feed and where they raise their young. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read over the excellent speech of the member for Fundy—Royal. 
I was quite intrigued with that comment, but I would add one 
more point to the point he was making.  Bill C-65 was brought 
forward in 1996 and died before the 1997 election.  I predict the 
same type of demise for this legislation.  It is not supported by 
any of the parties in the House and is not supported by the 
Canadian public in general. I suspect the bill could die before 
the election in the fall of 2000, which the government has gone 
to great task lately to say will not happen, which is a pretty 
sure sign that it will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be pointed out that the Progressive Conservative 
Party of Canada was awarded an <I>A</I> grade on our paper, 
“Carrots Before Sticks”, for our outline of an effective 
endangered species legislation.  The Liberal document which is 
before the House was awarded a <I>D</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the government has missed out on this bill completely. 
It fails to understand what Canadian industry and 
environmentalists are looking for.  It fails to understand much 
of what was alluded to by the New Democratic member who spoke 
previously, that whole principle of stewardship of the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most people, farmers, forestry operators, landowners, city 
dwellers, first nations, Canadians anywhere, have some 
understanding of stewardship of the land.  I grew up in rural 
Nova Scotia and I have a keen understanding of it coming from a 
hunting, fishing and farming background. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to leave something in this country and on this 
planet for our sons and daughters and their sons and daughters, 
we have to have a different approach to the way we look at 
species at risk and our interaction with the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party endorses recommendations put 
forward by the species at risk working group, a multi-stakeholder 
association that involved both industry and environmental groups. 
The group examined ideas for an ideal bill, not this bill.  It 
included representation from the Canadian Pulp and Paper 
Association, the Mining Association of Canada, the Sierra Club of 
Canada, the Canadian Nature Federation and the Canadian Wildlife 
Federation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those groups do not ordinarily get together in one room and 
agree on anything.  Obviously they are looking at this 
legislation and saying that there is a need and how can they 
formulate an approach they can agree with, that they can combine 
forces and overcome some of the obstacles and put forward a piece 
of legislation that will be helpful to wildlife, the environment 
and Canadians in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If mining, pulp and paper and environmentalists can devise a 
workable solution, then the Progressive Conservative Party will 
certainly endorse their plan.  We recognize that extinction is 
forever.  As a result, we believe that all Canadians want strong 
and effective endangered species legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The status of a given species is a matter of scientific fact, 
not of political choice.  It is for this reason the Progressive 
Conservative Party believes there has to be effective legislation 
that must take action based on sound science.  We are also 
committed to protecting the rights of landowners and users.  We 
believe that no single individual or entity should bear the 
burden of recovery of any species when the benefits of the 
species protection are for all society to appreciate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a pretty simple theory.  That is not a complicated 
concept for the government or Canadians to grasp and they should 
embrace that concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was mentioned earlier that the legislation in the United 
States has been very powerful in protecting species to a degree, 
but it has also been a deterrent to protecting species. Anyone 
who has followed the debate in the U.S. should know that among 
many of the landowners there are two points which they like to 
discuss.  It is the two <I>s</I> points: first they shoot it and 
then they bury it, or shovel it.  That is not the approach we 
want to take in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to bring in legislation which is so difficult to 
abide by that when individuals, farmers, forestry operators, mine 
operators, aboriginal groups, recreational groups and developers 
come across an endangered species, we force them to get rid of 
it.  That does not work.  We have to encourage them.  That means 
the government is going to have to open up its purse strings. It 
is going to have to find some ways to encourage that, and it will 
probably be a financial incentive, to protect the species at risk 
and to build a comprehensive plan around it that will allow for 
continued protection in the years to come.  That is why the 
Conservative Party believes that when designing a recovery plan, 
the bulk of the decision making should be left to the 
stakeholders and not the Liberal cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a few simple points which I would like to repeat.  If 
an endangered species is found in a given area, then the 
landowner must be doing something right and he should be given 
all the tools to continue.  He should not be penalized.  He 
should not be told that there is a part of his quarter section or 
his 250 acre woodlot that he will not be able touch from now on. 
We have to find a way to compensate people to protect that 
endangered species which happens to be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to know a few things about the species.  Is it a species 
that is simply passing through?  Is it a breeding ground?  Is it 
habitat that they depend upon?  Is that endangered species plant 
or animal?  Is it migratory?  There are a number of issues and 
points that we need to better understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with and support the recognition for voluntary 
measures.  We fully endorse stewardship as a means of providing 
protection for species and their critical habitat.  We endorse a 
graduated approach to stewardship with a full tool kit from 
material designed to engage the stakeholders positively in this 
process.  This could include tax incentives, habitat grants, 
scientific support and in some instances it may need to include 
compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party believes that simply making criminals out of 
landowners will not save endangered species anymore than making 
criminals out of law-abiding gun owners will make society any 
safer.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several core components of our species at risk debate: 
to protect critical habitat; to use carrots before sticks; to 
form partnerships with the provinces; to have a full and 
comprehensive scientific listing of species; and, the protection 
for endangered species and their habitat.  We need recovery plans 
and accountability mechanisms for citizens to ensure government 
forces act on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go back to point number six that I raised regarding the 
recovery plan.  We support legislation that commits to a firm 
target and time lines for designing and implementing an 
appropriate recovery plan for endangered species, whether they 
are endangered, threatened or vulnerable.  I would like to use 
for comparison the wild Atlantic salmon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wild Atlantic salmon population is in critical decline and 
the federal government needs to address this problem immediately. 
People are already saying that it is a crisis situation and the 
numbers back them up.  The wild salmon stock has dropped from 1.6 
million 25 years ago to only 350,000 this year.  I would state 
that the 350,000 is probably a generous estimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Gold River in Nova Scotia, which I live beside, is a small 
salmon river.  We used to have a run of salmon come up in the 
spring every year.  It was not a run like the Margaree, the 
Miramichi or any of the big salmon rivers in Nova Scotia or New 
Brunswick but it was a great little run of fish.  We would get 
anywhere from 350 to 600 fish in that river.  We would see them 
in the pools 25 or 30 at a time.  We do not see that today. It is 
no good taking my kids down to the salmon pool to show them a 
salmon jumping up over the falls or coming up the run because it 
would probably take five trips before we would see one.  It is a 
matter of bringing these fish back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Atlantic Salmon Federation is looking for $50 million in 
funding spread out over a five year period.  This would allow the 
federation to tag, track and monitor stocks and provide valuable 
insight into the problems facing this species.  Many different 
factors could be contributing to the declining numbers, including 
pollution and dams, but more research is needed if the wild 
Atlantic salmon is going to be restored to its former abundance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has had an opportunity to act on this species.  I 
am not talking about all the other species at risk.  I am talking 
about this particular one, the wild Atlantic salmon.  The 
government has failed to provide the much needed funding for 
raising salmon smolts and the salmon parr for release into our 
rivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We proved through our wildlife and salmon associations a decade 
ago that river specific salmon did much better than just any 
salmon dropped into our tributaries and our water courses. The 
government has known about this but has completely stopped 
advancing moneys for the hatchery program in Nova Scotia, and in 
fact has closed it down.  It tried to divest it to individuals 
but most of those hatcheries have since failed. It put a little 
money into a few of them this year just to get the fish out of 
the hatcheries but there was no comprehensive plan.  Meanwhile 
the salmon numbers continue to dwindle and diminish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government talks about endangered species but, quite 
frankly, talk is cheap.  We have seen that for too many years 
from this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The core components of our species at risk legislation has been 
explained and debated and put forth at committee by our member 
for Fundy—Royal.  It is critical that we look at protecting 
habitat.  We have to find a non-intrusive way to do that.  It is 
critical that we use carrots before sticks.  We have to 
encourage, recognize and reward stewardship by offering more 
carrots and resorting to fewer sticks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adequate funding, which I talked about a moment ago, is needed 
to implement activities designed to support the stakeholders in 
their efforts to recover and protect endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party believes a new bill should apply to all lands 
except where equivalent provincial legislation is in place.  If 
we listened to the debate from the members of the Bloc Quebecois, 
that is exactly what they were talking about.  They were talking 
about jurisdiction overlap and whose responsibility it was for 
certain species.  Obviously this government has not figured that 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need another Kyoto where the provinces are forced to 
pay for a plan imposed upon them by the federal government. The 
provinces themselves should be provided with sufficient resources 
to address the issue and to ensure protective and effective 
enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party supports scientific listing of a species at risk 
and of the identification of the critical habitat required for 
its recovery.   The PC Party believes a committee of wildlife 
experts should be charged with this task.  It should be a matter 
of science, not a matter of politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We go on to the protection for endangered species and their 
habitat.  The PC Party supports the immediate prohibition against 
the harming of any endangered species or its residence, and the 
protection of the critical habitat of species through either 
co-operative agreements or legal measures following a 
multi-stakeholder recovery plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we do not believe is simply implementing some program where 
there has been no reaching out to the stakeholders group, that 
there has been no co-operative effort on and that is little 
understood and little supported by the people who will be most 
affected by it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need some accountability built into the process. We need a 
mechanism for citizens to ensure that the government enforces its 
own act.  If the act is to include an accountability mechanism 
then the PC Party believes that there should be an independent 
process for the public to ensure the act is being effectively 
implemented.  This process should allow citizens to challenge the 
federal government and not other citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need to make this act complicated.  We do not need to 
make this act somehow a confrontation between our forestry 
operators, our farmers and our fishermen.  What we need is to 
bring in an act that encourages the protection of species at 
risk.  What we have is an act that fails to recognize that all 
important tenet. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I have enjoyed listening to the comments by my 
hon. counterpart from South Shore, Nova Scotia.  Would he care to 
comment on how he would reconcile several of the points he has 
made during his debate on endangered species with legislation 
recently passed by the Government of Nova Scotia, which is the 
same party as his. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also suggest that he consider the high regard with which 
that legislation is held throughout Canada.  It is considered to 
be a model.  In so being considered, it is a rather stringent 
piece of legislation.  Could he share his insights with us in 
that regard? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will go back to what 
the hon. member from the Bloc party stated about jurisdiction. We 
talked a bit about jurisdiction and the importance of recognizing 
that in the federal legislation.  What I was actually talking 
about was that the fatal flaw in this piece of legislation is 
that it really does not understand jurisdiction and, therefore, 
will not protect species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation passed in Nova Scotia is certainly important 
legislation but it is provincial legislation.  We need to look at 
a federal comprehensive plan that will encompass all the 
ingredients of species at risk legislation.  This means that most 
of it will be under federal jurisdiction but that we also have to 
recognize where there is provincial jurisdiction.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the critical flaws in this legislation is that it does 
not recognize jurisdiction and it does not compensate nor fully 
understand the obligations, responsibilities and needs of 
landowners.  I say that as a farmer, as a forestry operator and 
as someone who has come into contact with species at risk.  I 
understand what it is like to have a contract to cut a couple of 
hundred or couple of thousand acres of land and to all of a 
sudden discover there is a heron's nesting ground or an eagle's 
nest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe there is an operator out there who wants to 
abrogate the law, to break it or to put more species at risk in 
danger.  People are responsible but we need the legislation that 
gives them the tools to do that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure today to be here 
to debate Bill C-33, an act respecting the protection of wildlife 
species at risk in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I begin my comments, I want to point out that I am 
personally involved in agriculture in my riding of 
Selkirk—Interlake.  I am a cattle rancher and holder of several 
thousand acres of land, which is necessary for our cattle 
operation in that area.  As a result, I am not totally unbiased 
in the debate today.  However, I would like to point out that as 
cattle ranchers and farmers in the Interlake area of Manitoba, we 
are totally dependent on having an environment that is 
sustainable for the wildlife around us and sustainable for the 
agricultural pursuits in which we happen to be involved. In my 
case that involves cattle.  In order to produce cattle we need a 
good environment with good grasslands, good forestry and a clean 
water supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having made my position clear, I want to go on with some 
comments with regard to this specific bill.  The summary, as put 
forward by the minister, states that the purpose of this 
enactment is to prevent Canadian indigenous species, sub-species 
and distinct populations of wildlife from becoming extirpated or 
extinct and to provide for the recovery of endangered or 
threatened species.  It also encourages the management of other 
species to prevent them from becoming at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People need to know that this legislation covers every 
biological diversity in the country except bacteria and viruses. 
For instance, it includes our continental shelves off the shores 
of our coasts and the biological organisms that are contained 
therein, such as fish species and shellfish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the minister having a certain amount of say 
and authority over this, we can look back to when I was on the 
fisheries and oceans committee where we saw that the government's 
management of the cod fishery and the fishery off the coast was 
less than desirable.  The basic problem at that time was that the 
government had a political agenda to deal with that was more 
important to it than what was happening in the oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we saw was that the information, reports and critical 
analysis that were being put forward by the scientists to the 
minister were not being relayed to the general public where they 
would have received attention from individuals, environmental 
groups, fishermen and from all concerned people who would have 
said “Hold on a minute, what you are ignoring here you should 
not be ignoring.  The reports from the scientists should override 
political considerations”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill establishes the committee on the status of endangered 
wildlife in Canada. 
It is to be an independent body of experts responsible for 
assessing and identifying the species at risk. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea is great.  I believe that is what should be done. 
However, we have to remember, as we do with all things involving 
animals, trade and certainly the protection of species, that this 
should be totally science based and should not go running off, as 
I mentioned with regard to the fishery off the east coast, into 
political decision making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Science is fine and dandy, as long as the science, the reports 
and the analyses that are put forward are accessible to the 
public.  They should be totally and unreservedly put out for 
public scrutiny, not only by people with lay knowledge of the 
issues, but also other scientists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have seen with government paid for and sponsored studies 
is that quite often this science based information is not 
available for general public scrutiny.  As a result, it gives the 
minister an opportunity to deal with the information, to keep it 
secret, or to put out little snippets that help support his or 
her particular point of view.  That will make this legislation 
less than perfect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see that the minister not have the final 
authority with regard to the endangered species list, but in fact 
that there be a requirement in the bill that all the information 
be made public so that various NGOs, for instance the Canadian 
cattlemen, the farm lobby groups and the environmental groups, 
have an opportunity to come to each and every MP and say that 
this particular species should or should not be on the list and 
convince members of the House, all 301 of us.  I think the list 
could be brought to the House for approval as opposed to the 
minister simply saying “I think these are fine, and this one 
should not be on the list” for reasons that are not clearly in 
the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue with regard to government scientists, which has been 
brought forward quite extensively, is the fact of muzzling 
reports which they put forward.  I have mentioned this, that 
there should be clear guidelines in the legislation to ensure 
that those reports are automatically made public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wildlife in Canada is the property of the crown and is subject 
to provincial jurisdiction.  The animals, birds and fish species 
that are not are the ones that migrate from province to province 
or cross international boundaries, those of the United States and 
Mexico in particular, but also right through the whole Americas. 
As a result, there is a federal responsibility for these species. 
Environment Canada, through the Canadian Wildlife Service, has a 
mandated responsibility to conserve these migratory birds and 
their habitat through the Migratory Birds Convention Act and the 
Canada Wildlife Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as an example of man not being the know-all and the be-all 
when it comes to the management of species, there has been 
considerable depredation of habitat, particularly nesting habitat 
in the Arctic with regard to the snow geese, the white geese, 
that have become so numerous that the balance in nature has been 
upset to the point where the species itself is destroying the 
habitat, which will ultimately end up in starvation and death 
among the newborn birds in the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the problem is the efforts through various groups and 
governments to restrict and prohibit hunting.  With man being so 
populous and numerous in the world today, hunting is part of the 
overall management control of a species.  I think there should be 
less negativity put forward with regard to hunting which would 
help keep these species in check.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been talk and there will be some changes to the 
hunting legislation with regard to the snow geese which will 
allow for a greater harvest of those birds, which can be used for 
food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wildlife Federation, along with other farm groups, 
has been lobbying and putting forward information concerning 
predator damage and crop damage from migratory birds, as well as 
other issues.  I would like to point out on behalf of farmers 
that they put out a broader message.  They proposed in 1998 that 
the national agriculture stewardship program provide critical 
direction while we make the decisions we are currently involved 
in.  They anticipated that the program would prove to be a model 
for other programs addressing environmental needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To show the broad thinking of farmers and their representatives, 
they say, for example, that there should be funding for 
endangered species recovery plans and we should be providing 
broader incentives to landowners to maintain and enhance habitat 
and biodiversity.  That brings out the point quite clearly that 
our farmers, ranchers and other people engaged in agriculture do 
think of the bigger picture and are not simply thinking of 
production and profit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One issue put forward by the Canadian Federation of Agriculture 
with regard to essential components was that it wanted to ensure 
that conditional 100% compensation would be provided.  Among the 
11 recommendations, it wanted to see that there be permanent and 
flexible fiscal management from year to year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Working with agriculture, with the landowners, with the forestry 
industry, with the fishermen on the oceans, on our Great Lakes 
and on the freshwater lakes of the prairies, co-operation is the 
key and the essence to making any endangered species legislation 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation put forward by the minister is lacking in that 
it does not state specifically that the federal government has a 
total commitment to working in co-operation with the provinces 
and the landowners.  The provinces are mentioned in the 
legislation, as well as landowners, but the specifics of how and 
when and under what circumstances compensation would be paid is 
important.  As we have seen so many times, co-operation with the 
provinces does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last couple of points I will make are with regard to the 
specific policy of the Canadian Alliance.  We are committed to 
protecting and preserving Canada's natural environment and its 
endangered species and to the sustainable development of our 
abundant natural resources for the use of current and future 
generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance maintains that for any endangered species 
legislation to be effective it must respect the fundamental 
rights of private property owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, on the very lake where my ranch is located, North 
Shore Lake, it is my understanding that we have a species which 
is at risk at this time called the piping plover.  North Shore 
Lake has risen to such high water levels that the shoreline where 
they nest and feed is actually under water, with only a small 
portion remaining.  This brings to the forefront the fact that 
all of us are affected, no matter where we live in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has the responsibility to do what it can 
to preserve habitat.  In order to do that it has to have the

necessary funding in the case of North Shore Lake for an outlet 
to that lake, which is non-existent at this time, to maintain the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have a serious question to ask the member who just 
spoke.  He did a great job in his presentation.  However, before 
I ask the question, I remember reading not long ago on the 
Internet a dilemma:  What does one do if one finds an animal that 
is an endangered species eating a plant that has been defined as 
being endangered?  It is one of those deep thoughts to ponder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My serious question pertains to a question that one of my farmer 
friends in my constituency asked.  He wanted to know, if he could 
somehow be shown, either directly or indirectly, to be 
responsible for the danger and perhaps the killing of a member of 
an endangered species, and if he could lose his farm over that, 
because the proposed fines are of the magnitude that would 
basically put the farmer out of business, what would be his 
recourse? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that perhaps there would be a series of unintended 
consequences from the bill, that when farmers make sure that the 
margins of their sloughs and so on become totally uninhabitable 
so that those endangered species do not even go there, there will 
actually be less available land for endangered species than there 
is now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask for my colleague's comments on that, if he has some 
knowledge of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with respect to one 
endangered species eating another endangered species, I would say 
that we in the House have the audacity of man.  We think that we 
are all-knowing, wonderful and can figure everything out.  Mother 
Nature runs Earth.  Many people believe that global warming has 
more to do with nature than it does with man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To a certain extent, species have always become extinct, will 
always become extinct, and while we are on this Earth we have to 
get along and preserve what we can while we are here.  However, 
we should not delude ourselves into thinking that we can preserve 
every species forever, with unlimited resources being thrown at 
them, while there are children who are starving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to habitat, in many provinces there are wildlife 
management areas that have been set up, operations like Ducks 
Unlimited, which in my riding foster areas known to be the main 
wildlife tourist destinations in Canada.  Farmers and 
agricultural people are providing habitat, including the saving 
of sloughs on the prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member will still have seven 
minutes of questions and comments when we return to debate after 
question period, if he so wishes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

of course, we know that party is not interested in these grants 
and contributions.  It does not want to help Canadians improve 
their levels of literacy.  It does not want to help Canadians who 
are disabled to find work.  We know that is the case but if the 
hon. member would like to do it, I would be thrilled to provide 
her with the information. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Liberals talked about this when 
they were in opposition because they did not get any of the 
glory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This briefing book was not prepared just for the fun of it.  It 
was the result of a specific request by the minister in August of 
last year.  Instead of having her department clean up the billion 
dollar boondoggle mess, she had it put together lengthy briefing 
notes on how to get more publicity for her handouts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was the minister so concerned about publicity and so 
unconcerned about the billion dollar bungle? 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, do you know what else we did?  We 
provided 10,000 pages of all the grants and contributions in 
every single riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member, when she received that information, 
did she think to call those organizations and ask them about how 
the money was being used?  Did she think to talk to the 
individuals who are benefiting as a result of these investments? 
I think not. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to further suggest that 
the minister asked that the special ministerial briefing book on 
grants and contributions list a number of HRDC programs and the 
role MPs play in every one of them.  For example on youth 
employment initiatives it says, “on a monthly basis, regions 
will inform national headquarters of successful projects that 
would offer good visibility for the minister”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that not really what the grants and contributions are all 
about, visibility for the minister? 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what the grants and contributions 
programs are all about is helping Canadians who are in need to 
get the services that they need so they can participate in 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it were not for that party, we would not have to defend 
against the attacks it is making on Canadians, on the individuals 
who are benefiting from these grants and contributions and who 
quite frankly feel they are being chastised as people who are not 
worthy of our investment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in early August 1999 the minister asked for a special 
briefing book on MP involvement in 25 grants and contributions 
programs giving important detail such as,  “In Newfoundland the 
former Minister of Fisheries and Oceans announced all term job 
creation projects regardless of the constituency.  That process 
may now change with the new minister assuming her 
responsibilities”.  That is what she said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister deny that political visibility lies at the 
heart of these HRDC grants? 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, again, what lies at the heart of these 
grants and contributions is recognizing there is a role for the 
Government of Canada to play not only in supporting communities 
that want to participate fully in our country, but most 
particularly in supporting individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we know to be true now after five months of its ranting and 
raving is that party is not interested in Canadians who need 
help, Canadians who want to improve their literacy skills, who 
want to as Canadians with disabilities participate in the economy 
of this country, young people who want to get that important 
first job.  Let those members come clean with their real agenda 
here. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a little more from the grants and contributions 
briefing book that the minister had prepared.  We learn that all 
federal government announcements for the grants under the 
employment benefit and support measures, a series of programs 
worth $2.1 billion a year by the way, are “at the discretion of 
the minister”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was the minister demonstrating her discretion by creating 
publicity for the Liberals instead of preventing another billion 
dollar boondoggle? 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, again the hon. member gives me the 
opportunity to remind the House and Canadians that $1 billion is 
not missing.  In fact, $1 billion has been invested in 
communities right across the country to help Canadians in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is very interesting here is time and again members of that 
party opposite focus on grants and contributions. 
What they are really saying is those men and women who have been 
supported by these programs should not be supported.  What they 
talk about is the waste of government dollars.  We do not see 
that to be a waste at all.

<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Canadians know that the Liberal government leaks 
like a sieve, yet another government audit has shown that a 
significant amount of defence department contract information was 
slipped to two Canadian companies bidding on parts of a $10 
billion frigate program. The audit implicates a senior official 
and clerical staff and speaks of documents being removed without 
authorization.  If true, criminal acts may have been committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the interest of regaining public confidence which is waning, 
will the minister disclose the names of the companies which 
received this sensitive information so that an independent 
investigation can occur? 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, a number of allegations were made and 
most of them were found not to be true. There are some that are 
still under investigation.  In fact, the two companies, and I do 
not know which ones they were, which are alleged to have had 
information did not get contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is fair to say that overall we should put this in the 
context of saying this is one of the largest and one of the most 
complex procurement projects ever undertaken in this country. 
Out of it we got 12 state of the art world class frigates and it 
was all done under budget and on schedule. 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, that does not restore confidence about the system 
itself.  Years of cuts to the defence budget have hobbled the 
military and made it very difficult for it to conduct 
investigations of security breaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerns of office security for the frigate project became the 
subject of a 1995 segment of <I>W5</I>.  Since that time the audit 
has found that five complaints against the department merit 
investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a pretty good idea who was responsible for the breach, 
yet the department does not want to pin it on anybody and again, 
no names have been released.  Will the minister call in the RCMP

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

take the appropriate action. It is not true that any cutting of 
resources has resulted in any less of an investigation. That 
would not be an appropriate thing to do and that is not what we 
are doing at all.

first, I want to say how much we welcomed the report we received 
from the provincial and territorial ministers last week.  It is a 
very helpful contribution, but it does point to the fact that the 
health care system is under cost pressures that are only going to 
rise.  It is all the more important for us to get this system 
sustainable by making the kind of constructive change that is 
needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to working with my provincial and territorial 
partners to that effect.  We are off to a good start.  Yesterday

care since it came to office.  The report states that health care 
expenditures are expected to increase a whopping 247% over the 
next 25 years.   It is a question of priorities.  This government 
now spends $15 billion on health and social transfers and $17 
billion on boondoggle prone grants and contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are boondoggles more important to this government than the 
health care of Canadians?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
over the last two years there has been a 25% increase in cash 
transfers to provinces for health.  When we came to office in 
1993 the total transfers to provinces were $28 billion per year. 
This year they will exceed $30 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from providing more money, and more money we will provide, 
the other thing we have to do as a Liberal government is to stand 
guard over the Canadian public health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance would rescind the Canada Health Act and 
replace it with an American style private for profit health care

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

area, the government said in the budget—and in fact I repeated 
this last week before the House of Commons finance 
committee—personal income taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best proof is that of the $58 billion minimum tax cut that

banks, will he have anything to say to Canada's children?  Not 
only is Canada failing internationally, as pointed out by the

Canada, with a stroke of a pen, wants to change the low income

Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cut the middle income rate from 26% to 24%, on its way to 
23%.  We are increasing the child tax benefit, the very people

my question is for the Minister for International Trade.  One day

</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that the minister has already indicated in committee that 
he does not intend to seek this kind of investor state dispute

reinterpreting it?

of the NAFTA that we signed with two trade partners, Mexico and 
the United States.  We are confident that it has helped the 
Canadian economy a great deal.  The NAFTA is a very solid 
agreement that has helped to promote Canadian exports a great 
deal in North America.

has not happened.  In the new children's agenda child care is 
barely mentioned.

mistake was made.  The petitioners put in a figure and, I was

<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is always a pleasure to be 
able to stand in the House to talk about successes.  I am 
referring to successes that we achieve when we all work together 
in partnership for a common goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed act before us will confirm the advantages to Canada 
that flow from co-operation among partners working together to 
address issues of national importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5, an act to establish the Canadian tourism commission, 
is another example of this government delivering on its promises. 
Hon. members are being asked today, for example, to approve the 
creation of a new crown corporation.  If the House agrees, much 
more than a new corporation will be established.  By supporting 
this bill, members from all sides will be telling Canadians that 
the federal government has the ability to work co-operatively to 
produce significant economic benefits for every region of our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tourism is a very unique sector.  Although it is led by the 
private sector, it contributes to Canada's public policy 
objectives and melds national, regional and, of course, local 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Improved partnering between the private sector and governments 
will result in a greater impact on our target markets in the face 
of much sharper international competition, for example.  Already 
one of our country's largest industries, tourism, generates 
thousands of jobs and economic growth in every part of our 
country, in every province and territory, in aboriginal 
communities and and many municipalities. 
Let me point out that last year alone the sector brought in more 
than $50 billion and employed well over half a million Canadians 
right across our country. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT53"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT53"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1525

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point that out that this sector is 
essential to regional development plans of governments at all 
levels.  As hon. members can see, the success of tourism sectors 
and public policy are very much intertwined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next, let me comment on the Canadian Tourism Commission and its 
successful partnership between the private sector and government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the tourism industry's call for improved partnerships 
that was a key factor in the Prime Minister's decision to 
establish the original commission in 1995.  The private sector 
contributed so significantly to financing and marketing 
activities that the original projections for partnership 
contributions to match federal core funding were very soon 
exceeded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The partnership has endured and matured, and the proposed act to 
turn the commission into a crown corporation will solidify this 
partnership and provide the conditions for which it can continue 
to prosper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of the crown corporation is the result of 
consultation, negotiation and agreement, let me point out, among 
all the partners, many of whom sit on the commission's board of 
directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, the purpose of creating the crown 
corporation is to equip the commission with the legal, financial 
and management tools that it needs to carry out its mandate even 
more effectively.  Currently, as a special operating agency, it 
cannot fully operate as it must, using for example private sector 
management and accounting practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, crown status will give the commission the increased 
financial flexibility it needs as a marketing agency with strong 
international competitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, crown status will give the commission greater 
flexibility in managing the human resources required to respond 
to the marketplace and its partners needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, as a crown corporation the commission will have an even 
more effective board of directors.  The management of the 
commission will no longer be split between Industry Canada and 
the board.  Under the proposed act the board will manage all the 
affairs of the commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members can see what can be achieved when there is a 
willingness to work together and co-operate.  Here is an example 
of government making a vital contribution while respecting and 
expediting the work of the private sector partners who are taking 
the lead on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a winner on our hands here:  The small and medium sized 
businesses that make up the tourism sector benefit. The 
government's job and growth strategy is continuously advanced to 
create jobs for Canadians.  The new corporation will further 
demonstrate our commitment to the renewal of federalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, all Canadians support tourism.  Domestic travel 
accounts for 70% of the sector's revenue.  Every year, in ever 
greater numbers, Canadians are discovering their home, thanks in 
large part to the broad marketing efforts of the commission in 
collaboration with its partners.  Beyond the mere addition of 
dollars and cents, we are richer for this, as we learn more about 
the geographic and cultural diversity that our country has to 
offer in the various regions.  This should be encouraged on all 
fronts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing let me say that I am confident that my colleagues 
here will understand and know the effectiveness of Bill C-5.  I 
look forward to their support on this bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak today on Bill C-5, an act 
to establish the Canadian tourism commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and my Canadian Alliance colleagues are opposed to the bill 
because it would establish one more unneeded and unnecessary 
crown corporation.  In fact, we want to see the vast majority of 
the crown corporations that currently exist privatized and out of 
government hands.  I therefore disagree with the parliamentary 
secretary when he says that people in the House will be pleased. 
We are not pleased with it and we do not want to see it turned 
into a crown corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance has deep philosophical issues with crown 
corporations.  We believe that most of the functions performed by 
our current crop of crown corporations are unnecessary and should 
be carried out by those who can best perform the task most cost 
efficiently, with the greatest accountability to the owners and 
with the least likelihood of incurring public debt.

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That simply does not match up with what the government is 
proposing in terms of establishing another crown corporation, 
this one the Canadian Tourism Association. From this viewpoint, 
there are very few good reasons to create and maintain another 
crown corporation.  In fact there is overwhelming evidence that 
in the vast majority of cases, private sector ownership and 
control is better than government dabbling in business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>EDC is another one of those.  We have looked at EDC a number of 
times and have seen a lot of shortcomings with it.  I will be 
using that example in many parts of my speech today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance believes that crown corporations should be 
converted to the public sector institutions, left as a division 
within a government department, or discontinued altogether.  This 
time we are told it is the Canadian Tourism Commission that 
requires crown corporation status to better serve the Canadian 
tourism industry and thus the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been studying this issue at the industry committee for 
some time.  We have heard from a lot of witnesses, but I have not 
been convinced and I do not think that even the parliamentary 
secretary was convinced of the overwhelming need to turn this 
tourism association into a crown corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that case has been made.  In fact most of the 
arguments from the witnesses that I heard at committee seemed to 
support the privatization of the Canadian Tourism Commission if 
anything.  They told us that it needs to be taken out from under 
the arm of the Department of Industry because it needs 
flexibility, regulation and speed in decision making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest we cannot have it both ways.  It cannot be both a 
government department and have the flexibility of a private 
business.  If it wants to be under government and have government 
rules, it should stay just as it is now without converting to a 
crown corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The advocates of the transformation claim that the new crown 
corporation will be able to advance the cause of tourism more 
efficiently and effectively, more rapidly than is the case with 
the Canadian Tourism Commission as it currently operates. Of 
course, as a division of Industry Canada, CTC is directly 
accountable to the Minister of Industry.  The minister therefore 
is accountable to parliament.  That may gum up the system a 
little, but that is the way it should remain until the commission 
is privatized.  Either it stays as an arm of industry or it 
should be privatized.  That is our view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CTC, the Canadian Tourism Commission, is a relatively young, 
special agency created during the economic downturn in 1995. Only 
five years ago the government told us that this was the be all 
and end all.  The Canadian Tourism Commission should be just 
that, an association between the private sector and the 
Government of Canada.  Now it is telling us that did not work and 
what is needed is a crown corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission was set up with a mandate to promote Canadian 
tourism both domestically and abroad.  The Canadian Tourism 
Commission receives about $65 million of taxpayers' money every 
year.  Approximately one-fifth of that goes to salaries and 
operating expenses; the rest goes to the promotion of marketing 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told in committee that in 1995 when the commission was 
first established, government revenues were about 70% of the 
total and 30% was from the private sector.  But we know the 
economy has turned around and that the tourism industry has 
turned around. We were told in committee that that formula is 
exactly reversed and 70% of the revenues now come from the 
private sector and only 30% from government. I welcome the day 
that the Canadian Tourism Commission can be privatized and just 
be an agent of the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, Canadian Pacific hotels is one of the major 
shareholders in the organization.  One would wonder why it cannot 
do its own tourism promotion and why government is needed in it 
at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Tourism Commission has a 26 member board of 
directors, 16 of whom are directly appointed by the Government of 
Canada.  This is hardly an arm's length relationship.  There are 
representation requirements for the various parts of Canada, the 
provinces and regions.  The way the distribution takes places as 
to which parts of the tourism industry ought to be represented is 
spelled out under the current arrangement. 
Bill C-5 which would turn the commission over to a crown 
corporation will not change any of that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT55"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT55"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1535

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the Canadian Tourism Commission wants to enter into business 
arrangements to sell its logo and other revenue generating 
schemes.  It wants to have the authority to open bank accounts. 
It no longer wants to go through the complicated bookkeeping 
style or tendering process required by treasury board. Finally, 
it wants to hire and fire according to the Canada Labour Code and 
not the federal public service employment act.  It seems to me it 
cannot have it both ways.  Either it has to have the disciplines 
of government that are currently in place or else it should be a 
private institution and have the kind of flexibility it wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If government rules are too slow and inhibiting, which is 
probably true, why not go the whole way and let it operate on its 
own as a private commission?  It seems to me that empire building 
with the help of the taxpayers' money is what this is really 
about.  What is really behind this push to a crown corporation at 
the Canadian Tourism Commission is empire building and the 
Liberal propensity for state ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I did during the second reading debate on the bill, I refer 
the House to an Industry Canada paper entitled “Canada in the 
21st Century-Institutions and Growth-Framework Policy as a 
Tool of Competitive Advantage for Canada” to show the different 
points of view.  The Industry Canada report argues for the rapid 
divestiture of crown assets and seems to directly contradict the 
arguments behind the creation of a crown corporation under Bill 
C-5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would it hire people to do a very long study entitled 
“Canada in the 21st Century” which tells the government to get 
out of many areas in the economy and get out of crown 
corporations but on the other hand it is now trying to go to one 
in the Canadian Tourism Commission in Bill C-5?  It does not seem 
to make any sense.  Maybe they are a little dyslexic in Industry 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot say that there is no role for the federal government 
in tourism promotion; there probably is.  Tourism is Canada's 
12th largest revenue generating industry.  It directly and 
indirectly employs hundreds of thousands of Canadians, but I and 
my Canadian Alliance colleagues are firm, not in the form of a 
crown corporation.  Why would I say that?  Our experience is that 
there are still a number of crown corporations, although the 
Conservative government under Brian Mulroney asked that a number 
of those be turned over to private institutions and that 
happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are still two crown corporations which I am familiar with 
that have given me a very bad experience.  They are the Export 
Development Corporation and the former Canadian Wheat Board, 
which is now a mixed corporation and is still a bit of an 
oddball.  It was a crown corporation of government.  As a farmer 
in Alberta, I had lots of experience with the Canadian Wheat 
Board.  There was absolutely no transparency.  It was a system 
where we had to sell our product to the Canadian Wheat Board even 
though many people did not want to do that.  It was kind of a 
state run agency like we saw in the Soviet Union.  Many farmers 
in western Canada want to get out from under that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members might ask why government would want to continue.  It is 
a very good question.  I suggest that the lack of transparency is 
one way the government can look after quite a few friends in this 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have asked a number of questions in the House about the 
Export Development Corporation.  The government keeps telling us 
that it cannot disclose that and that there is a confidentiality 
issue for the countries it lends money to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that it has a $2.6 billion contingency reserve for 
bad loans.  Why would it do that?  We understand that through the 
Paris club Canada has written off a number of loans.  It has a 
very strange arrangement through the Canada account which Export 
Development Corporation administers for the Government of Canada. 
Export Development Corporation gets credited with the forgone 
interest even though it did not make that loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that of the $800 million in revenues it has had in the 
last 10 years, most of that has come from another pocket in the 
Government of Canada.  Treasury board and finance are rebating 
the Export Development Corporation.  In fact, it is not making 
any money at all but we cannot tell for sure because it will not 
disclose that to parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I ask the Export Development Corporation and the Canadian 
Wheat Board for information, they say they cannot tell me that 
even though I am a member of parliament.  They say they report to 
the minister. 
In the case of the Canadian Wheat Board, it was the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food.  In the case of the Export Development 
Corporation, it was the Minister for International Trade.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked the minister involved for the information.  What we got 
from the minister is, “No, I am sorry.  It is an arm's length 
agency between us and that crown corporation, therefore we cannot 
give it to you”.  It is a very convenient arrangement that 
should not be continued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine what happens when crown corporations are finally 
liberated from the heavy reins of government.  There have been a 
few that have finally made it out from the famous spider's web. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian National used to lose about $3 billion a year every 
year for decades. During the time I have been here in the last 
seven years, CN finally made it out on its own.  It finally 
became privatized and it has absolutely blossomed.  It is in the 
process of acquiring property in the United States, other 
railways, to make a continental railway system.  It is making 
lots of money for its shareholders.  Why could it not make money 
when its shareholder was the Government of Canada?  I suggest 
that government does a poor job in business and should get out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another crown corporation that made it out was Air Canada.  Look 
what has happened to Air Canada.  It has acquired Canadian 
Pacific as a result.  Now it is making lots of money.  It is 
essentially a monopoly in the airline industry in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Petro-Canada is another one that used to lose money.  What 
happened when it came out from under government?  It is making 
money and competing effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those corporations had a magical transformation from perpetual 
money losers and drains on the public treasury to productive 
members of the private sector.  And when they do that, they start 
paying taxes to the Government of Canada and taxes to the 
provinces.  When they were crown corporations they never had to 
pay taxes, nothing that draconian of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In keeping with tradition, I suspect that the cost of running 
the Canadian Tourism Commission as a crown corporation if Bill 
C-5 goes through will be higher in five years than it is now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was first briefed about the bill it was suggested that 
moving the operation to Toronto was a distinct possibility.  That 
is the kind of empire building I am talking about.  I can just 
see the empire building logic behind that move.  Where is it now? 
It is in Industry Canada at the C.D. Howe building just down the 
street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the commission will not be there very long.  It 
will not be acceptable for the new Canadian Tourism Commission as 
a crown corporation.  It will require some new, prominent, 
downtown Toronto location, top dollar real estate of course, to 
reflect the new status of a crown corporation.  It will also 
probably mean that salaries will have to go up so that the 
current 62 commission employees can afford to live in Toronto, 
not to mention the cost of relocating all those folks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is just another major problem we have with crown 
corporations.  They are not accountable.  Sure they must answer 
to the responsible minister, but the rest of us, especially the 
MPs in the opposition, are forced to wait until the end of the 
fiscal year or when they table their annual reports to get the 
information, if there is any information we can get at all. 
Whenever we try to get that information we get the runaround in 
the House of Commons and from the crown corporations themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>MPs have gone through an exercise in futility in dealing with 
crown corporations.  Therefore why would we want to vote in 
favour of creating another one? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that Canada needs to promote tourism and market our 
beautiful country as an ideal vacation destination for ourselves 
and for those from abroad.  It is not clear however that we need 
another crown corporation to do this for us.  That is why we are 
opposed to Bill C-5 and will not be supporting it.

House today, a packed House thanks to the people in the gallery 
and my colleagues on this side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike my friend who just spoke, we will support the 
legislation.  It is not often that I have some positive things to 
say about the government but I am forced to say some positive 
things today because Bill C-5, an act to establish the Canadian 
Tourism Commission turning it into a crown corporation is 
something we support.

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to explain the reasons we support it and then make a few 
critical comments that are aimed to result in some positive 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Tourism Commission was founded in 1992 after a very 
extensive consultation process with tourism operators across the 
country.  Something had to be done.  Basically, people did not 
know much about Canada outside Canada.  There was not much of a 
marketing effort around the world to encourage people to visit 
Canada, so this commission was set up.  Because the government 
wanted to get something under way quickly it was easier to create 
an agency of government than to set up a crown corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is, this agency is working quite well.  It works in 
partnership with the private sector.  We have a whole number of 
private sector tourism operators involved, we have provincial and 
territorial governments involved, and of course the federal 
government is involved.  This partnership of different levels of 
government plus the private sector has resulted in a very dynamic 
organization which is promoting Canada around the world in the 
sense that we get people to come to Canada and then it is up to 
other groups, both the private sector and provincial governments, 
to attract them to Quebec, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, P.E.I. 
or wherever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something had to be done.  If there is one criticism I have at 
this early stage it would be that this crown corporation to 
promote Canada abroad needs to have a larger budget.  To take an 
ad out in one of the big Japanese newspapers, for example, is 
very costly.  To run a series of advertisements in some of the 
big airports around the world is very costly.  If we are going to 
do this, then let us do it properly, and that is going to require 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it was operating as an agency it was very cumbersome.  It 
required a whole number of departments to have input, and to make 
the changes that are required today in promoting tourism means 
that we have to move very quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, what was in place was a massive marketing program 
targeted to attracting people living in the Asia-Pacific region to 
visit Canada.  We know how quickly that economic collapse 
happened in the Asia-Pacific region.  Overnight, bang, it was all 
over, there was an economic collapse and obviously not many 
people were visiting Canada, so they had to shift. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because it was such a cumbersome organization it took weeks and 
months of fiddling around before it could actually shift to 
target a different market.  This will be facilitated somewhat 
because of the crown corporation status that it will now have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look to two provinces which have mirror legislation.  British 
Columbia, the area from which I come, has Supernatural British 
Columbia.  It has been a magnificent crown corporation. It has 
done wonders.  We have people coming from all over the world by 
the tens of thousands into what has to be probably the most 
attractive airport anywhere in the world.  You have been there, 
Mr. Speaker.  I think you would agree that the Vancouver airport 
is world class, second to probably no airport in the world, and 
people are coming by the tens of thousands, every month, 
travelling to beautiful British Columbia, based on the 
advertising and the promotion that the crown corporation is 
doing, to say nothing about the province of Saskatchewan and the 
Land of the Dancing Skies organization, which again has been very 
successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evidence we have would indicate that moving to the status of 
a crown corporation is a positive move based on what we are 
seeing provincially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think all members agree that tourism is certainly one of the 
growth sectors of our economy.  We know what we have.  When 
people find out what we have, whether those people are coming 
from Switzerland, China, Indian or Mexico, they come to Canada 
and they are amazed at what we have to offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know because we live here, but I suspect even we could 
benefit from these programs to learn what it is like in other 
parts of the country:  people from the west going to the east, 
people from the east going to the central part, people from the 
central part going to other parts of the country.  I had the 
pleasure last year of spending some time in Canada's north.  I 
must say that it left a lasting, lifelong impression on me, in 
terms of what that part of Canada has to offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two quick points.  One is about revenues.  My friend from 
the Canadian Alliance referred to it, but I think it bears 
repeating. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT58"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT58"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1550
<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, 70% of the revenues for this operation came from 
government and 30% came from the private sector.  When I talk 
about the private sector I am talking about Air Canada and some 
of the big hotel chains that obviously stand to benefit from 
people coming to Canada on their vacations and so on.  In 2000 
the percentages have flipped around.  There is now 70% private 
sector financing and 30% government financing.  We can see the 
popularity and how well this is moving in terms of taxpayer 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a critical point that I want to address this afternoon. 
I do not want to detract from some of the positive comments I 
have just made because we will support this bill at third 
reading.  However, the other day the Liberals were talking about 
a program called Public Works Festivals.  If a festival is 
going on in a community or a region, the Government of Canada 
will sponsor it to a point to help local organizers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that 72% of the money went to festivals in Quebec and 
approximately 20% went to festivals in Ontario.  British 
Columbia, with 13% of the population of Canada—and the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans will really be keen to hear this 
statistic—received about 2.5% of all of the festival 
sponsorships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Questions were asked in committee about why this imbalance 
exists.  We were told that not many applications were received 
from western Canada.  When I asked how people in western Canada 
knew about the program, if it had been advertised in western 
Canada, the answer was no.  If a program is not advertised, how 
do we expect people to apply for something under the program?  It 
is bizarre, but it points out one of the weaknesses in our 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to have a system in place to promote and support 
festivals across the country, it should be equally accessible to 
Canadians regardless of where they happen to live.  The fact that 
70% of the money went to festivals in one province, obviously at 
the expense of other parts of Canada, is simply not fair.  We 
have to ensure, and perhaps the board of directors of the crown 
corporation will be helpful in ensuring, that there is some 
equality across the country.  There has to be some resemblance of 
fairness and equity in these programs in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that my friend the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is 
here.  I know how keen he is on some of these issues, so I would 
like to throw out a bit of a challenge to him.  Over the years 
that I have been a member of parliament I have been very aware of 
the various federal programs that apply to provincial 
jurisdictions; in other words, federal programs that receive 
applications from provinces right across Canada, including the 
territories.  This is what I have found, and I know members will 
be astonished at this.  British Columbia has approximately 13% of 
the population of Canada, and yet I am unaware of a single 
federal program from which British Columbia receives 13% of the 
funding.  I have made it a hobby over the past 20 years to study 
this issue.  For 20 years we in British Columbia have been 
getting skewered.  We always get the short end of the stick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What about fisheries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Fisheries is a little different because 
we are on the west coast in British Columbia.  Saskatchewan and 
Manitoba, being more central, do not get big chunks of fisheries 
support.  I am talking about a program that should have some 
equality across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could tell my hon. friends in cabinet sitting across the way 
and members of the Liberal caucus that sometimes I hear questions 
like:  Why do Liberals not do better in the west?  Why do 
Liberals not do better in British Columbia?  One of the reasons 
is because British Columbia never gets its fair share of 
anything.  It is frustrating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day a number of Liberals from British Columbia 
admitted that something is wrong with the picture.  They admitted 
that B.C. never gets its fair share.  Members of the opposition 
have said this and we now have members of the government caucus 
saying it as well.  Perhaps something will change.  It is a 
wake-up call. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we support this piece of legislation, we in British 
Columbia hope that steps will be taken to ensure that if programs 
are laid out across the country to support festivals or to 
advertise various parts of Canada people should remember that 
there are different parts of Canada and they should all get at 
least fair consideration in the international promotion that will 
go on as a result of this crown corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that I will conclude my remarks.  Perhaps some of my 
friends across the way would like to ask me a few questions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today I am 
delighted to speak to Bill C-5, an act to establish the Canadian 
Tourism Commission.  This is a particularly significant bill 
because it involves an issue that is of utmost importance to the 
Canadian economy:  the future vitality of the tourism industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the information of hon. members, just to give an indication 
of the magnitude of the tourism industry in Canada, consider the 
following facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tourism spending in Canada reached $51 billion in 1999.  The 
industry employed in excess of 500,000 people in 1999, clearly 
proving to be one of the leading growth industries within the 
Canadian business community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additionally, according to the Buchanan report on tourism, it is 
estimated that for every $1 billion of tourism revenue generated 
in Canada a further $230 million is generated for the federal 
government, $160 million for provincial governments and $60 
million for municipal governments, all in tax revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The continued vitality of the tourism industry is crucial for 
our country.  Anything that can be done to improve Canada's lot 
in the share of the worldwide tourism industry can only be a 
positive step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-5 will see the Canadian Tourism Commission transformed 
from what it currently is, a special operating agency, into a 
crown corporation.  The PC Party believes that this is a 
positive, desirable change that merits our full support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Tourism Commission was originally established by an 
order in council in April of 1995.  Its mandate was and continues 
to be to plan, manage and implement programs that generate and 
promote tourism in Canada.  The bill before us, which calls for 
the CTC to become a crown corporation, represents the natural 
evolutionary step in the developmental process of this successful 
agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-5 we find a number of suggested changes to the 
Canadian Tourism Commission.  Many of the proposed changes will 
result in fundamental differences for the commission, but all of 
them are designed to provide greater flexibility, thus allowing 
the CTC to better serve the Canadian tourism industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps one of the most persuasive reasons to support graduating 
the CTC from a special operating agency to a crown corporation 
lies in the fact that this move will result in increased 
flexibility and a greater role in the promotion of tourism for 
the CTC.  First, moving the CTC forward from an SOA to a crown 
corporation will make the CTC more like a business, which is 
good.  Under Bill C-5 the CTC will have greater administrative, 
contracting, financial and personal flexibility.  This will bode 
well as the Canadian Tourism Commission strives to meet the new 
challenges in the Canadian tourism industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new challenges in the tourism industry will be numerous.  I 
will mention four of the primary challenges that the tourism 
industry will face in the coming years.  First, there will, 
doubtless, be an economic challenge to the industry.  This will 
be a challenge that will require a greater role for actors in the 
industry and national and regional economies.  As a crown 
corporation the CTC will be free from undue administrative 
burdens that impede the necessary progress in the industry. This, 
along with the national reach of the CTC, will enable it to 
answer the economic challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the major players in the tourism industry will have to 
convince their respective private sector partners that they are 
viable in the long term.  Clearly, as a crown corporation the CTC 
will meet this challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the tourism industry in Canada will face stiff 
competition from the likes of our giant neighbour to the south 
and from other prime destinations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, and perhaps one of the most challenging of all 
challenges for the Canadian tourism industry, players in the 
tourism industry in Canada will have to battle the stereotypical 
foreign view of Canada.  I am referring to the stereotypical view 
which pictures Canada as safe and clean, but equally as cold and 
boring.  Certainly, answering these challenges will be difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a crown corporation whose mandate it will be to market Canada 
as a great tourism destination, I am confident that these 
challenges will be met with success. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT60"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT60"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1600

<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Tourism Commission will have as its purpose the 
marketing of Canada as a desirable tourism destination.  Toward 
this end it will be supportive of co-operative marketing 
relationships between the private sector and governments.  It 
will also provide state of the art information about Canadian 
tourism to the private sector and to government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced of the ability of the CTC to meet the challenges 
to compete against other appealing world destinations and to 
battle some of the mistaken images foreigners have of Canada as a 
destination for tourism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am equally convinced that the CTC as a crown corporation will 
be better equipped and better motivated to serve the Canadian 
tourism industry.  The characteristics of crown corporations are 
such that they should be on firmer ground as they seek to produce 
results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crown corporations function like the private sector firms with 
which they compete.  This will motivate the CTC to maintain 
excellence in its service delivery because it will be in 
competition with other firms.  Just as important is that under 
this bill the CTC will have to balance and consider the benefits 
of its public policy objectives with the cost efficient delivery 
of goods and services.  The PC Party believes that this notion of 
fiscal responsibility, and to a very real degree frugality, is 
best achieved by having the CTC exist as a crown corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members of the House do not have only my word to support 
the bill.  In fact a number of stakeholders appeared before the 
Standing Committee on Industry, on which I sit as a member, as 
witnesses in support of Bill C-5.  For instance, we heard from a 
representative from the Tourism Association of Canada.  This 
association represents the various sectors within the tourism 
industry, be they small, medium or large tourism businesses, 
destinations, attractions, transportation providers, adventure 
tour operators or any other sector.  Clearly it is a group with 
wide ranging membership, not compromised of just any one player 
in the tourism industry.  This group is home to all major and 
minor players in our national tourism industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says a lot when this group, the Tourism Association of 
Canada, has characterized Bill C-5 as pivotal.  The bill is not 
only pivotal for the future success of the CTC but for the entire 
tourism industry in Canada according to the Tourism Association 
of Canada.  Those are strong words and even stronger support from 
the industry's key players. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The testimony of this association is representative of the bulk 
of witnesses we welcomed to our meetings as our committee 
discussed and considered Bill C-5.  Their judgment was entirely 
positive, as hon. members have certainly surmised by the result 
of our clause by clause consideration of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I will add only a few points.  It is important to 
note that there is general support from the provinces and 
territories for Bill C-5.  The provinces and territories play a 
vital role in the tourism industry and without their support Bill 
C-5 cannot be successful.  This is why I am particularly pleased 
to see that there is support from their end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other factor in the equation is the private sector.  Is the 
private sector on board with this initiative to transform the CTC 
from a special operating agency into a crown corporation?  In one 
word the answer is yes.  Throughout the private sector there is 
very strong support for Bill C-5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a businessman I realize the importance of strong linkages 
among stakeholders.  The fact that the provinces, the territories 
and the private sector have signed on to this initiative is 
encouraging for two reasons.  It is an indication that the 
Canadian tourism industry will continue to grow and expand as a 
successful component of the economy.  The wide ranging support 
for this bill is such that it can only result in success for the 
Canadian tourism industry and for the tourism players.  With the 
help and co-operation of the major players in the tourism 
industry, the Canadian Tourism Commission will be better equipped 
to serve our tourism industry.  The PC Party will support Bill 
C-5.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, today we 
are debating Bill C-5, which has been around for a while and 
which deals with the Canadian Tourism Commission. The purpose of 
this bill is to transform the CTC from a special operating agency 
into a crown corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must tell the House from the outset that the Bloc Quebecois 
will not be supporting this bill for a number of reasons, which I 
will state during my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, we must ask ourselves what are the objectives 
pursued by the government in passing such a bill. There has been 
a growing tendency over the last few years within government in 
general, but even more so within this federal government, to take 
public funds and put them into an agency of some kind outside the 
government, an agency which is often run by friends of the 
government and which, for all intents and purposes, is not 
accountable directly to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the Canadian Tourism Commission, the federal 
government puts $65 million into that agency each year. The board 
of directors will be appointed by the minister, who will maintain 
that power. However, if there is ever a problem or if there is a 
policy with which parliament as a whole disagrees, we can 
anticipate what the minister's answer will be when he is 
questioned about that. He will say “Look, they are independent, 
they are the ones in charge of managing this Crown corporation”. 
The government will just wash its hands of all that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that the money going to this organization 
comes from the taxpayers and that parliament will essentially 
lose control over the management of public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the reason given for taking such an approach since the 
beginning of the debate on the Canadian Tourism Commission over a 
year ago, especially during the last weeks in committee? 
Flexibility. 
Commission and government officials say “More partnership with 
the private sector will be possible.  It will be simpler and the 
rules will be more flexible”.  As if it were impossible to 
figure out why a special section of a department is not able to 
give itself more flexible and faster rules for partnerships with 
the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One example has been given. It was the only one, because 
concrete examples have been very rare, as if mere mention of a 
vague principle were enough to make it true.  We were told that 
partnership would be easier and flexible.  Oh really, and why? No 
witness had an answer for that, except for the one who said “For 
example, selling advertising or soliciting revenue is easier for 
a crown corporation than for a special service of the government. 
If, for example, there is an internet site looking for business 
or selling advertising, that will be easier”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a risk of this happening more and more in future.  Why 
not look at the internal rules that make this partnership 
complicated to set up?  All the other departments might benefit 
from this.  The government as a whole could be made more 
efficient.  We are not required to create a crown corporation in 
order to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government wants to be more efficient, let us 
talk about tourism in its broadest sense.  Who is involved in 
this area?  There is the Canadian Tourism Commission, which 
receives $65 million yearly.  There are the economic development 
agencies.  In the case of Quebec, it is Economic Development 
Canada.  There are also other agencies for the other regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These too spend money to fund projects locally, whether 
infrastructure, promotional plans or any other program. 
In Quebec, Canada Economic Development is spending money.  The 
Canadian Tourism Commission has money to promote Canada in broad 
terms.  That said, part of its budget still goes for promotional 
purposes within Quebec.  We were told it represented 7% of its 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will discuss this a little later in greater detail.  There is 
also Attractions Canada, which spends $4 million annually.  Who 
manages Attractions Canada?  The Minister of Public Works, the 
one managing the CIO and administering another $40 million 
budget, the federal government's sponsorship budget, whose 
presence is strongly felt at festivals and tourist events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This same minister, who might be described as being in charge of 
patronage, or nearly, has two tourism budgets in his control. If 
the federal government wanted to be more effective, it could 
first put this money into a single agency. I am saying this 
without getting into a debate over whether the provinces would be 
in a better position, or, in some cases, the municipalities that 
do this.  We would much prefer a Quebec tourism promotion plan, 
sold under the aegis of Quebec, with our own events, our own 
festivals and our own label.  Our tourism product is sold 
differently from Canada's.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In case the Liberals forget, even if they are the ones reminding 
us from time to time, though as little as possible, we are 
distinct and different.  So we do not sell Quebec as they sell 
Canada internationally.  We would prefer to have that money along 
with our taxes in order to manage it ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, as we know about their obsession with visibility and 
their desire to manage, let them clean up their own yard.  Let 
them dig in the pockets of the minister of public works to see if 
there is anything there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to give the example of Attractions Canada.  Because, 
after a long battle in committee, we managed to have these 
obscure people from the Attractions Canada program testify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just look at how things work. These $4 million are given to the 
Everest group, the buddies of the party, so that it will manage 
that money on behalf of the federal government. The Everest group 
is not subject to the same constraints, to the same transparency 
rules and so on. The government gave $4 million to buddies. They 
must get a cut on that. I do not know how much, but we will 
eventually find out. And these people sponsor or display 
advertising on huge Mediacom billboards, and it is signed 
Attractions Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strangely enough, the government did not create a crown 
corporation for that purpose. It would rather create partnerships 
with the private sector. It has such partnerships with Cadbury, 
Via Rail—although Via Rail is not quite a private company and 
the government gives it a lot of support—and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the money he has in his pockets, the Minister of Public 
Works is capable of creating partnerships with the private 
sector. But it did not seem to be the case at Industry Canada. 
So, a crown corporation was established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pattern will be the same. Money will again be given out, and 
who is to say that it will not also become some kind of a 
propaganda agency? So, the minister of public works will award 
contracts to his buddies, while appointments will be made at the 
agency. We are very concerned by all this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not doubt that there are people within the commission who 
are full of good intentions. But once the directors have been 
appointed or approved by cabinet, on the recommendation of the 
Minister of Industry, might they not conveniently forget that 
they are accountable to the minister? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too am concerned about the principle of accountability in the 
management of public funds. 
I have in my hands the 1998 report of the Canadian Tourism 
Commission.  I will not show it to the House, because props are 
not permitted.  I challenge the House to find in this annual 
report the public money contributed.  The $65 million from 
taxpayers is mentioned nowhere in the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see how they spent all the money they collected—the 
partnerships with the private sector and so on—but nowhere is it 
mentioned that this money comes from taxpayers, to the tune of 
$65 million for the federal contribution.  There are also 
contributions from provincial governments and municipalities, and 
other public agencies.  So there is a real problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the case of the Office du tourisme et des congrès 
du Grand Montréal, a group that appeared before the committee. 
These folks appeared, claiming to be private partners.  I was 
very surprised and I asked questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of this organization's $15 million budget, $1 million comes from 
each level of government—the municipality, the Government of 
Quebec and the federal government.  That accounts for $3 million. 
Another $4 million comes from private enterprise, and $8 million 
comes from a tax on hotel rooms in Montreal of $2 a night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Lapointe, the former Liberal minister who now directs the 
office, told me in committee that this $8 million was private 
funding, as though no legislation had been necessary to give him 
the right to levy a tax of $2 a night.  I am not kidding—that 
was what I was told. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sorry, but when the figures are added up at the Commission on 
interventions by a body such as that, and the bulk of them are 
classified as private interventions, I say wait a minute. We 
must make not mistake about the Canadian Tourism Commission: it 
is funded largely by public funds, whether federal, provincial 
or what not. But for the taxpayer, that is all the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, there will always be a certain number of events and 
partnerships the commission will be publicizing.  Let us look at 
the whole thing here.  In our regions, what organizations or 
events really benefit? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are the major events, the major festivals, which manage to 
get included.  A highly select few at the top.  As for the 
others, they do not manage to gain anything from the spill-over 
effect, and still less so from small direct patronage programs 
such as Attractions Canada. 
What events in Quebec regions such as Abitibi—Témiscamingue<B> </B>or 
others even know such a program exists?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we asked the public servants in charge, their answer was 
“All people have to do is to consult our internet site.  They 
will perhaps find that there is some information available”. 
Yet they did not seem to be very clear themselves on how Everest 
determined its criteria for handing out money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of problems.  Before taking the $65 million in 
public funds from the commission and making it into an 
institutionalized crown corporation, some internal housecleaning 
would be in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representatives of the Professional Institute of the Public 
Service also came to testify at the hearings. 
For the rest, for the most part, those who came to defend their 
viewpoint were former members of the board or people still close 
to the commission.  I do not blame them.  They did their job. 
These people were all connected with the commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Professional Institute of the Public Service appeared near 
the end.  At the same sitting in which we were to begin voting on 
the bill, we heard these people in the morning, the first to 
speak out against the bill, and the bill was expected to pass 
before the end of the session, as if it served no purpose to take 
a step back and consider their arguments.  The government took 
care to have them testify at the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read a few quotes from their brief: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government makes much of the success of the commission since 
1995 in promoting and enhancing tourism. Since this is such a 
success story now, why is there a need to change the crown 
corporation status? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very good question.  A little further on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As proposed, the Canadian Tourism Commission will provide 
nothing new, except for the extra implementation cost. Bill C-5 
is a measure that is so vague that employees' rights are not 
stipulated. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They went on a little further in their brief: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the institute's position that an internal adjustment of the 
special operating agency's powers is the way to continue and add 
to the success story that began in 1995. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were therefore saying “Since we are told everything is 
fine, a few small changes would help us to improve things, 
without having to create a crown corporation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A bit further on, they say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, there is no need at this point to engage in any 
creation of a crown corporation, since the agency can continue to 
undertake the dialogue, research, and marketing that are 
necessary in the tourism industry. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their brief concludes as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institute feels that the extension of crown corporation 
status to the Canadian Tourism Commission is a completely 
unnecessary move, based on the fact that no particular advantage 
vis-à-vis the tourism industry will be gained. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an initial brief.  There are also other people who 
appeared before the committee and questions were asked which, in 
my view, show how confused the federal government's approach is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Mr. Francis, the commission's chairman, appeared before the 
committee, I asked him about Attractions Canada, which I 
mentioned earlier.  I asked him whether Attractions Canada was 
part of the Canadian Tourism Commission.  He told me it was not. 
I asked him what then was it was part of and he told me that he 
thought it was part of the Canada Information Office.  That was 
close; he had the right minister, but it was not the Canada 
Information Office; it was the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I then asked him how the various departments got along together, 
and this is what he said: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“It is an ongoing challenge, something that we have been 
attempting to do over the last two or three years”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People say “We are looking at all this.  We do not have much of 
an idea of how it works, but we are looking at it”.  So they 
came to sell us on the merits of creating a crown corporation out 
of the commission, but without even having done their own 
homework within the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised a lot of interesting questions but, in the final 
analysis, they said they were fully in agreement with what was 
going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked some witnesses to give me concrete examples of how 
partnership with the private sector would be easier if they were 
a crown corporation.  These were people who were very close to 
the action, people who had sat on the board, or those working in 
tourism.  They had no examples to offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked Mr. Lapointe of the greater Montreal tourism bureau 
“Are you familiar with Attractions Canada?”  His answer was 
“Vaguely”.  I then asked “Are you familiar with its mandate?” 
He started to explain to me that there were billboards, and that 
his understanding was that the purpose was to do this or that 
type of promotion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that people involved year in and year out in tourism 
are not fully familiar with the mandate of Attractions Canada, 
which spends dollars to promote tourism? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT64"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT64"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1620

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can it be that they are not familiar with the rules for 
intervention by the minister through his sponsorship budget 
which, I might point out in passing, ensures that Quebec gets the 
lion's share?  Yes, there are some programs where Quebec gets 
more than its share of propaganda, whether in billboards or in 
Canada Day spending.  In this area Quebec gets more than its 
share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when the time comes to ask the Minister of Industry, 
for instance, to do his part for a project such as the creation 
of a semi-conductor plant in Montreal, then the answer is: that 
takes time, it is complicated, they do not want to set a 
precedent by using a different approach in Quebec. 
But when it comes to flags, or what approximates a flag, or to 
nurture the friends of the government, it is a different matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite anyone who is interested to reread all that was said 
during the brief week we studied the matter in committee to see 
that nothing specific was put before us to enable us to conclude 
that this step of turning a special service into a crown 
corporation was necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, there are the clichés “It is a normal stage of 
development”, “Partnerships will be easier”, “It will be very 
flexible”.  But in practice, there is no specific proof.  When 
we scratch the surface, we see that there are problems left and 
right.  And I have not spoken in detail of Economic Development 
Canada, because its representatives did not appear before the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in order to hear the others I mentioned, whether it be 
Attractions Canada, or opinions on sharing jurisdiction, it took 
a real battle in committee to get the minister himself to come 
and present his bill.  They wanted, on the pretext that it was 
the end of a session, to hustle it through at committee stage, 
so as few people as possible would be heard on the potential 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Economic Development Canada, this federal government agency 
whose intervention criteria we will never clearly know, had long 
been an issue with me.  Last year, they toured the various 
regions of Quebec, and in all the press releases, it was obvious 
there were funds available for tourism. 
In certain regions, ours for example, we have learned that they 
are putting money into one project in particular in order to 
help fund a regional development or marketing plan, but the 
criteria are not known in advance to those in the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told that $1.2 million is available, but we are not told 
how it will be allocated.  When government funding is involved 
and there is a desire to manage it transparently, how can those 
in the business be expected to know that they are eligible and 
apply? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Economic Development Canada tells people to send in their 
applications and it will examine them.  What criteria will 
apply?  Nobody really knows.  And then, to justify refusals, all 
we are told is that it did not meet their priorities. Oh?  What 
priorities? 
Perhaps my region is an exception, but I do not think so.  I 
think that this goes on in many regions in Quebec and I am 
certain that it also happens elsewhere with regional development 
agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is therefore a serious problem.  For a minister who says 
he is concerned about promoting tourism, he should look at what 
is going on in his agencies, and do a little housecleaning so 
that his interventions are a bit more effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the federal government will not withdraw from a 
sector such as tourism.  The furthest it has gone is to say in 
the throne speech that it would try to establish new models of 
partnership with the provinces.  Given its obsession with 
visibility, that is what it will continue to do.  But it should 
at least start by striving for effectiveness and co-ordination in 
what it does.  That would already be a big step forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, for reasons of efficiency and out of respect for those 
who pay taxes and who want transparency in the management of 
public funds, we cannot support a bill like this, especially when 
we look at the parallel interventions by the government in 
sponsorship and tourism, we see that public funds tend to be 
spent on other things and, under the guise of promoting tourism, 
provide encouragement to friends, such as those in the Groupe 
Everest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drawing parallels, the same minister manages the Canada 
Information Office or the federal government Liberal Party office 
of propaganda.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be rather alarming to see that there is still a lot of 
money: $44 million annually in the case of the minister of public 
works—this is a lot of money—, $65 million in the case of the 
Canadian Tourism Commission.  Taxpayers pay out a lot of money, 
and we might as why it is used to fund the promotion of an 
industry that is currently flourishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not ignore the fact that the weakness of the Canadian 
dollar helps a lot to improve tourism both in Quebec and in 
Canada. I am not saying that the tourism market has not improved, 
but we must realize that the main factor was the quality of what 
we have to offer and the fact that our dollar is very weak, 
making other currencies stronger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will vote against this bill.  I invite all members of this 
House to bear in mind the fact that we risk turning this agency 
into another federal government propaganda agency, yet again.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of introduction, the measures contained in this bill, 
while wide ranging, all fall within the broad sphere of the 
government's ongoing commitment to an effective, efficient and 
fiscally responsible government. The intent of the legislation 
before us is to make our tax system more simple and more fair not 
only for individual Canadians but for Canadian businesses as 
well. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also in line with our government's commitment to sustain 
and improve our federal taxation system so as to encourage 
harmonization and federal-provincial co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-24 is aimed primarily at improving application of the 
goods and services tax, the GST, and the harmonized sales tax, 
the HST.  It also contains some important proposals relating to 
specific taxes on certain products. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members are familiar with this legislation, I will 
briefly reiterate some of the key measures contained in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed to reducing smoking in Canada 
particularly among young Canadians.  Bill C-24 contains measures 
with respect to the taxation of tobacco products that reaffirm 
the government's commitment to work in concert with the provinces 
and territories in order to reduce tobacco consumption in Canada, 
while at the same time maintaining vigilance in combating the 
level of contraband. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important component of Bill C-24 reflects the government's 
responsiveness to the health and social needs of Canadians.  For 
example, Bill C-24 proposes to provide a sales tax exemption for 
respite care for Canadians who are providing care for family 
members, very often an elderly parent or a disabled child. In 
past budgets the government has introduced numerous measures to 
assist individuals with disabilities.  The bill builds on such 
actions by extending sales tax relief to the purchase of 
specially equipped motor vehicles for transporting individuals 
with disabilities. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this same area, other measures contained in this bill relate 
to GST and HST exemptions on speech therapy, osteopathy and 
psychotherapy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-24 reflects the government's commitment to making the 
taxation system fairer for Canadians.  That commitment is 
translated into a number of different provisions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides charities whose main purposes include the 
provision of care, employment, employment training or employment 
placement services for individuals with disabilities the capacity 
to compete on an equal footing when selling goods or services to 
GST registered businesses.  Bill C-24 also refines the rules for 
the streamlined accounting method for charities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of amendments contained in Bill C-24 are aimed at 
clarifying and refining the application of our sales tax system. 
In response to representations from the tax and business 
communities, these amendments will ensure consistency and 
fairness in the application of the GST and HST in a number of key 
areas. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, further to the process of co-operation between the 
federal government and businesses in the energy sector, this 
bill proposes certain amendments simplifying the application of 
the GST and the HST in this sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments will help Canadian businesses to remain 
competitive internationally. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to other international commercial transactions, the 
bill also proposes to make air navigation services provided to 
carriers tax free in relation to international flights, and to 
refine the rules for exports of goods by common carriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-24 proposes a number of enhancements to the design and 
delivery of the visitors rebate program to further promote Canada 
as a destination for tourists and a place to hold conventions, 
for example by reducing the GST and HST costs associated with 
providing conventions to non-residents. These proposals will help 
to promote Canada as a tourist destination and to support the 
tourism industry in the creation of employment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government will continue to consult with the 
business community to improve the operation of our sales tax 
system.  In that regard Bill C-24 contains a number of proposals 
to improve the rules relating to certain business arrangements 
and ensures that the legislation accords with the policy intent. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government is also continuing its efforts to improve the 
application and enforcement of our sales tax system.  Bill C-24 
amends a number of provisions in these areas, in some cases in 
order to bring them into line with existing administrative 
practices and, in others, in order to increase the effectiveness 
of assessment, appeals and collection provisions in general. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, Bill C-24 also contains measures 
relating to taxes and tariffs on specific products.  In 
accordance with the 1997 decision of the World Trade 
Organization, the bill contains the amendments that repeal the 
provisions relating to the excise tax on split-run editions of 
periodicals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to tariffs, Bill C-24 implements proposals to 
increase certain duty and tax exemptions for persons returning to 
Canada after a minimum period abroad.  These proposals will make 
it more convenient for travellers to clear Canadian customs. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government remains committed to increasing aboriginal 
self-government and has frequently reiterated its desire to 
conclude tax agreements with first nations interested in 
exercising fiscal authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill proposes technical amendments to improve harmonization 
of first nations sales taxes with the GST, and to ensure that 
the definitions in implementation legislation are consistent 
with those used in other federal statutes. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the measures contained in Bill C-24 which I have 
outlined here today propose to improve the operation of our tax 
system while at the same time responding to the social issues 
that are important to Canadians.

has said sounds pretty reasonable.  What I find absolutely 
incredible is that he can say in such nice smooth language what 
the bill does not say at all.  I need to reword that.  He 
described the bill in nice, smooth language but the bill itself 
is convoluted legalese which I defy even an accountant to 
understand.  It is absolutely incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have read a number of things in the bill.  I will give one 
little example.  One thing the bill does which the parliamentary 
secretary did not allude to is it clarifies the tax situation 
with respect to HST and GST when it involves barter exchange.  I 
read it twice and I still cannot clearly understand it.  I would 
have to get a tax lawyer to help me interpret this.  I cannot 
understand whether bartering is out of the tax loop or in.  I 
think it is out as a result of the bill.  I will read a little 
bit of it because it is so incredibly interesting. It reads: 
<UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is clear, is it not?  It goes on to state that this section 
is is deemed to have come into force on December 10, 1998. That 
was a year and a half ago.  It goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3) If a designation of a barter exchange network under section 
181.3 of the Act, as enacted by subsection (1), takes effect on 
the day on which this Act is assented to, that section applies to 
the giving of any property, service or money at any time before 
that day, by a member of the network or the administrator of the 
network, in exchange for a barter unit that could be used as full 
or partial consideration for supplies of property or services 
between members of the network as if the designation and that 
section had been in effect at that time, provided that no amount 
was collected as or on account of tax in respect of the supply of 
the barter unit. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is perfectly clear.  And it goes on and on like that.  It 
is endless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand to be corrected but the bottom line is that if people 
arrange to have a barter unit established with an administrator, 
they can so register it.  If they then exchange goods and 
services in return for these so-called barter units, which is 
perhaps a new currency to be introduced in Canada outside of the 
Bank Act, then they can exchange those barter units for other 
activities, services or products and they are not considered 
taxable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would venture to guess that if this is actually implemented in 
this way, then competing with the loonie will be the boonie, the 
barter unit.  People will be using it in great amounts in order 
to avoid the GST.  Why? It is very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things the parliamentary secretary said was that in 
order to encourage the use of Canadian facilities for conducting 
conventions and meetings of international organizations, the GST 
rules would be altered so there would be a GST exempt portion for 
those people who are from outside the country. That is a clear 
admission on the part of the parliamentary secretary that where 
GST is applied it makes Canada less competitive.  The government 
is ready to remove the GST on that part of it in order to make it 
more competitive.  That makes sense to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally it is true that the more an activity is taxed, the 
less there is of that activity.  The less the government taxes 
it, the more it will get of that activity.  If international 
organizations are encouraged to have their meetings here, which 
of course would bring a lot of money into the community and the 
country, then reduce the tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How I wish we could persuade the federal government to apply 
that principle to our own citizens.  We are taxed to death.  The 
GST is one of those taxes.  And this bill does a lot to change 
the way the GST and now the GST and HST rules are applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting the government would choose to bring in these 
amendments to the GST. We know the Liberals were first elected to 
government primarily on the promise that they would eliminate the 
GST. There are a whole bunch of really good quotations by the 
Prime Minister when he was in opposition.  He said, “I am 
opposed to the GST.  I have always been opposed to it and I will 
be opposed to it always”. Back in 1990 when the GST was being 
introduced he said he would always be opposed to the GST.  The 
Liberals at that time were sitting on this side of the House and 
the Mulroney Conservatives were on the other side and were 
proposing this wonderful new GST.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all these years of GST the government in a piecemeal way, 
one little group at a time, is saying that it should take the GST 
away because it is unfair, inhibits economic activity, is bad for 
business, costs the government too much money, or whatever.  Now 
it is introducing some amendments in this bill to change some of 
the GST rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a quotation from the individual who is now the Deputy 
Prime Minister.  On December 21, 1992, he said  “The thinking is 
that we want to get rid of the GST”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A little less than a year before the 1993 federal election when 
the present Prime Minister was leader of the opposition he said 
“We will replace it.  No doubt about it”.  In retrospect I 
guess he has a bit of doubt.  He also said “We will replace the 
tax. This is a commitment.  You will judge me by that.  If the 
GST is not gone, I will have a tough time in the election after 
that”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He further said  “The only specific promise I am going to make 
is to replace the GST”.  I guess we have it replaced all right. 
It is now the GST-HST in those provinces that have bought into 
it.  Instead of being 7% it is 15%.  Yes, it was replaced.  Was 
that a great commitment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly just weeks after the 1993 election when asked by a 
reporter what he would do about the GST because of his election 
promise, the Prime Minister said “It will be gone in two 
years”.  That was 1993.  According to very simple arithmetic, 
much beyond the ken of mathematicians on Liberal side, two years 
after 1993 is 1995.  We would have expected by 1995 that the GST 
would be gone.  Is it gone?  I do not think so.  It is still 
here.  It is as big as ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me refer to the Prime Minister speaking in the House 
Commons.  We can look it up in <I>Hansard</I>.  In 1994, again 
just six months after the election, he said “We hate it and we 
will kill it”.  That is what he said in the House of Commons, 
still thinking about his election campaign, but he never really 
did it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are some six and a half years after that election and 
the Prime Minister and the Liberals have done nothing to change 
their so-called election promise to get rid of the GST but they 
are removing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can I stand in the House and either speak or vote against a 
reduction of GST as applied to vehicles needed by people who are 
handicapped?  One would have to be very thoughtless to say no. If 
someone is handicapped and needs a special vehicle to haul them 
around, it would be wrong to say that we think the federal 
government should get some GST money out of that vehicle or the 
extra fittings required to make it work for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will have a little dilemma because I will vote against the 
bill due to all its flaws.  Despite that, it is like eating 
tapioca pudding that has some gravel in it.  In this case some of 
the good tasting parts are the reduction of the GST for people 
who have special needs because they have disabilities.  To exempt 
them from GST is the right thing to do, but how about all the 
other people who have needs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about students who have to pay GST on books?  To add insult 
to injury, they are now paying it two, three and four times.  Let 
us take a look at our pages in the House, young people who are 
students. 
When they buy a used book they end up paying GST on a book that 
has already had GST paid on it.  I know all of them would love to 
keep the books they used when they were students in their youth 
as an ongoing building of their personal libraries.  However they 
will not be able to because of the high cost of education.  They 
will put their books up for sale.  Those books, which have had 
the GST paid on them when they were new and first bought, will 
have the GST paid on them again the third time, the fourth time 
and however many times they are recycled.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If students who are trying to obtain an education are charged 
GST on books every time the books are moved from one owner to the 
other, the word I use is greed.  It was invented by the Prime 
Minister.  It was used by him just a couple of weeks ago.  He 
talked about people who want to keep some of their own earnings 
as being greedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say it is a greedy government that does not have consideration 
for young people trying to get an education.  It insists on 
taxing them to death on their earnings and then when they use the 
earnings that are left over for the books they need for their 
education they are charged GST on them.  There is nothing in the 
bill about reducing the GST to zero on reading materials and on 
books. To me that is a huge flaw.  That alone is a good reason to 
vote against the bill.  It is totally inadequate in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of other things in the bill are commendable and a 
number of them are very questionable.  As legislators in the 
country we have an obligation to stop the huge tax bite.  The 
little things that the government does from time to time by 
changing a little tax rule here and a little tax rule there do 
not make it any simpler.  In fact it greatly increases the 
complexity.  It does not relieve Canadian taxpayers of their 
crushing tax burden in any substantial way.  It is just a little 
dithering and nothing substantial happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot stand in the House to talk about a budget 
implementation bill, some of which goes all the way back to 1990, 
believe it or not, without also mentioning that the Canadian 
Alliance has a very good tax plan that has the approval of many 
Canadians and many notable economists including Dr. Mundell, a 
Nobel Prize winner.  He said that our plan was workable, that it 
would give a substantial kick to the economy and that it would 
give real tax relief to Canadian families who are struggling to 
make ends meet.  That is the type of tax overhaul the country 
needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we have critics who say a flat tax is only a tax cut 
for the rich.  They try to make political hay out of that.  I do 
not apologize for the fact that under our plan everyone pays less 
taxes.  The fact of the matter is that the Liberals always 
misrepresent this aspect of our plan incorrectly.  The Minister 
of Finance particularly loves to talk about it.   He gives a 
totally false message that it is for rich people only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to the Liberals, we would take some two million 
Canadian taxpayers off the tax rolls completely, those people who 
make less than $20,000 for their families per year and are 
deprived of at least $6 billion of their earnings by this 
government.  Six billion dollars of tax revenue comes from 
Canadian families whose family income is less than $20,000 a 
year.  It is shameful, absolutely shameful.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our tax plan would give them a 100% tax break.  It is true that 
when people earn more money they would pay the same rate of tax 
on all their earnings.  That does not mean that people who make 
more money pay less.  They pay proportionately more.  It is a 
truly progressive system.  Anyone who says otherwise is not 
staying with the facts but is distorting them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize that this is the way to go.  It has the approval of 
no less than the WEFA group, which has done financial studies for 
the Department of Finance and the Minister of Finance in the 
production of his budget and his income projections for the 
government.  By using that same model and running our proposal we 
showed that every year tax revenue to the government would go up. 
That is even before we take into account the boost that a massive 
tax break would give to our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government revenue would go up.  There would be more money 
available for health care and education.  There would be less 
money under our plan for boondoggles and for building fountains 
in Shawinigan.  The money would dry up for fountains very quickly 
if we were in power because we simply do not believe it is 
correct to use the hard earned money of long suffering taxpayers 
to try to bolster the re-election chances of anyone including the 
Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would straighten all those things out.  With us at the helm 
of government, Canadians would find some real tax changes and 
changes to the system, not just the tinkering around the 
government is prone to doing.  It sort of dilly-dallies and never 
really gets around to doing anything substantial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say a little about some of the other matters 
that are involved.  There is a whole bunch of provisions in the 
bill on changing different things including charities.  The 
parliamentary secretary alluded to that point, but there is one 
that is really interesting.  It would exempt second language 
training in French or English from the GST if that training were 
provided by vocational schools or individual contractors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a step in the right direction, but once again the 
Liberals are guilty of tinkering.  What they have done is said 
that students studying math or science have to pay the GST on 
that. However, French speaking people learning English or English 
speaking people learning French will be exempt from GST on that. 
They just cannot do that.  They cannot just pepper away—I guess 
the Prime Minister likes pepper—at wee spots in the Income Tax 
Act and exempt this group, exempt that group and double the tax 
on this group and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a massive overhaul, one that is consistent, one that is 
logical, one that makes sense, one that helps the economy, one 
that leaves more of the money people have earned in their own 
pockets and puts the country at a competitive edge such that it 
has never seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see the country run ahead in terms of its 
economic activity per capita vis-à-vis the United States and 
other G-7 countries and our trading partners.  We have the 
potential to achieve that.  We have a vigorous, well trained 
population.  We have a wealth of resources unmatched in the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the fact that Liberal members are all sort of shaking in 
their pants these days, we have a relatively stable political 
country.  Our political regime is relatively stable.  We change 
our governments by election.  I always say we do it with ballots 
instead of with bullets.  That is something we want to preserve 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all these positive things going for us, but what do we 
have?  We have a country that is struggling, a country where our 
young people find it impossible to get jobs.  They are lured to 
the United States because of lower taxes and higher salary 
offers.  We keep on struggling in this country because of our 
excessive tax regime. 
I think we need to pay attention to the facts here and not put 
our heads in the sand any longer.

for me to carry on for a long time, but I will have to disappoint 
the vast majority over there.  I will stop at this stage and say 
that I will be voting against this bill for the reasons I have 
mentioned.  I will also continue to press forward for a new 
system, a new regime in this country, a system that is fair, that 
bolsters our economy and that leaves more of the people's hard 
earned money in their pockets so they can provide for their own 
needs and the needs of their families.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to say at the outset that I will be splitting my 
time with the lugubrious and illustrious member from Kamloops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the House give its consent for 
the hon. member for Regina—Qu'Appelle to split his time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to say a few 
words on the GST bill, but I will first respond to the member for 
Elk Island who talked about the Alliance Party's new tax policy 
being a fair one, which is 17% across the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell everybody that its tax policy would give a big 
tax cut to the wealthy and the rich, because someone who makes an 
awful lot of money, as supposedly my friend from Alberta on my 
left does, making $300,000 or $400,000 a year, one can just 
imagine the kind of tax break he would have if he had a 17% tax 
break compared to what we have today in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was on an airplane a few hours ago.  I picked up a newspaper 
and noticed that one of the candidates for the leadership of the 
Alliance Party, Tom Long, had a fundraiser in Muskoka.  I think 
when we look at where political parties get their money from, it 
tells us a lot about political parties.  I remember the reform 
party, since I come from the west, talking about being grassroots 
and representing ordinary people who come and put money in a hat 
and it picks up a few dollars here and there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tom Long had a fundraiser in the Muskokas.  What do members 
think they charged for this fundraiser?  First, it was not a big 
dinner with steak and wine; it was finger foods and the sipping 
of champagne.  What do members think they charged?  The member 
from Kamloops has guessed $100, while someone else has guessed 
$200.  They charged $5,000 a person to go to a fundraiser for a 
leadership candidate of the Alliance Party, some grassroot party, 
some party in touch with ordinary people.  It has become the 
party of Bay Street, the party that has been hijacked by the Bay 
Street barons.  That is what has happened to the reform party of 
Canada, and then it pretends that it is speaking for the ordinary 
people of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.   I normally would not interrupt my friend, but he 
obviously has made a mistake in his speech when he said they were 
charging $5,000 per person to attend that fundraiser.  I wonder 
if he could— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  That is not a point 
of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, according to a very reliable 
newspaper, the <I>Hill Times</I>, it was $5,000 a person.  Around 
100 people attended this function in the Muskokas.  They raised 
around $500,000 for the leadership campaign of an ordinary 
grassroots Canadian named Tom Long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Fine fellow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  A fine fellow, I am told by the 
reform MP next to me.  We now have a party that really is the 
party of the rich, the party of the powerful, the party of Bay 
Street, the party of the insiders, the party of the backroom 
boys.  I am talking about Tom Long here.  I am not talking about 
the old reform party that at one time said it was speaking for 
the ordinary citizens.  This is the new party that wants to 
appeal to Ontario.  It is the new party that is trying to imitate 
Brian Mulroney, despite the fact that he called it the reform 
party in pantyhose the other day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what has happened to the Alliance Party of Canada. I can 
tell the House that there are a lot of people in my riding, 
ordinary folks, who voted reform— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  On a point of order, 
the hon. member for Elk Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, normally we would have an 
opportunity for debate after a speech.  I think this is the last 
of the speeches where we do not.  I would not raise this point 
but I really think he is quite irrelevant vis-à-vis Bill C-24.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I was listening to 
the debate and I am sure the hon. member was just about to make a 
link between his propos and the bill we are debating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  I began my remarks by saying that the 
17% flat tax proposed by the reform party, or the Alliance Party, 
would favour the wealthy people of the country, people who make 
$300,000 to $600,000 a year or more.  I said that indicative of 
that of course was a fundraiser by Tom Long.  Maybe I have to 
repeat that.  An invitation was sent out inviting people to a 
fundraiser at a cottage in the Muskokas where they could eat some 
caviar and sip champagne.  The cost was $5,000 a head.  I am sure 
a lot of people sitting in the House, who are members of 
parliament from the Alliance Party, could not go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think my friend from Vancouver could afford $5,000 for 
an evening with Tom Long.  I do not know if my friend over there 
from Elk Island could afford $5,000 for an afternoon with Tom 
Long, but that is now what the party is targeting.  It is 
targeting the wealthy people in the country which is why it is 
proposing tax reform in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A flat tax of 17% would see a major reduction for the wealthy, a 
major reduction for the privileged and more taxes for the 
ordinary citizen, the ordinary middle class working family, and 
of course major cutbacks in government services such as health 
care and education.  People should be fully aware of what the new 
Alliance Party stands for.  That is the kind of tax reform we do 
not want at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to turn my attention to some of the reasons why the bill 
was brought in today.  It was to amend—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, before we broke for unanimous consent, I was responding 
to the Canadian Alliance and its new tax idea of a 17% flat tax. 
That was suggested by one of its spokespeople as an alternative 
to some of the taxes in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill really deals with the goods and services tax and with 
a whole series of technical amendments to the GST that were 
introduced as a result of the budget that came into the House in 
February.  It also makes permanent a 40% surtax on profits of 
tobacco manufacturers, and a number of things of that sort.  We 
have in here a whole series of things, some positive and some 
negative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we should also be doing in this debate is going back over a 
bit of the history of why we have the GST in the first place.  I 
remember very well back in 1990 when the idea was suggested by 
the Conservative government of the day led by the former prime 
minister Brian Mulroney.  The GST became law in January 1991. It 
was a 7% tax brought in by the Mulroney government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was about 1990 when the Conservatives first suggested 
bringing in the GST and replacing the old manufacturers sales 
tax.  My recollection is that this was never discussed in the 
federal election campaign of 1988.  It was something that 
happened after the campaign. 
It is something that stirred a great deal of controversy and 
animosity in the country, as most Canadians were opposed to the 
GST.  The GST in effect is a flat tax, with a 7% rate for 
everyone, regardless of whether one is rich or poor.  If people 
are going to have a haircut or buy a certain product or a certain 
commodity on which the GST is applicable, it does not matter what 
their income is, they still pay the GST.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the poor people there is of course the GST tax credit, but 
even with the tax credit it does not make it an equitable tax. 
When we get to the middle income bracket, compared to the 
wealthier income people, it becomes extremely regressive because 
it becomes in effect a flat tax.  Everyone pays the same tax rate 
on the same commodities, which are in many instances necessities 
of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember very well the Liberal Party of Canada taking a strong 
stand against the GST.  I remember the all-night committee 
hearing in the Railway Committee Room when the Liberals said that 
if they were elected and formed the government they indeed would 
abolish the GST.  They said they would get rid of it.  “Elect us 
and the GST will be gone”.  That was part of the 1993 campaign. 
We all remember a couple of years after that when the then deputy 
prime minister, now the Minister of Canadian Heritage, resigned 
her seat because of a commitment she had made to the voters of 
Hamilton East that if elected the Liberal Party would indeed get 
rid of the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That of course has not happened.  The GST is still here.  A 
campaign commitment that was made has disappeared.  It is 
interesting that Brian Mulroney, when he made his first political 
speech on Friday, in addition to talking about the the Alliance 
being the Reform Party in pantyhose, talked about the present 
Liberal government accepting many of his policies, including the 
free trade agreement, NAFTA and the GST, policies that the 
Liberals had campaigned against, policies that they had opposed, 
policies that they had filibustered against in the House of 
Commons.  Speaker after speaker rose in the opposition to say 
that if they were elected they would get rid of the GST.  If they 
were elected they would not bring in a NAFTA-type deal.  If they 
were elected they would certainly not go along with the free 
trade agreement with the United States.  That is a bit of the 
history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have the harmonized sales tax which was implemented in 
some of the Atlantic provinces in 1997.  Before that, of course, 
Quebec introduced its harmonized sales tax in 1992.  That is some 
of the background on the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, the Liberals promised to scrap the tax.  They broke 
their promise.  That is one of the reasons more and more 
Canadians are cynical of the political process, and are more 
cynical of politicians as every year goes by.  Liberal 
politicians are seen as having broken their promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole tax system has to be made fairer and more progressive. 
I think the GST is among the most regressive of all taxes, 
except for the GST tax refund for some of the poor people in the 
country.  It is a very regressive tax because it becomes a flat 
tax.  Of course, as I have already said, the Alliance wants to 
carry it even further by having a flat tax of 17% right across 
the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this country we have a long history of a progressive tax 
system.  That tax system has gradually become less and less 
progressive with the passage of time.  I remember before the 
Mulroney days that there were seven or eight different tax 
brackets on the federal side, which were reduced to only three 
brackets, 29%, 26% and 16%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As announced in the last budget, we are gradually going to see 
that made a bit progressive within the narrow band where the 
middle bracket will eventually go from 26% to 23%, so we will 
have 16%, 23% and 29% brackets.  What we have suggested many 
times is that we make the system more progressive.  I would 
personally like to go back to about five different tax brackets 
so that we could have a more gradual scale, where we would tax 
people more progressively based on their ability to pay.  I think 
that is only fair.  If someone makes more money than someone 
else, the long tradition in this country has been that they 
should be taxed in accordance with their ability to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are moving away from that.  The Reform Party wants to go the 
extreme distance by having just one flat tax in the country, 
which would be extremely unfair.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I notice the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle has referred 
to our party as the Reform Party several times.  I wonder if he 
could use the correct term for our party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I remind the hon. 
member to please call the Canadian Alliance by its proper name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, before I was 
interrupted by the member from the Canadian Reform Conservative 
Alliance Party, I was saying that that particular party wanted to 
make the tax system even more regressive, more unfair and even 
more of a burden for ordinary middle class Canadians.  That is 
the policy of the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance Party. 
That is what it stands for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that is why 100 people showed up a few days ago in the 
Muskokas at $5,000 a head to eat caviar and sip champagne with 
Tom Long, one of the candidates for the leadership of that party. 
They are excited about a more regressive tax system.  They are 
excited about putting more of a tax burden on ordinary, middle 
class people.  They are excited about tearing down government and 
putting less money into health care, education and regional 
economic development.  That is what the Canadian Alliance stands 
for.  It is the party of the wealthy, the rich, the insiders and 
Bay Street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians note those things.  They are not stupid.  They 
understand where this new party is going, that it is trying to 
become the party of Brian Mulroney and the old Conservatives from 
a few years ago, the very party which the original leader tore 
apart in 1993 for the foundation of the Reform Party.  Like 
amoebae they are changing their skin and trying to form a party 
of big business and Bay Street.  They are basically doing that by 
advocating a flat tax and a radical reduction in the role of 
government.  The Canadian people will see through it and will not 
allow that kind of extreme right wing ideology to have any more 
influence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the GST should be scaled back as a first step.  I 
see that the member for Red Deer just entered the House.  I 
wonder whether he went to Tom Long's little picnic for $5,000 the 
other day in the Muskokas.  It was a great fundraiser for his 
leadership campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I really do not believe that who attended what function or how 
much they paid has any relevance at all to Bill C-24.  I ask you 
to bring the member back on topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I do not believe that 
is really a point of order.  Relevance is a point of order and I 
would remind the hon. member to please keep his speech close to 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, I want to remind my 
friends in the alliance party of something that Ernest Manning 
once said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The name of the group represented is the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I would remind the 
member again that the Chair has ruled that we refer to that party 
as the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, in the House of 
Commons we call it the Canadian Alliance.  The chief electoral 
officer, I think, calls it the Canadian Reform Conservative 
Alliance.  It is rather confusing to a lot of us what it calls 
itself.  The former Prime Minister of Canada called it the Reform 
Party in pantyhose.  It becomes more confusing day by day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the House that a very distinguished gentleman, 
Ernest Manning, and another very distinguished western 
politician, Tommy Douglas, a number of years ago always said to 
us “He who pays the piper calls the tune”.  We should always 
watch to see who pays the piper, who contributes to political 
parties and who pays the bills for political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now seeing on our left a party that is going through a 
metamorphosis.  It originally started as a grassroots party.  Now 
we are seeing the extremely wealthy people in the country paying 
$5,000 for an afternoon of sipping champagne and eating caviar 
with Tom Long.  It is a party that has changed its rudder and its 
direction.  That tells us an awful lot about what it really 
stands for.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are seeing is a direction in which the Canadian people 
do not want to go.  The majority of Canadian people, the polls 
have shown, want the GST to be cut back.  The most popular tax 
cut in the country would be to get rid of the GST, to scale it 
back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We suggested taking the GST off things like books.  We suggested 
taking the GST down one point, from 7% to 6%, as the beginning of 
a process to get rid of it.  That is what the Canadian people 
want.  In fact the federal government's own polling, done by the 
Earnscliffe group, which is very close to the Minister of 
Finance, reported just a few months ago that the tax cut of 
choice—and we do not hear this from the Canadian Alliance—would 
be to scale back and eventually eliminate the GST, a tax which 
last year picked up some $23.1 billion from the Canadian people. 
It is the most regressive tax that we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is the GST unfair to ordinary citizens, it is a tax 
that is unfair and very difficult for business, particularly 
small business.  When we go up and down the main streets of our 
small towns and cities—and I am sure that even the premier of 
Prince Edward Island would be willing to admit this—we hear many 
business people talking about the paper burden of being a tax 
collector for the Government of Canada.  It becomes a real burden 
for the small business person who has only a handful of 
employees, or the farmer who, compared to a large business, 
because of the economy of scale, can do this with much less 
difficulty.  Indeed, it is a very bad tax for small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the Canadian Alliance members are silent on this.  The 
silence is really deafening when we do not hear them complain 
about the GST, when we do not hear them calling for the 
elimination of the GST and when we do not hear them asking to 
roll back the GST.  The GST is a very regressive tax that hits 
ordinary Canadians and middle class Canadians the hardest. It is 
a bad tax for business.  It is a bad tax for farmers.  It becomes 
a paper burden.  Of course, that is something which Canadian 
Alliance members do not complain about whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also not a good tax for medical doctors.  The physicians 
of this country cannot, contrary to what some other professionals 
can do, claim the GST tax refund.  That makes it a difficult tax 
for them.  In fact the Canadian Medical Association has spoken 
out against this and has asked for some changes in terms of how 
the GST applies to the medical profession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason is that the designation of medical services is tax 
exempt under the Excise Tax Act, which means that physicians are 
in the position of being denied the ability to claim a GST tax 
refund.  That of course is for input tax credits, which many 
other professionals and many other organizations can claim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the inequities about the goods and services 
tax, some of the things that should be changed and some of the 
things that reflect what the Canadian people want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Kamloops is very anxious to say a few words, so 
I will conclude by saying that the main thing we need is a more 
fair and a more progressive tax system that is based on ability 
to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we knock on doors or if we walk down the main street with 
ordinary people, the people who go to Tim Hortons, to McDonald's 
or to the corner cafe, the ordinary people who shop on a Saturday 
morning at Canadian Tire or who go to the wheat pool elevator in 
Winyard, Saskatchewan, those ordinary people do not go to Tom 
Long's $5,000 per person affair in the Muskokas with the wealthy 
people.  The ordinary people of this country— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  The wealthy people have a vote too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  The member of the Canadian Alliance 
said something that is actually accurate.  He said that the 
wealthy people have a vote too.  Of course they have a vote.  The 
Stronachs of the world have a vote.  Peter Pocklington has a 
vote.  Wealthy people have votes.  Now we have a political party 
that caters to the wealthy people, that stands for the rich, that 
stands for the privileged and that stands for the wealthy people 
on Bay Street who make a lot of money and support a backroom boy 
called Tom Long. 
He used to be on Brian Mulroney's staff who brought in the GST, 
who helped bring in the free trade agreement and who helped bring 
in all kinds of regressive policies.

Canadian Alliance.  Then finally those guys will be out of the 
weeds.  There will be a party here that will stand for the 
wealthy, the rich and for a redistribution of income where more 
goes to the wealthy people and less goes to the middle class and 
the poor.  That is what that party is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to have a great debate about the tax system.  It is 
an ideological debate about where we want to go in this country. 
Very clearly we want a tax system based on progressivity, based 
on fairness, based on the ability to pay and not a taxation 
system with a flat tax where everybody is taxed at the very same 
rate regardless of income.  That is not where the Canadian people 
want to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the next campaign when we can take on the 
forces of the far right that want to turn back the clock and 
return this country to the age of Fred Flintstone and Barney 
Rubble.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I too look forward to making a few 
comments on Bill C-24.   The comments of my friend who just spoke 
made me think about an issue.  These days there is a level of 
cynicism in the land attached to politicians.  One wonders where 
that cynicism comes from, what is it that makes people— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  From the member who just spoke.  It was 20 
minutes of lies.  That is where it came from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, I was not going to refer 
to my friends in the Canadian Alliance but since they have been 
calling us liars, I feel that I have to make some comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  That is the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, let me start off with an 
observation about the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of that party said when they came to Ottawa their leader 
was not going to be driven around in a big fancy limousine 
because it would send the wrong message.  It was to be a 
grassroots party and being escorted about in a nice big black 
limousine with a personal driver was not the imagery the then 
Reform Party wanted.  Today is the leader being chauffeured 
around in a black limousine? The answer is yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the leader said he would not want to move into Stornoway 
because that big mansion would send the wrong impression.  He 
said that it should be turned into a bingo hall but lo and 
behold, the leader of the Reform Party moved in and occupied 
Stornoway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Where the Leader of the Official Opposition lays his head at 
night is irrelevant to Bill C-24.  I call for relevance in this 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I will ask the hon. 
member to try to be relevant for the rest of his speech, even 
though personally I did not think that such a remark was out of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, you are absolutely right. 
My friend is also right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I was trying to make my point in a roundabout way. The 
leader of the Reform Party said that he would not live in 
Stornoway.  Then he changed his mind and said, “Excuse me. I 
made a mistake.  I actually will move into Stornoway”.  That was 
the point.  To be fair, it actually does not have much to do with 
this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then I noticed a number of my friends in the Reform Party— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  I rise on a point of order, Madam 
Speaker.   It is the Canadian Alliance party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, a number of my friends in 
what was then the Reform Party said that one thing they would 
never ever do was opt into the MP pension plan. Some people here 
did.  I am not going to name the members but a number of MPs 
said, “We changed our mind.  I guess some of us are going to opt 
in now”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The member from Kamloops did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, the member from Kamloops 
was always in the plan.  I was honest about it.  I was in the 
plan and I paid for it.  I did not say I would not take it and 
then slip in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of these comments is to simply say it is no wonder 
people are cynical about us.  When one thing is said and another 
thing is done— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Relevance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am getting to the 
point.  My hon. friend is calling for relevance.  Let us go to 
the Liberals.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-24 is a little bit of fiddling around with the GST. We 
are anxious and glad that the fiddling took place.  We support 
this fiddling, but let us face it.  What the government should 
have done was phase out the GST, and make a little change here 
and a little finicky switch there and so on.  And we applaud 
that, but for goodness sake, what did the Liberal members do when 
they campaigned across the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard from countless candidates in the election campaign that 
the minute they were elected they were going to do away with the 
GST.  I do not know if they actually said that, but they said 
they were going to deal with the GST.  The Liberals said the GST 
was unfair.  They said the GST was biased.  They said the GST was 
unjust and if people elected the Liberals, they were going to 
change all of that. Where people made the mistake was they 
thought the Liberals meant they were going to abolish it.  The 
Liberals did not. When they got elected they said they would keep 
this tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again a certain cynicism builds.  Quite frankly I wonder 
why it is not even greater because again, going back to my 
friends in the Liberal Party, they even campaigned against the 
NAFTA. The Liberals said that if they were elected, they were are 
going to do away with NAFTA.  Of course, not only did they not do 
away with NAFTA, they have become the free trade cheerleaders of 
the world.  They are trying to get us into NAFTA now with almost 
every country going. We could debate the merits of NAFTA, but the 
point is they said they were going to abolish NAFTA.  The 
Liberals said they were going to get out of NAFTA but they did 
exactly the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder people are cynical.  No wonder people ask if anyone 
can actually believe what the Liberals say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That same group said if they were elected they would introduce a 
national child care program.  Have we seen a national child care 
program?   Whoops.  They forgot about that. The Liberals promised 
that if they were elected they would introduce a national child 
care program.  They did not say, “If you elect us, we are going 
to have negotiations with the provinces”.  They said, “A child 
care program is a national priority for us”.  We are still 
waiting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a long list and I could go on but I think I have made 
my point.  No wonder people are a little cynical about this 
business.  If we are going to deal with the GST, as my friend 
from Regina said, the only way to deal with it is to reform the 
tax system from top to bottom.  A complete overhaul of the tax 
system is needed. The tax system right now is out of control.  It 
is meaningless.  I do not think a single member or Canadians 
anywhere in the country could say, “I understand our tax 
system”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>   Read our proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  My friend says to read the proposal from 
the Canadian Alliance party.  Its proposal is a flat tax.  I know 
that my friends are going to campaign on the flat tax.  The 
Republican Party in the United States rejected it.  The 
Republicans said there was no way they could go ahead with the 
flat tax idea because it is a tax that is going to benefit the 
wealthy people. The Republicans said to forget it, they were 
going to drop it.  George Bush has never used the term flat tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then Mr. Harris and Ernie Eves in Ontario said there was no way 
they wanted to touch this flat tax business because again, it 
favours the rich and the wealthy of the country.   We can 
probably guess who the multimillionaires would vote for, because 
if they were making millions of dollars and only had to pay a 17% 
flat tax, my goodness, that would be a real windfall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP does not support a flat tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Like the leader of the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  We have nothing against millionaires.  I 
was just saying that millionaires like the flat tax because it 
means they pay a lot less income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the NDP supports the idea of improving the 
GST.  However, the ultimate solution is not to tinker with it, 
with a little switch here and a little shift there, but to 
abolish the GST as we were originally promised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there was a signal it would be that any political party that 
said it was going to abolish the GST would be very successful in 
the next general election.  I have been listening carefully and I 
hear only one party saying that, the New Democratic Party of 
Canada.  It says that this is a regressive tax. The GST is an 
unfair and biased tax and it should be phased out.  That is our 
fundamental point.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some clear differences here.  The Liberals like the GST. 
The Canadian Alliance wants to bring in a flat tax.  The New 
Democratic Party wants to phase out the GST, do away with the GST 
and have less tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I have said enough.  My friends are nodding in agreement 
so I think I will sit down.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to speak to Bill C-24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague in the party formerly known as reform said, it 
was my party that actually brought in the GST.  I am proud to say 
it was my party which had the foresight to replace a 
counterproductive tax called the manufacturers' sales tax with 
one called the GST.  In fact, it has been recognized as not only 
one of the fairer taxes, but as one of the least negative in 
terms of its impact on the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the party formerly known as reform, the party that 
dare not speaketh its name, and the Liberal Party seem to have 
embraced that previously opposed tax because it was and is the 
right policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took a party that was willing to take a significant amount of 
risk and which had a high level of vision and focus on the future 
of Canada, not simply a focus on next week's polls but instead on 
the challenges and opportunities facing Canadians well into the 
21st century.  That was the Progressive Conservative government 
of Brian Mulroney.  It is to his credit that that policy has 
ultimately aged very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that Canada needs a significant level of tax reform. 
There has not been a significant level of tax reform since the 
time of the GST going back to I believe 1989 when the tax 
proposals were first discussed and debated.  Ultimately the GST 
was implemented in the early 1990s.  That was a major shift in 
tax reform in Canada, primarily because it enabled the country to 
move from a purely income based tax system to a consumption based 
system.  That in itself is recognized by most free market 
economic theorists around the world as being more sensible in 
taxing income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is we have to raise revenue.  Oliver Wendell Holmes 
once said that taxes are the price we pay for a civilized 
society.  The question is how we tax people and the amount to 
which we tax people.  Those questions determine largely the 
degree to which we have a productive and viable economy capable 
of producing the level of economic wealth and prosperity to 
sustain the very social programs, benefits, health care and 
education that we value as Canadians. It is very important to 
consider the degree to which tax reform can be a great vehicle in 
creating economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other countries have leapt ahead of Canada in this very critical 
area. Ireland for example has had a 92% growth in its GDP per 
capita over the last 10 years, largely based on an aggressive and 
innovative tax reform strategy.  Ireland's tax reform was based 
largely on creating a corporate tax strategy which attracted a 
significant amount of investment from around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the finance committee studied the issue of productivity 
last year, it was clear from a number of economic minds that 
there was a significant link between investment and productivity 
in the new economy.  Clearly productivity gains are critical and 
exceptionally important in creating economic wealth and 
prosperity in the new economy.

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is:  How do we do that?  Clearly there is a strong 
linkage between capital and productivity.  The types of 
productivity enhancements that are necessary to create economic 
growth today require significant levels of capital and 
investment.  Tax policy that encourages investment, that attracts 
capital, will ultimately lead to greater levels of productivity. 
Greater levels of productivity will ultimately lead to greater 
levels of economic growth and competitiveness for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our productivity growth or lack thereof, or the degree to which 
our productivity growth has lagged behind our trading 
competitors, particularly the U.S., threatens the standard of 
living that we value as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen during the 1990s a significant decline in our 
disposable income relative to the U.S.  We have had about an 8% 
decline during the same period that Americans have enjoyed a 10% 
increase.  Our productivity growth has lagged behind the U.S. 
while other countries—and I cited Ireland a few minutes 
ago—have had extraordinary growth, 92% growth of GDP per capita. 
In the last 10 years the U.S. has had around 15% to 20% growth in 
GDP per capita.  Canada has had about a 5% growth in GDP per 
capita. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As other countries and individuals and businesses in other 
countries are getting richer, Canadians in a relative sense are 
getting poorer.  That in part is the reason we have seen our 
dollar lose almost 10 cents under this government since 1993.  A 
dollar that lost only a penny during the nine years of the 
Mulroney government has lost under this government almost 10 
cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's response was that a low dollar is good for 
tourism as it reduces the cost for Americans to come to Canada. 
His theory is that Canada can devalue its way to prosperity.  The 
logical corollary of his illogical argument is that ultimately if 
we continue on this trend we could reduce our dollar to zero and 
thus would become the greatest trading nation in the world 
because we could give all our products away and things would be 
very productive and beneficial from that perspective.  Obviously 
the Prime Minister's theory on monetary or fiscal policy is as 
sound as his theory on most policy issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a government that is a government of sound and original 
ideas.  Unfortunately its sound ideas are seldom original and its 
original ideas are never sound.  The degree to which the 
government has relied on the sound fiscal policies of the 
previous government and the structural changes made to the 
Canadian economy by the previous government to fuel its economic 
growth has been unprecedented.  There has never been a government 
that has fought as vociferously against the very economic 
policies it ultimately ended up embracing as this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we discussed, those policies included the GST, free trade, 
deregulation of financial services, transportation and energy. 
Liberals members opposite fought every one of those structural 
reforms tooth and nail until they were elected, at which point 
they embraced the policies because they were the right ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some ways we should commend Liberal members opposite for 
swallowing themselves whole upon being elected in 1993, 
sacrificing their principles at the altar of reality, doing what 
was right for Canada and embracing the sound policies of the 
previous government.  For that I commend them and thank them 
because they were willing to put aside principle in the interest 
of doing what is right for Canada, which is adopting the right 
policies that they vigorously opposed in opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the New Democratic Party spoke at length of 
the soundness from an economic perspective of eliminating the GST 
or reducing the GST with a goal of eliminating it.  There would 
be nothing worse in terms of our tax policy reform than 
eliminating or reducing the GST at this point.  The GST raises 
about $22 billion worth of revenue, which is a greater level of 
revenue than what we draw from corporate taxation in Canada. 
Raising that revenue actually has a less negative impact on the 
economy than any other form of taxation. 
I did not have the opportunity to ask the member for whom I have 
a significant amount of respect about it.  I disagree vehemently 
with many of the policies of the New Democratic Party, but I do 
respect its consistency as opposed to the flip-flop party in the 
government opposite or the party formerly known as Reform.  Its 
members have adopted one policy of the Liberal Party to change 
its policies at whim to try to appeal to the populist winds that 
blow not just across the prairies but anywhere in Canada where 
they feel they may be able to buy the odd vote.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though I vehemently oppose the economic naivete that 
permeates NDP policy, I do respect its principles that remain 
fairly consistent in opposing things like the GST.  The New 
Democrats to their credit were opposed to the GST and continue to 
be opposed to the GST.  The New Democrats to their credit were 
opposed to NAFTA and continue to be opposed to trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am supporting their consistency in maintaining what I believe 
to be bad policies.  However I would prefer a party and 
individuals in a party that for principled reasons maintain 
policies that I disagree with than parties that simply embrace 
the latest political whim or populist leaning out there. 
Government by populism is an abdication of leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leadership means not just simply doing what is popular but it 
means doing what is right.  Leadership means not just responding 
to today's polls but in fact looking ahead of where Canadians are 
today and trying to determine where the country is going relative 
to other countries.  Leadership means looking at global trends 
and putting in place a policy framework that responds very 
strongly to the future opportunities and challenges facing 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the abdication of leadership to a large extent that has 
occurred in political service, there seems to be almost a vacuum 
of vision, foresight and courageous leadership in today's 
political environment.  On the other hand the Progressive 
Conservative Party continues to bring forth visionary tax reform 
policies, including the elimination of the personal capital gains 
tax.  Certainly this is not because the elimination of personal 
capital gains tax is a populist idea that would resonate across 
the main streets of Canada necessarily but because it is the 
right policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to create the greatest level of economic growth and 
prosperity for Canadians sometimes we have to say and do what is 
right.  In terms of its impact on the economy there is no tax 
that has a more deleterious impact on the new economy, on wealth 
creation and on capital formation for the new economy than the 
capital gains tax regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a 13% disadvantage over the U.S. in areas of capital 
gains taxation, even after the recent budget which was a step in 
the right direction but a baby step when other countries are 
taking gigantic leaps.  Elimination of the personal capital gains 
tax would give us a 20% advantage.  For the first time in a long 
time Canada would actually have an advantage in a very important 
area of taxation.  In the most critical and fundamentally 
important form of taxation in terms of its impact on the new 
economy Canada would have an advantage over the U.S.  We would 
become a magnate for investment in the new economy as opposed to 
the repellent we have become under the listless, rudderless 
leadership of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another area of tax reform we need a redefining of the middle 
class in Canada.  Clearly our current tax brackets penalize 
success in a very unfair way.  Americans do not hit the top 
marginal tax rate until $420,000 Canadian.  In Canada we 
currently hit the top marginal tax rate at about $60,000.  After 
full implementation of the recent budget that figure would be 
$70,000.  At $70,000 Canadian, even after the full implementation 
of that budget, we would still see Canadians hit the top marginal 
tax rate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A family today making $70,000 per year is not rich.  It is naive 
to think that someone making $70,000 per year in Canada, and 
particularly a family with dependants, would be rich.  This 
creates a huge disadvantage when Americans do not hit that top 
income threshold until $420,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that a technology worker, a software engineer for 
instance in Vancouver who is making $72,000 per year, is paying 
52% of his income in federal and provincial taxes.  The same 
individual at the same level of income in the same industry an 
hour and a half away in Seattle would be paying about 26% of his 
income in taxes.  We need to redefine the middle class in Canada. 
We need to adjust our tax bracket significantly to recognize that 
there are many people in that very critical area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see my colleagues from Quebec here.  Quebec's policies on the 
new economy have been very successful in creating a greater level 
of economic growth whether it is in biotech, e-commerce or 
knowledge based industry.  Quebec has done a commendable job in 
terms of growing the economy in these areas, but it has been 
without the assistance of the federal government and with a lack 
of leadership in terms of the types of tax policies that would 
attract knowledge based industry to Canada in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that my colleagues from Quebec would share with us 
their vision of the new economy.  It is extraordinarily important 
for all regions of Canada to develop policies that attract the 
innovators, not just keep the innovators in Canada which is 
probably the wrong headed place to start.  Instead of the notion 
of trying to keep the people here, why do we not develop policies 
that actually attract the best and the brightest? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever we shoot for a fairly low goal we end up achieving a 
lot less.  We should be developing the types of policies that 
attract innovators to Canada.  Quebec has been quite successful 
in developing provincial policies that have been helpful in terms 
of doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government made a recent announcement of another 
$400 million for ACOA to invest in a technology fund in Atlantic 
Canada.  There is some discussion about that, as nebulous as it 
might be.  Governments and government agencies have been 
inconsistent and continue to be notoriously bad at picking 
winners and losers.  There is a no more complicated area of the 
economy in terms of the difficulty in separating winners and 
losers than the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As much as I think ACOA has done some very good work at various 
times, we would be far better served to see a reduction in 
corporate and capital gains tax in Atlantic Canada by the amount 
the government is proposing to increase the ACOA allotment for 
new economy investments.  Reducing taxes in Atlantic Canada, 
particularly those taxes that have the most negative impact on 
the new economy, would be far more sound than increasing the 
budget of an agency for direct lending and grants to the new 
economy.  That is my feeling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a general sense we need to reduce and ultimately eliminate 
the personal capital gains tax in Canada if we want to speak to 
the new economy entrepreneurs and create a greater level of 
economic growth in the sectors we need to be competitive in.  We 
need to reduce our corporate tax levels to at least OECD levels. 
While the government has made a pathetic, anemic, little baby 
step in the right direction, other countries are leaping ahead of 
us far more quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to redefine our middle class by adjusting our tax 
bracket significantly, but not to the extent that is being 
suggested by the party formerly known as Reform in its flat tax 
proposal.  Steve Forbes fought two U.S. elections on the flat 
tax.  He was unsuccessful in both cases because the flat tax was 
too right wing for U.S. Republicans.  The flat tax is too right 
wing for the government of Mike Harris and Ernie Eves.  It has 
been cited by individuals including Mr. Eves, the finance 
minister in Ontario, as being unfair overall and not being 
appropriate. 
I would argue that for very sound reasons it will be less 
saleable in Canada than it has been in the U.S and, from a 
principle perspective, it is not an appropriate policy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be building our tax policies around growth and not 
greed. We should be focusing on reducing the types of taxes that 
most negatively impact on our ability to compete in the new 
economy. We have to recognize that lower taxes in some cases do 
not necessarily result in lower revenue.  In fact, reducing 
capital gains taxes would create such a significant level of 
unlocking of capital in Canada that we would ultimately raise 
significant levels of revenue in other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alan Greenspan, the federal reserve chairman in the U.S., has 
recommended the elimination of personal capital gains tax from 
the perspective that it would unlock a significant level of 
capital and help entrepreneurialism and economic growth in the 
U.S.  That is the very same priority we should have in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, the legislation is a collection of tiny little baby 
steps on tax policies by a government that is incapable of the 
broad sweeping changes and courageous vision that the previous 
government had.  After the next election, I look forward to, 
being in position as part of a Progressive Conservative 
government, making the types of changes Canadians need.

introduce in the House earlier today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides for the correction of an anomaly in 
legislation that was passed in 1995, which, as we all remember, 
ended double dipping with respect to severances.  However, it 
should be noted that it responds to concerns expressed by various 
members.  It is a non-partisan bill that should be welcomed by 
all of us in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will explain why the current situation is unfair.  It is 
unfair to over 100 MPs who are under the age of 55 and who have 
been shortchanged as a result of pension changes made in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1995 legislation provided for a severance allowance of six 
months salary to MPs under 55 who entered the pension plan after 
July 1995.  However, an MP elected before July 1995 does not 
receive any severance because the MP gets a small pension for 
contributions made before July of that year.  In the case of some 
members, that pension is as low as $1,400 a year, and that $1,400 
stipend—because that is all it is—in fact prevents people from 
having any kind of severance, and of course those members, were 
they to cease to be members of this place, are not even eligible 
for unemployment insurance.  We would not tolerate that of a 
private sector employer, certainly not one of the size of the 
Canadian government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation has created two groups, almost two classes of 
MPs.  MPs under 55 who were elected after 1995 get a severance 
allowance, while those elected before that date get no severance. 
For example, an MP under age 55 who was elected in 1993 would 
receive an annual pension of $5,600 a year and no severance.  In 
one case, as I said, this could be as low as $1,400.  There are 
actually two MPs in that situation.  This pension would increase 
to $21,000 when the MP in question reaches 55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need I remind all of us that the pension is not free.  People 
pay premiums, and the premiums, even by many standards, are quite 
high; $7,000 to $8,000 or, in the case of ministers, as much as 
$10,000 a year in premiums on the pension plan.  That amount is 
subtracted from what one is usually entitled to contribute to a 
retirement savings plan, so that is not free either because other 
investment opportunities are also denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An MP who was elected in 1997 and retires after six years would 
receive a severance allowance equal to six months' salary, or 
$34,000 a year, and at age 55 would receive the full pension that 
one gets after six years.  Of course one only gets the real full 
pension after 19 years of being a member of parliament, another 
fact not too well know, particularly by those who want to portray 
members of parliament in an unkind way. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill we are addressing today remedies the injustice to which 
I have referred, in the present pay arrangements, by providing a 
reasonable severance allowance for all MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those under the age of 55 who were elected prior to July 1995 
and belong to the MPs' pension plan will receive an allowance 
equal to six months salary, at the time they leave their 
position, less any immediate annual annuity.  Thus, the allowance 
and the pension are not combined.  The one is subtracted from the 
other, and MPs may only receive the difference between the two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members under the age of 55 who were elected after 1995 will 
continue to receive the allowance of six months salary after six 
years of service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In both cases, the allowance would not exceed six months salary 
after six years of service. 
So, it remains the same for both groups, with the amendment I am 
suggesting today.

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, this change does not affect members under 55 
elected in 1997, as I said earlier.  Nor does it affect members 
who have opted out of the pension scheme, because they will 
continue to receive the six month allowance when they leave 
their position. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The severance allowance proposed in the bill is reasonable.  It 
is comparable to severance allowances provided to provincial 
parliamentarians.  As a matter of fact, it is even less generous 
than what is offered in a number of Ontario provincial 
legislatures.  It is not that high either when one compares 
allowances in the private sector, in particular large private 
sector concerns.  Of course none of them are as large as the 
federal government, but in many medium size sectors their 
executives and people in higher echelons have severance packages 
that are far more generous.  Even the municipalities have quite 
generous severance packages, as we have noted from reports in the 
media, for those who are leaving their services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Providing all MPs with a severance allowance is also appropriate 
because MPs do not have access, as most people do, to 
unemployment insurance to support their families while they are 
looking for another job.  Again that is something that is not too 
well publicized.  I suspect there has been more than one case of 
someone leaving this high office only to find out that there were 
no benefits at all, not even a transition, not even unemployment 
insurance that every worker would get. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, Mr. Speaker, in case you are wondering, yes we do 
pay unemployment insurance premiums even though we cannot 
collect.  We certainly pay Canada pension plan premiums even 
though technically we do not receive a salary, we receive an 
emolument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the example of a former MP, a 45 year old parent 
of two who is eligible for a full pension at 55.  I think it is 
perfectly legitimate for that person to receive a six months 
severance package to enable him or her to find another job and to 
try to earn a living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe that the House should be regarded and should 
function in such a way as to attract people from all walks of 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the risk of boring members with details that I have shared 
with the House before, I obviously did not come here from a 
family that was very wealthy.  As a matter of fact, I came from 
the bottom rungs of the ladders of parliament.  I started here as 
a busboy.  I was the child of a sole support parent.  I had not 
even completed my high school education, as members of the House 
now know from subsequent educational training that I have 
received and which did get considerable attention in this place, 
for which I am grateful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one thing that remains true is that I do not object to the 
fact that very wealthy people have rights if they are elected to 
serve in this parliament.  What I am saying is that serving in 
the House should not be contingent upon being wealthy.  People 
who have families and who earn regular salaries, people who come 
from all walks of life, should have the right to participate in 
the process and to seek to hold this high office in a way where 
they know that the day they leave here, they can go home and at 
least provide for their families and provide for a transition to 
either going back to what they were doing or to finding something 
else to do for a living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was only a few weeks ago that a report was published and got 
considerable media attention.  The report said that it was 
getting to be more and more difficult to attract candidates for 
public office and particularly to sit in the House of Commons. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1815"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that has always been true.  There are vast distances 
for many people to travel.  There is, of course, the sacrifice of 
office with which we are all familiar.  We do not complain about 
it generally.  It is there and it is part of the job, but just 
the same I believe the climate should be conducive to attracting 
people to become members of parliament and to want to sit in this 
place to represent their fellow citizens in the highest court of 
the land, the Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 Blais commission report on MP compensation stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Departing members are entitled to a relatively financially secure 
transition from parliament to the work force or to retirement as 
the case may be. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the Blais commission reminding us that someday we all 
will leave here and that it should not be a sinecure nor an 
experience to make one rich, but it should not be the way to the 
poor house either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This transition is provided to MPs under the age of 55, and not 
only to MPs elected after 1995, which was the case until this 
bill came along.  Now it will be available to everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second provision of the bill is that it provides that all 
members of parliament will become members of the MP pension plan 
as of the date the bill comes into force.  This is consistent 
with the view that the MP pension plan is a reasonable plan for 
members of parliament.  The Blais commission said that the MP 
pension plan “while appearing generous, is not necessarily out 
of line with public and private sector plans that recognize the 
impact of the mid-career hire aspect of the career path of their 
senior executives”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also gives MPs who have opted out of the pension plan 
the choice to opt into the plan retroactive to the date of their 
election.  In other words, now that we have the bill it will be 
possible for someone who was not in the plan to buy back their 
years of service.  Again, this is very logical and I commend it 
to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same for an MP who served in a previous parliament, 
left this place and then came back some seven, eight, ten years 
later.  That MP would have the right to buy back previous 
service.  Why should we give that right to someone who sat here 
10 or 15 years ago and deny it to MPs sitting in the House today? 
MPs sitting in the House today should be given the same 
opportunity to buy back that service.  I believe that to be 
totally logical and I believe the opposite would be illogical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>MPs do not have to buy back previous service, but then again 
neither do members who served in a previous parliament who have 
returned and who must contribute to the pension plan.  They are 
not forced to buy back previous service either.  Again, it is 
consistent with what we are doing for others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This also provides, in a way, a transition to participation in 
the pension plan.  If an MP—and of course we all will, effective 
immediately—contributes to the pension plan, that does not make 
an MP who was elected in 1993 eligible for a partial pension now 
unless the member buys back his or her previous service.  The 
member who does not do so would only be partially pensionable in 
2006, two terms from now.  Furthermore, those who do not buy back 
previous service would only have a full pension in 2019.  That is 
19 years from now.  In fact, it is a form of phase-in back into 
the pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who do not opt back in retroactive to the date of their 
election would continue to receive the supplementary severance 
allowance which we passed in 1998.  That is only fair.  Of 
course, MPs who decide to opt back into the plan to the date of 
their election will have to reimburse their contributions 
retroactively to the date of their election. 
Again this is consistent with the case of an MP who previously 
served in parliament some years ago and is returning to the House 
of Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to cite a passage from an article by Claude Picher, 
which appeared in <I>La Presse</I> two weeks ago: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, generally speaking, it is clear that the salaries of 
Canadian politicians are in no way commensurate with their 
responsibilities....In reality, given what we expect of our 
elected officials, there is no comparison between their salaries 
and what they would be paid for doing a comparable job in the 
private sector. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether or not we agree with Mr. Picher, I think we would all 
agree that our system of pay should put all members on an equal 
footing.  This is not presently the case.  It will be with this 
bill.  Right now, some members receive severance pay when they 
leave, and others do not. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, which is designed to correct an unfair situation in 
the current compensation package, responds to concerns expressed 
by many MPs in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This place is not supposed to be government of the rich, by the 
rich, for the rich; it is supposed to be government where all 
Canadians can expect to be represented by one of their own, if 
that is their wish.  That is the case as it applies to political 
orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people in the House, of course, disagree profoundly on 
political issues, and that is perfectly legitimate.  However, it 
should also apply to people of various socio-economic levels.  I 
believe that correcting these anomalies will make it such that it 
will make parliament work better because it will assist in 
attracting good candidates for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the motion to discuss this bill is structured makes it 
possible to have a recorded division at the end of the debate.  I 
am going to make a plea to colleagues.  I have nothing to gain in 
this personally, as everyone will know.  I have been a member for 
a long, long time.  None of these changes apply to me.  I would 
ask my colleagues to rise above the temptation that there would 
be to embarrass one another as we are passing a bill like this. 
It is easy to do.  It is very hard to undo afterward.  It is a 
temptation that some of us might have from time to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we think of who we want to sit in the House in the future, 
not just the next term of office but maybe two or three terms 
down the road when my children and grandchildren decide whether 
they want to seek office to see if they too could participate in 
directing this very fine country and democracy, I hope they will 
be able to do so whether they are well off, which I hope they 
will be, or whether they start off at the other end of the 
socio-economic ladder, as I did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our country will be better served if we rise above some 
temptations that we might have, particularly in these times that 
are no doubt challenging for some of us. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, the argument I wish to make to the House this 
evening is that we will all come out of this experience perhaps 
slightly better people, having ensured that the legislation will 
be better for Canadians, especially those who wish to represent 
their fellow citizens in the highest court in the land, the 
Parliament of Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to conclude by saying that the bill corrects initially 
that mistake which I have described, that glitch in the system 
whereby some MPs had a severance package and some did not.  It 
fixes that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing that it does is obviously to make everyone 
contribute and be part of the pension plan for members of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said consistently in the past that it was wrong to be out 
of the system.  It was wrong to be out of the pension plan.  It 
is just like getting the benefits of a collective agreement or 
anything else. 
It is a group plan.  If I said in the past that it was wrong to 
be out of the plan and I am consistent, I have to say that it is 
right to be back in the plan.  That is why there is criticism of 
people who not only will be back in the plan, because we all 
will, but criticism of people who will join again.  Even 
purchasing their retroactivity portion would be wrong, because 
joining the plan is the right thing to do.  That is what I think, 
and I have to be consistent with my thoughts, otherwise it would 
not be correct or appropriate.

me when they thought that my view of the pension plan was 
incorrect, I have to stand in solidarity with others who now 
think that the plan is correct.  Again, that is only logic and 
easy for all of us to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all this in mind, I commend the bill to the House.  I think 
it is good.  I think it is right.  I think it corrects historical 
wrongs.  I think it will contribute to making this parliament in 
a small way a better institution than it is already.  I hope that 
the bill will be even greater if it passes with the unanimous 
support of all colleagues in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, perhaps you will forgive me if I do not say it is a 
pleasure to address Bill C-37 because I think it is always 
difficult for members of parliament to talk about their own 
compensation packages.  It is a discomfort for all of us on all 
sides of the House to talk about what it is we think we are worth 
as parliamentarians, whether we think we are worth a pension or 
what the severance package should look like.  It is the 
discomfort that comes from talking about one's own salary and 
setting one's own wages.  It is a difficult thing to talk about 
publicly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the debate this evening I think we will hear a level of 
that discomfort in all of the discussions that come forward, 
because people realize that no matter how they slice this loaf of 
bread there will be others who will misinterpret it or have it 
deliberately misinterpreted for them.  I think we all understand 
that some of that is bound to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the House leader for the government for giving a very 
accurate description of what the bill is about technically, the 
reasons for it and the changes to the severance package that 
specifically address a wrong which was allowed to stand after the 
last changes were put through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes uphold what I think should be a principle of any 
pension plan, which is that we need to be equitable to all people 
in the House of Commons when it comes to what is a fair and 
sensible severance package for MPs.  I cannot think of any logic 
which would say that someone elected in 1993 should not get a 
severance plan, but someone elected in 1997 should.  It is 
illogical.  It is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A pension plan is practical because people will often campaign 
right up to the date of an election, anticipating that they will 
be back here, only to be surprised—and many of us will go 
through this over the years—to find that they do not have a job 
the next day.  Barring asking members of parliament to set up 
another business while they are serving as parliamentarians, it 
is only fair that a severance package be given.  Again, the 
principle is that if it is equitable for one group of MPs, it 
needs to be equitable and fair for others.  That to me seems 
fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the changes to the MP pension plan that are 
proposed in the legislation, unlike the last time we made changes 
to the plan in the House, one of the things I am grateful for is 
that there will be a significant amount time, as a matter of fact 
as much time as people want, to speak to the bill and to put 
their thoughts on the record.  I think it is wise for us in 
parliament and one of the ways that we will garner respect, even 
on difficult issues like salaries and benefits, to allow people 
to speak freely in the House, to give them as much time as they 
want and to allow a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader has asked in a certain spirit that 
we not actually have a standing vote. 
I eagerly await the debates to see where the House goes on this 
issue.  I think it is proper and much wiser the way we are 
handling this issue now as compared to the last time.  We are 
having an open debate not just on one but on two evenings. This 
should do away with the criticism that this was a Friday night 
special or the quick passage of a bill that we were somehow 
ashamed of.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to vote on this issue and we will have to move on and 
defend it and explain it.  All of the speeches and all the debate 
will give people confidence that members of parliament have 
applied themselves to this thoughtfully and have come to a 
conclusion collectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Normally legislation comes down from the executive and 
backbenchers and opposition parties basically have to play 
whatever hand is dealt to them.  It is true the government has 
drafted this bill.  The rumour mill has been working overtime for 
the last month.  People have talked about it in caucuses.  The 
media has been abuzz.  The self-appointed watchdogs of parliament 
were sure they knew what was going to happen.  There has been 
lots of speculation about changes that might come down regarding 
the pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although this is a government bill there is no pretending that 
this issue just dropped out of on nigh this evening. There has 
been lots of talk around Parliament Hill and in different circles 
about this.  We knew something was coming.  The big question was 
how we would deal with it as individuals and as parties once the 
legislation was introduced.  That needs to be acknowledged and 
put on the record as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For most political parties the MP pension plan is a no brainer 
and is just accepted.  But there were MPs in all parties who 
opted out of the plan in 1995 and I think they have gone through 
a self-inflicted torture test each and every time this issue 
comes up.  There is no one to blame for this but ourselves.  It 
is a case of reaping what we sow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I take the government House leader at his word and if he 
argues the plan today is a good plan, then I believe passionately 
and wholeheartedly that when we opposed the plan which was in 
place in 1993 we did the right thing.  Changes had to be made to 
the original plan.  It allowed for a pension to be paid to 
someone 30 years old and even younger, an MP could double dip, 
and there were other parts that were unpalatable to Canadians and 
to many of us in the modern reality we face in parliament. 
Changes had to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those who say we should not have grandstanded so much 
to make the changes. I think the changes would not have been made 
unless we were willing to push the issue to the max and no doubt 
we did that. Some of the quotes that will be drummed up for media 
reports tomorrow will refer to a plan we felt had to be changed 
and we initiated some change.  That was a good thing.  Canadians 
had the feeling that they had been locked out of the decision 
making in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the plan was amended to exclude double dipping and benefits 
were only payable after age 55, many of us were still convinced 
that it was still a more generous plan than what was seen in the 
private sector.  The debate about whether it is too generous or 
not will go on here this evening.  In a genuine effort, as it was 
in 1993, to put pressure on all sides to offer something more 
modest, we created two classes of MPs.  There were those who 
would get the newly revised plan, the 1995 plan, and those who 
would get nothing.  A significant number of people from all 
political parties chose the nothing option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that had been the end of the options available to MPs, 
perhaps this whole issue would have slowly gone away. 
Unfortunately after every parliament the salary and benefits 
package for elected officials goes through a mandatory statutory 
review.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ended up with another plan that created yet another level of 
pension benefits.  Currently we have the absurd situation that 
MPs could be entitled to a pre-1995 plan, a post-1995 plan, a 
1997 plan with a different severance package than the 1993 plan, 
a hybrid of any of those mentioned above, or no pension at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though it was recommended by the Blais commission to offer 
a revised and more modest pension plan, that was not offered. 
Because it was not in the offing, a handful of MPs continued to 
opt out of the pension plan and have remained so. It is true also 
at that time some members from most of the parties in the House 
chose to opt back into the plan, arguing, I think absolutely 
honestly again, that they had not campaigned on no pension plan; 
they had campaigned on a fair pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Zero pension was never a campaign promise.  Certainly it never 
was in this party and it never was something that we had promised 
either to prospective candidates or others.  We have always said 
that we wanted a fair pension for all MPs and not just for some. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course any talk of pensions results in people being pilloried 
in the press, by some but not all in the public, by some of their 
own colleagues, and so on.  That is usually part and parcel of 
what the government House leader already described as a very 
unfortunate development.  No matter what members do it seems like 
it is always the wrong thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Virtually all MPs, those who opted in, those who stayed out, 
those who get some hybrid of the plan, all MPs experience some 
public flogging over the MP pension plan.  It does not matter 
whether or not one is in it.  I have been out of the plan and I 
continue to get criticized.  Even though I have not been in the 
pension plan since 1995, I still get flogged for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very unfortunate that those of us who have remained out of 
the pension plan have run that gauntlet and, as I said earlier, 
have reaped what we have sown.  We had hoped that by staying out 
of the plan we could press for a more modest and acceptable plan 
but alas, it was not to be.  Even though it was recommended by 
the Blais commission, it was unfortunate that option was not put 
forward and it has ended up that now there are four different 
classes of pensionable members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are faced once again with another revision to the plan. 
It is argued by groups such as the National Citizens' Coalition 
and actually it is Canadian Alliance policy that the proper way 
to change the remuneration package of MPs is after one campaigns 
on it in an election.  The alliance policy is that there should 
be an independent commission, just like the statutory review 
demands, to take it out of the hands of the members of 
parliament.  No matter how we slice it we end up with accusations 
of being self-interested in this.  It should be taken out of our 
hands and given to an independent commission which makes binding 
recommendations to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had followed through on those recommendations in the Blais 
commission report, we would not be revising the plan again today. 
The commission recommended that we be transparent with our 
salaries, that we do away with the tax free allowance and call it 
all one type of salary.  We could be up front about it and say to 
people, “This is what we are getting paid.  We get taxed the 
same as other people”.  We could have had a pension plan that 
was recommended in the Blais commission report.  It would have 
been wise.  It would have defused this issue.  We would have been 
able to move on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we can campaign on that, it is not going to happen 
unless everyone in this place agrees that is a better way to 
handle it.  No matter how we vote on it or do not vote on it 
later, people will point a finger at us and say, “You have some 
self-interest in it. What are you doing voting on your own 
salary?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still absolutely believe that if we gave it to an independent 
commission, the salary and benefits would not change a whole lot. 
I agree with the Blais commission.  It is not that far out of 
line.  It is just that people want the appearance of 
transparency; not just the appearance of it, they want it 
transparent.  They want to know that their MPs are treated the 
same way as everyone else under the tax system and they want 
their MPs to have a pension plan. 
I absolutely believe they do.  They say to give us the plan, make 
it fair, that MPs as much as any superannuate should get a 
pension for having served the country in this place.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that under the current plan many MPs, 
including those with 10 or 12 years of service to the country, or 
those who are over 65 years of age, will still receive no 
retirement benefits at all, without even the medical benefits 
that would be available to any superannuate, any public servant. 
If one is not in the pension plan the medical coverage is not 
available in retirement.  It cannot even be bought because one 
has to be a member of the plan.  In that sense, I believe that 
the second principle, that all MPs should be treated equitably 
and equally as far as a pension plan goes, is also fulfilled in 
this proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All MPs in my opinion should be in a pension plan.  They should 
be eligible for insurance and medical coverage in old age.  It 
should be available to all members of parliament.  This bill will 
accomplish that.  It puts us all in the pension plan whether we 
like it or not. It allows MPs to say to their loved ones, and I 
am thinking especially of those who are at retirement age, who 
have served the country outside parliament and have spent 10, 11 
or 12 years in this place, that they will not be denied the right 
to buy medical coverage.  To me, it was just not right to ask MPs 
to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, I think we would have seen a different result had we 
even known that back when some of us opted out.  The fact that we 
had no medical coverage and could not even buy medical coverage 
when we left here was not known.  Nobody picked up on that.  It 
was like the severance package.  It was something we did not see 
when we went through the process the last time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that some of the MPs who are currently not in 
the pension plan will still not get any pension or benefits 
because public pressure or personal financial straits will not 
permit them to spend the $50,000 or $60,000 required to vest them 
in the plan.  The unfortunate part of this is that some people 
very much need access to things like medical coverage and a 
pension plan of some sort.  If they cannot scrape up the $50,000 
or $60,000, and this is not crocodile tears and I do not expect 
any sympathy, it points to an unfortunate development that has 
happened for a variety of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The failure to offer that more modest plan recommended by the 
Blais commission and the steadfastness of some people to stay out 
of the plan means that even with the changes in this bill some 
people will leave this place and will receive no pension.  That 
is the personal financial story they will find themselves in. 
They opted for that.  They will not go home crying for sympathy 
but it is unfortunate that an important principle has been 
violated and some people will get no pension. That has never been 
the policy of either the Reform Party or the Canadian Alliance. 
All MPs should get a pension.  It should be a fair pension and it 
should be decided by an independent committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As opposition House leader, I realize the conundrum MPs find 
themselves in tonight and over the next couple of days as we talk 
about this and vote on it.  It will evoke little public sympathy. 
On both sides of the House, whether it is about a severance 
package, potential for a pension plan, will there be a pension 
plan, would an MP ever take the pension, all those discussions 
will evoke no sympathy, even if I were to ask for it, and I am 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public is very cynical about some of the things that go on 
in parliament.  Some of that we brought to this place by trying 
to bring in changes especially initially to the 1993 plan.  I 
reiterate one last time that the proper way to handle the 
remuneration package for members of parliament is to take it out 
of the hands of members of parliament and give it to an 
independent committee.  It is proper only because we cannot win 
this debate.  No one can win this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I have learned anything over the last seven years, no matter 
how we try to spin this story, people will say that we are voting 
on our own pension and we are voting on our own salary. 
No matter how we try to spin that differently, that is what it 
boils down to.  It is one of those things that is an unsolvable 
issue unless it is given to someone who takes it out of the hands 
of MPs who will struggle tonight to find the right balance of 
what an MP is really worth and so on.  In the end result, whether 
they vote yea or nay, they will be passing judgment on someone 
else's personal financial situation when that is better left to 
an independent body that can look at the big picture and take 
some of the political considerations out of it.

that I personally and heartily endorse.  When we come to our next 
statutory review of what is a proper package for all members of 
parliament I hope that is how we handle it in this place.  I hope 
we will say, not just in the spirit the House leader mentioned 
tonight, that we will take the partisan sniping out of it, 
realize we are all in this boat together, and give this issue to 
an outside body to decide it for us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the easiest 
thing to do at this point in the debate on Bill C-37 would be to 
start making a political issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The matter of the benefits, salary, pension and everything that 
concerns members of parliament has become such a sensitive 
matter, that every time the matter is raised, it distresses and 
discomfits parliamentarians to do so.  They are embarrassed, 
intimidated and never know how it is going to be received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say right off, before anyone gets in a state because of 
this bill, that over 50% of the members of this House do not 
benefit from the bill before us.  Over 50% of the members of this 
House have nothing to gain from this bill.  Some 30% of members 
will an injustice affecting them corrected.  For 20% of the 
members remaining, the bill forces parliament to apply the same 
plan and conditions for all those who already enjoy them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill therefore corrects an injustice, requires parity for 
all and offers no additional advantage to most of the members of 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among those members who are required to join in the famous MP 
pension plan like everyone else, let us not forget that, while 
some of them may benefit, namely those who are close to 
retirement age, a number of others will be penalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the case for my colleague, the hon. member for 
Témiscamingue, a young member of parliament who has been here for 
a number of years and who, based on elementary financial 
calculations, would be better off if he did not have to join in 
that pension plan. Over the years, so much was made of this 
extraordinary pension plan that, when it was reduced, they forgot 
to explain to all that it now allows members of parliament to 
retire at age 55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But are there not thousands of public servants in Quebec, 
thousands of nurses, federal public servants and people across 
Canada who can retire at 55? It is the same for parliamentarians 
in this House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some make a big fuss because it is now automatic, because a 
member of parliament is automatically entitled to a pension after 
six years. But is it not 10 years for public servants? I have 
never heard anyone in Quebec—I am well aware of the situation in 
Quebec, because I myself was a member of the public service—for 
example a journalist say “Today, public servants who joined 10 
years ago are entitled to their pension”. Yet, in the case of 
members of parliament, after six years—and when we look at the 
average career of the members of both groups we can understand 
the difference—people say that they are entitled to their 
pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, as public servants are entitled to their pension after ten 
years, along with thousands of workers who have contributed ten 
years to a private pension fund, they are eligible but cannot 
draw it until age 55.  It is the same thing for MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MPs pension fund is not what it used to be.  It is very 
close to the public service pension, but slightly more 
advantageous for one very simple reason: the average career of an 
elected member—a matter I have already looked into—whether an 
MLA in Quebec or an MP in Ottawa, is around seven years, or one 
and one-half mandates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know very many, of course, who last for just one mandate, and 
others for two or a bit more, but the average time for an MP is 
seven years.  Nevertheless, the retirement pension applicable to 
them must not be accessible to only about 30% of the total. We 
must not get carried away here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conditions are particular.  Who else in society sees his job 
open to question every three or four years, who else has to go 
before his bosses or his customers to find out whether he can 
keep his job for another four years?  There will always be 
differences for MPs.  What seems to be just a slight positive 
difference as far as the number of years is concerned is a major 
inconvenience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we asked any public servant—and there are some here—if they 
would be interested in running for election every four years, 
provided their pension plan were altered slightly, we know very 
well that not a single one would say yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, this bill before us makes no change for most MPs, 
remedies an injustice for a certain number of them, and requires 
the rest to accept the same plan as everybody else.  This is no 
big deal.  This is not a coup that has been organized to take 
advantage of the end of a session in order to do something to 
benefit MPs, far from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a matter of justice, and this is my second point.  In our 
society, everyone has protection at work, even those who work and 
are protected under minimum labour standards.  I will speak of 
the case of Quebec, because I know it best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, those who are subject to the minimum labour standards 
are entitled to vacations when they lose their job.  They are 
entitled to paid vacations.  They are entitled to compensation 
when they have been in their job a period of time.  It is 
understandable, no one can reasonably lose their job overnight 
and end up without a cent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have access to employment insurance, are protected under 
minimum labour standards and everyone has a transition allowance. 
Except in extremely difficult cases, and perhaps our society 
should correct them, the vast majority of people who lose their 
job are entitled to certain benefits: vacations, a separation 
allowance, certain severance pay and employment insurance for a 
year or nearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about parliamentarians?  Some, because of a discrepancy in 
the law, do not have this transition.  Let us consider our 
colleagues, professionals, lawyers, doctors, engineers, people 
who left their office work and who tomorrow morning, because of 
elections, lose their job and do not have even a month's 
transition.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among my colleagues on both sides of the House, there are 
45-year-old fathers who have interrupted their career to serve one 
or two terms here in parliament.  Because of a loophole, they 
could find themselves home tomorrow without employment 
insurance, severance pay, or anything, after two terms.  These 
members would go back to their families with nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it so scandalous to ensure that every member of the House 
gets six months of severance pay, i.e. $34,000 gross, or 
approximately $17,000 to $20,000 net, depending on individual 
situations?  Is it a tragedy to give members somewhere between 
$17,000 and $20,000 to support their family for a few months 
while they find a new job?  Of course not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that those listening understand this.  They know that, 
if they lose their job, they can collect EI benefits for 40, 45 
weeks—perhaps a bit longer, I am not sure, depending on the 
region—but nobody wants anyone to lose everything overnight and 
have to rely on public charity to survive and support their 
family.  It is therefore a matter of fairness and equity for 
parliamentarians in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by saying that the cost to society is ridiculous. 
We do not build the finances and the economic future of a 
country like Canada on the backs of 50 members of parliament who 
were penalized through a bill by mistake. No one would be proud 
if, following the next election, the Parliament of Canada had 20 
or 25 of its members with no money and no job, simply because 
one day, when the pension plan was reduced, there was something 
missing in the act and some people were not covered by the six 
month severance pay, the transitional allowance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that the taxes of the Canadians listening to us 
will go down by one quarter of one penny per year if we take 
action to avoid penalizing 50, 75 or 100 members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to engage in demagoguery. Tomorrow, many people will 
talk about this. I am curious to see how they will do so. 
I know that some morning men in radio stations will say that the 
members of parliament voted themselves a generous severance 
package. But the fact is that these people earn three, four or 
five times the salary of the parliamentarians in this House. 
Yet, not one of them will mention that fact. Not one of them 
will say “I earn $300,000 per year. I make five times as much 
money as a member of parliament, but I object to 
parliamentarians voting themselves a six month transitional 
allowance, in case they lose an election”. We have to realize 
that some people will say such things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are journalists who will write about this. Some will do so 
correctly, they will look at the facts, but others will say that 
members of parliament voted themselves a generous benefit. Most 
journalists who work on the Hill have a salary equal to or 
higher than that of MPs. This has to be said. 
Society has the right to know how things are made difficult for 
certain individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about salary increases.  We are not talking 
about giving rash benefits.  We are talking about correcting 
something that needs correcting.  While political rhetoric is 
easy, justice requires we proceed this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, as of tomorrow or whenever the bill is passed, all 
parliamentarians in this House will have the same working 
conditions regardless of their political party and this is only 
right.  When this bill is passed, all parliamentarians in this 
House will know that at least they will have a transition period 
of six months' salary to enable them to take a new direction and 
feed their family should they lose in an election.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is no irresponsible benefit.  Once we pass this bill, 
everyone in Canada, as well as in Quebec, all those watching us 
will know that parliamentarians did not give themselves more 
benefits.  They simply corrected a terrible error that risked 
putting a few of our colleagues in a very difficult situation, 
were it not corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that a good MP—for those watching us—closes his 
eyes to the need to respect others here. A good MP respects his 
colleagues, respects the duties of an MP and respects his fellow 
citizens for having risen and said “I think this makes good 
sense, I think this is just and fair”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I very definitely support this bill, because it corrects a 
flagrant injustice.  It does not cost a lot and it will save 
social costs, perhaps major ones for some of us, that would have 
benefited no one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I support the government on this.  My party should support 
the government on this matter.  It seems to me a simple matter of 
fairness, justice, honesty, candour and courage.  I thank the 
government leader for introducing the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I echo the sentiments of others, but perhaps for different 
reasons, when I say I take no pleasure in speaking to this bill 
because I for one associate the debate about the pensions of MPs 
with a great deal of unpleasantness, both personal and political. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the third such debate I have been in.  I was here in 
1981 when the pension plan that became so controversial in the 
early nineties was designed out of amendments that were made to 
the pension plan that existed before 1981.  At that time in 1981 
I voted against the amendments to the pension plan which involved 
not just changes to the pension plan but also a very significant 
raise in pay for members of parliament.  However I have to say, 
even though I voted against that measure in 1981 and had my own 
criticisms and reservations on the plan, that I came to despise 
the way the plan was misrepresented for political purposes over 
forthcoming years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came to despise the way in which I constantly read in the 
newspaper and other places analyses of the pension plan which 
either implied or stated in bald faced misrepresentation that 
members of parliament qualified for lucrative pensions after only 
six years of service, when in fact what was true was that members 
of parliament who served for six years qualified, because it was 
a 15 year qualifying period, for six-fifteenths of a pension. 
Six-fifteenths times 75% times the average of the five best years 
service in the House is a long way from making the claim that 
members of parliament only have to serve six years and they can 
collect wonderful pensions.  Yet I read this time and time and 
time again.  I came to read it more often in the late eighties 
and early nineties as it became part of a political strategy on 
the part of a particular party.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House leader of the official opposition said that he and his 
party favoured an independent commission to arrive at 
recommendations on how members of parliament should be 
remunerated.  This has been the policy of the New Democratic 
Party since the beginning of time, to exaggerate the metaphor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that because having that policy did not save us from the 
kind of criticism that came out of certain quarters.  Having 
exactly the same policy as the House leader for the official 
opposition just advocated did not save us from the kind of 
criticism, both legitimate and illegitimate, both modest and 
extreme, that emanated from certain quarters in the late eighties 
and early nineties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My leader at that time, Audrey McLaughlin, the former member for 
Yukon, was the first leader in the House of Commons to suggest 
that the pension plan ought to be reviewed with a view to 
addressing some of the things being said about it, but that did 
not save us from the kinds of criticisms being offered at that 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I will do my best to hold to the non-partisan tone that 
has been set or that some have tried to set, it is very hard to 
do because this pension issue has been a partisan issue.  It has 
been employed for partisan purposes— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  People lost elections on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  I do not need the help of the hon. 
member.  He should just let me talk.  It was employed for 
partisan purposes and often in ways that I found quite 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was one of the people who was targeted in the literature of 
the Reform Party.  I remember seeing my name in pamphlets as 
someone who was receiving a $1 million pension because I had the 
good fortune, or misfortune some might say, to be elected when I 
was 27 years old.  They calculated everything I would receive 
from that year on and, because I was so much younger, there would 
be that much more distance between my age and when I was 75.  It 
would all be added together, figured out through some kind of 
formula about indexing that would kick in when I was 60 and 
amount to this enormous sum.  That was the sum put beside my 
name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My children would come home from school and ask “Daddy, are we 
millionaires?”  I asked them what they were talking about and 
they said “The kids at school are saying that you are a 
millionaire.  They are saying that you get a million dollars. How 
come we don't see any signs of it?”  It is hurtful to have those 
kinds of impressions left and to have those kinds of questions 
asked, yet that is the kind of thing that not just myself but 
others had to put up with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would certainly beg the indulgence of the House if hon. 
members can detect the difficulty I have in speaking to this 
issue.  I do not mean this in an entirely partisan way, but I 
also have some satisfaction in speaking to this issue because I 
hope this legislation could bring to an end what I regard to be a 
very ugly chapter in Canadian politics. 
Members of parliament were played off against each other and this 
began to happen even within the parties that started it.  I think 
this was the beginning of wisdom which led to this day and the 
legislation we now have before us.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would echo the sentiments of the government House leader in 
hoping that it will not become the object of that sort of thing 
but that this will be something people will be left to decide 
individually, that their decisions will be respected but not 
regarded as cannon fodder for political rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition House leader verged on this.  Perhaps this is 
what he meant to say when he said that this is no secret and 
there has been talk around the Hill.  There has not just been 
talk around the Hill.  There has been talk between the House 
leaders.  What we have before us tonight is something that was 
negotiated.  It is a product of cross-party or inter-party 
negotiation, whatever is the appropriate word.  I have heard it 
said and some reporters even asked me today “Don't you think the 
government House leader has tried to outmanoeuvre Canadian 
Alliance members, former Reform Party members or what have you?” 
I said “No, that is not what is going on here”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing that had to be done out of fairness to all 
members who found themselves in the anomalous position that was 
created by the Reform of 1995 was to address the particular 
anomaly, something that was not noticed at the time.  That had to 
be done anyway, but there was the second dimension of whether or 
not one more opportunity would be provided for members who had 
opted out of the plan in response to what I consider as the Prime 
Minister's bluff in 1995, but in some respects a bluff that was 
called by those members who opted out.  Perhaps they were not 
sure who bluffed whom after it was over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a need to give those members, a felt need, not on the 
part of other members but a debate in the minds of those of us 
who had been the object of this political strategy to ask why 
should we.  Why should we allow them back in after all they said 
about the plan even after it was amended?  There was a felt need 
to do that, particularly on the part of many members who had 
opted out, and that was made clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The end result was that the legislation reflects the fact that 
it is better for everyone, and particularly for those parties who 
have opted out members because we do not have any, if everyone 
went back in together rather than being vulnerable to the kind of 
not necessarily public political sniping that might go on but 
even the internal political sniping that might go on.  What we 
have before us is an amendment that puts everybody into the plan 
and gives those who are able and willing an opportunity to buy 
back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One could be tempted to say many other things. 
It is part of a process that we have seen on the part of my 
colleagues to the left, who came to this House without any 
institutional memory by definition.  It was not their fault. 
They just did not have one.  Therefore, they did not always 
understand the reason why certain things are the way they are.

got here.

that they called pods or envelopes or something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They did not want to go on parliamentary trips.  That was a bad 
thing too.  Parliamentary trips are not a bad thing.  They are 
part of our job here, trying to get to know people in other 
countries, in other parliaments and to be citizens of the world. 
I think they have come to appreciate that, which is a good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other more political things that have happened, which 
I will not go into for fear of entering into a form of 
partisanship at a lesser level, like Stornoway and Ontario and 
what is happening with the new party and that sort of thing.  Let 
us save that for a town hall meeting some night.  Let us save 
that for the election.  Let us save that for moments when we are 
not trying to do something that has to be done and do it in the 
most dignified way that we possibly can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said all of that, I express the support of the New 
Democratic Party for this particular amendment to the Parliament 
of Canada Act and to the legislation having to do with pensions. 
We hope that we might be able to deal with this expeditiously, 
not because we have anything to fear and not because we have 
anything to hide, but because I am sure the Canadian public do 
not want us wasting any more time on this than is absolutely 
necessary.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I always am fascinated when listening to the NDP member 
for Winnipeg—Transcona.  He has been around this place a long 
time, having been elected at a very young age.  This is an issue 
about which we have spoken to each other in private as well, that 
is, the unfairness in terms of the public perception of the 
pension plan which the member mentioned in his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lady sitting next to me is probably one of the most famous 
politicians in the country.  As an example of this so-called gold 
plated pension plan, this woman would have to live to be 117 
years old, if in fact she were to reach that number.  She is a 
woman who has spent most of her adult life serving the public and 
she would have a pension of about $20,000 a year.  I have 
actually had people on the street talk to me about the member for 
Saint John and the pension she will get.  The reality is that she 
will be looking at a pension of about $20,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the member is, how did this story spin totally 
out of control?  How did we get to the point where now, on second 
sober thought and reflection, some members have to re-think their 
position? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not mean this member personally.  I know that he is one who 
firmly believes that public servants, politicians and others 
working in the workplace should be rewarded for their service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did we reach the point that we brought public perception 
down to that level when it comes to talking about pensions for 
politicians?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first I want to say how 
much all of us share the view that the hon. member for Saint John 
should live to be 117.  However, we do not know if we want her to 
hold her seat that long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member makes a good point.  He was asking me what went on in 
that time, which is not completely over, of misrepresenting 
political life and the perks that go with it.  I was very hard on 
members of the Reform and Alliance earlier.  It was not only 
them, it was also a general sense which they both contributed to 
and also played off of and exploited.  The tragedy of it is, as 
politicians we do not want to be a closed club in which we defend 
our collective habits, come what may, no matter what.  On the 
other hand, we all need to defend politics collectively because 
politics is the art of democracy.  If we do not defend the 
democratic enterprise, if we do not defend the democratic task, 
if we engage either collectively or individually in calling that 
down and feeding public cynicism about it, then who will? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member may not like this answer, but I personally feel that 
the extent to which the Conservative government created a lot of 
cynicism about politicians and politics, which was sometimes 
centred on the prime minister, was that this was part of the 
problem.  From my point of view, I would like to see more 
decisions made here about Canada's public life rather than 
elsewhere, rather than in the corporate boardrooms or by trade 
bureaucrats or in the courts or by the first ministers or in all 
of the other places where decisions are now made that at one time 
would have been made here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything we do collectively or individually to disparage this 
place for short term political gain is, in a way, an unprincipled 
attack on democracy.  That is not say that we should not be 
critical or that we should not encourage public skepticism. 
Skepticism yes, but cynicism no; criticism yes, but exaggerated 
attack no.  We have seen too much of the negative and not enough 
real reflection on how important it is to hold this place up, and 
not for our own sake.  If we do it only for our own sake, then we 
do nothing.  We hold it up because in so many ways this place is 
under attack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many quarters in this country, both politically and 
non-politically, which take joy, which celebrate, which rejoice 
in the erosion of the power and the prestige of parliament.  They 
would like decisions to be made somewhere else.  We should all 
keep that in mind every time somebody sticks a microphone in our 
face and we are tempted to say things that perhaps we should not 
just to get on the news.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, one thing I always had a problem with, long before I 
ever became a politician, was the fact that a group of people 
might get together and accomplish a mission that sits before them 
and then draw their own package as to what they should earn, how 
they should be paid, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have believed for a long time that a totally independent body 
of people, made up of citizens of the country who are not 
affiliated with politics, who have never been members, who are 
genuine, hard-working taxpayers who expect a service from each of 
us, should be put together to settle this thing once and for all 
on behalf of all Canadian people, rather than us, through debate, 
determining our own fate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that with all my heart.  I wish that would happen 
rather than any kind of debate or discussion or bills being 
presented in the House.  I wonder how the member feels about 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with the hon. 
member.  In fact, I think I began my remarks by saying that NDP 
policy for many years had been to have an independent commission. 
We do have commissions after every parliament, but they have 
been subject to criticism because they are commissions made up of 
former members of parliament.  A cynical public will say “Yes, 
but they are guys from the club”.  That is a legitimate point of 
view, and it can be a legitimate point of view without reflecting 
on the integrity or the objectivity of the people who have made 
up those commissions.  It is just a fact that some, not all, but 
some members of the public will never trust the recommendations 
of former members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others have said that there should be a completely independent 
commission of people who do not come from parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting thing about that is—and I will say this by way 
of saying how complex this is—now that we have been members of 
parliament for a while, could we pull somebody in who has lived 
his or her entire life in the business world who could have an 
appreciation of what being a member of parliament is like, how 
different it is from so many other jobs?  I assume it is very 
different.  However, that is neither here nor there.  The fact 
is, if we brought people in from the corporate sector and if the 
recommendation was that we be paid $150,000 a year or $200,000, 
we would have to live with it.  It would have to be binding 
before they were given the mandate.  Otherwise we would end up 
voting on whether to accept the recommendation and we would be 
right back in the same box we were in to begin with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This box is not easy to get out of, unless we want to completely 
hand over judgment with respect to the remuneration of members of 
parliament to somebody, if we want to give up that responsibility. 
There may be members of the public who would say “Isn't that 
cute.  You guys want to wash your hands of it altogether”.  Then 
we would be criticized for who we appoint.  “They appointed a 
bunch of high rollers from the corporate sector to determine 
this.  Those people think that anything under $150,000 is 
peanuts.  No wonder they appointed those guys”.  If we appointed 
somebody else, they would have some other criticism to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can all say everything that we said here today, but we should 
not be under any illusions that we are not going to get out of 
the world, this side of the kingdom, without these kinds of 
criticisms which will prevail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember seeing in a bookstore a book of headlines from the 
last 100 years or so.  I just happened to turn to 1905, to a 
headline about MP salaries.  It comes with the territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to determine amongst ourselves what we think is fair 
either in terms of process or in terms of outcome and realize 
that no matter what we do there will always be a certain amount 
of public criticism. 
<P><A NAME="LINK265"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, a recurring theme around this place is that only in the 
dying days of a session would a debate like this take place. I 
guess what is worrisome to some members, and I could refer to the 
House leader of the NDP who just spoke, is that much of this 
debate takes place among House leaders but individual members of 
parliament are not involved.  In fact most of us in this place, 
with the exception of the House leaders and very few others, 
would have no idea of what is being debated today.  It is brought 
in a fashion to allow the expedient passage of the changes to the 
members' pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has to happen is that there has to be transparency, not 
only for the public but for members of parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member from Nova Scotia next to me and I found a glitch 
in some of the numbers that are being presented as part of the 
package.  There are some inequities that involve certain members 
of parliament, myself included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to talk seriously about this, we must have some 
notice of what is on the table, what is being discussed.  We are 
talking about individual members of parliament, their retirement 
packages and what their families or they themselves will be left 
with when they leave this House, provided they can leave this 
place alive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know we do not want to get into too much of the politics of 
this issue, but there is at least one party in the House that has 
swallowed itself whole on the pension issue.   I am speaking 
about the Canadian Alliance party, formerly known as the Reform 
Party.  Again, we are talking about goodwill and even personal 
goodwill from the reformers, if some of these inequities are 
going to be changed.  One might say I am going to be shooting 
myself in the foot, because they are not going to show much 
generosity to me as an individual member of parliament if I 
cannot show it to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put on the record how some of this stuff started and 
what their position was on the pension issue a few short years 
ago prior to the 1993 election.  In fairness, many people come to 
this place not really knowing what the job entails.  They come 
not knowing what sacrifices they make as individual members of 
parliament when they leave their jobs, their careers, their farms 
or their businesses behind.  Many members of parliament do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can argue that members of parliament are overpaid.  We can 
say that I am personally overpaid or that other members are 
overpaid, but there are members on both sides of the House who 
are certainly working below what they would get in the private 
sector. We all know that.  Many members made more in remuneration 
in their private lives than they are making as members of 
parliament.   Sometimes we have good fortune in the marketplace 
and sometimes not as good, but on a yearly basis in terms of 
compensation, many members can certainly exceed what they are 
paid as members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they came to the House, many members did not realize they 
would be taking a pay cut, because what a member of parliament 
gets paid and what the pension will be all looks pretty good from 
the outside.  That is the feeling of many members in what was 
then known as the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I do not see any quotes here that are attributed to 
you.  I think being a former businessman and understanding the 
pitfalls involved in the business of politics that you had pretty 
good idea of what you were getting into. Therefore, I do not 
think you were one of those who railed against the so-called 
pension scheme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote the former leader of the Reform Party, the man 
who is now seeking the leadership of the Canadian Alliance party. 
It is a quote from Preston Manning which I am reading from the 
Vancouver <I>Sun</I> of September 28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Order, please. The hon. 
member for New Brunswick Southwest is well aware of the fact that 
we do not refer to sitting members by name, only by their 
position or riding.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>   It is something like the pension 
plan.  You cannot bring it in the front door, so you bring it in 
the back door.   I think this is what the leader of the former 
Reform Party, the member for Calgary Southwest who is certainly 
seeking the leadership of the CA, was referring to and this is 
what he is quoted as saying in the September 28 edition of the

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the intention of Reform MPs to opt out of the MP pension 
plan.  We call upon every other member of the House to do 
likewise.  “Opt out or get out” will be the cry in the

and leadership by example and integrity are to be restored to 
Parliament and any budget it endorses. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is typical of what the former leader of the Reform Party 
had to say.  He basically said the same thing in terms of his 
limousine, “Here are the keys.  Take it.  I do not want it.” 
That was in 1993 when he first came to the House. He regretted 
making that decision because he eagerly took the keys to the 
limousine when he was re-elected in 1997 and he became Leader of 
the Official Opposition.  To my knowledge he still has the 
limousine, the driver and the keys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said the same thing of Stornoway.  Remember that one?  He 
said that Stornoway was nothing more than a bingo parlour and 
that he would never live there.  It would be obscene to think 
that the leader of the Reform Party would live at Stornoway at 
public expense.  “I simply will not do it,” said the leader of 
the Reform Party, the hon. member for Calgary Southwest who is 
now seeking the leadership of the CA.  However he is there and he 
is not holding any bingo games for charity.  He is living there 
at public expense, which is what we would expect every leader of 
the opposition party to do.  However, it was convenient at the 
time to rail about it.  “I will not do it,” he said.  Now he is 
doing it and he is entitled to do it but he railed against it 
until he got there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been mentioned that he started out sitting in this place 
in the second or third row because he did not want to be a 
favourite or a star.  He wanted to be a lonely MP and not lead 
the pack.  It did not take him long to realize that if one is 
going to be a leader of a party in the House, then one sits in 
the front row and leads the attack on the government.  It did not 
take him long to change his mind on that one.

including a facial and voice lessons to make his voice sound 
better in the House of Commons.  I would call those enormous 
flip-flops.

going to be watered down by this so-called broader base of 
support called the UA or the CA.  The cry that the west wants in 
is going to be diminished because Ontario is going to take over 
the party.  We will find out how lost or disoriented those 
members become once that happens, which will probably be on June 
24 if my calendar is right. Those are major flip-flops and are 
the types of things that have to be considered when we look at 
this issue.

defied pensions.  Those members said they would never take them, 
that they would never opt in.  Those members wanted out and in

done with politics.  Most of us are done with politics beyond 
middle age because most of us do not come into this place at the 
age of 20 or 30.  Some of us have had a career or two before we 
came here.  In most cases this is basically ending our working 
career. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those that leave businesses behind, there has to be a little 
bit of something there.  The argument is that they are going to 
retire on a gold plated pension plan.  As I mentioned in a 
previous intervention, under the existing plan, which will still 
exist after this debate and will not change but will allow the 
people who opted out to come back, the deputy leader of the 
Conservative Party and I would get all of $20,000 a year in a 
pension.  How many times have we read in the newspaper about a 
million dollar pension for this MP or that MP? 
What the press and some politicians were doing in a case like 
that, including some Reformers at that time, was taking the worst 
case scenario or the best case scenario.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, they might point to the present Prime Minister who 
has been here since 1962, having come to this place when he was 
younger than 30 years of age, or the Deputy Prime Minister who 
has been here just about as long having been elected at the early 
age of 30.  They extrapolate from that that he will live to age 
90 after having served here 30 years.  They use that as the 
example which fits all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that most members in this place do not qualify for 
a pension.  The life of a federal member of parliament, believe 
it or not, is equivalent to that of a pro football player.  How 
long does a pro football player play in the NFL or the CFL?  On 
average it is about four years.  The average life of a member of 
parliament is just slightly higher than that but it is certainly 
less than six years.  All the statistics will prove that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sad reality is that most members will leave this place 
without a pension, with nothing.  Most people that leave this 
place usually go out feet first politically because most of us 
are defeated.  There are a few of us that get defeated and have 
the opportunity or the privilege to come back into this place, 
but that is not the norm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about some fairness on the part of those that 
oppose pensions for MPs and the media.  Why do they not take as 
an example the member for Saint John, the deputy leader of our 
party, who has spent most of her adult life in public life?  The 
only pension that she will have at the end of this term would be 
a pension of about $20,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not fall into our seats in this place.  Most of us have 
worked in our communities and have worked in other levels of 
government or behind the scenes of government as volunteers.  We 
worked in our communities and left our homes and families behind 
to come to Ottawa.  None of us believe in a gold-plated pension 
plan, but the truth is the public wants good people representing 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If every safety net completely disappears in this place called 
Ottawa, good and worthy Canadians of standing in this place who 
represent their constituents will say they are not sure they want 
to drive or fly 3,000 miles a week to go to Ottawa, only to find 
out at the end of four years they are defeated and have nothing. 
At the end of six years they would have a measly $20,000 pension. 
The truth is in the private sector just about anyone in here 
could make more than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is politics, and this should not happen, diminishes 
people's attractiveness to the private sector once they have been 
here.  There are many exceptions to that rule and many people 
flourish after they leave politics.  Those people are exceptions 
to the rule.  At the end of an election when we are on the losing 
end we are not in high demand, believe me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been saying all along that there has to be fairness and 
equity in the pension plan.   If members want to opt in, my 
position is that they should be able to do so.  If they do have 
to swallow themselves whole on this issue as the Reformers will 
have to do, let them do so.  They have probably learned by their 
mistakes in terms of railing against it for so many years in this 
place.

evening, despite the somewhat late hour, to address some of my 
comments on Bill C-37.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise tonight to address an issue that strikes at the very 
heart of my political philosophy and personal credibility.  I 
joined the Reform Party of Canada in 1988.  The party at that 
time was less than a year old.  I made the decision to leave the 
family farm and run as a candidate later that summer in what 
became known as the free trade election.  I lost as did all 
Reformers.  However the party's platform of fiscal 
accountability, criminal justice reform and changing the very way 
in which government operates that first attracted me lived on. In 
fact it flourished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was subsequently elected along with 51 other Reformers in 
1993, partly because people believed the time had come to change 
the system.  Reformers believed we were undertaking a noble 
mission to come to Ottawa to push for fundamental changes, 
reforms, the very reason for our name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Constituents knew that because we were in opposition there were 
limits to what we could accomplish and how many changes we would 
be successful in convincing the Liberal government to adopt.  One 
of these was to strive to change the MP pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the third attempt at convincing the Liberals to fix the 
plan and to bring it into line with what is available to other 
Canadians.  I am afraid I must report that once again we have 
been unsuccessful, for this bill like its predecessors does not 
address the basic fact that the MP pension plan is still too 
rich.  It still needs reforming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not and I do not begrudge politicians a pension.  However 
I do begrudge that the pension is richer than anything other 
Canadians are able to access.  I also find it unpalatable that 
politicians are able to set their own level of remuneration.  We 
have heard a number of speakers from almost all the parties talk 
about this point tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was and still am offended by the lack of accountability and 
transparency under which the federal government operates.  I was 
first elected in 1993 and during that session of parliament I 
stood in the House and spoke out in adamant opposition to the 
self-serving generosity of the MP pension plan.  I am no better 
than any other Canadian and I am therefore undeserving of special 
treatment.  I am still opposed to the generosity of the present 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As chief opposition whip part of my duties include caucus 
morale.  It is hard to create harmony among a team that is 
treated differently.  Within the Canadian Alliance caucus there 
exists those MPs who opted out of the 1995 pension revision and 
an MP who opted into the 1995 revision.  There are those who were 
given no choice but to participate in the pension plan by being 
elected in 1997.  There are those who opted into the MP pension 
plan in 1998 and those who continue not to participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would think all MPs are treated the same.  After all, are we 
not all endeavouring to do the same job despite what party we 
might belong to?  This is a difficult situation to manage and one 
that I feel should never have occurred.  Rather than face another 
opt in clause with how divisive that is, I believe the clause 
forcing all MPs into the plan is a step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equality is the underlying principle of the Canadian Alliance 
and its predecessor, the Reform Party of Canada.  Anything less 
than equality of all MPs is unacceptable.  As a result of this 
legislative change MPs will no longer be allowed to opt out or 
remain out.  They will be legislated into the plan like those 
elected for the first time in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>MPs should not set their own level of remuneration.  One of the 
worst conflicts of interest a person can be placed in is to have 
the responsibility to decide upon one's own remuneration, that is 
paid pension and perks.  A CEO has a board of directors to do it 
for him or her. 
The CEOs are in turn responsible to the shareholders of company. 
The government shareholders are the taxpayers.  Yet who is 
responsible to them?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Ministers of the crown have to declare their assets and have 
their holdings administered by a blind trust.  This is necessary 
in order to ensure that cabinet removes even the appearance of a 
conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An act of parliament should not directly affect the net worth of 
a minister or a member.  Yet what are we doing here tonight?  We 
are amending legislation that substantially affects the net worth 
of members of parliament.  We have our hands in the till deciding 
how much we personally are worth.  It is a conflict of interest 
and I submit it is wrong.  It is extremely difficult and some 
would argue impossible to be completely objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MP pension plan is overly generous in that it provides 
pension benefits for MPs at a level that other Canadians cannot 
legally obtain.  Yet this same government restricts the RRSP 
choices of Canadians who are trying to provide for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we as parliamentarians make decisions that affect the 
lives of all Canadians if the laws do not apply to we who create 
the laws?  Canadian Alliance has a policy on this issue, debated 
and passed by grassroots Canadians.  It is one that I believe in 
wholeheartedly.  It is policy position No. 70 which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentary compensation will be recommended by an independent 
commission according to private sector standards. The decision of 
Parliament will be implemented after a subsequent election. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words it is our policy to amend the pension plan once 
elected to government and to make those amendments retroactive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the last general election the Blais commission, about 
which others preceding me in the debate tonight have talked, was 
charged with reviewing the allowances of members of parliament. 
One of the commission members was Mr. Ray Speaker who served as 
Reform House leader, had a long and distinguished career in the 
Alberta legislation, and served one term as a member of 
parliament in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Blais report was quite comprehensive and made numerous 
recommendations, made laudable by the fact that the commissioners 
did not have a direct stake in the outcome.  Yet the government 
has selectively chosen the recommendations it likes and has 
disregarded others such as doing away with tax free allowances 
for MPs to which Canadians in the real world have no access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been a loud opponent of this pension plan and here I 
stand today about to enter the plan.  I have said before that I 
believe that members of parliament are fully deserving of a 
pension, just not this one.  Therefore I stand here with three 
options tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I could support the bill, surrender my opposition to the 
inequality of the MP pension plan, go back on my stand to reform 
the MP pension plan and malign the fiscal sacrifices some of my 
colleagues and I have made in the past.  I believe that would be 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I could abstain from voting if this issue actually comes 
to a vote.  This would be difficult for someone who has stood in 
the House and referred to the plan as the piggy plan.  I would be 
as self-serving as Liberals opposite who begrudge the 
responsibility of administering taxpayer money wisely.  That too 
would be wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Or, I have a third option.  I could vote against the bill.  Some 
would say it is insincere to stand and vote against a bill that I 
will personally stand to profit from.  I am opposed to the level 
of pension remuneration that is included in the bill.  I am 
opposed to the fact that I as a parliamentarian am put in a 
precarious position of voting on my own pay and benefits.  I am 
opposed to the fact that the Liberal government has had three 
opportunities to rectify the inequality in the pension plan and 
has chosen to criticize those who have fought for change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately my colleagues and I who have fought for seven 
years to change the pension plan will be looked down upon for 
re-entering it, and those who have held no regard for the 
taxpayers will be without consequence.  I am sure that many of my 
constituents will provide me with their views on this issue over 
the summer,  and as always I look forward to their input.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This matter is not over.  It will be rectified after the next 
election when the Canadian Alliance takes over and refocuses the 
balances of power in the interests of Canadian taxpayers and 
takes the decision making on MPs' remuneration out of the hands 
of the MPs themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, let me reiterate my three main points.  First, I 
have never been opposed to a fair pension for all MPs, but fair 
must mean in line with plans accessible and legal for all 
Canadians to attain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, an independent commission must determine the level of 
remuneration for MPs, removing all potential conflicts of 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the Liberal government has had three opportunities:  two 
years ago, in 1995, with Bill C-85; about the same time in 1998 
and now today.  It has had three opportunities, including the 
bill before us, to rectify the flaws within the pension plan and 
yet has chosen not to do so.

<P><A NAME="LINK267"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this evening 
we are debating a bill in second reading which concerns MPs' 
pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing I would like to clarify right off the bat. 
It is very true that it is easy to get involved in demagoguery 
within such a debate, because the people debating it are the 
ones directly concerned.  It is easy to blame other people, or 
to make political judgements without stepping back from a 
subject such as this. I do, however, have reservations about the 
process and about the bill per se, but I shall come back to 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing I want to say right away: it is perfectly 
normal for MPs to have a pension plan like a good many other 
people do, whether in the public service or in the private 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also plans in place, such as the Quebec pension plan, 
to ensure that the greatest possible number of people have a 
retirement income.  Parliamentarians must not be left out, and 
it is normal that they would have a pension plan.  It is also 
totally normal in that—and it is important to point this out—the 
MPs who benefit from the plan also contribute to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, members who participate in the pension plan 
contribute 9% of their salary to it. In the months or years that 
followed the 1993 election, the government decided to change the 
pension plan so that MPs could no longer start collecting a 
pension immediately, but only at age 55. Such a change made 
perfect sense. Indeed, it was totally unacceptable that, for 
example, a 40 year old MP leaving after sitting six years in 
parliament would collect a pension until the age of 55, while 
getting a percentage of his salary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the pre-1995 plan, an MP would accumulate a pension at a 
rate of 5% per year in office. Therefore, a member with eight 
years in the House, or two mandates, would get 40% of his salary 
upon retiring, until his death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the change made, it was no longer possible to collect that 
pension before 55. 
So, a person leaving office at 40 cannot receive any pension 
until age 55. That pension is deferred and paid only at 
retirement age. That change made sense and it was welcomed by 
the public, because it made the plan more realistic, more in 
line with the reality elsewhere, both in the private and the 
public sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, MPs had the option of not participating in the 
plan. That was my case. I chose not to join in that plan. This 
means that I do not contribute to the plan, but will not benefit 
from it either. That was my choice and it still is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I do not like about this bill is that as soon as it is 
passed—and I am convinced it will be, because a majority of 
members here will support it—I will no longer have that option. 
I will automatically be covered by the plan, even though I do 
not wish to be covered, and I have a problem with that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was allowed to opt out and now I am being forced back in.  I 
would like members to continue to have the option or, if people 
are forced to contribute, see the government at least wait until 
election is a thing of the past and say “From now on, there is a 
universal system that applies to everyone.  It will apply to 
anyone who is a candidate and who wins the election”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I opted out.  I also told my constituents that I had done so. 
Now, I will have to tell them that the government has introduced 
a bill that forces me to opt back in, effective tomorrow morning. 
I have a lot of trouble with that and that is why I cannot vote 
in favour of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not everyone is familiar with the bill.  Why is it being 
introduced at this particular time?  In the amendments to the 
legislation in 1995, there was an oversight by the government. 
The result was that members under 55 years of age who had 
contributed to the pension plan and who ceased to be members, no 
longer received severance pay, while members who had opted out of 
the plan, as I had, were entitled to severance pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, this is not fair, because when members finished their 
term of office, or were defeated in an election, they did not 
have a few weeks or months of income to give them some breathing 
space financially speaking.  Nor were they covered by EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government therefore wished to correct this oversight. 
I have no problem with that part of the bill, which gives MPs an 
allowance for six months after the end of their mandate or after 
they lose their seat.  I do have a problem with the other part, 
which now requires everyone to belong to the pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know also that it is not necessarily the government MPs who 
are affected by this part. It is mainly a group of Canadian 
Alliance members.  I have trouble with members who get themselves 
elected by saying “I do not want to belong to the pension plan” 
and who now will conveniently be able to say “I was forced back 
into it”.  One could well think this provision was put there 
primarily for their benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not work.  I have trouble with people who made these 
noble speeches just to get elected. That was not the only thing 
they were running on, but it was part of their platform.  Now 
they are sneaking in the back way, claiming that the government 
forced them to join the pension plan and the government will play 
along by saying “Let's go ahead and rush this through at the end 
of a parliamentary session”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been better to have at least divided the two 
matters, the first one being to correct the fact that an MP who 
leaves at the end of a legislature, or after having been defeated 
in an election, can benefit from the allowance.  I believe there 
is a consensus, or there might be close to unanimity, on this.  I 
have no problem with that part, but I do have one with the second 
part, which states that, as soon as there has been royal assent, 
I am going to have to start contributing again to this plan to 
which I do not want to belong for a variety of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will also be able to buy back past years.  They have at 
least been given this option.  There is no requirement to buy 
them back.  Happily, the door has been opened, meaning that I am 
not forced to join retroactively.  But in the future, I will have 
no option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat that if it were at least done after an election, after 
an announcement was made to the effect that there will be a new 
plan and that members elected in the next Parliament will be 
subject to such and such conditions, people would be more aware, 
and the government party would have the leisure to leave things 
as they are.  That would have been clear, transparent and 
understood by all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to talk for hours on this.  I have made my point. 
I think it is too bad that things often happen in an improvised 
and hasty fashion.  Had it been otherwise, it would have meant no 
need to return a few years later to correct an error, because it 
was done in haste the previous time.  People quickly saw that 
something was left out in the case of severance pay, but no one 
wanted politically to take on the dirty job of bringing it all to 
the table.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It takes ability and courage to defend the things one believes 
in.  I have nothing against those who say “I do not believe in 
that.  I think the plan should be mandatory for everyone”.  Such 
arguments and such an opinion are defensible.  At least they 
should have the courage to do it a little more transparently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they had involved a few more people in the discussions at the 
time, had it not gone on at just one level, had people been more 
involved, at least forewarned, they would have avoided this sort 
of error. Except for a few people who were involved in the negotiations—and 
here again, I would say that that has been limited to people 
very close to the government House leader—we are hearing about 
this bill for the first time today, with technical amendments to 
the plan, with the result that questions are being raised by 
those who will join the plan retroactively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example that concerns me.  For the 2000 tax year, 
I contributed to my own RRSP.  I prefer to manage my own affairs 
and I therefore contribute to an RRSP.  With this bill, I am 
being forced to contribute to the government's pension plan.  I 
will therefore find myself in the situation of having 
over-contributed for this year.  I will have to withdraw 
contributions from my RRSP, be over-contributed, because I was 
not aware of this fact. I have a lot of trouble with a plan that 
operates this way and which, on top of that, forces on me a 
choice I did not make, when I had been allowed to opt out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This deserves some thought, and I would have liked members to 
have a bit more time to examine the bill, and go through first 
and second reading, committee of the whole, and third reading in 
48 or 72 hours.  I imagine that the government is worried that 
people will start being swayed by public opinion, but it should 
have the courage to say what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, the Bloc Quebecois House leader quite rightly said “I 
too can just imagine what some radio and television commentators 
will have to say tomorrow about those MPs who voted themselves 
severance pay”.  That may be, but we must also have the courage 
to say that these people are earning more than most of us here, 
and than all of us because, except for ministers, all members' 
salaries are the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sanctimonious elements in our society should take a look at 
themselves, because they enjoy much better conditions than we 
do. Meanwhile, we must have the courage to face criticism here 
and there and say “Listen, we will do this. We will take a 
little longer to do it properly”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a legitimate debate on this which is related to the 
whole issue of enhancing the role of members of parliament. I 
was going to conclude, but this brings another point to mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Salaries and pensions are two things that may attract people to 
political life, but they are not the only ones. If the 
government is serious when dealing with issues such as salaries 
and pension plans, if it really wants to enhance the role of 
members of parliament, it should also take a closer look at the 
concrete work and real powers given to MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that if it improved that role somewhat, if it 
gave more flexibility to both government members and other 
members, if the Prime Minister did not control everything from 
his office, the work of members would be enhanced in such a way 
that the issue of salaries would become less important. There 
are elements to consider, but these elements are part of a 
whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not true that people enter politics only because of the 
conditions that relate to their duties. They also do so because 
they want to change things, to have a say in the decisions made. 
There is a lot of work to be done in that respect and I am 
convinced that all members of this House, except for a few 
ministers and those who hope to become ministers, share my view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about this a lot among ourselves but, at some point, we 
will have to take action. 
Compensation is also an issue. We must have the courage to tell 
people that, if they want good MPs, they have to accept the fact 
that these MPs must have a good salary and a good pension plan. 
I have no problem saying that. Often, the type of people we get 
depends on what is expected of them. To attract quality people, 
the whole package must be interesting, including the 
compensation aspect, the influence aspect, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several factors which motivate someone to go into 
politics, including the desire to change things and to improve 
the lot of the people one represents, but also the capacity to 
do it under reasonable working conditions compared to what one 
would earn elsewhere in society. All that should be taken into 
account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not agree with the members of the Canadian Alliance who say 
that this issue should be left entirely to people from the 
outside because we must be able to make our own decision on this 
issue. I have no problem doing it and I would have great 
difficulty accepting that this decision be left to people who 
would not be accountable to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, I think we must be able to have that debate, even 
though it might open the door to a demagogic kind of rhetoric. 
Some may have already gone in that direction, and others will do 
so, I am sure.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the way it is being put through and because of its 
content, forcing us back in after we had been allowed to opt out, 
as I did, I cannot vote in favour of the bill, whether at second 
or at third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what I can understand of the motion, there is little 
possibility either of amendments at the report stage.  I would 
have liked to have seen that possibility provided, so that the 
possibility for people to opt out if they wish, which had been 
allowed, could be retained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In future, after another election, having it apply to new 
members is not a problem. Those who were allowed to opt out could 
at least be left with the choice they made in the past, a choice 
that should be respected.  Whether they are now telling us that 
it is better to belong to it, or not to belong to it, the 
decision is up to us. Those who made that choice made an informed 
decision, and I have no problem with that.  I can live very 
comfortably with what I decided.  Today, however, I must say that 
I am not all that thrilled with this bill and my being forced 
back in the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am therefore submitting these comments to the House.  I hope 
they will cast some light for certain members and that, between 
now and when it is passed at third reading, there will at least 
be a minimum of leeway for some arrangements to ensure that the 
choice made by individuals to opt out can be retained.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this is one of those debates that comes along from time 
to time about which one begins to wonder exactly why are we 
having it.  What will be the end result of this debate and what 
will be achieved by having a debate of this kind? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ask ourselves a whole lot of questions because it brings into 
question, at least for me, the whole question of what this place 
is about.  Who are we as parliamentarians?  How can we 
concentrate and get so involved in a question of this kind when 
in fact we have big things to discuss in our nation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but think about Chuck Colson who has written a 
number of books about the role of government.  He made two 
observations.  He said that a good government exists for two 
purposes:  One, to resist evil, and the other, to be a ministry 
for good.  If those are the fundamental issues of good 
government, to resist evil and to create and minister to that 
which is good and make it better, then I ask myself what this has 
to do with what we as parliamentarians are here to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all need to be paid, we all need pensions and we all need to 
be looked after.  That is certainly true and I do not want to 
denigrate that in any way.  However, what is it that will make a 
good government do something that is good for Canada?  I would 
like to suggest that the number one requirement here is to 
demonstrate balance, equity, equality and fairness and that we 
recognize that there ought to be a reward for a job well done. 
There should be recognition for people doing what is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is something that is positive, something that is 
desirable and something for which we are looking, then where is 
the balance in this situation right now?  Is it a balanced 
situation when the rules of the House are, if not changed, bent 
to suit a particular direction?  I find myself in a real argument 
about the way in which this is being done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer to the comments made by the hon. member who 
spoke just before me.  He was in a similar situation.  He wanted 
to know why this was suddenly forced upon us to deal with now at 
the end of the session.  He wanted to know why we could not have 
had months to study it and to look at all the nuances of how it 
would affect people.  That was what he was after and that is what 
I am after as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had all kinds of leaks to the press.  We have had all 
kinds of comments and presentations made to our caucus and other 
caucuses.  We were sworn to secrecy on these things but what 
happened?  What is it that we are trying to do here?  We are 
trying to create a balance between that which is confidential and 
that which is transparent and open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something else that has happened.  There is 
divisiveness in certain elements of what happens in this place, 
and that is the divisiveness based on party lines.  The Liberals 
will do things because they are Liberals and the Canadian 
Alliance members will do things because they are the Canadian 
Alliance. There is a division along those party lines. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2020"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT111"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an issue here that is not a division along party lines. 
We have a divisiveness that has been created between 
parliamentarians.  Individuals are finding themselves in 
opposition to other individuals, sometimes in the same party and 
sometimes in other parties.  However, the issue is one of 
non-unity.  What this does is it disturbs what we should be doing 
here.  We should be building an environment where people can see 
that there is some equality, some fairness and some way in which 
we can have balance in our country.  This is an issue where we 
could demonstrate and exercise a leadership role, but what do we 
have?   We have divisiveness, not along party lines, but 
essentially pulling one group of MPs against another group where 
we have different plans for different people.  I believe that is 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member who spoke just a moment ago said that he did not 
like the idea of a third party coming in, perhaps an independent 
group, and telling us the way we should be remunerated, so we as 
parliamentarians do not speak to that issue.  There is a lot of 
merit to that particular idea.  I do not want to abrogate my 
responsibility to some other group and tell them that it should 
determine what I should be paid, what my pension should be, what 
my benefits should be and what my perks should be.  I think it 
should have an input but it should not be the ultimate 
determining factor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are the supreme body in this country.  We are the ones who 
determine the laws of the land.  I think we need to look at that. 
While the opinion of other groups should be taken into account, I 
am not sure it should have the final say.  There is a balance 
here that has to be looked at as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is more than that.  The strength of a nation does not lie 
in divisiveness.  The strength of a nation comes from working 
together and from being strong.  If there was an outside party or 
an outside country that suddenly decided to commit acts of 
aggression against Canada, what would we do?  Would we divide 
ourselves along party lines?  If somebody was threatening the 
welfare of our nation and wanted to destroy our nation, what 
would we do?  We would come together and take care of that 
aggressor.  The unanimity of pulling together is what builds a 
nation.  This is one of those areas where we could pull together, 
and I think we should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was preparing for this particular debate I asked myself why 
I came here and why I was a Canadian Alliance member.  I told 
myself that it was because I wanted to make a difference.  There 
are some things that should change.  I am sure there are Liberal 
members opposite listening to this speech right now who are 
saying “Yes, and I too wanted to make a difference”.  I commend 
them for that, but the interesting thing is that there are some 
things about which they made no changes whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some very significant ways in which I think we can 
agree.  One of those ways is that we have to make the decision 
making process of the House transparent.  We have to make it 
democratic so that it reflects the four areas in which we can 
represent.  Those gentlemen opposite—there are no ladies at the 
moment—will recognize only too well that one of their roles as 
elected MPs is to represent their constituencies.  When they have 
found out exactly what those constituents want, they represent 
them by saying what their constituents want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another way is where they have to sit here and say that they do 
not know what their constituents want them to do in this case, 
but that they need to make a decision in a certain area and that 
they will exercise their best judgment and apply all their 
knowledge and skill in order to resolve the issue and become a 
trustee on their behalf, acting in their best interests.  That is 
a very important role that we all have to play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have a role to play on our mandate.  We all ran on a 
certain platform and we must do the things we said we would do. 
If constituents voted us in and gave us a majority, which the 
people sitting in the chairs opposite have, we are obligated to 
live up to that particular standard.  Finally, of course, we need 
to advocate particular positions from time to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the mandate that we have taken?  What are the promises 
that I made as an MP when I ran in 1988, in 1993 and in 1997? One 
of them had to do with changing the democratic system in Canada. 
It had to do with really representing the people and doing what 
the people felt was right.  It had to do with free votes in the 
House and a clear indication of what the people wanted regarding 
senate reform and fiscal responsibility.  It had to do with 
recognizing that people wanted tax cuts, a balanced budget and 
the debt paid.

<A HREF="#LINKT112"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have we had that?  These are the things to look at.  Some people 
will say “Oh, but Mr. Schmidt, you also said that you did not 
like this pension plan”.  I did say that and I do today.  I will 
oppose this bill, partly because of the way in which it was 
introduced and partly because the benefits in it are still too 
generous as far as I am concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need more than that.  We also need to recognize that if we 
are really going to be democratic in this country we need to give 
the people a voice that is meaningful, a voice where they can 
determine what happens.  That means that on certain issues there 
ought to be a referendum.  We are not the wisest people.  We do 
not always have the answers for everything.  The people have a 
right to express themselves and there are certain issues upon 
which we should listen to them and let them decide what the 
issues are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to balance our country so that no one part of it is 
stronger than another or that no one part is given more 
advantages than another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will happen after all this?  We have all listened to the 
debate.  We know we came here to change things and to make things 
happen, and we did.   There is a balanced budget today.  Why? 
Was it because the finance minister wanted a balanced budget or 
was it because the pressure from the people was mounting and he 
had to do it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Balancing the budget was a good thing.  We were the catalysts to 
that balanced budget and I feel very proud of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We achieved other things.  We made a change to the pension plan. 
It was in the right direction.  This is another step in the right 
direction, but is it enough?  The answer is no, it is not enough. 
There are more changes that have to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What else have we done since we came here?  We have learned a 
lot. We have learned that there were some things that we did and 
some things that we stood up for that were actually pretty 
stupid.  We really did not have to do them but they were done for 
cosmetic reasons and people will never forget them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the leader of our party took the keys for a car and gave 
them back the first time around, I do not think there is any 
Canadian who at this time will not remember that particular 
incident, but what did it really achieve?  It was not one of 
those things over which a big issue should have had been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to recognize that there are things that really matter 
and there are things that do not matter as much.  We have learned 
some of those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also learned that some of us have very deep emotions. We 
have sometimes allowed those emotions to colour our better 
thinking. We need to think with our heads and we need to feel 
with our hearts.  The balance we need is to bring those two 
together so that the compassion we feel in our hearts is mediated 
through the intellect in our heads which says that if we go this 
way we have to look at what the implications will be down the 
road.  We need to be really careful about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was one of the things that happened when this particular 
pension plan was changed in 1995.  Yes, it was changed and it did 
move in the right direction, but not everything was thought about 
and it should have been.  It was rushed through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the insurance and other benefits were cut off. 
Certain people were treated unfairly with regard to severance. 
Had we been given enough time to study this, we all would have 
recognized that.  However, we were not given enough time and 
consequently the thing did not come through the way it should 
have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have learned that to rush usually creates more problems than 
it solves.  Therefore, I would strongly recommend and urge the 
government to re-look at this bill and ask itself if it really 
has to be done this fast.  What is wrong with waiting until the 
fall session?  Why can it not happen after the next election? Why 
does it have to be done right now?  Who said that it has to be 
done right now?  Someone in his or her imagination decided that 
it has to happen now.  We did not say that.  The MPs generally 
did not say that.  However, someone in his or her wisdom decided 
that it had to happen now.  I do not accept that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something else seems to be at work here.  There are two 
characteristics that are very significant.  One of them is greed. 
We all need money to live and we all need pensions to live. Yes, 
I am one of those who thinks that we as MPs should be paid 
properly.  We should be paid in a fair and reasonable way.  We 
should also receive pensions and benefits similar to those of 
other Canadians.  That is not the issue here. 
The issue is that we should not become greedy in that pursuit. 
That is the issue we need to look at.

<A HREF="#LINKT113"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another one that has to do with power.  The leader of 
the government has simply said, “This is the bill.  Take it or 
leave it.  You are going to do this”.  The seeking of power very 
often takes a lot of energy but the degree to which people hang 
on to that power often means a greater energy being expended. 
This is a sop that is being thrown to certain people and I do 
not believe it is complete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to deal with one other subject.  It has to do with the 
leadership of MPs in their respective communities and their 
families.  It has to do with stewardship. Stewardship means that 
we are handling the resources and finances of other people on 
their behalf in their best interests.  Stewardship is not an easy 
thing to learn.  It is something that has to be learned and 
taught and it has to exist in a variety of areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is stewardship in our finances, how money is managed and 
applied in such a way that it can be defended.  When asked by the 
boss or family, one can say how much is made and explain what is 
happening.  If a father comes home having spent the week's wages 
in a casino or bar, what kind of stewardship or financial 
responsibility is that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another responsibility and it has to do with health. 
There is stewardship in health.  How do we look after our bodies? 
Do we exercise them properly?  Do we eat properly? These matters 
are very significant.  When symptoms arise that should be dealt 
with, have they been dealt with? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are the skills we have and how we use them.  Are we lazy 
or are we diligent and aggressive in applying them so that our 
entrepreneurial talent and skills actually bring about a greater 
economy, a better production of goods and services?   The 
abilities and talent we have involve stewardship.  Are we 
creating music or art?  Do we create for ourselves or for the 
benefit of society and lift the level of cultural awareness in 
relation to art and music, and things of this sort? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are very significant issues with regard to stewardship. 
They have to be dealt with.  We should be leaders in this area as 
to how we manage other people's money.  We have not demonstrated 
a very good example in that regard.  We have created deficits. We 
have created a burden for our children and grandchildren simply 
because we wanted services and goods for which we were not 
prepared to pay.  That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to teach this to our children.  We have to teach it to 
our friends and neighbours.  We have to be accountable to one 
another.  We have to call each other to account and ask, “Is 
that really the way you should be managing your time?  Is that 
really the way you should be managing your money or the people's 
money?”  We have to address these questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to recognize that we need to develop stewardship as 
individuals.  It is so easy to become part of a herd, to be sheep 
and follow one person in a particular direction.  Where is the 
individuality here?  We are being denied the individuality that 
is possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot as an individual MP do what I feel I should do.  I can 
do only one thing and vote against it.  However, when it is all 
over, I will be forced to do it the way the government wants it 
done.  On an issue like this, where it is not a partisan matter 
but rather an individual MP matter, we should be allowed to speak 
our minds.  We should be be allowed to vote.  We should be 
allowed to exercise what we think is best in the exercising of 
stewardship for our people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wonder 
how the hon. member feels about people who have given 25 years of 
their lives.  Does he not feel they should have any form of 
pension whatsoever?  Perhaps their spouse is ill and they need 
some form of health care plan, which one also loses when one 
leaves here.  Does he not feel they should be able to look after 
that person?  How does he expect them to feed and care for that 
person?  How does the hon. member expect the family will survive? 
I truly am in absolute shock.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For 18 years I served at the local level.  I gave right from the 
heart and I am glad I did.  I hope I was able to do something 
positive for my people.  When I left and came here they shook 
hands with me and said, “Thank you very much for being with 
us”.  In fact, some have asked me to come back.  I get no 
pension for that, absolutely not a penny, but a lovely hug and a 
thank you.  I thank them for that hug and the thank you they gave 
to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came here.  I probably made history in 1993.  We did not have 
any money for research when there were just two of us. I did not 
know I could put in for my living expenses. I paid for it all out 
of my own pocket from 1993 to 1997.  I did not know that we could 
be compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are with a little pension that someone told me tonight 
was around $20,000 a year.  Heavens, when I heard about the gold 
plated pension, I thought it must have been something that was 
around $40,000 a year.  After 25 or 30 years of their lives, 
people are going to get $20,000 a year.  Is that not something? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not just looking at my life but I am looking at the lives 
of so many who are here, people who have been here much longer 
than I have, 20 to 25 years.  Do they not deserve something?  I 
have never had one single solitary person in my riding say to me, 
“We do not want you to have a pension”.  Not one person has 
ever said that to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to my hon. friend that I just cannot believe what I am 
hearing tonight.  All members are deserving of something.  I 
think if every Canadian from coast to coast knew the sacrifices 
made by members and their families and spouses who allow them, 
whether they are male or female, to come here to this House of 
Commons to serve their people, not one that I know of, if they 
were told the truth, would not want members to have some form of 
compensation through a pension when they leave here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have three comments. 
The hon. member obviously was not listening to what I said.  At 
least on three different occasions I said very clearly that I am 
in favour of a pension and I think we should be properly 
remunerated and that we should have the appropriate benefits.  I 
said that at least three different times during my speech. That 
is the first point. I am not in any way denying a pension to 
anyone, not to myself nor to anyone else.  That is not the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I did say was that the pension should not be more generous 
than those available in industry and the other superannuates. 
That is what I said.  It is not a denial of pensions.  The hon. 
member has misrepresented rather severely what it is that I said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should people be remunerated for what they do here?  Of course 
they should and I said that too.  It is really unfortunate that 
the hon. member has taken upon herself to say what she did just a 
moment ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would appeal to us all.  Let us build a pension that we can 
all support, one which makes sense, is fair and creates the 
equity and balance we want.  That is what I am after and that is 
what I said. 
<P><A NAME="LINK270"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I stand in my place to speak to an issue which I think is very 
important to Canadian taxpayers and voters. It is the whole issue 
of how we manage their money. I talk a lot about this because I 
am on the finance committee. Over and over I have been on record 
as saying that we should give Canadian taxpayers a break.  It is 
time that we reduced their taxes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are on a Monday evening in June debating the change in 
the pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not had a great amount of time to look at the bill since 
we only got it today. It has been a bit of a rush job.  From what 
I see, like most bills we get here, parts of the bill have some 
gravel mixed in with the tapioca pudding.  Some things are 
probably necessary and should be done and then there are a few 
things that perhaps are beyond what should be done. I will try to 
put this into perspective from my own point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard several members say that there is no Canadian who 
thinks that members of parliament should not have a pension.  I 
am not sure that is accurate.  Some people I have talked to have 
said that they do not get a pension so why should we. There are 
some who think we should get no pension at all from the taxpayer. 
Some others have quite the opposite view.  Some say they know how 
hard we work. They know how many hours we put in and therefore, 
we should have a pension.  Some people have even said to me that 
they think I am a fool to have opted out.  So be it; that is 
their opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One lady even told me she would not vote for me again because if 
I was that stupid not to take a pension, I must lack intelligence 
in other areas too.  I told her that was her choice.  I made that 
choice because I believed it was the right thing to do at the 
time. I found out later that she had been kidding and had a great 
deal of admiration for a politician who finally acted on 
principle and actually put his money where his mouth was.  But it 
has been a real personal dilemma. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that in making speeches here tonight we are going 
to elicit a whole bunch of sympathy from the taxpaying public no 
matter what we say or do.  I have an idea that two-thirds of 
Canadians have no pension plan other than what they provide for 
themselves.  If that is the case, then we need to be rather 
discreet in how we describe our work. I am not trying to elicit 
any sympathy but it is important to put some facts on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I worked at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology for a 
number of years.  Tonight while some of the other members were 
speaking I did a quick calculation. I was in that pension plan. I 
have not yet taken my pension.  I have not yet retired from NAIT 
in the sense of actually receiving my pension payments.  I did go 
through the retirement procedure so I could be replaced by a 
permanent staff member instead of perpetual temporary staff.  I 
thought it would be fair to that person.   But I have not yet 
begun taking my pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My pension at NAIT is rather mediocre, if I dare say it, in the 
sense that the politicians of the day in Alberta made themselves 
a very good pension, but did not make a very good one for the 
civil servants. Our pension plan is actually reduced by the 
amount of Canada pension plan. Basically my contributions to the 
Canada pension plan are just a gift to the Government of Canada 
since whatever I get from the Canada pension plan is the same 
amount by which my pension from the provincial government plan is 
going to be reduced.  So that is not a great deal of money here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought about the salary.  I did a quick calculation and my 
gross salary at NAIT when I quit was around $24 an hour.  That 
was before deductions.  We all know after deductions that is 
about $12 per hour.  I made about $24 an hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people think that having left NAIT to become a member of 
parliament I am rolling in the dough.  I again did a quick 
calculation and based on my salary here, I make $16 an hour.   Of 
course, I make a lot more money because I have the privilege in 
this job of working easily 80 hours per week, whereas at NAIT 
even though we were required to work 36 hours per week, I usually 
only worked about 55 hours per week.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hourly rate of wage is down and that is just a fact.  I am 
not trying to elicit sympathy.  It is a choice I made.  Very 
frankly I have to admit that at the time when I decided to run 
for parliament I did not compute that.  As a matter of fact it 
was after my nomination or perhaps just shortly before when 
somebody asked me what my salary would be.  I said that I had 
better check that out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was always under the impression that MPs got paid lots and so 
I had not paid any great amount of attention to what the pay 
actually was.  I discovered that is was about 15% higher than 
what I was making at NAIT so I thought it would be okay.  However 
I no idea of the amount of the expenses in this job and what it 
costs to be a member of parliament.  Again those are just the 
facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having given up the growth in my pension at NAIT, I came here 
and I was upset because there were some critic groups, people 
such as the Canadian Taxpayers Federation and others, who had 
drawn a great amount of attention to the MP pension plan.  They 
called it the gold-plated plan and everything else.  I looked 
into and, sure enough, there were some aspects of the pension 
plan available to members of parliament that were actually 
somewhat offensive.  I found several things really offensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, in order for me to collect 70% of my salary, including 
Canada pension, when I worked at NAIT I would have had to work 
for 35 years.  Thirty-five years of service at 2% per year, which 
was the rate of accrual, gave me 70% of my salary.  As I said 
earlier, the amount we earn from Canada pension is taken away 
from that pension so it is not really even a full 70%.  That is 
after 35 years of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then I looked at the MP pension plan and I found that MPs would 
be eligible for 75% of their salary on retirement if they had 
worked for 15 years.  To me that seemed a little high.  For the 
Liberal members who just came in and do not realize what I was 
talking about, this was before the revisions to the plan, when it 
was still at a 5% accrual rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was then told that the Income Tax Act did not permit ordinary 
participating pension plans to accrue at more than 2% per year 
and that in the federal government a special law was passed by 
MPs and senators that basically exempted them from the Income Tax 
Act.  I felt that was wrong.  It was not right for members of 
parliament and senators not to have the whole law apply to them 
as it applies to every other Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After I was elected in 1993 I went to the payroll office and 
asked if I could opt out of the pension plan.  I was told that I 
could not.  It is an act of parliament and I was required to 
participate in it.  If I remember correctly, about $590 per month 
in contributions would be taken off my paycheque before I ever 
got it and I was in it whether or not I wanted to be, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that some of my colleagues at that time actually filed a 
letter saying that they wished to be exempted from the plan and 
not participate in it.  I did not file a letter.  I did it 
verbally.   When it was denied I said “If you are going to take 
my money anyway, I guess there is nothing I can do about it”. As 
a new member of parliament trying to get two offices organized, 
staff members hired, learning the ropes in a brand new job and 
everything else, I did not have a great deal of time to work on 
that part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the history of it.  About two years later for fairly 
political reasons the Liberal government decided that it did not 
like all this criticism of the MP pension plan and said that it 
would call the bluff of those MPs.  In a piece of legislation it 
offered us the opportunity to opt out.  It said that it would get 
us to stop criticizing the MP pension plan by having half of us 
opt out and the other half stay in.  It would cause dissension in 
the ranks and that would be the end of it.  Then it could have 
its MP pension plan and live happily ever after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine the government's surprise when 51 of 52 on this side 
opted out.  I did so on principle. 
It was an individual decision.  I was asked “What about the one 
who opted to stay in?  What is going on?  You guys are divided”. 
I said “No, it is the strength of our party.  We are not told 
what to say.  We are not told what to think.  We are certainly 
not told how to act in our party”.  This was an individual 
decision.  The fact that 51 out of 52 opted out voluntarily 
without coercion from anyone else is a mark of what principled 
people we are.

<A HREF="#LINKT117"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very proud at that time to opt out and decided to make the 
best of it.  At that stage we had that opportunity.  We got back 
our contributions into the MP pension plan minus income tax, 
which meant that we got a very small amount of money after tax. 
Some of us were able to roll that back into an RRSP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I started contributing to an RRSP as my way of supplementing my 
living after I retire.  That has been sort of a difficult thing 
to do.  Other members have been enrolled in the MP plan.  They 
contribute approximately $590 or $600 a month into a very 
generous plan.  I did a little computation and found out that if 
I wanted to give myself the same benefits they are getting, 
because of my age and not having enough time for the money to 
grow with interest, I would have to put about $3,000 a month into 
an RRSP.  That is not permitted under the Income Tax Act so I 
cannot do that, besides which I could not afford it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore have kept on making payments of around $600 a month 
into my RRSP just as before.  This is one of the big reasons I 
will be voting against the bill now before the House.  If I 
decide that I want to continue to contribute to my RRSP because 
of the fact that my total savings for the future are not that 
great, with the plan before us today I shall lose all my RRSP 
room or the bulk of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not ready today to announce whether or not I will be 
running in the election following the next one.  I have already 
stated publicly that I plan on running again in the election this 
fall or next spring, but after that perhaps I would like to see 
some younger guy come in and represent Elk Island with all the 
energy that he could bring to the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the case, I would get only my contributions back 
because I will not have put in the six years under the plan that 
we are speaking about today.  In the meantime, for the next six 
years I will lose my RRSP room so I will be able to do even less 
in terms of looking after myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is not a well thought out plan.  I am against it on 
that account.  I am also against it on the account that it still 
provides for members of parliament and senators benefits which 
are not available to ordinary Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that if ordinary Canadians can accrue 2% per annum on 
their pensions then so should members of parliament. That should 
be the limit.  Really in a sense the plan before us is simply a 
way of deferring the tax on a fair amount of income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did a little calculation.  If one looks at just the 
contributions into an annuity to provide similar plans, we would 
have to put in, depending on the age of the person and how many 
years he or she will pay in, anything between $1,700 a month and 
$2,500 a month.  That is an eight year plan.  When I did my 
original calculations of $3,000 a month it was on the assumption 
that I would be a member of parliament for four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that it is not really possible for a 
person to contribute enough into an RRSP with the present RRSP 
rules.  I think what should be done is very simple. 
We should have a system whereby the amount that members of 
parliament and senators contribute to their future retirement 
plans is within the same limits as those provided to and 
restricting ordinary members of the public.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to take a bit of a swipe at the the taxpayers 
association.  I have tried to talk to it about one of the things 
that has bothered me over the years, but I have not been able to 
get together with the association.  Now that I have said it in 
the House I imagine that my phone will ring tomorrow, but it has 
not rung when I phoned before and it has not returned my calls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have tried to get them to actually admit publicly that the 
difference between what one contributes into the plan and what 
one gets out is not all coming from the taxpayer per se.  Some of 
it could appropriately be called interest on one's contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that by and large the taxpayers association has failed 
to take that into account.  It has simply added up the total 
amount of the benefits, and that is what it has put on its 
billboards along the highways.  Since I am a mathematician of 
sorts and I know the math of finance, I have always felt that was 
intellectually dishonest of the association. It has not served 
Canadians well by giving them that misinformation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that it is still too rich compared to what is 
contributed, even if one matched dollar for dollar on behalf of 
the employer the taxpayers of the country.  It is still richer, 
but it is not rich by the amount the association claims.  For 
example, if people contribute $1,700 a month to an RRSP or to a 
growth annuity, if I can use a calculation here again, after 19 
years they would have put in $395,000.  That contribution alone 
would entitle them to $1.5 million in total of annuity payments 
taken out over 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say for the sake of round figure that people paid 
$400,000 in and got $1.5 million out.  Then they would get $1.1 
million that they did not put in.  Where did it come from?  It 
came from the accumulated interest.  In a sense, the difference 
is what the contributor has lent to the federal government, not 
unlike buying a Canada savings bond or a government T-bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a loan to the government.  It has the use of that money 
over that time.  Some of it is simply interest taxpayers would 
have paid to the holder of a bond if it had not been that the 
government had that money available from the contributor to the 
pension plan.  That is true for every public servant.  That is 
true for everyone who is a member of parliament or a senator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would simply say to the taxpayers association that it has a 
case, but its case is not as strong as what it has been saying 
because of the lack of taking into account the proper, legitimate 
interest portion of the growth as opposed to being totally 
subsidized by the taxpayer.  In fact the money does all come from 
the taxpayer, but like I said it was also partially interest on 
the loan that the taxpayer got by the contributions the 
particular member has contributed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is most unfortunate that I am being signalled since I could 
speak some more about this subject.  I would like to simply say 
in conclusion and in summary that I intend to vote against the 
bill because of the coercive force of it and because it is still 
outside the parameters available to ordinary Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time I would say that as a person who has always 
been the sole provider in our family I do have to look very 
carefully at what the options are, because I believe I have an 
obligation to my family.  I will have to look at it very 
carefully.  It has been a dilemma for me and continues to be.  I 
want to say that I have, above all, a deep desire to serve not 
only the taxpayers of Elk Island but also the taxpayers of Canada 
with honour and with respect. 
<P><A NAME="LINK271"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to add a different aspect to the debate before us. 
My remarks will be related very much to the politics of this 
issue, as opposed to the substance of the bill itself.  As most 
members of the House know, the matter of pensions for members of 
parliament has been a lightning rod in the last number of 
election campaigns, which has been largely promoted by one 
political party over another. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2100"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT119"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard the concern that I have is that this was used as 
a political wedge in a very aggressive fashion in the 1993 
election campaign and in the 1997 election campaign as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When that was done the language that was utilized and the 
literature that was produced was against very noted members of 
parliament, including my former leader, Mr. Charest.  I know that 
every member who sits with the Alliance, the former Reform Party, 
utilized that particular document in terms of the amount of 
compensation the former member for Sherbrooke, the hon. Jean 
Charest, would actually receive from pension benefits.  It was 
based on the fact that he may live to be 90 and that if he had 
lost the election at that particular time it would have amounted 
to such and such an amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My comments are in defence of the solid, hon. members of 
parliament who lost their seats in the election of 1993 because 
this issue was used as a political wedge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have difficulty in terms of taking this approach initially 
because some members of parliament who sat formerly as Reformers, 
who are now with the Alliance, I regard as very honourable 
individuals.  I compliment the member of parliament whose father 
was the former provincial leader of the Socreds.  He said “We 
did some really silly things that we should not have done in the 
first place”.  They gave away the keys to the limo.  They were 
going to turn a national institution, Stornoway, into a bingo 
hall.  They attacked all senators, including Senator Ron Ghitter, 
who was a very solid legislator at the provincial level as well 
as the federal level.  Personal attacks were made by Ezra Levant 
and the member for Calgary West which were clearly over top.  At 
least they had the fortitude to apologize for their remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform Party members opposed pension plan schemes for members of 
parliament.  They went on to say that the Reform Party would 
support the provision of pensions for MPs only—the key word 
being only—if those pensions were no more generous than private 
sector norms and met all requirements for a registered plan under 
the Income Tax Act.  That is the litmus test that was established 
by Reform members of parliament.  My concern is whether they are 
following that perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were very moderate approaches made by some individuals who 
clearly said that the pension plan is too generous and should 
reflect what we would see in the private sector.  There were 
other members of parliament who chose to ratchet up the rhetoric. 
This is what they will have to deal with when they go back to 
their ridings in the next election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the gimmicks that we know still exists within the Reform 
protocol is the issue of recall.  In the event that constituents 
do not support the way their member has voted, that member could 
be recalled. 
The number of signatures that is required to do that is not all 
that great.  I suspect that there are a number of members of 
parliament who are now with the Alliance, formerly the Reform 
Party, who are a little apprehensive about that particular aspect 
which they advocate.  They did not advocate the pension plan, now 
they do.  They did not advocate residing at Stornoway, now they 
do.  They did not advocate taking the car, now they do.  Maybe 
they do not advocate recall now.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know what the current leader of the Canadian Alliance said on 
a previous occasion about the pension plan.  She came to my 
riding the other day and made a very direct comment.  She said 
“We are going to win the riding of Saint John.  We are going to 
win the riding of Fundy—Royal.  We are going to win the riding 
of New Brunswick Southwest”.  This in spite of the fact that 
they did not have one poll to substantiate their capacity to win 
even one seat.  They said that they were going to send them home 
whether they received a pension or not.  The point is, that would 
be a purely political jab with respect to the pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With these comments on the pension plan Canadians will know 
which MPs are greedy and which ones really care about the 
taxpayers.  Those are not my words; they are the words of the 
member for Edmonton North.  She went on to say “Believe me, the 
voters won't soon forget those MPs who promised integrity in 
government but decided to pig-out while the trough was still 
full”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Who said that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  That was said by the member for Edmonton 
North, the current leader of the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern I have is with a hard working Alliance MP for 
whom I have a lot of respect.  These are debates and challenges 
which they will have to work out among themselves.  On August 6, 
1998 he stated, when a member of parliament chose to opt into the 
pension plan, “Members who opt back in are liars or 
hypocrites”.  That was very callous, and perhaps short-sighted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Who said that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  That was the member for Calgary 
Southeast.  I suspect that will be a difficult issue for them as 
time goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also recall comments made by the former House leader for the 
Reform Party.  He stated “It is those principled individuals who 
took it on themselves to opt out of the gold plated MP pension 
plan who got on the alternative pension placed before the House 
today”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Elk Island spoke just a few moments ago.  The 
approach he takes in the House more often than not is one of 
moderation.  He said that the kind of language which uses such 
terms as gold plated pension plan was rhetoric that was not 
becoming of the House.  I commend him for that.  However, I 
question the tenacity and the visceral approach that the member 
for Langley—Abbotsford took on that particular day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the comments of what other individuals have said, 
I believe it is time to build a strong coalition of Conservative 
voters, ones who want to pay down the debt, lower taxes, grow our 
economy and acknowledge where they were wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last weekend the member for Calgary Southwest said that Prime 
Minister Mulroney still had not apologized properly to the 
Canadian taxpayers for what he did with the free trade agreement, 
which has grown our trade with the Americans from about $100 
billion in 1988 to over $320 billion annually. 
The free trade initiative was brought forth by the Progressive 
Conservative Party.  It was an initiative which represented the 
fact that Progressive Conservatives are prosperity builders of 
this nation.  We are very proud of that.  Those members should 
apologize for the language and terms they have used and for 
accusing our members of taking a pork barrel approach.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will comment on another member of parliament for whom I have a 
lot of time.  He is a very learned member.  He is one of the best 
questioners in the House.  I am talking about the member for 
Medicine Hat.  He tries to do his work on the finance committee. 
However, again an apology is required for the language he uses 
when referring to the pension plan as only being available to 
members of parliament:  “It is disgusting.  It is the height of 
hypocrisy”.  These are the words of the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I referred to the House leader of the Canadian Alliance.  He is 
probably one of the most moderate, nicest guys that we have here 
in the House of Commons.  When he made his remarks, Mr. Speaker, 
I know that you were in the chair at the time.  I hasten to add 
that the member for Fraser Valley chose not to state this 
particular quote:  “All Reform Party members are going to opt 
out of the pension plan because we stand on principle and we do 
not swim in gravy.  We are going to opt out”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now refer to the hon. member for Calgary Southwest who is 
vying for the Canadian Alliance leadership.  We will have to 
question the leadership candidates in terms of what their 
particular issues are as well, be it Tom Long or Mr. Day.  There 
are questions about when the member for Calgary Southwest, the 
son of a former Alberta premier, said:  “It is the intention of 
Reform MPs to opt out of the pension plan.  We call upon every 
member of the House to do likewise.  Opt out or get out will be 
the cry in the constituencies”.  Is it the cry in the 
constituencies?  Will it be the cry that will actually 
precipitate recall? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a cry which must be respected if fairness in leadership by 
example and integrity are to be restored to parliament and any 
budget it endorses.  When the word integrity comes into play, I 
am very proud to be a member of the Progressive Conservative 
Party and to be part of a team led by the Right Hon. Joe Clark. 
Mr. Clark is an individual who has taken a very honest approach 
to government.  His integrity and honesty has always been beyond 
question.  Again, I want to build a coalition with members of 
parliament who are in the Canadian Alliance, the moderates within 
that caucus with whom I have had the pleasure of having 
conservations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to really do the things that we need to do in this 
country.  We have to pay down the debt.  We have a $580 billion 
debt, which is a mortgage on the future generations of this 
country.  I want to lower taxes to grow our economy and to 
maintain our international competitiveness.  We must recognize 
the fact that the economies of the Irish, the Danes and the Finns 
have taken off.  There has been 18% growth in the United States, 
14% growth in Germany and 14% growth in the U.K., while Canada 
has fallen behind with only 7% growth.  Those are figures for 
1992 to 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to get our tax regime in order.  To do that we need to 
build a coalition, an alliance, a further conservative consensus. 
We will not be able to do that if members continue to make 
visceral attacks on our leader, Mr. Clark.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A comment has been made that maybe I want some time out, but I 
do have more to say.  At the time the member for Beaver River 
said that they would win Fundy Royal.  I had the honour in my 
riding association to have all eight MLAs who actually share the 
boundaries of Fundy Royal at my nomination just about nine days 
ago today.  They endorsed my campaign.  All eight riding 
associations came forward to endorse my campaign.  The most 
fiscally conservative premier in the country, Premier Bernard 
Lord, was actually there as my guest speaker.  I know the 
strength of my riding.  She attacked me.  She was going to send 
us home whether or not we had a pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want everybody to know who threw the first dart.  This 
particular member of parliament said that the pension plan was a 
scheme, a dream, when one thinks about what has gone on in the 
last several years to make sure MPs look after themselves.  In 
other words some may opt out but the rest will continue to pork 
out.  It is what I understand.  Those people who are still in an 
overbloated pension system because they have qualified now will 
just continue to pork out while some people will opt out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were some immoderate approaches taken by reform alliance 
members.  I spoke of the moderate language of the member for Elk 
Island and the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca.  He mentioned 
quite simply that the MP pension plans should be converted into a 
money purchase system, the same as many private companies are 
doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have any problem with taking that kind of an approach 
if that is a belief he wants to follow.  However, visceral 
attacks were made by the member for Elk Island about the 
gold-plated pension plan.  He attacked hon. members of parliament 
who actually tried to advance public policy in the country, hon. 
members of parliament who actually stood in the House and 
delivered principles that built the prosperity of this nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at the member for Cumberland—Colchester.  I know he was 
attacked on that very issue in 1993.  I look at the former member 
for Charlotte as it was called at the time, and now the proud 
member for New Brunswick Southwest, who was attacked on that very 
same issue.   The visceral hatred brought forth against our 
candidates at that time should be remembered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that my colleagues in the Reform camp or the Canadian 
Alliance camp, with reform as its middle name, may look at the 
language in terms of reciting these quotations and be a little 
upset over it.  The intent of what I was trying to do was to say 
that the language the former leader of the Socreds brought forth 
provincially was wrong.  It was wrong to use hatred and visceral 
attacks condemning our leaders in terms of Brian Mulroney to the 
degree they did.  They utilized hatred in terms of attacking with 
respect to the keys and not taking the limo, not taking the house 
in Stornoway or the chauffeur, and opting out of a pension plan 
and maybe opting back in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they want to build a coalition of Conservative voters, I 
think it is time that the hand is more than just extended and 
they say that they went over the top time and time again in what 
they said about some hon. members.  It probably was not in the 
spirit of developing sound public policy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I think I will make a comment.  Very frankly I do not 
require a response from the member.  I would like to point out to 
everyone who happens to be listening to the debate that in fact 
the then Reform Party, which is now the Canadian Alliance, was 
the only party that ever both publicly and privately said it 
would do something to try to make this pension plan fairer for 
Canadian taxpayers at the same time as giving a commitment to fix 
it for everyone. 
As far as I am concerned we will form government.

it.  All other members, including those on that side, have always 
very happily taken whatever they could get without ever 
questioning whether or not it is fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to question the fairness of it.  I will 
personally.  We need to work on it until we get it right.  Right 
now there are some changes being proposed in this bill.  As far 
as I am concerned they do not yet fix it.  The work is not yet 
finished.  With that I end my comments.  As I said, no response 
is needed, nor required, nor wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to try to be a 
little generous in that regard.  I think the reform alliance 
actually did the Canadian public some degree of service by 
recognizing the fact that the pension plan, as was stated 
previously, probably was not the best pension plan to reflect the 
will of Canadians in that regard.  I give him credit in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want him to go back to their platform in “Let the Future 
Begin” in 1997 on which every one of his members ran.  They 
indicated that people would not be receiving pensions until they 
were 55, which was probably a step in the right direction.  I say 
this to correct the record. 
<P><A NAME="LINK273"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
comment and a question for the member for Fundy—Royal.  I 
listened intently to what he said.  I thought his comments were 
quite profound and quite illuminating.  A fair amount of light 
needs to be shone on a lot of the statements that have been made 
in this place since 1988 and especially since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Elk Island said that somehow this policy 
would change the pension plan for everyone else.  This policy 
would change the pension plan for the Canadian Alliance.   No one 
else opted out.  No one else said they would not take it.  This 
pension plan is being changed for one group of people only, and 
quite frankly there is a term for that.  There was some talk 
about braying, but I will talk about con.  I have heard crows on 
a gut pile before and that is what it sounds like to me.  I would 
like an answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is wrong in one 
aspect.  It is not just Reform or Canadian Alliance members that 
this bill actually applies to.  It applies to about 90% to 95% of 
Reform or Canadian Alliance members.  That would be the accurate 
number.  This bill has really been brought forward because of 
them.  There are a couple of members in the Bloc, but the bill 
was brought forward mostly for the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue that will come into play at home over the course of 
the summer is the Reform vehicle which I think is wrong in terms 
of recall.  I am not an advocate of that. The number of 
signatures required to precipitate a recall situation would be 
quite difficult, especially when I look at the comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In August 1998 the member for Calgary Southeast stated “earlier 
this week the MPs who opt back in are liars and hypocrites”. 
That is a very difficult situation for them to sort out 
internally.  I know reform alliance MPs work for their 
constituents and try to do the best they can in that regard.

debate which I do not think will be beneficial to anyone whom the 
particular bill benefits or does not benefit.  For those whose 
idea it was to bring it in and who participated in the 
negotiations and for those who did not, I want to read from a 
Reform Party of Canada blue book from the past.  Then I will ask 
the member if he supports that policy just so we are clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what is happening here this evening is that a number of 
members are stating what our policy was or was not in the past, 
and I think we need to be clear about it. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports the provision of pensions for MPs only 
if those pensions are no more generous than private sector norms 
and meet all requirements for a registered plan under the Income 
Tax Act.  Reformers also support using an independent body to 
make binding recommendations to parliament with regard to MPs' 
pensions and that these recommendations be applied to the future 
benefits paid to both retired and currently sitting members. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the blue book used to say for the Reform Party of 
Canada when there was a Reform Party of Canada.  I just wanted to 
point that out to the member and ask him if he has a problem with 
that type of policy, although I do not believe he has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the issue is that they have 
a vote before them and they have to make that determination.  The 
key word is only, only if it did not exceed what was found 
immediately in the private sector.  The issue here is not to 
cloud what we have before us.  It is whether this bill does or 
does not and whether they will vote for it or not, whether they 
want to deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the reasoned approach that was just quoted, I 
think a lot of Canadians agree with it, but that is not what we 
are debating today.  I thank the hon. member for his question and 
the opportunity to participate in this evening's debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK275"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like the member to answer the question.  The 
question was regarding Reform Party policy.  It says in the blue 
book: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports the provision of pensions for MPs only 
if those pensions are no more generous than the private sector 
norms and meet all requirements for a registered plan under the 
Income Tax Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Prince George—Peace River asked specifically for 
the member's comments on this Reform policy.  The member sounded 
like he was opposing it.  Could I get an answer on that, please? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Canadians, this member 
included, believe we should have a competitive regime.  A pension 
plan should be something that would reflect the level of risk and 
the level of investment and contribution found in the private 
sector.  That is the gist of the comments that may be in the 
book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is only if.  During the vote that we will have later 
they will have to make their own determination.  That is the 
relevant issue.  I would say to the hon. member that is the issue 
before the House.  As I said before, I wanted to talk about the 
politics of the issue in that regard.  The visceral language, the 
attack, and the rhetoric used before was wrong, was over the top 
and was not becoming of this place House over the last seven 
years.

order.  I just want to inform the House that this is going to be 
carried to a vote.  There is not going to be unanimous consent to 
move this ahead as reformers wanted.  We will be here the rest of 
the night but we are going to force the vote on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That was not a point 
of order but it was certainly illuminating. 
<P><A NAME="LINK276"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am going to be splitting my time with the member for 
Surrey Central. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to the comments which were made from the back corner, 
they seem to be prejudging how people are going to vote in the 
House.  I do not know how they would know that.  I certainly do 
not know how some of my colleagues are going to vote so I am not 
sure how they have decided that already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about how this issue has come to where it is at 
today.  It seems I have had this date with destiny for quite some 
time.  Mr. Speaker, you will know that there has been a bit of a 
tortured past with this issue within our own caucus. Why is it 
that this has come about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I campaigned in 1991 and 1992 I heard a lot of constituents 
say that there was a problem with the MP pension plan.  I was not 
hearing much about the pay issue but I was hearing about the 
pension plan. Certainly there were some politics being played as 
I suggest there are today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard over and over again that people thought that the MPs of 
the day had failed, that they did not want to deal with the issue 
of pay increases so they had decided to give themselves an 
increase through the back door.  That is what bothered 
constituents more than anything else.  They wanted the government 
and members of parliament to be up front on this issue.  I agree 
and I think that still has not been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do want to raise the issue.  Some excellent comments were made 
earlier in the debate by people whose judgment I value, the 
member for Winnipeg—Transcona, and the member for New Brunswick 
Southwest in terms of the history on these issues of pay and 
pension.  They were valuable and important to the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know it is hard not to take a few swipes along the way.  I 
have been guilty of it myself.  In 1995 I spoke out very strongly 
against the revised pension plan which was brought in. Why did I 
do that?  I believe we still have not achieved the MP pension 
plan that most Canadians want.  All we want, and I believe all 
that Canadians want, is a reasonable pension plan for members of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was it a reasonable plan when we were raising this issue back in 
1991-92?  Let us examine that for a moment.  At the time it was 
about a $6 contribution by the Government of Canada for every 
dollar the member put in.  At the time a member only had to serve 
six years in the House. As someone said earlier, a member could 
be 27 years old and have a pension for life, albeit if the member 
only served six years it would not be that much, but it would 
continue until the member is 75 years old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that was a fair plan, why did the government change it in 
1995?  I suggest that improvements were made in 1995.  They were 
not as much of an improvement as I would have liked to have seen, 
but there certainly were improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at it for a moment.  It was a step in the right 
direction.  It was taken down to $3.70 for every dollar the 
member contributed.  Although it is probably still twice as 
generous as a private sector plan, the age limit was changed to 
55 years.  People could not start drawing it until they were 55 
years old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course there was an opt-out provision for the class of 1993 
and some of us took it because we were essentially dared to 
either take the second plan, which is kind of super-enhanced to a 
lesser degree, or nothing.  So we did take it.  But there were 
improvements.  It ended the double dipping as was said earlier. 
We ended up with closure on that debate.  I think we are still a 
ways away from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to talk about what happened in 1997.  After the review, 
in 1998 the legislation went through, but in 1997 there was a 
plan calling for expense allowance increases, an enhanced 
severance package, and of course the opt-in provisions which some 
of our members took advantage of.

<A HREF="#LINKT126"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no provision for that more reasonable plan at least 
for the very MPs who had opted out.  Some people have made the 
case that we do not want to do that because that creates another 
class of MP pensions.  There are four classes of MP pension plans 
now.  What difference would it make if there was a fifth? That 
was not a good argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What bothered me more than anything in the 1997 package which 
was put before the House, and which I vowed I would never be part 
of again, was it was essentially passed in the dark of the night. 
There was no debate and no vote in the House of Commons. The very 
thing we are sent here to do by our constituents is to debate the 
issues and vote on those issues at the end of the day.  I must 
say that today's package moves a long way to recognize that was a 
problem.  That was my biggest single problem with what happened 
in 1997.  Many people in my riding asked me what we were trying 
to do by sliding that package through in the night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every elected member in the House should have the opportunity to 
debate the issues.  If it is our pay, that is still fair game. We 
have to debate those issues.  There needs to be a vote at the end 
of the day.  I wanted to ensure that happened this time around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of my colleagues joined in 1997 and I do not fault them for 
that.  We have different situations.  We have different financial 
situations.  But the 1997 plan, the 1995 plan and of course the 
plan today still are all overly generous and do not meet the test 
we put forward in 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am trying to say is I am not in favour of the current 
plan, although I understand many members are and most probably 
will be opting in.  I have a problem with it. We need to go 
further to change it to a plan that is less generous than it is 
right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, there have been many good cases for different 
points of view on this issue, but I wanted to put my point of 
view on the record.  I think this enhanced plan today has missed 
the mark again.  There should have been a plan offered for those 
members of parliament from the class of 1993 that were out that 
was based on a fifth option, a fifth package.  There are four 
classes in the plan right now.  What would have been wrong with 
having one more class for those people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked to a number of constituents over the last seven 
years regarding this issue.  They want us to be up front and 
honest with them about the issues.  If we feel we deserve a pay 
increase, we should get up in the House and make the case for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see some benefit in having an independent panel make 
recommendations to the House, but it really is for the members of 
the House to make those kinds of decisions in the end.  It seems 
to me the most important issue from the point of view of our 
constituents is that we do not want to do through the back door 
what we are not willing to do through the front door, which is to 
have a super-enhanced pension plan because we are not addressing 
the real issue which is probably the pay issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the previous parliament, Jim Silye, a former colleague of 
mine from Calgary Centre, made an important comment about what he 
believed was the best way to handle this.  I agreed with him at 
the time and I agree with him today.  If members were paid a 
proper amount we could do away with the special tax free portion, 
the tax free expense allowance, and members could look after 
their own retirement income.  He made a good suggestion at the 
time. People laughed at him because he was a self-made 
millionaire and did not need the pension plan himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we do have to recognize that people come from different 
walks of life and we do not want to limit this place just to 
people who can sort of buy their way in here, people who are 
independently wealthy.  We want a cross-section of Canadians in 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The class of 1997 as I said are automatically in the plan. There 
is no opt-out provision for them.  The class of 1993, the ones we 
are really talking about today, are going to be compelled by this 
plan to be in it.  Members of our party have been involved in 
some of these negotiations and I do not fault them for that, but 
my own view is I think we still have a way to go to correct this 
plan and I would like to see that happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 I committed to work to make this pension plan a fair 
one.  I think that is what my constituents want. 
They want members of parliament to have a good basis for pay and 
they want members to have a good pension plan but it has to be 
fair.  It has to meet the test and I do not believe that has 
happened today.

Speaker, what those members are proposing certainly has not met 
the test, because this scheme, and that is what it is, it is a 
scheme, was hatched in secrecy.  Not one member of parliament 
with the exception of the House leaders had any idea what was 
going on.  This was laid on our table tonight at 6 o'clock. Every 
one of them on all sides of the House should be ashamed of 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically this is being forced by the party formerly known as 
the Reform Party, presently known as the CA.  What those members 
did in a previous life in a previous parliament was to make the 
decision that they did not want in.  They staked their whole 
political careers on this pension plan.  They raged against it 
back home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of that party's own members are now sitting on the 
backbenches because they defied their own party a couple of years 
ago when they opted in.  They want to set the rules of the game 
themselves.  In fact they are forcing the government's hand on 
this very issue.  Unless it involves them, they do not want to 
have anything to do with the renewal of the pension plan.  They 
are setting the rules and the government is stupid enough to fall 
into their trap, because now they can conveniently go back home 
and say the majority of parliament overruled them.  That is 
exactly what they are doing.  They are the hypocrites of all 
hypocrites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard the present leader of the party— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Order, please. I understand 
the member for New Brunswick Southwest is incensed over this, but 
I would ask that the remark hypocrites of all hypocrites be 
withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I withdraw the term 
hypocrite, but it was very hypocritical of the member, which is 
very parliamentary— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Order, please. I asked the 
hon. member to withdraw the direct implication of the word 
hypocrite as directed to a specific member.  In my judgment, to 
refer to the action of a specific situation as hypocritical is 
parliamentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Canadian Alliance members 
are holding the House hostage, if you will, on this very issue, 
because many of them now realize that they have to go back out to 
get elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their party is going through a huge transition at this time. 
They do not know who their new leader will be.  Whether the new 
leader will be from Ontario, which they will detest if that 
happens, whether he will be the recycled leader from Alberta or 
possibly a new leader from Alberta, there is a lot of uncertainty 
in that party.  It creates a lot of anxiety and now they are 
trying to build that very safety net they took away about 10 
years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I may have to take back 
some of the words I said earlier.  There is a lot of venom coming 
from that corner of the House of Commons today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the member for New Brunswick Southwest may not have any 
kind of relationship with his House leader, he may not know what 
was going on, but his House leader certainly did.  The fact that 
he may not have shared it with his members says quite a bit about 
that party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dealing with the specific issue he raised about whether we 
wanted pension plans for our members of parliament in terms of 
the Canadian Alliance, I reject categorically what the member has 
said.  A couple of our members have read from our 1991 blue book. 
We have always taken the position that we want a pension plan 
for our members, but the pension plan has to be a reasonable 
plan.  I think that is in <I>Hansard</I> a number of times.  For 
the member to suggest otherwise is a total fabrication that 
misrepresents what was read into the record from <I>Hansard</I> 
just a few moments ago when he was sitting in the House.  I 
cannot understand how he could possibly have missed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that there is a lot of politics being played in 
that corner and we want to move on.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my constituents of Surrey Central and 
my colleagues I would like to participate in the debate on Bill 
C-37, an act to amend the Parliament of Canada Act and the 
Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I begin I would like to share a short story with the 
House.  Yesterday it was raining cats and dogs at about 5 p.m. 
before I got on my flight to Ottawa.  About 10,000 members of the 
Fijian community held a rally in sympathy and for the protection 
of the rights of their friends and relatives who are victims of 
violence and persecution in Fiji, where an attempted coup has 
taken place. They presented me with this yellow ribbon and made 
me promise that I would wear it in the House today.  I am keeping 
my promise to honour the efforts of those 10,000 people in Surrey 
and Delta from the Fijian community by wearing this ribbon today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now to Bill C-37.  A number of passionate speeches have been 
given in the House, particularly by the House leader and the whip 
of the official opposition, as well as many members of the 
official opposition.  Passionate speeches and very valuable 
comments have been made by members of other parties, particularly 
by the House leader of the NDP.  All of these members command 
high respect in my mind, irrespective of the political parties to 
which they belong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, while I was listening to the debate I noticed that a 
few members used this occasion to throw around political 
rhetoric.  They were probably the left-over members of the 
Progressive Conservative Party who were taking this opportunity 
to show their resentment because they are dissatisfied with the 
direction in which their party is going, so they tried to use 
this opportunity to throw around political rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate about pensions and retirement allowances is a very 
emotional issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four different tiers of pension in the House.  One is 
the class of '97, to which I belong and, therefore, I stood to 
speak on behalf of my colleagues.  Another tier is the class of 
'93. Another tier is those members of parliament who were 
defeated and then came back to the House.  There are different 
tiers of pensions in the House.  Should they not be equitable? 
Those tiers should not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be only one type of pension for all members of 
parliament because all members of parliament are expected to do 
the same job and to have the same duties.  All members are 
supposed to represent their constituents.  All members are 
supposed to work hard and make themselves available to their 
constituents.  They are supposed to try to help them as much as 
they can.  They are supposed to show leadership, skill, courage 
and determination.  Therefore, I believe that all members of the 
House need to have the same type of pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should look at the different factors, which vary from 
individual to individual in the House.  Every member has 
different responsibilities as far as family is concerned.  Some 
members are rich and others are poor.  Members of parliament 
serve this great nation, but they are members of a political 
party and they are branded as such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, my qualifications are in the field of business 
administration and marketing management. 
When I look for a job after my political career is over, I 
have already planned it.  It might be the case that very few 
businesses would want to hire me because I have a political 
brand on me, as do other members of parliament.  It is not 
easy to find a job.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that members have some sort of compensation. 
The Canadian Alliance members, formerly the Reform Party of 
Canada members, have never said, to the best of my knowledge, 
that they did not want a pension.  Even the blue book policy has 
been read a couple of times in the House.  What these members are 
against is the gold plated pension.  They do not want an overly 
generous pension plan for members of parliament which is not in 
conjunction with the terms and conditions of private sector 
pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not that they did not want the pension; they wanted to 
reform the pension.  All the people who are talking about 
pensions need to appreciate that these members tried to reform 
the pension while they were in opposition.  They asked the 
government to reform the pension plan.  Instead of appreciating 
this, the issue now becomes that they are opting into the 
pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, the issue is not whether or not they are opting into 
the pension; the issue is that they tried their best to reform 
the gold plated pension and the credit goes to the Official 
Opposition of Canada, the Canadian Alliance, which has been 
effective in toning down the gold plated pension.  Now this 
pension plan is much more reformed than it was many years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Peace River has already mentioned that the 
contribution used to be six to one.  Then it was four to one, and 
now it is a different type of pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the same members of parliament who not only sacrificed 
the amount of the pension they were supposed to get, but who also 
sacrificed the other medical and insurance benefits associated 
with the pension.  I do not see any appreciation from members 
opposite or anywhere else saying that these members sacrificed 
their own benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another big factor is the quality of members of parliament. 
Members of parliament in performing their responsibilities try to 
do their best.  They work hard, but they should be compensated 
for the amount of input they put into their work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I want to make is that it is the sacrifice of members 
which should be appreciated.  They tried their best.  They put 
their money at stake.  They put their livelihood for their 
retirement at stake to reform the gold plated pension, which 
should be recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on the government benches have picked this time to 
introduce this bill, when we are about to break for summer.  They 
want to drive a wedge between members.  They did not give enough 
time for members to digest this plan, to think about it, to 
discuss it and then to vote on it.  The Liberals just introduced 
the bill and we are to debate it late into the night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For members who sacrificed their pension or who opted out of the 
pension in the past, it was a very difficult choice.  They can 
support this bill, they can oppose it or they can abstain.  Since 
the gold plated pension has been changed quite a bit I would 
encourage my colleagues to support the bill so that we can bury 
this issue once and for all and then focus on the more important 
issues which are confronting our nation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am wondering how the party formerly known as the 
Reform Party can square itself on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of its members is getting a bit vexed, and I guess I would 
too if I campaigned on the idea of eliminating a pension plan and 
all of a sudden I wanted to jump into the so-called trough which 
they talked about, which the interim leader of the party has 
referred to in the past. 
I could quote from speech after speech which she made on the 
issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  What does Peter have to say about 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member will have a 
chance to get on his hind legs and speak.  He has already spoken 
to this issue.  I am speaking in the sense that members of the 
former Reform Party, now known as the CA, have completely 
swallowed themselves whole on this issue.  It is very symbolic. 
It is something like Preston's flip-flop on taking the keys to 
the limousine in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I know the time is 
getting late and I am sure it was a slip of the tongue, but we do 
not refer even by first name to current members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I apologize.  I should 
refer to the member by the riding he represents and not by his 
first name.  I was speaking of the former leader of the Reform 
Party, now the member who represents the riding of Calgary 
Southwest, who is vying for the leadership of the CA.  I guess we 
know who we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can they swallow themselves whole on an issue like this, 
which was such an integral part of their campaign strategy in 
1993?  Many members of parliament were defeated on the very issue 
of pensions.  Basically, the Reformers in 1993 were saying not to 
vote for this person or that person because it would mean that 
when the person went back to Ottawa he or she would get a 
pension.  They were against pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the Reformers were saying.  Now they are saying 
that they want pensions, that they like them.  The reason they 
want them is because they are now in a vice.  Many of them are up 
for re-election with a very slim possibility of winning, so they 
want that golden handshake.  They want that safety net.  They are 
willing to swallow themselves whole.  That is exactly what they 
are doing on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Bill C-37 is not about 
leadership.  It is not about the Canadian Alliance.  It is not 
about partisanship.  The bill is about a gold plated pension.  It 
was the member of this party who showed courage and leadership in 
the House so that the gold plated pension could be reformed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member who asked the question should think twice.  He 
should worship the leader of the Canadian Alliance who showed 
courage and who stood in the House against the old line political 
parties which have been governing the country for more than 132 
years.  They never thought of reforming the gold plated pension. 
For 132 years their members have been receiving those pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was up to the Canadian Alliance members to stand in the 
House. They wanted a positive change.  They wanted to bring about 
a change in favour of the Canadian taxpayers.  He should worship 
those members.  Moreover, the hon. member should talk to his own 
House leader about the pension.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here tonight to 
talk about the retirement allowance pension plan that is being 
amended for members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to 1993 the political parties of the day set up a pension 
plan that was not in keeping with what Canadians wanted their 
members of parliament to be rewarded.  As a result, in 1993 the 
Reform Party members came to this place and began the march for 
change and a more sensible compensation plan for members of 
parliament.  Tonight we find ourselves continuing on that march 
to a reasonable, sensible and fair pension plan for members of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding no one has a big problem with our pay scale.  In 
fact, some people say it should be more.  People realize the 
amount of our tax free allowance that we have to spend.  That is 
not the issue.  When they look at the pension plan, they say it 
is an issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us tonight does not go to where the Canadian 
public's position is on pensions for members of parliament.  I 
fail to see at this time why the Liberal government, which has a 
majority in this place, could not have negotiated with the 
leaders of the other parties and brought in a bill that would 
have satisfied everyone, especially the Canadian public who pay 
the bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tonight we have seen the federal Progressive Conservative Party 
members in the House attack, not the Liberals for the way they 
brought in this bill, but the Canadian Alliance.  I would like to 
quote a statesman in our country, who happens to be a provincial 
premier, to bring into perspective the fact that we, as 
opposition members, as conservative thinking and conservative voting 
members, should be working together with regard to the bills and 
the amendments that Liberals bring in on various bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what was said.  I will read it into the record so that 
it is clear to all Canadians watching this debate tonight that 
the enemy is not on the opposition side.  The enemy, in political 
terms, is on the government side which has mismanaged our 
economy, mismanaged the spending of billions of dollars and has 
mismanaged the compensation issue in the House for members of 
parliament causing untold harm to many members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following is a quote by Mr. Klein, the Premier of Alberta: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems sort of odd...especially when he's talking about the 
Alliance splitting the conservative right.  The Alliance is 
really a consolidation of the conservative right.  Many PC 
members left the federal PC party because of a lack of fiscal 
accountability.  It seems to me Brian Mulroney lost a lot of his 
popularity because of his fiscal responsibility...The Alliance is 
a unification mechanism to bring Conservatives who were fiscal 
conservatives to the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tory collapse in 1993 was “a manifestation of Brian Mulroney 
and his policies,” Mr. Klein added. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see conservative thinking people across Canada coming 
together in the Canadian Alliance that we are building at this 
time.  That is the fear on the government side.  That is why we, 
as Canadian Alliance members, are working together to bring in a 
pension plan that Canadians will accept, a reasonable, sensible 
pension plan that we can all vote for at a future time when we in 
the Canadian Alliance are the government of this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK281"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
just a couple of questions because I have always been intrigued 
about how this would make out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to compliment the member for his remarks because his 
level of rancour was in proportion to the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two concerns.  Given the problem we have with the speed 
by which the bill has been brought forth, perhaps there are ways 
to ask the House, since we are masters of our own domain, whether 
the bill could be hoisted, debated over the course of the summer 
and then brought forward in the fall in order to have a proper 
debate in committee with witnesses.  Would the hon. member 
support that initiative? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member think that this issue would be eligible for 
recall if a significant number of signatures could be obtained? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member's last 
question does not require an answer because there is no recall 
legislation in place in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Realistically, had the government not wanted to essentially take 
care of its own members for the most part in this legislation, it 
could have, in good faith, come over to our House leader and the 
House leaders of the other parties and talked about a plan with 
which Canadians themselves could be happy and satisfied that they 
were paying a reasonable amount of compensation for us through 
our pension plans.

<P><A NAME="LINK282"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to point out the hypocritical nature of the 
position taken by the party formerly known as the reform party 
and now known as the CA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote from the June 14, 1996 <I>Hansard</I> where the 
member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, the MP for Winnipeg North Centre has just returned 
after travelling all over the country and talking with Canadians 
who are concerned about their public pensions.  The travelling MP 
said that restoring faith in the CPP is as important as reforming 
the plan itself.  No kidding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While hardworking Canadians worry about their pensions, is the 
Liberal member from Winnipeg North Centre concerned about his? 
No.  Did the member for Winnipeg North Centre care one bit about 
average Canadians when he refused to back away from the Liberal 
pension trough?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the Liberal government care one bit about Canadians when it 
firmly re-established its pension trough position last year?  No. 
Did the Liberals care one bit that Tobin and Copps, the $7 
million pension couple, are out campaigning at the taxpayers' 
expense today?  No. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Once again, I would 
ask the member for New Brunswick Southwest, who knows this as 
well as I or anybody else in the House, that we do not refer to 
sitting members by other than the constituency they represent or 
their office, period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member for New 
Brunswick Southwest was in parliament between the 1988 and 1993 
timeframe.  I believe there is a question now as to whether or 
not the members who served during that time are in fact really 
trying to have their contribution level increased from 4% to 5%. 
It may be a little self-serving to be debating like this in the 
House at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the point that we are 
attempting to make is that the party formerly known as the reform 
party and now known as CA is attempting to change the rules in 
the middle of the game.  It is attempting to swallow itself whole 
on this pension issue and it is doing a very good job of it.  If 
we look at the agitated faces of those members we will understand 
why.  They came into the House railing against pensions and now 
they want the pension act changed.  Why?  They want it changed to 
benefit themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When that party went through this exercise a couple of years ago 
what did it do when some of its members bought back into the 
pension plan?  It put those members in the back row.  It actually 
punished those members because they voted and supported a reform 
to the pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question remains:  Why do members get up on their hind legs 
and rail about us when it is their party that forced this issue 
to the floor of the House of Commons?  They attempted to sneak it 
through in the dying days of this session with not one single 
member of parliament knowing what was going on until 6 o'clock 
tonight.  Talk about transparency.  They were the ones who did 
it.  Talk about a House leader.  Every House leader here is 
surprised by the reform members' flip-flop on this issue.  Here 
they are standing on their hind legs supporting something they 
fought against for 10 solid years of their political lives.  This 
is hypocritical—

said often that the use of unparliamentary words directed to a 
specific individual is unparliamentary.  There are times when the 
use of a word in the English language may not make people feel 
good, but it is an English word and it is descriptive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my judgment the use of the word hypocritical to describe 
actions in an abstract form is entirely appropriate, unless 
someone can figure out another word that would be just as good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, certainly there is no 
reason at this time to use words like that in the House.  I 
certainly concur with your ruling.  All of us have had our House 
leaders, including the federal Progressive Conservatives, in on 
the discussions and what has been going on.  For the member to 
stand here and take the position he has is clearly unreasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance is composed of 57 members that were in the 
Reform Party.  The Canadian public has received a great service 
from us.  Prior to 1993 I recall that taxpayers were contributing 
something like $6 for every $1 that a member of parliament put 
into pensions.  After the 1993 election Reform Party members came 
here saying that was not right and that we needed a more 
reasonable pension plan for members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They did not get everything they wanted, but they did manage to 
get it down to about $4 for every $1 as a contribution level and 
increased the age to 55.  Canadians appreciated the effort of 
those members in 1993 and they appreciated the sacrifice they 
made by not jumping willy-nilly into the gold-plated pension 
plan.  The Canadian public owes a debt of gratitude to those 
people.  They have rewarded us by voting for us in vast numbers.

plan an acceptable and reasonable one, and I know voters will 
reward us again in the next election.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
two weeks ago during question period I had the opportunity to 
address a question to the Minister of Health.  It concerned a 
newspaper report that evidence had been conclusively found that 
the tobacco industry was explicitly targeting our youth in terms 
of marketing and sales of tobacco products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I became a member of parliament I asked to be put on the 
health committee because of my interests from my prior work.  One 
of the first issues we dealt with on the health committee was 
tobacco related products and some of the health concerns 
Canadians have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went through extensive hearings. Experts from all across 
North America came before us. Evidence was presented of some of 
the things being done. For instance in the United States young 
people were being invited to rock concerts but the admission was 
two empty packages of cigarettes. There was also evidence that 
there was advertising in children's comic books for cigarettes 
and anecdotal evidence that scantily clad women went to schools 
to hand out cigarettes to students, somehow to glamorize or to 
draw attention to tobacco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been no question for a very long time that the tobacco 
industry has recognized that if a person does not start smoking 
by age 19, it is very unlikely that person will ever be a smoker 
in adulthood.  Knowing that fact, it has been very clear to 
health care advocates that children, our youth, are the ones 
being targeted by the tobacco industry to try and sustain tobacco 
sales. It was no surprise to find out that there is hard evidence 
that this is the marketing strategy for the tobacco industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Friday, June 9 there was a Senate hearing on a Senate bill 
dealing with increasing the price of tobacco with the additional 
resources to be made available for use cessation programs et 
cetera.  It was interesting to find that the tobacco industry 
mysteriously has come on side after all that has gone on, and 
Canadians will know how much has gone on with regard to the 
tobacco industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have a situation where everyone knows that is exactly 
what has been happening.  There is no debate.  There is no 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised the issue with the minister and I raise it again 
tonight.  I think it is important that Canadians know that there 
is going to be a concerted effort to communicate with Canadian 
youth.  This issue is not a surprise to us. Obviously Health 
Canada has been working on this for some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to raise the question again tonight with the 
parliamentary secretary.  Could he help us to understand better 
how committed Health Canada is to addressing the issue of youth 
smoking?  Maybe he could share with us a couple of the ideas or 
strategies we have to ensure that we will not have a false start 
on a very important health initiative.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin my remarks by 
pointing out to our colleague from Mississauga South that Health 
Canada made a commitment to work with the provinces and 
territories, with health care professionals, young people and 
other key partners to prevent and reduce tobacco smoking in 
Canada, especially among young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have solid proof, taken from tobacco industry documents, 
that the industry's promotional activities were directed at 
young people, among others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's current initiative against smoking is a 
co-ordinated national strategy worth $100 million over several 
years and involving legislative, regulatory, statutory, 
preventive, anti smoking, protective and public education 
activities.  Young people are the primary target of this 
national initiative.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada made every possible effort to capture the 
imagination of young people and make wise use of the enormous 
influence of peers to help change young people's behaviour. The 
national advertising campaign really connected with young 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ads put together by young people clearly showed the toxic 
nature of nicotine, which creates a dependency and has serious 
consequences on health, including the loss of life. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999 Health Canada established a youth advisory committee to 
advise Health Canada on realistic and effective approaches to 
reduce youth smoking, empowering youth to return to their own 
communities to initiate and participate in tobacco control 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, Health Canada has made available on its website the 
quit for life teen cessation program.  By addressing their unique 
needs and issues, it provides teens with useful information and 
tools to help them quit. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past year, Health Canada developed new labelling 
regulations that were just recently adopted. The new labels 
include graphic pictures, warnings about health and also 
information inserts. These labels were largely tested with young 
people to ensure they have the expected impact. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key element of any comprehensive tobacco control strategy is 
price.  Health Canada is committed to working with the Department 
of Finance and others to increase tobacco taxes as a means of 
reducing tobacco use in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we must continue to work together to protect 
young Canadians from this threat.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise to follow up on a question put to the Minister of 
Transport on May 30.  I reflected on some words the minister used 
in a committee meeting that afternoon which put into question the 
future of the airports in New Brunswick, Saint John airport, 
Fredericton airport and Moncton airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All three airports are having a difficult time maintaining 
viability because of a convergence of two government policies. 
One is the divestiture policy which divested the Department of 
Transport of these three airports and put responsibility for them 
to the communities.  The other one is the merger of the airlines. 
These two policies are starting to cause a great deal of 
difficulty for the airports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his comments the minister seemed to indicate that the future 
of these airports was at question.  When I asked him about this 
he did not do anything to alleviate anyone's concern.  He said 
the marketplace will determine which local airport authorities 
and which airports have the best means of serving the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say that in reference to airports in New 
Brunswick, the people of New Brunswick will make accommodations 
and sacrifices in the same way they do in Ontario in using their 
airports.  He then went on to say there is no pretence at all 
that those airports should disappear. The question is not whether 
they should disappear.  The question is will they survive? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Department of Transport and the Minister of Transport 
ensure that these three longstanding airports survive and are 
viable, and continue to serve the people in the communities of 
Fredericton, Saint John and Moncton? Will the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Transport absolutely ensure the 
survival and prosperity of the airports in Saint John, 
Fredericton and Moncton? 
<P><A NAME="LINK292"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Transport, I would like to tell our 
colleague from Cumberland—Colchester that Saint John, 
Fredericton and Moncton airports in New Brunswick are part of the 
national system of airports established with the announcement of 
the national airports policy in 1994. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This system consists of 26 airports, which handle approximately 
94% of all passenger traffic and connect the country from coast 
to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government promised to ensure the continued 
operation of airports in this system.  To that end, the federal 
government has retained ownership of 22 of the 26 airports in 
the national system of airports, which were transferred to local 
interests under 60-year leases. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same long term lease will be used to transfer the four 
remaining national airports system airports, including 
Fredericton, which the federal government continues to operate as 
part of the national system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Transport is administering these leases in 
consultation with the various airport operators.  This will 
ensure the national airport system operates effectively and 
remains a vital effective component of the transportation 
infrastructure in this country. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transfer of control over airports in the national airport 
system to local interests will also make it possible for 
decisions taken by airport operators to reflect the interests 
and priorities of the areas they serve, in addition to the fact 
that these airports will continue to belong to the national 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These airports are thus making a very important contribution to 
the prosperity of the areas served. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The motion to 
adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 
a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 10.25 p.m.)
