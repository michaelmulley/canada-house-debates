	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government for its neglect of Labrador, and for 
refusing to resolve the injustice of the Churchill Falls hydro contract, thus 
perpetuating interprovincial trade barriers and denying the residents of 
Labrador the right to enjoy the benefits of their own natural resources.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to lead off the debate on 
what I think is an often neglected subject in the House of 
Commons. Labrador is a region of the country that is the news for 
its natural resources and for its natural beauty. It is something we 
appreciate as part of Canada. However, it is an area that is taken for 
granted and has been taken advantage of for years.
<P>
	It is time to address some of those issues in this debate. I hope 
that during the discussion we will be able to decide how we can 
better appreciate the assets of Labrador and correct some of the 
wrongs that have been perpetrated on the region in the past.
<P>
	Yesterday during question period we discussed how a contract 
was awarded in Atlantic Canada but was taken away from a Halifax 
firm and awarded to someone in another province. Atlantic 
Canadians, and in particular Labradorians, feel that has happened 
far too often.
<P>
	The Churchill Falls contract has been a severe irritant to the 
people in Labrador since it was signed 25 or 26 years ago. The 
contract forces Labrador and Newfoundland to sell its power to 
Quebec, which in turn sells it to the Americans. The price is jacked 
up 25-fold and Quebec reaps the benefits of a deal that pays almost 
no return to the people of Labrador.
<P>
	The people of Labrador deserve much better than this. For 25 
years they have sent off their electricity, specifically, and in return 
have received almost no benefits. They have had almost no 
infrastructure  spending in their region. They do not have a 
passable highway through their region. They do not receive the tax 
benefits of a deal that is worth $800 million a year to Quebec.
<P>
	Every time a premier from Newfoundland says: ``We are going 
to renegotiate, we are going to be tough, we are going to force the 
federal government to use some of its powers'' nothing happens. 
This has been going on for a long time.
<P>
	Labradorians are going to make another choice in the next 
election about who will represent them best in the House of 
Commons. They will be looking to see how sincere the federal 
government is in addressing what has been, as we all know, an 
injustice to the people of Labrador.
<P>
	Recently we have been hearing more talk from the government 
side that it is working on an internal trade agreement that will help 
the free flow of goods between provinces, including trade in 
electricity. Two years ago it came forward with a trade agreement 
that would break down the internal barriers to trade. However, the 
energy chapter is missing. It said not to worry, that by July of last 
year it would have the energy chapter all intact. That did not 
happen.
<P>
	By September of last year a government spokesman said: ``Now 
we will have the contract'' but again it was not signed. In other 
words, the federal government does not seem to be able to 
understand that an internal trade barrier called Churchill Falls is 
holding up the entire internal trade agreement. It seems unwilling 
to exercise its powers and influence to strike that trading barrier 
down. During the day other speakers will be elaborating on specific 
points.
<P>
	I would like to emphasize that although there is much the federal 
government can do to address this wrong, some of the feel good 
messages being sent out by the new Quebec premier about how he 
wants to get along with people, mend fences and so on, it would be 
a good time for him to express some of those feelings of goodwill 
in striking a new agreement with Labrador on Churchill Falls.
<P>
	It is not enough to say we would like to get along. If something is 
unjust and we know it is unjust, then it needs to be addressed. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="750"> 750 </A></B>
<P>
would hope that the new Quebec premier will take the opportunity 
during these negotiations on the internal trade agreement to fix 
what  is an absolute injustice to Labrador and renegotiate that 
contract.
<P>
	In 1969 Newfoundland signed a deal that sold power from 
Churchill Falls to Quebec for 65 years. Newfoundland signed this 
deal for two reasons. First, there was an energy glut at the time. It 
was before the rise of OPEC, the rise in the cost of energy generally 
in the world.
<P>
	Second, Quebec frankly refused to allow Newfoundland to build 
transmission lines on its soil in order to transmit that electricity to 
the New England states where it was to be sold. In essence 
Newfoundland had to sign the deal. There is a contract, there is a 
deal and that cannot be denied.
<P>
	The deal is so bad and so unjust that it is time not only the 
Quebec government, but the federal government, waded into this 
fray and said this is so wrong and it needs to be addressed.
<P>
<B>(1010 )</B>
<P>
	Labrador has no access by land to the rest of North America 
except through Quebec. Quebec at the time had Labrador over a 
barrel. Labrador and Newfoundland signed. I wonder where the 
federal government was at the time. It was an unjust deal. Trudeau 
refused to deal with it. Clark refused to deal with it. Turner did not 
deal with it. Mulroney would not deal with it. The current 
government seems content to talk about it some more. It is talking 
and it urges us to be patient.
<P>
	The people in Labrador are tired of being patient. When does the 
deal expire? It does not expire for another 45 years. For 45 more 
years the people in Labrador are expected to sell their power at one 
twenty-fifth of the going rate. Twenty years from now there is a 
renegotiation clause and the rate will drop again. Labrador will get 
even less money. It is so unjust that it has to be remedied.
<P>
	Quebec has an opportunity to show its good faith and willingness 
to negotiate. The premier of Quebec says he wants good relations 
as a sovereign nation. It would be a good step for him to renegotiate 
a contract that is obviously unjust. At the end of this contract in 
2041 Labrador will have transferred almost $50 billion to Quebec 
under this contract. That is $800 million to $1 billion a year. I 
understand that Quebec signed in good faith at the time but they 
need now to address an injustice.
<P>
	The federal government can do something. It could not break the 
contract, of course. However, it could regulate interprovincial 
trade. This is one of the powers that should be enhanced as we 
reconfigure Confederation. Many things should be transferred to 
the provinces. This is what the Reform Party has said time and time 
again. We should allow the provinces, Quebec, Labrador and 
Newfoundland, all the provinces to benefit from their own natural 
resources. We should transfer many of the  responsibilities to the 
provinces. I think that realignment of powers is a good sign.
<P>
	One of the things the federal government should do is strengthen 
its power to regulate and to strike down interprovincial trade 
barriers. Those barriers cost Canadians between $3 billion and $5 
billion a year. The first thing we must do is strike down those 
barriers if we are to have a free trade agreement that works in North 
America and the world.
<P>
	In July of 1975 the minister of energy, Alastair Gillespie, said in 
a speech in Labrador that he favoured the use of the BNA act to 
declare hydro lines to be under federal jurisdiction so that they 
could be built across provinces.
<P>
	In the west we do not deal much in the transfer of electrical 
energy, although certainly it is transferred without interest. 
However oil and gas products are transferred across provinces 
without an $800 million a year transfer in western Canada.
<P>
	In 1976 the member for Grand Falls-White Bay-Labrador, 
Bill Rompkey, now a senator, and the person whose seat in 
Labrador is now vacant because he has been bumped up to la-la 
land in the other place, asked this of the minister of industry.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-is the Minister now optimistic that hydro resources in Labrador can be 
developed for the benefit of the Atlantic region, and will he ensure that the full 
force of his office, and indeed the Government of Canada is used to bring this 
about?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Of course there was no answer from the government of the day. 
Mr. Rompkey said he would talk about it and maybe someone 
would fix it some day. Here we are 20 years later asking a Liberal 
federal government about Mr. Rompkey's comments. Is it willing 
to champion the cause of Labrador and make this deal and the 
future development of lower Churchill Falls an important issue for 
the federal government? It does not seem to be.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	It is interesting that other parties have made comments about 
this. In 1976 John Crosbie, the member for St. John's, said: ``The 
federal government has put us in the hands of Quebec''. To that a 
parliamentary secretary on the Liberal side responded: ``The 
government has a strong preference to explore the co-operative 
approach and to consider exercising constitutional leverage only as 
a last resort''. In other words, ``we would like to talk about it'', they 
said in 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979 and for the rest of time, ``and 
Labrador just has to be patient. You do not get a road. You do not 
get to develop your own assets. You do not get to benefit from 
future development''.
<P>
	People now in Labrador are saying: ``Are we even going to 
benefit from Voisey Bay? What do we do, just take it on the chin? 
You eliminate our fish stocks. You take away our way of living. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="751"> 751 </A></B>
<P>
You take away our future  prospects for benefiting from our own 
natural resources''. It is a shame.
<P>
	In 1980 Mr. Trudeau, another well known Liberal, said: ``The 
federal government could act if two conditions were met: if 
Newfoundland had an actual contract to sell power and if Quebec 
charged too much to transfer that power to Newfoundland''. He 
said the federal government would act. He said an unreasonable 
charge would constitute a trade barrier.
<P>
	This places Labrador and Newfoundland in a catch-22. How can 
they enter into a contract when they cannot get permission to 
transfer their power? If they cannot get permission, how can they 
get a contract? If they cannot get a contract the feds say they will 
not act. There they are hung on the horns of a dilemma saying: ``We 
would like to develop something. We would like to put forward a 
proposal but we are not allowed to wheel our power through 
Quebec and we are not allowed to build transmission lines. What 
are we supposed to do?''
<P>
	The federal government should step in and say it wants to help 
Newfoundland and Labrador and it is willing to do it in a couple of 
ways. There are a couple of avenues for addressing this problem.
<P>
	The first thing the government could do is follow up on a 
recommendation by a federal government mandated group which 
tabled a report in 1988 called ``Energy and Canadians: Into the 21st 
Century'' which we are approaching. The section entitled ``Federal 
Government Role'' recommends:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The federal government should articulate the conditions under which one 
province has a right to access, on a business basis, another province's electricity 
corridor or electrical grid for the purpose of transmitting electricity to a market 
not adjacent to the first province.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In other words, in 1988 again it said: ``The federal government 
should set out the terms and conditions that we could transfer 
power from one region or one province through another province 
for sale''. The federal government should do that and that has been 
recommended by that government mandated group back in 1988, 
which again promised to do something about it.
<P>
	That is the first thing the government should do. It should state 
the right of provinces on interprovincial trade, that the right exists. 
The government should say it will happen, the right exists to 
transfer power on the electricity grid, to wheel power through 
another province for sale. The federal government should say that 
is part of its job and it will do it. It would not require legislation. It 
is a statement of policy. That is what we should at least be 
attempting, but the federal government is reluctant for some reason 
to even do that.
<P>
	If that is not enough the federal government could take another 
step. Several suggestions were made by the National Energy Board 
in a study in 1992. If people in Atlantic Canada could live on 
studies they would have a  very high standard of living. They have 
been studied to death and everyone tells them they all need help.
<P>
	The Inter-Utility Trade Review in 1992 suggested several 
amendments to the National Energy Board Act. One suggestion 
was to amend the act to give the NEB the power to open up 
Quebec's transmission lines to allow exports of electricity to other 
provinces and regions. We are not talking about expropriating any 
land from Quebec. We are talking about the opportunity to use the 
lines. Other provinces do it; why not through Quebec? The NEB act 
could be amended to do that.
<P>
	The same study talked about the huge benefits of that free trade 
in electricity; up to $3 billion a year Canadians would benefit from. 
Another NEB suggestion which can be used is that we can ask for a 
land corridor to build a new transmission line through another 
province. We have the power to do that. Section 58(4) of the 
National Energy Board Act says we can designate a corridor 
through Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1020 )</B>
<P>
	However, we have to do something because it has been talked 
about for 25 or 26 years with promises of more studies, talks and 
negotiations. If the people in Labrador and Newfoundland are told 
they have to pay 25 or 30 times more for the power to run their own 
homes and businesses than the selling price is for export, it is 
unacceptable. The people in Labrador deserve the right to develop 
and benefit from their own natural resources.
<P>
	If anything is to come out of the negotiations to settle what role 
each level of government has in the future of Canada, surely the 
people who should benefit from the natural resources should be in 
the province that owns the natural resources. Certainly Quebec 
would want and demand, and rightfully so, the control over its 
mining regulations and control over its own destiny when it comes 
to natural resources. B.C. demands the same thing. Labrador and 
Newfoundland demand it and should get no less. It is $800 million 
a year which is not going down the tubes but down the lines and the 
people are not getting the benefit of it.
<P>
	The people in Labrador have been taken for granted for too long. 
It is time the federal government stood up for them and said it will 
doing something, that it will articulate a policy to request that the 
internal trade barriers come down, that the people in Newfoundland 
benefit, that the people in Labrador get to develop their natural 
resources, that Voisey Bay will not be farmed out to Ontario or to 
another province, that Newfoundland and Labrador will have the 
electricity, power and access to the natural resources so that they 
can become a have province and not dependent on others for a 
federal transfer payment.
<P>
	If we were to move that way today and at least say that is to be 
the policy of the government and the thing we are striving for, we 
could send a message to the people in  Atlantic Canada that they are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="752"> 752 </A></B>
<P>
not there only for the votes come whatever, but that they are also 
there because they deserve the right, as Reform Party policy states, 
to develop their own natural resources.
<P>
	I hope the House will agree with me today. I anticipate and hope 
someone on the Liberal side has been studying this issue and will 
say more than we should talk, study and think about it, but that they 
are now ready to act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a certain amount of respect for the previous 
speaker, after working with him in the human rights committee. If I 
were a teacher and you were to ask me to assess how rigorous his 
arguments have been this morning, however, I would be forced to 
give him a big fat zero. Let me explain.
<P>
	What we are dealing with is a dispute between two self-managed 
crown corporations with their own administrative policies. An hon. 
member rose in the House this morning-and I think that this 
shows a lot of nerve, not to say chutzpa, even a little rudeness on 
the part of the Reform Party-to put forward an opposition motion 
urging the federal government to intervene in a dispute between 
two crown corporations.
<P>
	You may tell me: ``Yes, but a dispute is possible in relation to 
what is most sacred in law, namely a contract''. Anyone who went 
to university and took a few law courses knows that a contract is 
what binds the parties in a world where order, justice and equity 
mean something.
<P>
	How can the hon. member rise and ask the federal government to 
intervene in an area that is none of its business on the basis of a 
contract that was signed by what we can assume are two 
enlightened, knowledgeable parties and that runs until the year 
2031? How can the hon. member show so much disrespect for 
Quebec, its premier and its representatives by rising in this House 
and telling us that it is unfair?
<P>
	Through you, Mr. Speaker, I would ask the hon. member to pay a 
little more respect and remind him that, in our system, when people 
sign their names to a legal document called a contract, they are 
bound by it. If this means nothing to Reformers, it just goes to 
show that those people will never form the government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be interested to hear some of the 
speeches from the hon. member during this debate.
<P>
	It will come down to the position of the member.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	I am not disputing a contract exists. I have never said that. It has 
already been to the Supreme Court. The contract exists, but is it 
right? Would Quebec feel it is right? I do not think so.
<P>
	Quebec might say ``there was a contract and they got us over a 
barrel. We are taking power at one twenty-fifth of the going rate 
and for doing that we are netting $800 million to $1 billion a year. 
We have them by the shorts and for the next 35 or 45 years we will 
take the boots to them and say they signed so suffer and live with 
it''.
<P>
	I will ask the hon. member during the speeches that follow if it is 
just. It is not just. The member knows that. Nobody foresaw the 
OPEC situation; nobody saw the escalation in prices and demand. 
Because of this we have a deal which for the next 65 years will 
keep Labrador and Newfoundland in a have not position; three 
generations.
<P>
	We will allow that area to be depopulated. We will allow the 
people there to suffer the consequences because the deal gives us 
$1 billion a year. If a deal was signed that would last three 
generations to the effect that Quebec will take the shaft for the next 
65 years at $1 billion a year, would the member say c'est la vie, 
whatever? I hope he would be up saying Quebec is getting ripped 
off, that it is not fair and it is not just. If it is not just it needs to be 
addressed, which is what I hope the new premier of Quebec will do, 
address an injustice, something that is not fair.
<P>
	On the legality of the contract, by all means I know it is legal. If 
by the contract they want to let someone suffer, if they think that is 
fair, they can do it. I hope they would not. That is one issue.
<P>
	The other issue is what is the position of the Quebec government 
on a land corridor for transferring other power from the lower 
Churchill Falls site? What is its position on the fact that one should 
be allowed to wield power through the province of Quebec as is 
done in all other provinces? It is now becoming a North American 
grid. I hope it would say: ``By all means, if you develop Lower 
Churchill in the years to come you can have either access, a land 
corridor to transfer that power, or you can have access to our own 
existing hydro lines to wield the power as we do through all other 
regions and areas in North America''.
<P>
	There are two issues. Is it just? It is not just. That should be 
addressed and corrected. More important, ``We will not let this 
continue. We will give you access to our lines and we will give you 
access to if not that at least a land corridor, something so you can 
benefit from Voisey Bay mineral deposits with the smelter that will 
come. We will not make you suffer any longer''. That is what is 
will come down to.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the debate on the Churchill  Falls contract has been in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="753"> 753 </A></B>
<P>
House many times. I put the emphasis on timing because this has 
been given a thorough contract and has gone all the way to the 
Supreme Court of Canada which ruled that it was a binding 
contract.
<P>
	It is the nature of the Reform Party's presentation that concerns 
me. Reformers came here saying they would do business 
differently, that they would play. The only reason they are here 
today is there is a byelection in Labrador. That is the only reason 
they would ever bring this forward. They cannot hide behind 
something like that.
<P>
	We hear the praises that they will pave their roads. Those poor 
people are being taken down the garden path that you will fix the 
Churchill Falls agreement. Again, that is something you cannot 
deliver on.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Would the hon. member please address 
his remarks through the Chair and remember that from now on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richardson:</B> Do you think-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> This is the second time. The member is a 
parliamentary secretary now. I ask the member to obey this rule in 
the House and put his remarks through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richardson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I should know better.
<P>
<B>(1030 )</B>
<P>
	I wonder if the party opposite understands that this is an issue 
which has been given thorough examination by the House and by 
the Supreme Court. Even though on the surface it looks like it is a 
bad contract-and it is a bad contract in my mind-it is a valid 
contract. When a contract is valid the parties have to live with it, 
unless one side is prepared to acquiesce and say it thinks it is bad 
and it would like to amend it. That is the only way the contract can 
be changed.
<P>
	Does the hon. member know of another method?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that the Liberals say we 
are not a national party because we do not have any members of 
Parliament from Atlantic Canada. We are definitely trying to be a 
party from coast to coast. We are running candidates all over the 
place. We are running in all the byelections.
<P>
	When we do our job, when we are out there addressing issues 
from coast to coast, the member says that we should not be there. I 
do not know if he wants us to ignore it. I do not know what he 
expects. However, we are going to be there. We are not going to go 
away. We are going to be there in his face in the next election. He 
might as well get used to it because that is the political fact.
<P>
	We have never said that we should pave a road from one end of 
the riding to another. We have never said that a paved road is going 
to be practical. It is never going to  be practical to spend that kind 
of money. However, there could be a road that is at least 
serviceable, at least a gravel road, something the rest of us take for 
granted. They just tell people to take a skidoo and have a nice day. 
We could at least promise them not a paved road with shoulders but 
a gravel road that could be serviceable so that when the spring 
breakup comes they do not have to park their vehicles until July.
<P>
	I have already mentioned three things the government can do. 
First is on intent and policy. The internal trade agreement is being 
renegotiated. It has been two years since the energy chapter was 
promised and it has not been delivered. During the discussions on 
the energy chapter of the internal trade agreement the federal 
government could put its foot down and say it is going to break 
down the barriers to trade.
<P>
	Second, the government could instruct the National Energy 
Board to amend the act to allow access either through a land 
corridor or through a wheeling mechanism to allow electricity to be 
sold in other areas.
<P>
	Finally, we should allow Labrador in the very near future, as it 
develops Voisey Bay and the other rich mineral deposits that are 
going to pull that province up from a have not province to a have 
province, to have access to as much electricity and power as it 
needs so it can develop and benefit from its own natural resources 
in the years to come.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great enthusiasm that I participate in today's debate.
<P>
	I take great exception to the hon. member's motion. Historically 
the federal government has been a firm supporter of Newfoundland 
and Labrador and its economic pursuits. I might remind the House 
that it was a Liberal government that negotiated Newfoundland's 
entry to Canada.
<P>
	The Reform Party introduced today's motion because there is a 
byelection in Labrador and it hopes to gain votes by pretending to 
be a voice for the people of Labrador. The Reform Party took an 
interest in Labrador only after its member of Parliament, the hon. 
Bill Rompkey, moved to the Senate causing the byelection. There 
is no evidence that this issue was important to the Reform Party 
before that.
<P>
	The Reform Party election platform only makes reference to the 
revenue from hydroelectric projects in relation to equalization. It 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Reform Party supports the inclusion of economic rents from 
hydroelectric activities in the public revenue of all provinces for the purpose of 
calculating the size of federal-provincial transfer payments.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In general, the Reform Party supports energy policies based on 
market mechanisms with no government involvement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="754"> 754 </A></B>
<P>
	What makes the Reform Party think it will be able to find a 
new resolution to this longstanding issue which has been debated 
by experts for years and heard by the courts?
<P>
	The Reform Party, which it says is a strong supporter of free 
enterprise, is questioning a contract which has been ruled valid by 
the Supreme Court. By raising this issue the Reform Party may be 
trying to mask its extreme right wing economic agenda which is 
not attractive to the voters of Labrador.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	The Reform Party plans to turn programs such as employment 
insurance and the Canada Pension Plan into personalized savings 
accounts or private insurance. That will not find support among the 
workers in Labrador. The Reform's opposition to any active role by 
governments in economic development and creating new 
employment opportunities would indeed hurt the workers of 
Labrador.
<P>
	The Reform Party avoids telling the voters of Labrador about its 
opposition to regional development programs. It thinks that 
regional development spending in Atlantic Canada has been a 
failure and Reform would slash programs and eliminate subsidies. 
The hon. member for Capilano-Howe Sound sums up what his 
party thinks about Atlantic Canadians and regional development by 
saying: ``We do not give money to our children after a certain stage 
because we know if we keep giving them money they will never 
become independent. Sometimes the best things we can do for our 
children is say no''.
<P>
	Another Reform member of Parliament in his determination to 
uncover failed attempts at regional development by ACOA 
resorted to exaggeration to try to make his point. The member 
attacked ACOA for giving $22,323 to a food research centre at the 
University of Moncton for a study to develop blueberry jelly for 
Mega Bleu, a company in Tracadie, New Brunswick. In fact, 
ACOA had only granted $6,000 and would increase the amount 
only if the company decided to market its product. Moreover the 
money was not for jelly but for blueberry products.
<P>
	The same Reform MP told Nova Scotians he would run there in 
the next election. When asked about this by a newspaper in his 
riding in British Columbia, he said: ``I was trying to be nice 
because I knew it would be in the Atlantic Canadian papers. I did 
not want to say: Who the hell would want to run there?'' That is a 
quote from the Halifax <I>Chronicle Herald</I> of September 22, 1995.
<P>
	I remind all members of the House that this federal government 
has a long history of partnership and co-operation with all the 
provinces and territories. In no way would this government hinder 
responsible resource development in Newfoundland and Labrador. 
It has a solid record of working with that province to resolve  
outstanding issues and dismantle barricades to resource 
development.
<P>
	For example, I look at how the federal government is working 
with Newfoundland and Labrador and other stakeholders to resolve 
issues surrounding mineral development in Voisey Bay. For more 
than three decades the federal government has been working with 
Newfoundland and Labrador on the development of its 
hydroelectric resources. I can cite countless examples of federal 
support to my province. Recent examples include the Hibernia 
development project. We are encouraged with the progress that is 
being made in connection with the Terra Nova project.
<P>
	We should establish at the outset that the rights of the provinces 
in the area of natural resources are clearly set out in the 1982 
amendment to the Constitution Act, 1867. Those rights are exactly 
the same for every province.
<P>
	The province of Newfoundland and Labrador has the complete 
right to enjoy its own natural resources. It further has the right to 
control the development of these resources and any benefits from 
financial gains by way of royalties and taxes. The same is true 
again for all provinces.
<P>
	All crown lands within Newfoundland are owned by the 
province of Newfoundland. These ownership rights give the 
province the right to royalties from mineral developments such as 
in Voisey Bay, as well as for all oil and gas development within the 
province's boundaries. The province also has the right to royalties 
from offshore oil and gas development such as Hibernia. The same 
would be true for any other similar projects brought on line.
<P>
	These rights are clearly set out under the legislation and are 
further guaranteed under a number of co-operative agreements 
between the federal government and the province of Newfoundland 
and Labrador.
<P>
	That ownership of crown lands also gives the province the right 
to control the development of forestry resources. That right has 
allowed Newfoundland to develop and maintain a sustainable 
forest resource.
<P>
	The ownership of crown lands is only one way in which 
Newfoundland has the right to benefit from its natural resources. 
There are many other ways which are equally important. The 
province of Newfoundland and Labrador has the constitutional 
authority to legislate natural resource related works and 
undertakings within its boundaries. That constitutional 
responsibility also gives the province jurisdiction over the 
generation and distribution of electricity.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	I mentioned the amendment to the Constitution Act which 
clarifies the rights of provinces to control their own natural 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="755"> 755 </A></B>
<P>
resources. The amendment deals with  provincial rights concerning 
non-renewable natural resources and it includes forestry resources 
and electricity. The amendment states that provinces can make 
laws regarding the exploration for natural resources. Again, all 
provinces have this right, including Newfoundland.
<P>
	The provinces may further pass laws covering the development, 
conservation and management of non-renewable resources as well 
as forestry. Again all provinces have the right to make laws 
concerning the generation and production of electricity including 
everything from development to conservation to the management 
of the sites and facilities. In addition, Newfoundland and all other 
provinces have the constitutional right to pass laws regarding the 
export of electricity. They can pass legislation covering the 
taxation of electrical generating facilities.
<P>
	Some members may feel these rights should be changed, 
expanded or perhaps cutback. My own view is that they represent a 
reasonable and fair allocation of authority. These rights are clearly 
outlined and equally applied. I cannot see how these rights have in 
any way been denied to Newfoundland or any other province.
<P>
	Newfoundland has constitutional control of its natural resources 
as do all other provinces. It is Newfoundland that decided how 
those natural resources would be developed, how they would be 
conserved and it is Newfoundland that will decide what the best 
advantage is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I have just listened to an astounding speech. I cannot believe that a 
member from Newfoundland would take the stance that it is okay 
to hold her constituents' heads under water while their pockets 
were being picked.
<P>
	The member did not address the motion in any way that I could 
understand. Does the hon. member agree that Newfoundlanders 
should bear the brunt of this injustice over the next 45 years? 
Should her constituents do without the benefit of the resources that 
will help them build their economy, give them jobs, put their 
children in schools, put money on the table, give them 
independence? Who does the member represent? Does she 
represent her constituents or does she represent the Liberal Party in 
this Parliament?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Payne:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do represent my constituents and I 
do represent the province of Newfoundland. I am very glad to be 
able to do that.
<P>
	I do not concur with breaking a legitimate agreement that was 
put in place and which has gone through the courts and has been 
ruled as a legal and binding agreement. Another member of the 
third party was asked earlier what he would do to renegotiate the 
agreement. He was unable to provide an answer. Does the hon. 
member have any suggestions as to how to renegotiate this?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> Mr. Speaker, inasmuch as I was asked the 
question, I would be happy to respond. I am going to respond very 
briefly because I will have the opportunity to deal with it in detail 
in my speech.
<P>
	When the member says the hon. member for Fraser Valley East 
did not offer any suggestions, that is entirely inaccurate. She is 
correct when she says that there is a legitimate contract. The 
Supreme Court has even ruled on that. What she does not say is that 
there are other avenues the federal government could take to 
relieve Newfoundland of this burden. The member does not speak 
of those but the hon. member for Fraser Valley East certainly did 
and I will be referring to them later in my speech.

<B>(1045)</B>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
why is this motion being put forward today? Why waste the time of 
this House again when we have already wasted two consecutive 
days this week? The motion reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government for its neglect of Labrador, and for 
refusing to resolve the injustice of the Churchill Falls Hydro Contract-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	And so on. The motion talks about injustice. But as far as I am 
concerned, the Reformers do not know the meaning of the word 
``injustice''. In a moment, I will give them a brief history of these 
contracts which, as my hon. colleague from Newfoundland said 
earlier, were entered into in good faith.
<P>
	Why is this motion before the House today? It is a matter of 
political expediency for the Reform Party, and that is cheap. You all 
know as well as I do that a number of byelections are coming up. 
Had they not been motivated by these byelections, I hope that they 
would have chosen a different topic for this opposition day.
<P>
	You know that the unemployed are worried. In my riding, 5,000 
of the 6,500 residents of a small town took to the streets. Not all 
demonstrators were from Amqui of course. Some of them came 
from outside of town to show support.
<P>
	We are going to debate this motion here, while jobless people are 
in the street. Nice doing. Even at the political level, I am sure that 
putting this motion before the House and condemning this 
government will not do much to help the people of Labrador. When 
I first came to this House, two years or two and a half years ago, it 
thought that the Liberal government was extremely centralizing 
and was under the impression that the Reform Party was a tad more 
understanding toward the provinces.
<P>
	Today, I realize that the Reformers are worse than the Liberals. 
They are in fact asking the government to meddle in the provinces' 
affairs on the pretext of resolving an injustice. I should remind the 
hon. member  from the Reform Party that his party's position is to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="756"> 756 </A></B>
<P>
the effect that the provinces should enter into agreements between 
themselves and increase interprovincial trade as much as possible.
<P>
	Here is what a document, released by that party in January 1996, 
says: The Reform Party's vision of a new Confederation is that of a 
Canada in full expansion, that of a stronger and more creative 
country-how nice-which is as rich, as prosperous and as varied 
as our land. Our vision rejects the overcentralization of powers in 
the hands of a few, while insisting on the numerous benefits of a 
more equitable distribution of powers everywhere in the country 
and to the provinces.
<P>
	Does the hon. member not agree with his party's proposals? Is he 
telling us that his party's vision is only for election purposes, and 
that if the Reform Party ever becomes the government, which 
would be a tragedy, it would be much more centralizing than the 
current government? And Heaven knows that the government 
opposite is very centralizing. Imagine the worst.
<P>
	I would like to give a brief historical outline. I could go back to 
George V, but I will start in 1963. At that time, Hydro-Quebec said 
that it was prepared to buy all the electric power produced at 
Churchill Falls, provided it could sell its surplus to Ontario.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	Negotiations got under way in 1963, but the parties could not 
agree on production costs and on a price per kilowatt-hour. Three 
years later, in 1966, Hydro-Quebec again offered to buy the energy 
produced at Churchill Falls and, this time, accepted to pay the 
asking price.
<P>
	As you can see, the contracts were not entered into lightly. It 
took three years of negotiating before finally reaching an 
agreement, in 1966. Daniel Johnson senior was somewhat reluctant 
to sign the deal, and rightly so, because he feared that the 
agreement might be interpreted as a tacit approval of a 1927 Privy 
Council decision regarding the border between Quebec and 
Newfoundland, following which Labrador became part of 
Newfoundland. You are all aware of that dispute.
<P>
	Finally, on October 30, 1966, Johnson endorsed the 
Hydro-Quebec proposal, taking pains to make it clear his 
authorization was not of a Newfoundland-Quebec agreement but 
rather of one between Hydro-Quebec and the Churchill Falls and 
Labrador Co., alias CFLCO.
<P>
	Six years after negotiations began, on March 12, 1969, the 
contract was signed, for the term that has just been referred to: 65 
years. It stipulated that Hydro-Quebec would receive 5,225 
megawatts from Churchill Falls. Another 300 of the megawatts 
produced at the Falls would be reserved for the Newfoundland 
companies.
<P>
	The contract was not a one way negotiation; the two parties held 
discussions for years and this was the conclusion they both 
reached. In exchange,  Hydro-Quebec accepted the bulk of the 
financial risks associated with the project, assuming a portion of 
the eventual expenditure outlay. It also contributed its technology 
in the area of high voltage transmission lines. At that time, this was 
what Newfoundland needed. We should note that the Smallwood 
government of Newfoundland approved and signed the contract. It 
bears the signature of the premier himself.
<P>
	In 1974, Newfoundland nationalized CFLCO and, in 1984, as 
has been said, the Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision-which 
is rather rare-in favour of Quebec, rejected Newfoundland's 1980 
request to break the contract between CFLCO and Hydro-Quebec. 
In 1988, another Supreme Court decision confirmed the primacy of 
the contract signed in 1969.
<P>
	The Reform Party has a lot of nerve terming this an injustice. 
The contract was the result of years of negotiations, and both 
parties were satisfied with its terms, as well they should. My hon. 
colleague should keep in mind that all of the provinces in this 
country sign trade agreements and have met on several occasions 
recently to try to lessen internal trade barriers.
<P>
	Increasingly there are agreements with Ontario, with New 
Brunswick, with the Maritimes, that do not involve the federal 
government. We want to see more of this. It is far easier for 
provinces to reach agreements between themselves than with the 
federal government. This is why we are anxious for sovereignty, so 
that we can negotiate with Canada as well, for that will lead to 
agreements and to our being heeded more than in the past.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	It is not up to the federal parliament to dictate the behaviour of 
these two provinces in an area that comes under provincial 
jurisdiction exclusively according to the British North America 
Act. The government's intereference in an agreement reached 
between two provinces strikes me as totally unacceptable. I hope 
the government shares my view.
<P>
	My colleagues from the Reform Party, who don the garb of 
ardent defenders of federalism for a day, should understand that 
provincial relations is a matter for the provinces. I am still 
surprised that my colleague has tabled this motion in the House.
<P>
	The members of the Reform Party are always calling for 
decentralization and returning matters to the provinces, and yet, 
today, they are playing petty, second rate politics with this motion. 
They think they will earn votes in Labrador by defending the 
people there and claiming an injustice has been done.
<P>
	In other words, we Quebecers are penalizing the people of 
Labrador, because a contract was properly signed. Even the 
Supreme Court says this contract is valid and meets the required 
standards, and must therefore be adhered to.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="757"> 757 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to ask the Reform Party to withdraw the word 
``injustice'', because it is not injustice that Quebec is creating. We 
even have agreements with Newfoundland on a number of matters. 
We have teachers working in Newfoundland, and relations are 
excellent.
<P>
	Certainly, the going gets a bit rougher when its premier, in his 
capacity as representative of all the people of Newfoundland, told 
us that the five little conditions we were looking for in the Meech 
Lake accord were not acceptable. At that point, on some issues it 
really hurt and it hurt a lot.
<P>
	However, as far as the contract is concerned, it was signed by 
two firms, not the government, and it is valid. There is no injustice, 
and it takes a lot of nerve to call the contract unjust.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleagues, it being 11 o'clock, we will 
now proceed to statements by members.

	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at the same time that Atlantic Canada's marine fishery 
continues to decline, world aquaculture production is expanding. In 
fact, it will account for 25 per cent of the total global fish harvest 
by the turn of the century.
<P>
	I am proud to announce an important initiative in the Atlantic 
aquaculture industry. Recently at the Nova Scotia Agriculture 
College in Truro I had the pleasure of announcing a Bachelor of 
Science degree program in aquaculture. This program was made 
possible by more than $1 million in funding from Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities.
<P>
	The aquaculture science degree program will provide our youth 
with the opportunity to train in a sector where there is tremendous 
potential for economic growth.
<P>
	The University of British Columbia and now the Nova Scotia 
Agriculture College in Truro are the only two degree granting 
programs in aquaculture in Canada. With the huge coastline of the

educate our youth for future jobs in fish farming.

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister displayed amazing ignorance about how jobs are 
created when he said a few weeks ago that it is now up to business 
to spend money to create jobs.
<P>
	How would the Prime Minister like it if he had a GIC paying 6 
per cent interest but at year's end the bank sent a letter saying sorry, 
it created unnecessary jobs with the interest it was supposed to pay 
him, so there is no return on the investment? That is exactly what 
he is asking business to do, to create unnecessary jobs at the 
expense of its investment returns.
<P>
	Businesses will create jobs when it is in their interests to do so, 
when they need more employees. Business has told the government 
how that can happen. Stop the deficit financing. Start running 
surpluses so that taxes can be reduced.
<P>
	With more money in the pockets of consumers demand will 
increase and companies will need lots more employees. It is not a 
hard concept to grasp.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister truly wants to help create jobs, budget 
surpluses and tax reductions are all it takes.

development policy implemented by the municipal council of 
Bromptonville, in the Quebec riding of Richmond-Wolfe.
<P>
	A few years ago, the Bromptonville municipal council, headed 
by mayor Clément Nault, decided it would try to attract businesses 
to the region. Its initiatives took off and continue to be very 
profitable. Among other things, it developed an industrial park, 
which, with the large demand from these businesses for rental 
space, has grown steadily from the outset.
<P>
	In addition, the Kruger paper company recently decided to build 
a $20 million electric power plant at its Bromptonville factory, and 
a few days ago announced that it had selected Bromptonville as the 
site for a $325 million glazed paper plant.

Shakespearian Festival.
<P>
	I note the important contribution that French Canadians have 
made to this success story. While the Stratford Festival is known as 
North American's foremost English speaking repertory theatre, this 
title does not reveal the whole truth.
<P>
	It is a proud fact that the festival's success has come in large part 
from the dedication and skills of the theatre's French Canadian 
cast, crew and management.
<P>
	Richard Monette, Berthold Carrière, Jean Gascon and Denise 
Pelletier are just a few of those Canadians with francophone 
backgrounds who have given so much of themselves to make the 
Stratford Festival what it is today. The festival is just one of many 
examples across Canada in which individuals from every culture

than anyone ever thought. Talk about throwing money down the

<P>
	Their infrastructure program was supposed to rebuild sewers, 
but they spent it on boccie ball courts. Instead of showing some 
leadership, instead of showing the people with the highest cancer 
rate in North America how much they care, they back away.
<P>
	There is a recurrent theme here. When it comes to pouring 
money down sewers, the government is number one. No matter 
how much perfume it splashes on it, the vile odour of truth remains.

<P>
	The government has declared it will stop dredging the Athabasca 
River this fall. This historic trade route links the city of Fort

road is completed. I and my constituents do not understand why 
this road is proposed to the east end of the lake when a seasonal 
road already exists to the west end of the lake.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCEREFORM">UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE REFORM</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in their brief yesterday to the human resources 
development committee, the Fédération des femmes du Québec 
stated that fewer and fewer women will be eligible for maternity 
benefits because of the unemployment insurance reform. The 
Liberal MPs on the committee were, moreover, unable to disprove 
the federation's statement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="761"> 761 </A></B>
<P>
	Does the Minister of Human Resources Development realize 
that, by setting a minimum number of hours worked ranging from 
420 to 700 hours, he will be preventing a considerable number 
of women from drawing maternity benefits?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, this question being raised by the 
House leader of the official opposition is indeed a very important 
one. It is true that the changes proposed in Bill C-12 would impact 
upon women, as the hon. member says. This is one of the very good 
reasons why we are in the process of examining the bill in 
committee, and why we want to hear witnesses and to find out 
about problems such as this.
<P>
	I am sure the committee members from all parties will address 
the problem identified yesterday by the Fédération des femmes du 
Québec. I trust that here, as in other sectors, amendments will be 
proposed to improve or totally eliminate the problem referred to by 
the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister can count on the official opposition to bring 
in such amendments, and I trust we can count on the minister to 
support them. This is not the only area in which there is a problem. 
Women will be penalized, not only by maternity benefit 
restrictions, but also when they return to work if they opt to devote 
several years to rearing their children. Let us keep in mind that the 
minister intends to triple, from 300 to 910 hours, the minimum 
number of hours of work required for eligibility for benefits.
<P>
	I am asking the minister, who has announced major amendments 
and who again this morning has said he is open to certain 
amendments, whether he has looked at changing the rules proposed 
in his bill relating to people returning to the work force after more 
than three years, after having left to devote their time to rearing a 
child or for some other reason?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are trying to be as equitable 
as we can in addressing all of the questions that will be brought to 
the attention of the committee.
<P>
	In response to a comment by the House leader for the official 
opposition, we will look with great interest at any of the 
amendments brought forward by any of the political parties 
represented on the committee. Whether we can agree with them in 
totality we will have to wait and see. I am sure we will do the best 
we can.
<P>
	With respect to the re-entry qualifications I want to make it clear 
that they apply across the board to all new entrants or re-entrants. 
We will take into account any special circumstances. Again there I 
understand the honourable member's comment about the need for 
mothers to take extended periods of time to deal with the  rearing of 
their children. I expect the committee will be making suggestions 
and recommendations on this and a number of other areas.
<P>
	I am very pleased to see that members of the official opposition 
now recognize the value of having this piece of legislation 
considered by the committee. I am sure as time goes on, as was the 
case yesterday and as will be the case next week, there will be a lot 
of constructive suggestions made and we will deal with them.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	The one thing I would say we are totally committed to is the 
fiscal parameters that were set out for the overall EI reform. Within 
that restriction we are prepared to look at anything which will 
render the situation as equitable and as fair to women and 
everybody else who must have access to employment insurance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the minister is pleased with the possibility of 
amendments by the official opposition, I trust that he also realizes 
that, if the official opposition had not opposed the initial bill so 
strenuously, and if there had not been demonstrations across the 
country-which are still continuing-the government would 
perhaps not have acted and would perhaps not be considering 
changing the bill, which was unacceptable right from the start. As 
well as the professional agitators-
<P>
	In Quebec, women hold 68 per cent of the part time jobs. From 
now on, in order to be entitled to benefits, people will have to have 
worked between 420 and 700 hours, depending on the region. Does 
the minister realize that people who work 15 hours a week, the 
large majority of these women, would see the number of weeks 
they would have to work to draw benefits raised from 28 to 47 
weeks? This is often a problem for those with unstable 
employment, seasonal employment, and 68 per cent of such jobs 
are done by women.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, a large number of women, 
students, people everywhere in Canada working a few hours 
weekly, a few hours yearly, are not eligible at all for unemployment 
insurance benefits under the system as it now stands.
<P>
	There is no doubt that the matter of 15 hours needs looking at, 
for it is very important to understand that 15 is the total number of 
hours worked in a week required at the present time to be eligible 
for unemployment insurance.
<P>
	It would be necessary to know how many people, including 
women, work exactly 15 hours a week-not 14, not 16, not 18, not 
22-to find out exactly what the impacts will be. We are prepared 
to present all of the impact analyses once the committee has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="762"> 762 </A></B>
<P>
finished its work,  or even while they are still sitting, in order to try 
to assess the implications of this or that change.
<P>
	I trust that my hon. colleague recognizes that, by changing the 
system to start counting from the first hour worked for everyone, 
women included, we have taken a forward step. We have succeeded 
in protecting many people and I am prepared, in due time, and in 
committee, to see that my departmental employees present all 
possible data to ensure that everything is clarified. We will need to 
look at the impact on women, on those who have been excluded 
from the unemployment insurance system all these years because 
they did not have their 15 hours a week, in order to see whether 
where we are headed will be fair to women and to all who need 
access to the employment insurance program.

	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
also for the Minister of Human Resources Development. When 
asked in the House on Monday about employment assistance 
programs for students, the minister wrongly accused the official 
opposition of being out of touch with reality. Unfortunately for the 
minister, he was confronted the next day by students who 
reminding him of how precarious student life is and how 
ineffectual, indeed pathetic, government programs are. We now 
know who is out of touch with reality.
<P>
	Will the minister recognize that all the employment assistance 
programs for students in the world will never compensate for the 
hundreds of millions of dollars the government is going to cut from 
post-secondary education and for the increased tuition fees the cut 
will mean?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, this week I had the opportunity 
to meet with young people from across the country at Forum 
Canada. The hon. member's claim that I was confronted by young 
people who had raised the issues he intimates in his question is 
wrong.
<P>
	Just to let you know what is happening with the money made 
available for post-secondary institutions in this country, obviously 
we have jurisdiction-because the member and his party are 
always interested in jurisdiction. The provinces have jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	The money transferred by the Government of Canada is being 
used as well to fund certain provincial expenditures for 
post-secondary institutions.
<P>
	Tuition fees for universities, cegeps, community colleges and 
post-secondary institutions are set by the institution or by the 
government, depending on the system.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance announced in his budget last week that 
we were going to stabilize the amounts available to the provinces 
under the Canada social transfer.
<P>
	I hope we will all work together, as we did federally, by trying 
not only to provide the tools needed for young people to progress, 
but also the funds needed through job creation for students this 
summer to enable them to meet their objectives.
<P>
	To suggest that the Government of Canada is totally responsible 
for the situation in universities or post-secondary institutions 
across the country does not really indicate where the responsibility 
lies. It lies with the provinces, which have jurisdiction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister just 
talked about lowering transfer payments. We have some figures for 
him on the consequences for Quebec, in particular.
<P>
	While the federal government has cut more than $400 million in 
two years in transfer payments to Quebec for post-secondary 
education, it will allocate an additional $15 million only for 
summer jobs in Quebec.
<P>
	Will the minister acknowledge that the recent announcements 
are nothing more than window dressing hiding major cuts for 
students?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can have differences of 
opinion with representatives of various political parties on a 
number of issues. Surely one of the areas on which we will all find 
some common ground is that governments of all political stripes at 
all levels are faced with extremely difficult decisions.
<P>
	That is the situation in the province of Quebec today on a whole 
number of fronts that are entirely within the jurisdiction of the 
Government of Quebec. Although we have very serious and 
profound differences on a number of issues, the future of the 
country for example, one thing I do agree on with the premier of 
Quebec is the need for that government to take serious action to 
address its fiscal problems.
<P>
	It is simply not accurate to suggest that the Government of 
Canada is entirely responsible for the problems that exist with 
financing post-secondary institutions in Quebec. On the other hand 
when we announced we were doubling the amount of money 
available in Canada for summer student employment from $60 
million to $120 million and the portion going to Quebec would be 
$15 million, it recognized that we did understand the problem 
facing young people in Quebec and their need to find summer jobs.
<P>
	I did not suggest that the $120 million for summer employment 
for students was going to be a panacea for their need to find jobs. It 
is just part of the solution,  which will have to be met by other 
<P>

provinces, municipal governments, and particularly the private 
sector.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANARMEDFORCES">CANADIAN ARMED FORCES</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first it was a letter calling on soldiers in the Canadian Armed 
Forces to shift their allegiance to a Quebec army. Now it is high 
level negotiations and agreements between Quebec officers and the 
PQ government to establish a Quebec defence staff headquarters 
after a yes vote.
<P>
	This is a very serious matter. It strikes at the very integrity of the 
Canadian Armed Forces. What will the Minister of National 
Defence do to investigate the separatist attempt to destabilize the 
Canadian Armed Forces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I noted the 
comments of the hon. member from Charlesbourg which have been 
in the press. Certainly those kinds of allegations are quite serious. I 
agree with my friend opposite on the gravity of such an accusation.
<P>
	The chief of the defence staff has consulted with his predecessor, 
General de Chastelain, and other senior officers in the last number 
of hours. I can assure the House that there have been no plans 
drawn up. There have been no discussions authorized by the 
leadership of the Canadian Armed Forces for the eventual creation 
of two armed forces or the integration of a Quebec-Canada army. 
That would be totally inappropriate and unacceptable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am glad to hear that assurance from the minister.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	Is this the first time the minister has heard of these allegations 
that are being made about the interplay between the Bloc 
Quebecois, the Parti Quebecois and the Canadian Armed Forces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we should view 
this in perspective.
<P>
	During the referendum campaign there were lots of assertions 
and accusations made and a lot of emotional debate. The hon. 
member for Charlesbourg had sent a letter to certain officers in the 
province of Quebec. The matter was of such gravity that you, Mr. 
Speaker, ruled that the House debate a motion by a member of the 
Reform Party, my opposition critic. The matter is now before the 
House.
<P>
	Any accusations or suggestions made by the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg on the latest accusation or on the letter is something 
that has to be dealt with by the  committee. If the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg has any evidence to substantiate this kind of 
allegation, he has a duty as a member of this House to bring it 
forward to that committee so that it can be examined.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this goes beyond the allegations concerning the member for 
Charlesbourg. It goes beyond the matter that will be placed before 
the committee presumably next week. This is a very serious matter. 
I find the minister's answers to date unacceptable.
<P>
	The BQ letter and the PQ secret negotiations are exactly why we 
have been trying to open it up and get the government to discuss the 
terms of separation well in advance but it has chosen not to do that. 
That is precisely why we are in a problem right now. Before the 
final showdown with the Quebec separatists, the government 
cannot continue to sit on the fence; it has to come out.
<P>
	Will the minister make it perfectly crystal clear in whatever 
public domain to the Bloc Quebecois, to Lucien Bouchard and to 
every member of the Canadian Armed Forces that the Canadian 
forces are off limits in the debate on Quebec sovereignty?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member was a very distinguished general officer in the armed 
forces. He knows that the role of the Canadian Armed Forces is to 
support the duly elected Government of Canada and the 
Constitution of Canada. I am confident that the men and women of 
Canada's armed forces are doing exactly that.
<P>
	The burden of proof about any actions of members of the armed 
forces as alleged by the hon. member for Charlesbourg is on that 
member to come forward and give us that proof. Only at that time 
will we launch a greater investigation other than the one I have in a 
sense launched in the last number of hours with the chief of the 
defence staff who has assured me that these allegations are 
unfounded.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	In response to a question from the official opposition, the 
minister recognized and confirmed that several amendments to the 
UI program will result in greater numbers on the welfare rolls, 
since thousands of newly unemployed workers will no longer be 
eligible for UI benefits.
<P>
	Does the minister not find it scandalous that people who lose 
their jobs are forced to turn to a form of assistance of last resort, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="764"> 764 </A></B>
<P>
instead of receiving UI benefits  to which they have contributed and 
to which they are entitled?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I do not see how the hon. 
member can say that I agree with opposition members. This is not 
the case at all. What happens is that, with the legislation as it was 
proposed, the calculation is to be based on the number of 
accumulated hours.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	However, I think that, with the amendments that will be moved 
during the course of the legislative process, we will end up with a 
system whereby many part time workers will not have to turn to 
social assistance and will in fact be eligible for UI benefits. Some 
employers, for all sorts of reasons, provide less than 15 hours of 
work per week to their employees. These workers are currently not 
eligible for the UI program, or for other support programs that are 
in place to help the majority of Canadian workers.
<P>
	Hopefully, and contrary to what the hon. member implied, these 
amendments will reduce the number of people who have to turn to 
social assistance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister is well aware that, since new entrants will 
now have to work 910 hours instead of 300 to be eligible for UI 
benefits, these young people will be forced to turn to social 
assistance.
<P>
	Will the minister recognize that, in addition to being a terrible 
measure for the unemployed, this is a roundabout way of making 
the provinces pay part of the costs of the UI reform?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member and his 
colleagues are working very hard trying to create a situation. They 
talk about people who are going to go on social assistance. Then in 
the question the hon. member talks about new entrants onto the 
system.
<P>
	If a person is already connected to the unemployment insurance 
system then he is not not a new entrant unless he or she has been 
out of the system for a number of years. Then that person becomes 
a re-entrant.
<P>
	We are not advancing the quality of the debate or trying to deal 
with the problems facing real people by trying to raise all kinds of 
unnecessary concerns. The requirement for new entrants into the 
system is not based on just the 52 weeks of the calendar we have 
normally applied it to. They can actually bank the weeks, or hours 
as the case will be after January 1, 1997, from the previous year's 
work.
<P>
	If the hon. member wants to put forward his arguments in a place 
where we can sit down and look specifically at what he is proposing 
and what concerns  him and how we can respond to his questions, 
we will be happy to do that. However that is not the interest of the 
hon. member and his colleagues. They want to continue to provide 
ammunition to those who, for all kinds of other reasons than 
protecting those at the bottom end of the income scale, want to 
agitate and make even more anxious real families with real 
problems who want real solutions.

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the current environment minister was in 
charge of immigration, he apparently ordered up to 30,000 copies 
of a 25 page booklet telling Canadians what a wonderful job he was 
doing. However, when the new minister of immigration learned 
that this Liberal propaganda exercise was costing Canadian 
taxpayers $20,000 she immediately ordered the secret destruction 
of all copies.
<P>
	Can the parliamentary secretary explain how the government 
could spend $20,000 of taxpayers' money on producing partisan 
propaganda and then pay civil servants to destroy it?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the new 
minister for the department, the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration was within her right and it is her prerogative to refuse 
a document which was prepared by her predecessor which did not 
reflect her prospectus or her priorities for the Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration. Therefore, the document was not 
distributed and her staff took the appropriate action and means to 
have the document destroyed.
<P>
	As the new minister of the department it is her prerogative to 
decide what the priorities of the department are.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is reported that the new immigration minister 
turned to CSIS to destroy these potentially embarrassing 
documents. If this is true, it would be another example of CSIS 
involving itself in partisan politics by protecting the party in power.
<P>
	Before the solicitor general comments on these allegations, 
would he explain whether he has given any instruction to CSIS that 
it is no longer responsible for investigating threats to the security of 
Canada but rather that it is responsible for concentrating its efforts 
on investigating threats to the Liberal Party of Canada?
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I have been advised that the allegations made by the hon. member 
that CSIS was asked to destroy these documents and did so are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="765"> 765 </A></B>
<P>
totally  false. CSIS was not asked to destroy these documents and it 
did not destroy the documents.
<P>
	Furthermore, I am confident that CSIS is very well aware of its 
responsibilities under the law established by this Parliament and is 
carrying them out.

	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	Two Ontario women are currently challenging, in court, the 
parental leave provision of the unemployment insurance plan, 
which treats adoptive parents very differently from natural parents. 
There is a huge difference, in that adoptive parents are entitled to 
15 fewer weeks of leave.
<P>
	In light of the fact that the purpose of parental leave is to nurture 
the child, how can the minister explain this double standard for 
biological and adoptive parents?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a very difficult question. 
As the hon. member said, there is a matter before the courts so I do 
not want to specifically address that problem.
<P>
	This is a question that has to be dealt deal with in the most 
sensitive way possible. I have been informed of the decision to 
move in this direction and I have been trying to become better 
acquainted with the rationale behind it.
<P>
	On the question of maternity benefits, as the hon. member says it 
has the component of taking care of the child. It also has the very 
obvious and significant element of taking care of the natural 
mother as she goes through the process of childbirth.
<P>
	I understand the concerns raised by people who feel there should 
be as much opportunity as possible for nurturing a newborn child or 
a newly adopted child in those situations. However, it would seem 
to me, and there is no doubt of the decision of the government in 
terms of how to deal with this issue, that there were differences not 
in the needs of children to be cared for by their mothers for as long 
as possible, but in the difference between the situation faced by a 
natural mother in terms of her own physical capacity to deal with a 
birth as opposed to that of an adoptive mother dealing with an 
adopted child.
<P>
	I do not think there are ever any easy solutions to these 
questions. I hope my hon. colleague would understand there is at 
least that difference between the two situations of a natural mother 
and an adoptive mother, and the need to look at them somewhat 
differently.

	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, still on the subject of children's well-being, given that 
adequate child care can greatly improve their quality of life, could 
the minister explain to parents in Quebec and Canada what has 
become of the 150,000 new day care spaces his government has 
been promising for three years?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is always a timely topic. 
Before Christmas, the Government of Canada made a proposal to 
the provinces and territories, suggesting that a national day care 
system be established.
<P>
	It will come as no surprise to my hon. friend to learn that several 
provinces, including Quebec, have expressed serious reservations 
about the appropriateness of federal interference in an area of 
provincial jurisdiction. I agree with this reaction. What we are 
suggesting to our partners from all the provinces is that we need to 
sit down together and try to figure out how the Government of 
Canada could help resolve, at least in part, the problem raised by 
my hon. friend, while at the same time respecting the provinces' 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	In this context, I promise, not only the hon. member who asked 
the question, but also the representatives of all governments across 
the country, that we will do our best to fulfil the commitment made 
by the federal government in the throne speech not to interfere 
unilaterally, through its spending power, in an area of provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	We will nonetheless try to find, within these parameters, a way 
to co-operate with the provinces in order to help those who need the 
kind of support that a financial contribution to day care would 
provide.

made the announcement in a series of Canadian government 
announcements in support of the people of Haiti.
<P>
	The two projects announced yesterday will be implemented by 
two Canadian NGOs, CECI and CESO by name. They will be 
working in collaboration with Haitian non-government 
organizations.
<P>
	All of the funding is for the benefit of the people of Haiti, not for 
the people of Canada, whatever their origin, and certainly not for 
the personal benefit of the minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when a minister does not yet have a seat in the House of Commons, 
how convenient it is to spend money to buy a few votes in one 
region of his riding.
<P>
	Canadians are justifiably proud of their commitment to Haiti. 
We have sent many people to Haiti. We continue to send money. 
We want to help to restore democracy in Haiti.
<P>
	However, it is unconscionable that Pierre Pettigrew would funnel 
$3.8 million at this time, in the middle of a byelection, at a critical 
moment, in order to help himself in a byelection attempt.
<P>
	Does the minister personally condone spending money 10 days 
before a byelection in an obvious attempt to buy-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Even by the furthest stretch of the imagination, 
the question does not fall under the purview of the minister's 
administrative responsibilities. It is out of order.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the minister of Indian affairs.
<P>
	On February 28, the community of Kanesatake voted a 
resounding no to the following question: ``Do you want Jerry 
Peltier as grand chief and chief negotiator?'' Yet, the minister 
seems torn since Mr. Peltier wrote him that he wanted to remain as 
chief.
<P>
	Since the minister has long supported the principle of Native 
self-government, when will he recognize the Kanesatake 
community's inalienable right to choose its own leaders?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I responded to that question last 
week.
<P>
	That community had an election. We hired Coopers and Lybrand 
to oversee the election. The report was returned saying that it was a 
proper election of Jerry Peltier.
<P>
	The community had a meeting a few weeks ago and they now 
have a second chief. However, Mr. Peltier's term is for three years 
and he has not resigned. In the spirit of self-government, I am 
hoping the community will work itself through the process.
<P>
	On the upside, the difficulty in the community has not affected 
the fact that there are seven members on the council. Six are still 
there. The majority is still working.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	Why do Bloc members always pick on Jerry Peltier and the 
Mohawks? They are back to Mohawk bashing. Why do they not 
pay some attention to the Algonquins or the Abenakis? They do not 
have any interest north of here. It is always the Mohawks. Why? 
The Mohawks see through this party for what they are. They see 
them as ideologues and they will continue to ask these questions 
about the proud Mohawks.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I should point out to the minister that I am a member of 
the Bloc Quebecois and not the Reform Party, thank God.
<P>
	Does the minister not agree that, by continuing to protect former 
chief Jerry Peltier-who, may I remind you, used to work for his 
department-and by failing to acknowledge the February 28 vote, 
he is showing disrespect for the community of Kanesatake and 
treating all Native communities in Canada like children?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I face the separatists and the 
Bloc every day and I know they are very concerned about territorial 
integrity and the political position of the Mohawks.
<P>
	These are not my words, these are the words of Daniel Turp, the 
candidate for the Bloc in Papineau and the man who gives this 
party advice. He said: ``If Quebec were to object to sovereignty 
measures democratically approved, these native nations could 
undoubtedly claim that their democratic rights to 
self-determination and to secession have been violated''. This party 
is violating this.

	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister has just returned from Egypt after attending an 
international conference on terrorism. Would the secretary of state 
for Africa tell the House the outcome of the conference and what 
steps is Canada taking to ensure that the peace process is not 
hijacked by terrorism?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Secretary of State (Latin America

Egypt this week sent a very important message to the international 
community that collectively people, including those who 
historically were sometimes antagonists, can come together to 
confront terrorism, violence and the cowardice of that in our world 
community. It is an important message, particularly to the Middle 
East peace process, at this time.
<P>
	The summit was a very short process. There was agreement that 
a working group be formed. Canada will participate in that working 
group to find other ways in which the international community can 
improve its efforts and collaboration toward ending terrorism and 
violence around the world.

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Cornwallis Park Development Agency has some serious problems 
within it, not the least of which is political interference from the 
Liberal member for South West Nova.
<P>
	For example, Mark Phillips got a management job for $33,000 
and pocketed another $7,500 as a part time consultant. His 
qualifications were that of a cook and president of the Digby 
Liberal Association.
<P>
	My question is for the minister responsible for ACOA. Will the 
government disclose the criteria and qualifications for selecting the 
board of the Cornwallis Park Development Agency besides being 
Liberal, or do we have to dissect this whole operation piece by 
piece?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, in question period I try to give every 
latitude in the framing of questions. I would ask members to be 
very careful in the preamble.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	I have to wait until the end of the question to see if it is in order. 
That is what we are dealing with here. Sometimes in the questions 
and sometimes in the answers members are taking, in my view, a 
little bit of licence. I would ask them to please try to compact the 
preamble to  questions so the wait is not so long before I can 
intercede and make a decision.
<P>
	This question is in order and I will allow the solicitor general to 
respond if he wants to. I saw him on his feet.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> I will follow 
your admonition most closely, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I will say simply that I do not accept in any way what I consider 
to be the unwarranted insinuations and premise in the hon. 
member's question. I do not see why his question should start out 
with an unwarranted attack on a very distinguished and hard 
working member of this House.
<P>
	I will be happy to take these allegations, in spite of their 
unwarranted nature, and bring them to the attention of the minister 
responsible for ACOA. I understand the new agency is in place and 
its administration is being put in place in the proper way. I am sure 
the minister responsible for ACOA will have full answers when he 
is back in the House.
<P>
	In the meantime, I see no reason why the hon. member should 
make these unwarranted attacks on a very distinguished, 
hardworking and effective member of this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> I guess, Mr. 
Speaker, when you are dealing with facts, you are dealing with 
facts and I do not see them as unwarranted at all, having already 
undertaken an investigation.
<P>
	We have unsolicited bids, we have hiring of unqualified people 
and we have political patronage which are commonplace in this 
particular agency. The vultures have started picking at the carcass 
of a closed military base.
<P>
	Will the minister agree to a public inquiry of the Cornwallis Park 
Development Agency? If he will not, will he allow the opposition 
to review the records of ACOA and the Cornwallis Park 
Development Agency with respect to its finances and its 
operations?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in answering this question I want to make it clear that I do not 
accept in any way the premise, the insinuations or innuendos in the 
hon. member's question.
<P>
	This matter will be looked into by the minister responsible for 
ACOA and he will be in a position to report back in the appropriate 
way.

he has not demonstrated in this House that he always has a 
complete grasp of them himself.

	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Indian Affairs.
<P>
	The minister recently claimed to have given $80 million to the 
Davis Inlet community. However, according to information 
provided by Innu leaders from Davis Inlet, the actual amount given 
to the community is $7 million, not $80 million as claimed by the 
minister. Moreover, it seems that the 35 consultation reports that 
the minister boasts about were paid with moneys targeted for 
emergencies and vocational training.
<P>
	How can the minister consider Davis Inlet as a success for his 
government, considering that the Innu live in abject poverty and 
that, according to their leaders, they are still being exploited? 
Which version are we to believe?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will start taking advice from 
the Bloc on Davis Inlet when they send as many members of 
Parliament to Davis Inlet as the Liberal Party has.
<P>
	We have been there several times. We have a plan over a term of 
years to deal with health, to deal with housing. I have crawled 
under those houses myself to see what was being constructed. 
When the Bloc gets under a house at Davis Inlet and looks at what 
is being done, then I will start listening to them.
<P>
	The figure is over a term of years. We are working with the very 
unfortunate people at Davis Inlet. We hope that this will be a 
success story in Canadian history where the Government of 
Newfoundland, the Government of Canada works with native 
people. Unlike the Bloc, we work with native people, not against 
them.

<P>
	The new health minister in Japan, after taking on the portfolio,

changes to the country's child care expense provisions. Would the 
Minister of National Revenue please explain to the House how the 
child care expense provisions have been modified?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as a result of last week's budget there have been changes 
to the child care expense deduction.
<P>
	First, the age of eligibility for children has been increased from 
14 to 16, recognizing that there are parents who do work night 
shifts and need to have support in the home for their children. 
Therefore those costs should be deductible.
<P>
	Second, we know there are single parents who are enrolled in full 
time education and who have not been able to use the deduction in 
the past. We have changed this process so that they will now be 
included. These reflect the changes in Canadian society. I believe 
the changes will be appreciated by Canadians.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to read into the record a short statement in reply to the 
statement by the chief government whip concerning the Standing 
Committee on Procedures and House Affairs.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	Members were initially informed there were three days of 
hearings for the subcommittee on private members' business of the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. These 
meetings were to start on Tuesday, March 12 and end on Tuesday, 
March 19.
<P>
	Several of our members were counting on being able to present 
their items to the committee on March 19 and planned trips back to 
their ridings for most of that week. On Tuesday, March 12 our 
members were informed the meeting on the March 19 was 
cancelled and the committee wanted to report back to the House 
this week.
<P>
	This 11th hour cancellation made it virtually impossible for a 
number of our members to present their items to the committee on 
their own behalf. Because of this change private members' 
business would now start on March 18 instead of March 25. This in 
turn created another set of last minute scheduling headaches for a 
number of our members.
<P>
	We hope the cordial and efficient manner in which the 
committee functioned during the first session of the 35th 
Parliament will soon re-establish itself during the current session. 
It is our sincere hope that the unfortunate events of this week were 
merely a temporary aberration from the co-operative atmosphere 
members had become accustomed to in that subcommittee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand the point raised by the 
hon. whip from the Reform Party. It is of course the intention of 
everyone to make this subcommittee work as efficiently and 
appropriately as possible. I believe the committee even left empty 
spots to  ensure members who could not be heard during the first 
round would have room deliberately made for them for a quick 
second report so that all members who have private members' 
items that should be made votable are made votable at the earliest 
opportunity.

<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I have introduced this bill for a couple of 
reasons. First, the government is considering a major overhaul in 
dealing with the nuclear industry and radioactive waste.

Meadow Lake Indian Reserve, of wanting and desiring radioactive 
waste in their own areas as make work projects.

	Pursuant to a special order of the House passed on March 4, I am 
requesting this bill be reinstated to the position it was in prior to the

of non-citizens convicted of violent criminal offences punishable

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for 
Matapédia-Matane has concluded his remarks. We will now go on 
to the period for questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the contract we are discussing concerns two Canadian 
provinces. I understand that if Quebec separates from the rest of 
Canada, the Churchill Falls contract will be nul and void. It will 
have to be renegotiated. It seems to me that that would be good for 
Labrador and Newfoundland.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member for Matapédia-Matane to tell us 
his thoughts on this matter, which is of some interest to all 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank my colleague. This 
contract, which runs until the year 2041, was signed after a great 
deal of reflection. If we become sovereign, this contract and others 
will be maintained. In 1984, the Supreme Court ruled that this 
contract was valid. When we went back in 1988, the original ruling 
was upheld. In such a case, I think an agreement should be 
honoured. It would be really easy for us to establish the legitimacy 
of these contracts.
<P>
	Agreements with other countries would be maintained. In the 
case of NAFTA or the GATT agreement, the international courts 
would recognize our new country's sovereignty and tell us that we 
are right and that the agreements are valid.
<P>
	There is no problem with that and the people of Quebec 
understand that, if over 49 per cent of them voted in favour of 
sovereignty, it is because these laws are and always will be 
respected. We are going to make that demand.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	There should be no attempt to frighten people by saying that this 
or that contract would be cancelled the day after sovereignty is 
achieved. This is not what happened in other countries that have 
become sovereign and this is not what will happen in our case.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the question. I would like to expand on it a little bit.
<P>
	It occurred to me as I listened very carefully to the minister's 
brief history lesson that when the contract was being agreed on and 
signed, there was a Liberal government in Newfoundland, a Liberal 
government in Quebec and a Liberal government in Ottawa. I 
wonder if the Newfoundland voters consider this as they think 
about who is representing their interests.
<P>
	It also occurs to me while we listen to members of the Bloc 
Quebecois talk about honouring contracts, there is another contract 
that many of us hold quite dear, originally known as the British 
North America Act, the Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	Bloc members seem to feel there is some injustice in their 
province. Some members of Parliament and Canadians would very 
much like to accommodate the  legitimate concerns of Quebec so 
that every province, including Quebec, would have a legitimate and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="771"> 771 </A></B>
<P>
meaningful place in the country. While this is being done, there are 
other members of a rump group, who are saying: ``No, we will tear 
up that contract. We will go our own way. We will forget about 
that''.
<P>
	I would like to add that question to the previous question. It 
seems to me that if the province of Quebec no longer exists and 
becomes a country, whatever name they choose to call it, then it is 
necessary to re-establish contracts and certainly this contract with 
Newfoundland and Labrador.
<P>
	How does the member consider breaking the contract of 
confederation and his insistence that the previous contract with 
Newfoundland and Labrador cannot be touched?
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague is getting it all mixed 
up. I do not understand. When we become a country, we do it 
democratically. We have people vote. We all presented the 
referendum honestly. If there were another, we would present it to 
everyone too. And if people chose to do so at that point, we would 
become a country.
<P>
	A contract is another matter altogether. A contract is signed 
between two companies. At that point the contract is signed. When 
I look back to 1867, when Canada became a country, the provinces 
were very powerful. Over the years, all their powers have 
essentially been picked off. We are left with basically nothing.
<P>
	It is true that over the past 60 years, we have had Maurice 
Duplessis, who spoke of provincial autonomy and went and got 
income tax; Jean Lesage, who spoke of ``maîtres chez nous'' and 
wanted almost sovereignty; and Daniel Johnson senior, who 
wanted equality or independence.
<P>
	It is just crazy to compare two contracts duly signed by two 
companies, Hydro-Churchill and Hydro-Quebec, with the desire of 
a people to become sovereign through a democratic vote of all 
citizens duly recognized in Quebec, regardless of their colour or 
language. We are very open to these people. We have told all ethnic 
groups that they are very welcome in Quebec, that they have the 
right to vote against or for sovereignty. This is no contract, this is 
the process of setting up a country, because, at the outset-I am 
providing a little historical background for my colleague, because 
his knowledge seems to be a bit lacking-at the outset in Canada, 
there were two peoples, two equal peoples.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	At one point, we lost much of our powers, and not only the 
sovereignists now want them back.
<P>
	A few minutes ago, I mentioned Jean Lesage. He sat in this 
House and had a high regard for Canada's  Parliament; he spoke of 
``Maîtres chez nous'', saying that to assume our powers, we had to 
get them back. While he did not manage it, he did make significant 
progress. I readily admit that. I congratulate the Liberals of that 
period. René Lévesque was a member of cabinet and it was he who 
was responsible for setting up Hydro-Quebec. The Liberals did a 
huge job.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that apples and oranges should not be 
mixed and that the Reformers, unfortunately, have been doing so 
for the past while. They have a talent for getting everything all 
mixed up.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the poet Robert Frost penned the very eloquent words: ``Something 
there is; that doesn't love a wall; that wants it down''.
<P>
	This is a sentiment with which Quebec's new premier is starting 
to agree. He wants to mend and remove broken fences, to heal old 
wounds, to show that Quebec is a good neighbour and that it would 
be a good trading partner, as a sovereign country of course. 
However, one fence which Quebec and Labrador have between 
them which needs major repair is the Churchill Falls contract.
<P>
	Twenty-seven years ago a 65-year contract was signed between 
the Churchill Falls Corporation of Labrador and Hydro Quebec. 
The contract requires that Newfoundland sell cheap power to 
Quebec from the gigantic hydroelectric project on the Churchill 
River until the year 2041 at pre-1973 oil prices.
<P>
	It is an extremely unfair contract. Newfoundland earns $20 
million each year from Churchill Falls' electricity sales. Hydro 
Quebec, on the other hand, makes a staggering profit of $800 
million from the resale of Newfoundland power to New England. 
That is a difference of $780 million.
<P>
	The people of Newfoundland and Labrador are extremely upset 
and even embittered over the contract. This is a matter which dates 
back long before the days when the Reform Party was in politics. It 
was a matter of great concern and sadness before I ever thought 
about politics.
<P>
	It is an unjust contract. It is an unfair contract. It is an oppressive 
contract. Newfoundlanders know they erred in signing it. They 
realize that Quebec has wilfully and knowingly taken advantage of 
them. Quebec knows that too.
<P>
	When Newfoundlanders suffer, Canada suffers. The $780 
million that Newfoundland and Labrador lose to Quebec every year 
is nearly equal to the amount that Newfoundland gets in 
equalization payments from Ottawa. The Churchill Falls contract is 
extremely unfair to the Canadian taxpayer as well.
<P>
	If Quebec wants to be a good neighbour, if it wants to build good 
fences rather than poor ones, if it wants to  show the world that it 
can be trusted, it will come back to the table and renegotiate the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="772"> 772 </A></B>
<P>
contract with Newfoundland and Labrador. We challenge the 
premier of Quebec to make this commitment.
<P>
	Newfoundland is a have not province. It suffers from the highest 
unemployment rate in the country. Over 20 per cent of the 
population is unemployed. The cod fishing industry is practically 
non-existent and its economy is in a complete shambles.
<P>
	If a fair contract had been signed, or if the federal Liberal 
government had intervened to ensure that Newfoundland received 
an equitable share of the profits from this megaproject, the 
economic situation in Newfoundland would be quite different 
today. There would be jobs. There would be growth. There would 
be prosperity in Newfoundland today.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	Newfoundland has been unable to finance a power line to siphon 
off some of Churchill's power to the island. It has also been unable 
to finance the construction of a second Labrador power plant on the 
lower Churchill River, estimated to cost $11 billion. This project 
would create 24,000 construction jobs. Newfoundland also cannot 
afford to develop a smelter in the Voisey Bay, a project that would 
create hundreds, if not thousands of jobs.
<P>
	The federal government promised to create jobs, jobs, jobs. 
There is no place in Canada that needs jobs more than 
Newfoundland. However, for the last 27 years the federal 
government has failed to act on behalf of Newfoundlanders 
concerning this matter. It has failed to intervene and to guarantee 
one of the poorest provinces in the country its fair share of profits 
from the direct sale of power to the New England states.
<P>
	If Quebec does not want to be a good neighbour, if it does not 
want to build good fences and voluntarily agree to renegotiate the 
Churchill Falls contract, then we challenge the federal government 
to stand up for the people of Newfoundland. We challenge the 
federal government to lower internal trade barriers in Canada and 
to push Quebec to the negotiating table.
<P>
	Quebec has refused to allow Newfoundland to build its own 
power lines on Quebec soil. Consequently, Labrador cannot 
develop the lower Churchill Falls hydroelectric plant. Quebec also 
has refused to allow Newfoundland to use its transmission lines to 
transmit electricity to markets in other parts of Canada or the 
United States, to join in the North American power grid.
<P>
	Clearly Quebec has backed Newfoundland and Labrador into a 
very tight catch-22 position. It cannot develop the untapped 
resources of the lower Churchill Falls unless it gets an energy 
contract. It cannot get a contract without a way to transmit the 
electricity to the buyer.
<P>
	Quebec has established a barrier to the free movement of 
electricity from Newfoundland to places outside Quebec. If Quebec 
does not want to be a good neighbour, if it does not want to mend 
walls with Newfoundland and Labrador and voluntarily agree to 
break down this trade barrier, then the federal government must 
move to have the trade impediment removed. This would lead to 
prosperity, not only for Newfoundland and Labrador, but increased 
prosperity for Quebec as well.
<P>
	In western Canada natural gas, electricity and oil freely cross 
provincial boundaries. This neighbourly approach to trade creates a 
harmonious relationship among western provinces and produces 
greater wealth for all the provinces involved as these provinces 
have free access to each other's markets.
<P>
	If Quebec would be this kind of good neighbour, Labrador and 
Quebec would both prosper, shoulder to shoulder into the 21st 
century.
<P>
	By this August there is supposed to be a second draft of the 
internal trade agreement to be signed. Unfortunately it is not in 
Quebec's economic interest to sign the internal trade agreement. 
Quebec would have to give up some of the benefits it receives from 
Churchill Falls contracts. It is unwilling to do this so it will not 
come to the table.
<P>
	It is important for Ottawa to finally take a stand for the people of 
Newfoundland and Labrador. It needs to take a strong stand and say 
that enough is enough. Quebec must come back to the negotiating 
table. It must help build good fences between good neighbours. It 
must work to allow Newfoundlanders to benefit from their own 
resources.
<P>
	The federal government can urge Quebec to be more neighbourly 
by first of all following a recommendation by a federal government 
mandated group that tabled a report in 1988 called: ``Energy and 
Canadians: Into the 21st Century''. That report recommends:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The federal government should articulate the conditions under which one 
province has a right to access, on a business basis, another province's electricity 
corridor or electrical grid for the purposes of transmitting electricity to a market not 
adjacent to the first province.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	This is the first step for the federal government: state the right of 
the provinces to interprovincial trade, then articulate the conditions 
under which that trade might exist. Taking this stand would not 
require legislation. It is a direct statement of policy.
<P>
	The government must assert its authority under section 121 of 
the Constitution to bring down internal trade barriers. Section 121 
reads: ``All articles of the growth, produce or manufacture of any 
one of the provinces shall from and after the union be admitted free 
into each of the other provinces''. If the federal  government is 
willing to use this section of the Constitution, it might be enough to 
encourage Quebec to come back to the negotiating table on this 
subject.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="773"> 773 </A></B>
<P>
	If Quebec still refuses to be a good neighbour, the federal 
government could act further. It could give the National Energy 
Board the power to open up Quebec's transmission lines to allow 
export of electricity from another province. This would allow 
Newfoundland to channel electricity through Quebec lines to 
markets in the United States.
<P>
	Quebec would still have the original Churchill Falls contract. Its 
earning power would remain in place but Quebec would also be 
helping out a neighbour. It would be helping all the people of 
Newfoundland and Labrador to get back on their feet financially so 
they could get off government assistance and back to work. This 
would help build a prosperous future for their families right into 
the 21st century. It would be a neighbourly act indeed.
<P>
	If Quebec refuses to be a good neighbour and remains unwilling 
to mend fences between itself and Labrador, the federal 
government might consider a second position suggested by the 
National Energy Board. That option is to use section 58(4) of the 
National Energy Board Act to designate a corridor through Quebec 
on which hydro lines could be built by Newfoundland for the 
transmission of its own power. This could be done through an order 
in council.
<P>
	What I have just discussed are only options. They are options 
available to the parties and to the federal government. They are 
options that would encourage Quebec to become more neighbourly 
in its attitude and more giving in its actions.
<P>
	The fences between Quebec and Labrador are in need of much 
repair. Newfoundland and Labrador have suffered financially for 
years due to the Churchill Falls contract and Quebec's trade 
barriers. They are extremely embittered. The people of 
Newfoundland and Labrador want a change and they have wanted it 
for years.
<P>
	The new premier of Quebec wants to mend broken fences, to 
heal old wounds, to show that Quebec is a good neighbour and that 
it would be a good trading partner as a sovereign country. This is a 
prime opportunity for Quebec to come back to the table voluntarily 
to renegotiate this contract with Labrador to break down internal 
trade barriers. If Quebec does this, then and only then will Quebec 
together with Newfoundland and Labrador be able to say that well 
mended fences make good neighbours. However, if this is not 
possible, the Government of Canada representing the interests of 
all provinces must intervene.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish I could 
understand what Reformers have in mind with such a proposal. I 
have been trying all morning to figure out their real motives. Are 
they defending the interests of  a private firm or their own interests 
on the eve of a byelection? This is what we must ask ourselves. 
After all, the basis of their argument is that the federal government 
should get involved in a dispute between two private firms that 
signed a contract a few years ago and concerning which one of 
them is not happy.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	This is like asking the federal government to step in between two 
hockey clubs because, two years after trading Lindros, one of them 
is not happy and feels it got shortchanged. This is almost the same 
thing.
<P>
	Are we going to ask the federal government to get involved 
every time a private contract is signed by two major companies but 
one of them suddenly decides that it suffered a prejudice because it 
feels it could have made greater profits by acting differently or by 
agreeing to different conditions?
<P>
	When one signs a contract, one must behave like an adult. Those 
who represented Churchill Falls when the contract was signed 
behaved like adults, as did those who represented Hydro-Quebec. 
There is a duly signed contract between two private firms. I do not 
see why we would want to set a precedent and ask the federal 
government to get involved, except to make voters believe that the 
Reform Party is the one that understands them best, the one with 
the solution to their economic woes of the last few years.
<P>
	The best thing that voters can do is to wonder if they should put 
their trust in the Reform Party, given that, in the eyes of that party, 
an agreement is no assurance for the future.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member would have us believe 
that the Reform Party has come to Ottawa to begin thinking about 
what the country needs. I did not come to Ottawa because I was 
interested in the self-serving drivel I have heard from the opposite 
side and the government benches. I entered politics because of 
serious concerns of longstanding issues that need redress from my 
part of the country.
<P>
	We did not go into Labrador simply to win a byelection. We were 
there long before this byelection was called. This is not a new issue 
that the Reform Party has dreamed up. This is an old, old issue that 
has been hurting and crying for redress for years and years and 
years. Simply because the Reform Party has the guts to stand up 
and say that enough is enough, something has to be done does not 
mean it was invented by the Reform Party.
<P>
	We are simply speaking on behalf of the people who have been 
calling for redress for decades. This is nonsense that I am hearing 
from the member. This is an unjust contract. He knows it and what 
he says is to serve his own political purposes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="774"> 774 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member from the Reform Party is dreaming if 
he thinks the contract will be reopened under any current 
circumstances primarily because it is far too profitable for Quebec.
<P>
	The Reform Party has taken the position that Canada should set 
the terms for sovereignty before the next referendum. Has it 
occurred to the hon. member and his party that the Churchill Falls 
contract would certainly be something that would be open for 
negotiation in the event of any kind of debate or negotiation with 
respect to sovereignty?
<P>
	I do not think we will ever see the day when there will be a 
referendum in which Quebecers choose to separate from Canada. 
However, we should still put on the table the fact that were there 
negotiations for a separate Quebec, the Churchill Falls contract 
would have to be on the table and Quebec would have to concede a 
fair arrangement with Newfoundland and Labrador which would 
probably cost the new sovereign state of Quebec many hundreds of 
millions of dollars annually.
<P>
	Perhaps my colleague from the Reform Party would care to 
comment on those remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> Mr. Speaker, Quebec has been calling for fairness 
and justice about the injustice it has been suffering. Newfoundland 
and Labrador has been hurting very badly for a long time. If we are 
to have a country in which all of the provinces can hold together, 
then the interests and the needs of every region of the country must 
be given attention.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	Are we to say to Quebec that its needs have not been met so it 
can go? Are we to say to Newfoundland that it has been hurting for 
a long time and maybe if it leaves Confederation it will be able to 
renegotiate a contract or say to go stuff it?
<P>
	The interests of Newfoundland and Labrador must be attended 
to. The Government of Canada must attend to the interests of all 
regions of the country, including the eastern region of 
Newfoundland and Labrador. It must also attend to the needs of 
Quebec, I agree.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by saying that, on occasion, I 
have wished in this House that the Reform Party became the 
official government of Canada. But over the past few weeks, and 
especially today, I have changed my mind.
<P>
	The motion before us today deals with a contract signed on 
behalf of two corporations by very smart individuals who took 
months to negotiate and reach an agreement. The case was heard by 
the Supreme Court of Canada, and the contract declared valid. A 
contract is a contract.
<P>
	Reform members are taking advantage of the forthcoming 
elections in Newfoundland to engage in some Quebec bashing, 
telling Newfoundlanders that we are bad neighbours.
<P>
	If you recall, Mr. Parizeau himself, at the last premiers' meeting, 
when Mr. Wells was still premier of Newfoundland, surprised Mr. 
Wells with a private offer to renegotiate the issue of a corridor 
through Quebec should the province become a country in the short 
term, which at the time was a strong possibility. We are very open 
to this kind of negotiations.
<P>
	I would like to remind my colleague that if it were not for 
Quebec weighing heavily in favour of NAFTA, there would be no 
NAFTA agreement between Quebec and the U.S., and probably no 
GATT agreement, since it had a profound impact on the decisions 
in this respect.
<P>
	I would like to ask a question of my hon. colleague who raised 
the issue of contracts; we have a proper contract, by which we will 
abide. In Canada, there is a basic contract called the Canadian 
Constitution. In 1982, the Constitution was patriated and Quebec 
was deliberately excluded from this contract. The terms of the 
contract were changed without Quebec's assent, against the will of 
Quebec's national assembly, even though Quebec used to be party 
to the contract. In Quebec, no premier, no political party-forget 
about sovereignists and let us look at federalists in Quebec-no 
federalist, the allies of our friends opposite, agreed to sign. We 
were excluded from this contract. Does my colleague find this 
normal?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that the member 
would say we are calling to have this contract judged. That has 
already been done. That is not what we are asking for. We are 
asking to have the contract renegotiated.
<P>
	It is not only Churchill Falls that is the problem here. The 
problem is the blocking of a development which is waiting to 
spring up and benefit the people in that part of the country. The 
lower Churchill, the Voisey; there is so much happening there and 
this contract is a plug that will not allow events to flow through.
<P>
	The Government of Canada should be prepared to take some 
leadership in opening up the possibilities for this to be resolved. 
We have suggested some of those possibilities but we are not the 
government in power. We are urging, pushing and suggesting that 
the government must take the initiative. If it cares for 
Newfoundland and the development of Labrador it must take the 
initiative. It must adjudicate fairly to the interests of both Quebec 
and Labrador. It must take action to relieve this impossible 
situation.

	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have been in the Chamber for some time; you much longer than 
I. When I read today's orders of the day I was surprised, but not 
completely, the Reform Party of Canada put down as one of its 
opposition motions a subject matter dealing with a particular 
constituency which happens to be in the midst of a federal 
byelection.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> We will have an opportunity to exchange views 
during the questions period. Whether the hon. member is disabled 
or not, we will have that opportunity. I ask him to be patient in 
terms of his interventions.
<P>
	To the hon. member from Fraser Valley East, is if there was one 
shred of concern for the people of Newfoundland and Labrador 
why did he not have the absolute decency to come to the Chamber 
and put before us a votable motion? It is not a votable motion. That 
shows the strength of the conviction of the hon. member opposite. 
Some people in Newfoundland-not I-would say this is 
hypocrisy at its worst.
<P>
	This is absolutely despicable on the part of Reform Party 
members, who are trying to position themselves as individuals 
concerned about the plight of the people of Newfoundland and 
Labrador; so much so that they have gone one step beyond by 
attempting to bloody the good name of the former member of 
Parliament who served there with great distinction for over 24 
years. I think of my colleague, Mr. Rompkey, who we all know was 
able, concerned, dedicated and sincere in all of his activities on 
behalf of his constituents.
<P>
	I find it passing strange the Reform Party would use this 
occasion, when a byelection is under way, to raise these issues, 
when it has never in the two years we have been in the House raised 
issues which affect the people of Labrador.
<P>
	The people of Newfoundland and Labrador will not buy this. 
They will not buy your new found faith, your new found concern, 
your new found care, your new found compassion-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> A minister who has been in the House 
will know he is not to address his colleagues by ``you'' but to 
address his remarks through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Colleagues opposite 
know this will not wash with the people of Newfoundland and 
Labrador. I assure them of that.
<P>
	If they really wanted to debate something that could be resolved 
quite easily they would have put some other subject matters on. 
They chose a particular contract, duly consummated between the 
Government of Quebec and the Government of Newfoundland. 
This has been adjudicated by the Supreme Court of Canada as 
being a  binding, legal contract on the parties. What does the 
Reform Party do? It says it should be broken up. To hell with the 
Supreme Court of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	What hypocrisy. What stupidity. What unbelievable arrogance 
on the part of the Reform Party to tell the people of Newfoundland 
and Labrador that the way to go is to break legally binding 
contracts.
<P>
	The hon. member shakes his head. He says: ``We are just looking 
for a new way to resolve this dispute'', but he has not given one 
shred of evidence, one piece of constructive advice.
<P>
	He disputes the government's position in dealing with this 
through the provision of internal trade agreements, which 
negotiations are being led by my very able colleague, the Minister 
of Industry, as well as the Minister of Natural Resources.
<P>
	What is taking place here is nothing more than a sham by the 
Reform Party of Canada.
<P>
	I thought its members might have talked about certain projects in 
the province of Newfoundland such as Hibernia, in which the 
Government of Canada has been involved. No, we have not heard 
from them on that initiative. They are probably against Hibernia, if 
the truth were known. If they are in favour of Hibernia, I would 
think the hon. member opposite would want to stand up to say he 
fully supports it.
<P>
	Where are they on CFB Goose Bay? Where is the Reform Party 
on that issue? Silent. Not a word. Not a reference. No interventions 
relate to that. The base in Goose Bay, Labrador contributes about 
$128 million to the province's GDP. That was in 1992. It has 
probably increased substantially in recent years. It is a significant 
boost to the economy.
<P>
	The Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency is working with 
community groups intending to foster economic development in 
that region. Has the hon. member stood in his place and said we 
need more of that kind of assistance and intervention by the state? 
No. His colleague stands in the House to criticize minister after 
minister who is trying to make money available for the purposes of 
economic development.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Especially Liberals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Mr. Speaker, he just said it all. It proves the point 
that the hon. member for Fraser Valley East is trying to play 
politics with the people of Newfoundland and Labrador.
<P>
	The Vancouver <I>Province</I> of March 14, 1996 described hon. 
members opposite as: ``Wacko Reform''. In Newfoundland people 
do not have to be reminded by Vancouver newspapers; they know 
the Reform Party is wacko reform when it comes to protecting and 
enhancing their economic interests.

<P>
	Through ACOA the province of Newfoundland, in co-operation 
with the Government of Canada, has some of the best economic 
educational programs in North America. It build not only physical 
infrastructure but, just as important if not more so, human 
infrastructure. ACOA has added to that to assist in developing and 
in diversifying its economy.
<P>
	The hon. member opposite has not stood in his place during 
question period over the last two and a half years supporting those 
efforts. He has criticized them; again my thesis that the hon. 
member opposite is playing cheap, nasty, dirty politics, which is 
typical of the leader of the Reform Party.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member should state on the floor of the House 
of Commons whether he supports the leader of the Reform Party. 
We know the hon. member for Macleod, the bellhop for the party, 
does not support his leader. Perhaps I should correct that. The 
leader of the Reform Party does not support the hon. member for 
Macleod.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	I raise this issue because this is the same member who stood up 
Thursday after the budget and said we were not putting enough into 
transfer payments. He had the byelections in Quebec and in 
Newfoundland in mind when he was saying those things.
<P>
	What did his leader say this week? His leader cut him off, as he 
should have cut him off, and said: ``I am sorry, there have to be 
more cuts to transfer payments''.
<P>
	At some point in time some will think it is a flip-flop on the part 
of Reform members in terms of their interests. They consistently 
say one thing in one part of Canada and another thing in another 
part of Canada.
<P>
	When they go to Quebec they ease up and they are goozy, teary 
eyed, and they want to be friends to the people of Quebec. When 
they go to Newfoundland the handkerchiefs come out and they 
want to ooze up to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador; also 
when they go to Nova Scotia.
<P>
	Canadians are not fooled by that. They have rejected Reform 
overwhelmingly and that is why members of its caucus are 
desperately seeking headlines in the byelection in Newfoundland in 
terms of misinformation, erroneous information, false information. 
Newfoundlanders have told me time and time again that the 
Reform Party is pretty careless with the truth.
<P>
	The hon. member has not made one sentence in terms of the 
comprehensive Labrador co-operation agreement of $67.2 million., 
He has said nothing about the $100 million economic renewal 
program which will also benefit Labrador. He has said nothing with 
regard to the Atlantic ground fishery program which will benefit 
the people of Labrador.
<P>
	He made reference to one contract consummated by the Supreme 
Court of Canada which cannot be changed. The only reason he does 
that, as I indicated at the beginning of my remarks, is he knows it 
cannot be changed. He is doing it for political purposes. I would 
have thought the hon. member opposite would have a different 
view from that of his leader and some of his caucus members and 
that he would have come here today with constructive suggestions 
in terms of how the economy in one of the poorest regions of the 
country could be improved. No, he sets up a straw man, knowing 
full well what the Supreme Court of Canada has decided.
<P>
	There is language to describe such conduct. I think the language 
will be best demonstrated to the hon. member, to the hon. member 
for McLeod and of course to the famous leader of the Reform Party 
clearly and unequivocally on election day when the people of 
Newfoundland and Labrador make their decision and reject 
overwhelmingly the hypocrisy of this member opposite and of the 
Reform Party in general.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Nervous?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Nervous? Mr. Speaker, I will pay the hon. 
member $15,000 or $20,000 if he would only run against me. I will 
hold fundraisers for him if he would only come down and run 
against me. Run anywhere in Atlantic Canada. I will pay the 
member $25,000. We will have a fundraiser just for the Reform 
Party so it can find a candidate.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	If the hon. member wishes to take me up on the offer he has to 
put something on the table also such as a little bit of integrity, a 
little bit of honesty, a little bit of compassion, as opposed to being 
this anti-institution, anti-government, anti-individual, anti-Quebec, 
anti-democracy, anti-everything.
<P>
	Their ranks are starting to grow, Mr. Speaker. They are like 
earwigs, they multiply when a little issue comes to the forefront.
<P>
	One of their caucus members said about their own leader and 
their own party: ``I have had enough of labouring under the image 
of a party that is downright scary''. That does not come from us. 
That comes from the members opposite which adds to the thesis. 
This group of Canadians in the Reform Party are not concerned 
about Newfoundland. They are not concerned about the economic 
interests in that part of the country. They are not concerned about 
the economic interests of the people of Quebec or indeed 
elsewhere. They are playing an old game of cheap, sleazy politics.
<P>
	This was the politics that the leader of the Reform Party said he 
was not going to be involved in. He is doing it. That is exactly what 
he is doing. I find, and I am sure Canadians will find, this kind of 
conduct very disgusting and will vote accordingly.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="777"> 777 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not need notes to debate the hon. member. I would debate 
the hon. member anywhere on any subject that he chooses to 
debate. The problem is that it is very difficult to debate with 
anyone who uses false and erroneous information and who tries 
to use poor people and poor regions of the country to his own 
political advantage.
<P>
	I say to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador that the 
Reform Party has absolutely nothing to offer them in this election, 
absolutely nothing. The hon. member opposite asks me: ``What do 
you have to offer?''. We have lots to offer the people of 
Newfoundland and Labrador. The work that the hon. member who 
was the member for Labrador for 24 years will continue when we 
elect a Liberal member of Parliament from that constituency.
<P>
	In closing, let me challenge the Reform Party. Instead of being 
anti-poor regions of this country, instead of being anti-Quebec, 
instead of being anti-those who are less fortunate than you are, 
stand in your place and put constructive ideas before the House of 
Commons. Support measures which will help people who are less 
fortunate than you are as opposed to playing cheap political games.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to make a few comments and ask a couple of question of 
the minister. I thank him for that diatribe but I do not know why I 
really should.
<P>
	There were a couple things I noticed. One is that he would like to 
run against me in a future campaign. This is interesting. If he could 
ever figure out where the west coast is, he could come and take a 
tour. I could show him around. He would be welcome to run against 
me there.
<P>
	Even if he were to run, of course, I know the minister is good at 
raising dollars. He raises and spends lots of bucks. If he wants to 
give me $25,000 to run against him, he should be aware that in the 
debate, in a battle of wits he is unarmed. I hate to take advantage of 
an unarmed man.
<P>
	He brought forward the following points. First, he did not deal 
with the motion at all. The sad part about the speeches of the 
Liberal side today is that they do not want to talk about this. They 
are saying: ``Let's not talk about this. We are happy with the status 
quo. What is going on is perfect''.
<P>
	Mr. Rompkey was there for 25 years and for 25 years Labrador 
has been shipping hundreds of millions of dollars a year to Quebec 
under this deal and the Liberals are satisfied. They say: ``It's a good 
deal. Don't talk about it. Don't ruffle the feathers. Don't cause any 
problems. We are happy over here on the Liberal side. It's a good 
deal. We're happy. Don't worry, be happy''.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	The people of Labrador are not happy. They have not been happy 
since this deal was signed and the minister's complacency, saying 
``just live with it because that's the way she is'' is not good enough.
<P>
	Development in Labrador is not good enough. The ability of 
Labrador to develop its natural resources is not good enough. It has 
not been able to take advantage of its natural wealth. It is not good 
enough to say just live with it.
<P>
	The minister asks them to be satisfied with the TAGS program. 
First, the fishery is destroyed and then they are asked to be satisfied 
with some government handout. The people in Labrador do not 
need handouts. They need the federal government to quit taking 
them for granted.
<P>
	If the hon. member would speak to the motion we could believe 
that he would be dissatisfied with the deal for not only Labrador, 
but for most of Atlantic Canada. Instead the minister defends his 
record as if he thinks he is doing a good job. Frankly I do not think 
the people of Atlantic Canada, and specifically Labrador, believe 
he is.
<P>
	I think of the work done by the hon. member for Kootenay West 
when the Liberal government was willing to shut down the ferry 
service in Labrador Straits. The hon. member received many letters 
from that region thanking the Reform Party for standing up for 
their rights. I am getting phone calls and faxes throughout the day, 
even comments from people on the Hill that finally somebody is 
talking about Labrador. However, nothing has been said on the 
government side. They seem to be satisfied with the status quo.
<P>
	I think of the wealth that is in Labrador. I have been to Voisey 
Bay. I have been on the ground and talked to the people. I have 
been throughout that whole region. I will go again and hope to go 
often.
<P>
	When I see the wealth that is there and the fact they are not 
encouraged to develop it for the benefit of themselves and for the 
people in Newfoundland, I think it is disgusting that the Liberal 
Party opposite says: ``Everything is okay, we do not want to talk 
about it. Mr. Strahl, why did you bring this motion up? We are 
happy to ignore Labrador, just suck out the resources, tax their 
pants off and leave them standing naked in a cold wind storm''. It is 
not good enough.
<P>
	Finally, I know the minister will support me on this. His initial 
thesis, if you can call it that, was that we did not care because this 
motion is not votable. I would ask for unanimous consent of the 
House to make the motion votable.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, is there unanimous consent 
to make the motion votable?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it agreed?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="778"> 778 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Very well. Do I see-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I will ask again. Is there unanimous 
consent to make the motion votable?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I do not hear any nos. I will assume 
therefore that the motion by unanimous consent is made votable.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. Minister of Health in reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Mr. Speaker, let me reply to the hon. member's 
intervention when he said: ``I did not speak to the motion''. I spoke 
to his motion. He said: ``That the House condemns the government 
for its neglect of Labrador''. The things I have outlined are exactly 
the things that the government has done for the people of 
Newfoundland and Labrador and the things we intend to do in the 
future. Therefore the first issue is false.
<P>
	Second, the hon. member says that we are satisfied with the 
status quo. We are not satisfied with the status quo but we are 
certainly not satisfied with the approach of the Reform Party. It 
wishes to cut transfer payments even further. It wants to do away 
with regional and economic development.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> You would not need those things.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall</B> The hon. member says: ``You would not need 
these those things''. He knows that there is a legally binding 
contract, affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada. The hon. 
member's reaction opposite is to throw his hands in the air and say, 
so what?
<P>
	I am afraid that members on this side of the House and people 
across the country respect the law and it is high time that the hon. 
member opposite showed some respect for the law as well.
<P>
	The hon. member is somewhat agitated and I can understand 
why. His party has gone down to 13 per cent nationally and it is 
going to go down the tubes in Newfoundland and Labrador.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	The hon. member is making a false case. If he thinks that the 
people of Newfoundland and Labrador are going to buy this new 
found concern and compassion during an election campaign when 
you have stood in this House and repeatedly faulted this 
government for putting money into regional economic 
development, for putting money into Goose Bay, for putting money 
into various economic development agreements, for putting money 
into various institutions in that part of the country, you are the party 
that have opposed all that.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The minister has now used the word you 
at least seven or eight times. I would ask him if he would please 
remember the rules of the House and not use the word you other 
than referring to the occupant of the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows full well 
that his is the party that has consistently and repeatedly railed 
against economic development in Canada for two and a half years. 
Now, all of a sudden, because there is a byelection in 
Newfoundland, the people in that part of the country are now going 
to accept that the members opposite are compassionate. We will 
not be fooled by that hypocrisy.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Resuming debate, the hon. member. 
Before I do, colleagues, I might indicate that not having heard a no 
on the final time I asked if there were any nos, I ruled that the 
matter was votable and the question will be put at the end of the 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am privileged 
to debate this issue. The previous speaker was pretty good. I would 
say he generated fair emotion and experience in his speech.
<P>
	However, I do reflect on his words in a specific way. I would like 
those who are listening to the debate to decide whether the minister 
is satisfied with the Churchill Falls power agreement. Is he 
satisfied with the status quo?
<P>
	I was the first Reformer to go to Labrador. I visited quite some 
time ago. It was my choice to visit. Having made that choice, some 
of my colleagues asked: ``Why are you going there? This is a cold 
and bitter spot. Why would you go to Labrador?'' The answer is 
very straightforward. I am quite interested in the activities of the 
north and I found myself on the ground.
<P>
	I was inexperienced in Labrador. I have spent some time in the 
north in my own part of the country but I had never been lucky 
enough to go to Labrador. It was fascinating how I was treated. I 
was treated with some scepticism, I must admit. I was treated with 
some degree of misunderstanding, which I also accept. However, I 
found a few issues in Labrador that are profoundly important to the 
people there.
<P>
	One of those issues was brought to the table by my colleague, the 
power agreement at Churchill Falls. I met one of the men who first 
worked in Churchill Falls. He told me that whatever Reformers do, 
we should not buy the line that the Churchill Falls agreement is 
over and done with forever. He told me to look at the agreement 
and I would find that the excess power that is generated could be 
used by Newfoundland. It need not go through the convoluted 
agreement to coffers elsewhere. He told me to look carefully and I 
would find that the only thing necessary for Newfoundlanders to 
benefit from their own power is for superconductor transmission 
lines to go from Churchill Falls, the source of the power, through 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="779"> 779 </A></B>
<P>
Newfoundland. In fact Churchill Falls could provide all  of the 
power needs for Newfoundland at a significant savings to that 
province. Why can we not do that? We cannot do that because the 
money is not available to build that transmission line.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	I took the time to look into that agreement and what he told me 
was true, that Newfoundland could generate its own power and the 
excess power and benefit from it. To those status quo Liberals who 
say that the Supreme Court has ruled this agreement is over and 
done with, I say hear, hear. The agreement is a secure binding 
agreement, but Newfoundland could take the excess power.
<P>
	The fellow who showed me around Labrador also said that the 
former member had been a very dignified member. I take nothing 
from the member who has gone on to the Senate, his reward in the 
sky. He told me that when the issue of gun registration came on the 
table, many Labradorians did not understand it. They asked for the 
former member's advice. They could not reach the member; he 
would not come home; he did not respond. His executive assistant 
in Labrador was usually easy to reach but he seemed to disappear 
and became very difficult to reach. He would not answer their 
phone calls and he would not respond when they asked for public 
meetings.
<P>
	This individual took me to meet people to whom firearm 
registration was an unknown concept. He asked me what we would 
do with firearm registration. I told him that I had a commitment 
from my leader and my caucus colleagues that firearm registration 
was not the way to go. I told him we would love to have the bill 
split into two. We would quickly pass the portion of the bill that 
makes stricter penalties for the criminal misuse of firearms. We 
would take the part of the bill that talked about interfering where 
we do not think interference would be successful and we would toss 
it into the dustbin of history. He asked if I would give him that in 
writing. I said not only would I give it to him in writing but I would 
get it in writing from my leader. He responded by saying we should 
talk to some people with strong feelings on the issue.
<P>
	On a rainy Sunday afternoon he drove me out to a gravel pit. I 
wondered where I was going; I thought perhaps he was going to 
finish me off. At the gravel pit there was a group of young men who 
were keen internationally renowned competitive shooters. He said 
to them: ``Fellows, come over here and talk to this guy. He is from 
Alberta, a Reform member of Parliament. He is the first one to step 
on Labrador soil as a member of Parliament. He says the Reform 
Party will throw the gun registration component of Bill C-68 into 
the dustbin of history. Do you believe him?'' They replied: ``No, 
we don't believe him for a second. He is a politician and they are all 
as crooked as question marks''. The fellow said: ``Boys, I have 
talked to a lot of politicians and I have  looked them in the eye and I 
think this fellow is telling us the truth''. He said that he was going 
to join the party and that he would work hard for it.
<P>
	This was well before the byelection was called, well before there 
was any idea that we would be fighting on this ground. I came back 
and told my colleagues that there was fertile ground in Labrador.
<P>
	There is another issue that annoyed the people of Labrador. 
There is a line on most maps that indicates the boundary between 
Labrador and Quebec. One of the fellows told me there are some 
people in Quebec who do not accept that boundary. In fact, on some 
maps the boundary is absent. When tourists come from Quebec to 
Labrador, they are actually told that Labrador is part of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Come on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> It is true. Annoy a Labradorian more than 
to tell a Labradorian they do not belong to Newfoundland; I do not 
believe that can be done. He said to me: ``You make sure that your 
Reform colleagues know that Labrador is a part of Newfoundland 
and we are going to stay a part of Newfoundland. When you come 
here make certain that is clear''.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	It was fertile ground for Reform well before the byelection. It 
was fertile ground because those individuals determined that we 
are no longer going to dump wheelbarrows full of money on the 
ground to try to buy their votes. Reformers will tell it exactly as it 
is.
<P>
	ACOA, FEDNOR and western economic diversification have 
been mechanisms for big political parties to buy votes. The way to 
get votes in Labrador is to tell the truth, to specifically say to 
individuals in Labrador that they do not need handouts. They need 
an environment in which they can thrive. They need a debt that is 
no longer sucking the lifeblood out of the future of their children. 
They need to have places where they can go to university and not 
be left without training.
<P>
	Labradorians respond to that truth. Labradorians respond to 
common sense. Labradorians respond to a specific issue that says 
when they send a Reformer from Labrador to the Parliament of 
Canada they will not be sending a trained seal. They will not be 
sending someone who bows to the party wishes. They will be 
sending someone who gives party input.
<P>
	I say plainly to my colleagues across the way: When the old way 
of doing politics is over, when the old way of campaigning is over, 
Labradorians may look again at the Liberals for their member of 
Parliament.
<P>
	I make a prediction here today that Labradorians are going to 
show the way of the future in Canada when they vote in the 
byelection.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="780"> 780 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the words of my colleague from the 
third party.
<P>
	He spoke about Newfoundland being a part of Labrador. 
Newfoundlanders always knew that Labrador was a part of 
Newfoundland, not Quebec. They have known it for years. We do 
not have to be told that. We are not dumb.
<P>
	He also said that we need to get rid of the debt so that the 
government is not sucking the lifeblood out of Newfoundlanders. 
During the budget debate and prior to it, if we took what they were 
saying, those members would have sucked the lifeblood out of 
Newfoundlanders and Labradorians long ago, not just 
Newfoundlanders but other Canadians as well.
<P>
	There is one point the hon. member made to which I take 
particular exception. It was his comment that the gentleman who 
took him on a tour of Labrador brought him to a sandpit and he 
thought he was going to be done in. Newfoundlanders are not like 
that. Newfoundlanders are responsible, trusting, respectable 
people. We do not go around doing other people in.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, I seem to have struck an 
interesting chord with the hon. member opposite.
<P>
	Light hearted comments made in the House I am sure should be 
taken in a light hearted fashion. If the hon. member thinks for one 
second that I really thought I was going to be done in during my 
visit to the gravel pit, that is quite far from the truth. A little 
chuckle might be worthwhile in the House occasionally.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a short question and a small comment. Can my colleague from 
the Reform Party tell us why his party, which has so much to say 
about the law and financial matters, which has so many principles 
on paper, introduced this debate today, unless, as my colleagues 
across the way have so eloquently said, it was simply for the 
purpose of indulging in petty politics, or wasting the time of the 
entire House? I hope that he will give an honest answer to this 
question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, why a debate on this topic? Is 
a byelection not a very important debate for the Bloc Quebecois 
members? It is not a very important question for him, but it is very 
important for us. It is difficult for a Western party to come East and 
make a new proposal for this region of Canada.
<P>
	I have a question for the Bloc Quebecois member. Before the 
sovereignty debate, why did we speak about Quebec? It is the same 
thing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the 
Reform Party motion.
<P>
	I will talk a little bit about the actual facts in the motion, the 
Churchill Falls agreement. I want to talk about what has been 
discussed over the last few minutes, exactly how much support the 
federal government has provided to Newfoundland and Labrador. It 
is indeed significant.
<P>
	I will also talk about the absolute political inconsistency and 
hypocrisy of the Reform Party in bringing forward this motion 
some few days before a byelection takes place in Labrador, an area 
which before the byelection the Reform Party hardly new existed.
<P>
	I will be quite straightforward. A contract exists in respect of 
Churchill Falls that was freely entered into and which has been 
ratified by the Supreme Court. That is a reality. In hindsight one 
might suggest it was not necessarily a good contract to enter into. 
Coming from the financial business area, I can say there are a lot of 
contracts that one could look back on and ask: I wonder why I ever 
did that. Unfortunately, one rule of law, one of the tenets we have in 
Canada and something that keeps us going is the fact that we 
respect contracts. In this case, the contract has been ratified by the 
Supreme Court.
<P>
	The member is right. Things have changed a lot since the 
contract was signed. At the time it probably seemed like a good 
deal. Energy costs were low. The only practical way to deliver 
power from Labrador is through Quebec. Quite frankly, when the 
project was being developed thousands of jobs were created for the 
people of Newfoundland and Labrador. However, hindsight is 
20-20. An oil crisis ensued shortly after that and there was an 
increase in the cost of energy. I guess we learned that long term 
contracts are probably not always the best way to go. The Supreme 
Court spoke to this matter and clearly stated that it was a firm 
contract.
<P>
	The Reform Party knows and consistently insists that natural 
resources and the management of natural resources is not the 
purview of the federal government but is the purview of provincial 
governments. That is something the Reform Party not only wants to 
see continue but it also wants to see it enhanced.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	Quite frankly, the federal government does assist Labrador and 
Newfoundland in developing its natural resources. It has worked 
with the province in the hope of finding ways to develop on the 
lower Churchill. It went on record in 1975 of offering financial 
assistance in the development of a transmission link to the island. It 
is now working at Voisey Bay to find the tools we need to find ways 
of streamlining the regulatory regime. In fact the member who put 
forward this motion has worked  closely with the natural resources 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="781"> 781 </A></B>
<P>
committee and signed off on a unanimous report on finding ways to 
ensure that we can assist in the important development of Voisey 
Bay to make sure that it can come on stream, that it can be a reality 
and that jobs will be created in Labrador and Newfoundland.
<P>
	Not just as the federal government have we supported that 
province through the natural resource sector, in Labrador today 
there is the Canadian forces base at Goose Bay which adds $128 
million to the local economy. That is more than fish harvesting and 
trapping; it is about the same as what pulp and paper and 
agriculture together supply. The federal government through the 
establishment of CFB Goose Bay adds tremendously to the 
economy.
<P>
	Other types of assistance are provided. There is the whole issue 
of transfer payments from the federal government to the provincial 
governments. I know that my Reform colleagues across the way 
might suggest it should be equal for each province, but we feel a 
little differently over here. Areas of the country which are most in 
need require greater assistance than some of the other areas. That is 
borne out when we look at the fact that Labrador and 
Newfoundland has the highest per capita rate by which we provide 
transfers to the provinces. That is the way it should be. It is the way 
the Reform Party would want to see ended.
<P>
	Let us talk about the Reform Party and Labrador and 
Newfoundland. First, it was very difficult in fact near impossible to 
find that subject in the 1993 Reform Party campaign literature and 
campaign platform. As I said at the beginning of my speech, this 
discovery of Labrador and Newfoundland seems to have occurred 
only with the advent of a byelection in that area. If one goes 
through the record of this House and looks in <I>Hansard</I> for a 
reference to Labrador by the Reform Party, it will be a very thin 
record that will be found.
<P>
	Let us talk a bit about the Reform Party and what great things it 
will do for Labrador. I notice the finance critic was one of the 
architects of the 1995 Reform budget. Unfortunately the Reform 
Party did not get around to doing a 1996 one. I will touch on some 
of the things Reform suggested and the impact they would have on 
the people of Labrador.
<P>
	Reform would get rid of the Canada pension plan. It would give 
up on it and replace it with private RRSPs. This is great if one 
happens to have a lot of money. Those who earn a lot of money can 
establish their own RRSPs. With the Reform budget, those who are 
not that fortunate to be at the upper end of the income scale are 
simply out of luck.
<P>
	A $20 billion suggestion on reductions in social programs was in 
the Reform budget of 1995. I wonder how that would play out for 
the people of Labrador. I doubt that it would be a real positive thing 
for them.
<P>
	Besides looking at the Reform budget and campaign literature, 
perhaps we should move right to what the Reform leader had to say 
about Labrador and Newfoundland. I understand the leader was in 
that area in September 1994. I happened to look at a couple of 
newspaper clippings on that visit. I want to make sure the people of 
Labrador know exactly what the leader of the Reform Party had to 
say. On another issue affecting Newfoundland he said: ``The 
unemployment insurance system should be reformed so that 
seasonal workers are taken out of the system''. My goodness, the 
leader of the third party is suggesting that seasonal workers, on 
whom we depend so much in rural Canada and in Labrador, should 
not be included in the UI system. I hope the people of Labrador 
know that is the position of the leader of the Reform Party.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	We know from many exchanges in the House that the Reform 
Party does not believe in regional development agencies. That is 
certainly shared by the Reform leader when he goes on to say in 
that article that the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency should 
be disbanded.
<P>
	The Reform Party is suggesting all the assistance that has been 
provided over the years has not been the appropriate way to go, 
regardless of the fact that there might be an economy that is in need 
of special assistance so that the private sector can do its job. I agree 
with him that long term job creation will come from the private 
sector but sometimes the private sector needs assistance. The 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency does that but the Reform 
Party would see it eliminated.
<P>
	There are some inconsistencies between what is being put 
forward by the third party today, what its policy seems to be 
suggesting in this motion and what in fact it says on an ongoing 
basis. Earlier we talked about natural resources. The Reform 
Party's policy states clearly that the federal government ought not 
to have a role in the management of natural resources. What did 
Reform do today? It put forward a motion that suggested the 
federal government should intervene in it. This is totally 
inconsistent. Reform cannot on the one hand say we do not have 
any business there and then on the other hand say we should 
intervene.
<P>
	We have here a party which prides itself on being the party of 
free enterprise, the party of the private sector, and all of the stuff 
that goes with that. Yet the Reform Party says a contract that was 
freely entered into, probably as a mistake by some of the parties, 
and confirmed by the Supreme Court should be set aside. That 
seems a very strange position to be taken by the Reform Party.
<P>
	We should see this motion for exactly what it is: a crass political 
attempt during a byelection to gain political support in a part of the 
country the Reform Party historically has ignored. It is a party 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="782"> 782 </A></B>
<P>
whose policies are  certainly not in the best interests of the people 
of Labrador and Newfoundland.
<P>
	Reformers talk about doing politics in a new way and bringing 
something new to this House. All we have seen is old politics, the 
old way of trying to take advantage of the situation and the old 
inconsistencies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the member has made some point of discussing the regional 
economic development which goes on out there and Reform Party 
policy. He mentioned my leader, the member from Calgary 
Southwest, at least three times. He has said a lot of things.
<P>
	The hon. member should look at what the Reform Party is about 
and not simply what his own party is saying about Reformers. The 
Reform Party really would like to see Canadians be independent, to 
be able to care for themselves, to take satisfaction in their 
achievements. That is what we would like for the provinces as well. 
We would like for Labrador and Newfoundland, as well as all the 
other provinces, to be strong, economically capable and 
self-sufficient. As a British Columbian I am really proud that we 
have the strength, the economy and the wealth that benefits other 
provinces and other people in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	In the member's justification of all the things the government 
has done over the years for Newfoundland and Labrador, such as 
the army bases and bringing in money through economic 
development funds, would he tell me how prosperous the province 
has become as a result of Liberal initiatives?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member opposite went on 
about his great pride in the country, which I share with him.
<P>
	He talked about wanting to have the opportunity for everybody 
to have a fair shot at economic prosperity. What is missed here, 
which I think the Reform Party generally misses, is that 
government has a role to help both the people and the areas of the 
country that are least advantaged.
<P>
	Reformers are right in that we have an economic responsibility 
as a government. We fulfil that economic responsibility very well. 
But what they forget and what they ignore is the fact that 
government has a second responsibility, a social responsibility. The 
people of Labrador and Newfoundland know very well that the 
Reform Party if given an opportunity to govern would spend its 
time strictly on economic affairs and would forget the social 
responsibility. That is what the future would hold if that party were 
in power.
<P>
	The government when it governs the people must remember that 
it has that dual responsibility. Yes, it must manage the economic 
affairs of the country well and it has a firm responsibility in that 
area. However, it has a  social responsibility to ensure that those 
regions which are less advantaged and those individuals in society 
who are less advantaged have an opportunity as well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
1969, the federal government could have forced Quebec to open a 
corridor to let Newfoundland run its power lines through Quebec's 
territory. It did not do that. Had it done so, it would have been 
totally unacceptable.
<P>
	I ask the member opposite, who is the chairman of the natural 
resources committee, to assure me that his government will respect 
the terms of the contract, which was duly signed-as the member 
himself said earlier-between the CFLCO and Hydro-Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I accept the fact that there is a 
contract in place which governs the power coming from the upper 
Churchill River. There will come a day, hopefully in the not too 
distant future, when the economics of energy will be a little 
different from what they are today. The demand for 
hydroelectricity will increase and the opportunity will exist for 
Labrador and Newfoundland to sell the power to create new 
facilities on the lower part of the system. That will come when the 
economy changes and demand increases. At that time it will be 
quite right for the people of Labrador and Newfoundland to look at 
the best way in which they can use that increased capacity.
<P>
	I look forward to that day. I look forward to the people of 
Labrador and Newfoundland being able to do further development 
in their best interests.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to respond to a total falsehood which was 
presented by the hon. member when he mentioned that the Reform 
taxpayers budget had planned to cut $20 billion out of social 
program spending. Our budget committed very firmly to a 
maximum reduction in transfers to provinces, the famous money 
going to medicare, higher education and CAP, of only about $3 
billion. Whereas his government took $7 billion from this program. 
It is totally false.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	Over three years the total reduction in program spending would 
have been $16 billion, and well over half of that would have come 
out of savings, inefficiencies, overlap between governments, 
outrageous programs that had been bloated over the last 30 years. 
This is simply an incorrect representation which is despicable 
because it adds to something that is simply wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, it does not add to something which 
is totally false, it simply reinforces the reality of the situation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="783"> 783 </A></B>
<P>
	The budget brought forward by the Reform Party stated a goal, 
an objective of where it wanted to be economically. Then it listed 
a number of fiscal measures that should be undertaken. There was 
a funny thing about that. When we add up the specific measures 
it suggested and compared them with the goal it was trying to 
reach, the two did not match.
<P>
	There was a big pool of cuts that needed to be made which it was 
not willing to make clear. There were big cuts the Canadian people 
were to be asked to undertake but they were not spelled out. It did 
not tell Canadians the specifics of what they would be. That is the 
reality of the Reform budget.
<P>
	It was calling for all of these cuts and these things to happen, but 
it was not willing to put in writing each and every cut that would 
have to be made to reach the target it wanted to achieve.
<P>
	Quite frankly, the Liberal government and the finance minister 
through his three budgets have shown a path to the Canadian people 
by which we can reach good fiscal management, substantially 
reduce the deficit and do it in a way that is paced in an appropriate 
manner and in a way that combines the two responsibilities I talked 
about earlier, the fiscal responsibility the government has and its 
social responsibility.
<P>
	I think the reaction of Canadians to the budget of the Minister of 
Finance shows we are on the right course which will bring sound 
fiscal management to the country in a way the Canadian people 
think is appropriate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to 
respond to the last statement from the hon. member for Parry 
Sound-Muskoka, the answer to the question from the member for 
Capilano-Howe Sound was very revealing not only about the 
communications techniques of the government but about the 
character of the hon. member.
<P>
	He was caught expressing, I suspect inadvertently, a falsehood 
regarding what was in Reform's budget proposal last year. He said 
the party had committed to cutting $20 billion out of social 
spending, something which by simply referencing the page can 
seen to be untrue.
<P>
	Then having been caught saying that, his answer is the budget 
really did not specify the cuts at all. Now he says precisely the 
opposite. He might want to bother to check the documents before 
he makes statements.
<P>
	Reform proposed in the last election precisely what it would cut. 
It expressed those cuts to the people of Labrador as well as to 
people in other parts of the country. It did the same thing in the 
taxpayers budget. The numbers add, up if the hon. member bothers 
to read them.
<P>
	Where we will not find reference to cuts, reference to cutting 
seasonal workers on unemployment insurance,  reference to the 
elimination of old age security, reference to the massive cuts in the 
order of 40 per cent to 50 per cent in transfers for health, post 
secondary education and welfare is in the red book. Nor will they 
be found in the document on which his party and this member ran 
in Newfoundland and in all other provinces.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	This member will get up and pontificate so wisely on these 
issues but he ran on one thing and he will now vote for the precise 
opposite measure in every other category.
<P>
	I am not afraid to say what I believe because that is the platform 
I ran on. Some of those measures are positive. We ran on those 
measures. That is what we said should have been done. However, 
this member who is enrolled in the MP pension plan had an 
obligation to tell his own electors the truth, but he did not do that. 
Instead he told people what they wanted to hear. Now he goes along 
with the party because he will go along with anything. That is what 
we have and that is precisely why in Labrador and in so many other 
parts of the country politics is held in such disrepute.
<P>
	I repeat what I said in my budget speech. I honestly do not know 
how some of these socialist Liberals live with this. Some of them 
are sincerely committed to their principles. They have now 
proposed and enacted $25 billion in cuts. That is a figure from the 
last budget by the Minister of Finance; more cuts than were 
proposed by the Reform Party in 1993, the slash and burn Reform 
Party.
<P>
	We still have a $15 billion deficit which is the real unknown 
figure. How are we to fix that remaining $14 billion, although they 
say it is $17 billion counting their reserves? How is that remaining 
$14 billion to be cut? We have not been told that yet. I suspect 
much of it will come near the turn of the century when they actually 
implement their cuts to old age security. Then we will find out what 
they really mean.
<P>
	We found out on health care. We talked about cutting health care, 
saying we should actually spend zero in 1993. We said we should 
have cut about a billion last year. They said this was awful. Now 
the cuts in the health care area are many times that; $4.3 billion.
<P>
	The motion today is:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House condemn the government for its neglect of Labrador, and for 
refusing to resolve the injustice of the Churchill Falls Hydro Contract, thus 
perpetuating interprovincial trade barriers and denying the residents of Labrador the 
right to enjoy the benefits of their own natural resources.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The hon. member sees this as a contradiction; another of his 
contradictions. He said: ``I thought the Reform Party would stay 
out of natural resources. Now it wants to regulate natural 
resources''. Nobody is proposing to tell the Government of 
Newfoundland how to run its power. We are proposing to open up 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="784"> 784 </A></B>
<P>
interprovincial  trade. It is just a slight distinction but the hon. 
member may want to read the motion.
<P>
	Reform has chosen this as its motion for supply day. In that 
regard the debate has been very interesting. We have been talking 
on this side about the Churchill Falls contract and about the 
situation of Labrador, Newfoundland generally, in Confederation, 
in interprovincial trade and in other arrangements.
<P>
	The official opposition has had nothing to say. We are told this is 
the national opposition. It has nothing to say because it does not 
happen in Quebec and therefore has no relevance. It does address 
Quebec indirectly but it is of no relevance whatsoever.
<P>
	In the case of the Liberal Party, rarely if at all today have we 
heard the issue addressed. Instead we have heard constant reference 
to the fact there are two byelections in Newfoundland, one in 
Labrador and one in the riding of the former minister of fisheries. 
That is what the Liberals' main concern has been, an election. The 
focus is that there is an election and there is electioneering. Who 
has been talking about elections here today? The Liberals.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	There is a byelection in Labrador and those who say it is a 
terrible, dishonourable and despicable thing to somehow talk about 
the needs of Labrador at this time I think are wrong. I say 
byelection, why not? Why not talk about the concerns of Labrador 
when there is a byelection in Labrador?
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as you know and have written very eloquently on 
this problem, this is one of the perennially ignored backwater 
regions of the country, one that is always getting the short end of 
the stick and never paid any attention at election time.
<P>
	The hon. member for Parry Sound-Muskoka is quite right that 
the Reform Party election platform never mentioned Labrador in 
the last election. Without having reviewed every page of it, any 
money Labrador is not mentioned in the red book either, from a 
party that has been in existence since Confederation and that has 
represented that riding for most of its time in Canada.
<P>
	It has been ignored, not unlike the west, not unlike many of the 
ridings our members represent in western Canada, particularly in 
the northern part of western Canada. It has been viewed, as are 
many of the ridings of more remote areas, by traditional parties as 
really rotten boroughs, a place where a few handouts can be 
provided and the member can be expected to be re-elected until 
such time as he moves on to the other place.
<P>
	One of my colleagues referred to the other place as his reward 
high above. I think that is a little different. The rewards may not all 
be high above. The place down there is on the same level as this, at 
least in terms of altitude.
<P>
	I have mentioned many times in the House that we need Senate 
reform. Labrador is incredibly large. We need Senate reform so that 
important large resource producing regions have a meaningful long 
term role in the governance of the country.
<P>
	A few people in the House probably remember that in 1971 the 
people in Labrador were so outraged by their treatment not only by 
the signing of the Churchill Falls contract in 1969 but by their 
general treatment from the Government of Newfoundland that they 
actually elected an independent Labrador representative, a 
representative from the New Labrador Party in 1971.
<P>
	It caused quite a sensation at the time because the member very 
briefly held the balance of power between the two traditional 
parties. It was one brief attempt by the people of Labrador to assert 
their needs in the political system. It did not last long because 
frankly the system makes it very difficult for an area like that to 
play a meaningful role.
<P>
	We have heard from the Liberals nothing but concerns about the 
election itself and electioneering. We have heard on the issue itself 
silence, particularly from Newfoundland members. I notice with 
some pride and gratitude that the government has agreed to make 
this a votable motion. It is now a votable motion. I am happy to see 
that.
<P>
	I was in the House when consent for a votable motion was asked. 
I know the hon. member for St. John's West did not want this to be 
votable motion for whatever reason. I guess because she is such a 
well trained Liberal backbencher she was not used to shouting out 
her point of view. Mr. Speaker, you decided you had heard 
unanimity. I am glad to see we have a votable motion today.
<P>
	It is very interesting to listen to the Liberals today bragging 
about their concern for Labrador and pointing to what they see as 
the Reform Party's lack of concern for this region and similar 
regions.
<P>
	The bases for their accusations are the following. I will point out 
several things I have heard referenced. The Reform Party is not 
firmly supportive of the current system of unemployment 
insurance, particularly as it relates to seasonal industry. The 
Reform Party does not fully support all the workings and objectives 
of the welfare system. The Reform Party is not the strongest 
supporter of TAGS, the strongest supporter of subsidies to the 
beleaguered fishing industry.
<P>
<B>(1400 )</B>
<P>
	The Minister of Health, in particular, went on at great length 
about how this illustrates the Reform Party's lack of 
compassion-words we heard a lot today-its lack of sympathy or 
its lack of pity for the people of Newfoundland and Labrador. I 
believe that, more than anything, illustrates the difference between 
these two parties.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="785"> 785 </A></B>
<P>
	It is true that this party does not want to view the people of 
Labrador and Newfoundland with compassion, with sympathy and 
with pity. These people, like Canadians in my province and 
elsewhere, deserve hope, deserve economic growth and economic 
opportunity. They are not pitiful and sympathetic characters just 
around for when it comes to some program the Liberals can point 
to and say: ``We are giving you billions of dollars in your own 
money''. That is a very different attitude toward not only how we 
deal with the remote and undeveloped regions of the country, but 
it is also an attitude which tells us why we have such large, remote 
and undeveloped regions in this country.
<P>
	The Churchill Falls project in Labrador, which is at the centre of 
the motion, is also a very interesting topic symbolically because it 
underlines a perspective heard in Newfoundland and particularly in 
Labrador that is very different than the problems of Quebec 
separation.
<P>
	The people from this part of the world, particularly from Ontario 
where I grew up, are very concerned that if Quebec leaves it creates 
this giant hole and a divided country. This is of course a concern we 
all share. However, when we look at what has happened with the 
Churchill Falls contract and what happened with Labrador's 
attempts to integrate its economy into North America, we see that 
already for those people the country is already divided and there is 
a giant hole between them and the markets in the rest of North 
America.
<P>
	It goes back not just to the Churchill Falls contract but even 
before that. Despite the fact that Newfoundland and Labrador were 
knitted into this country in 1949 with an agreement that respected 
their territory, the province of Quebec has consistently not only 
used its geographical position to block Labrador but has even 
staked territorial claims on the province of Newfoundland. Frankly, 
I am not aware of anything resembling this in another federation, 
certainly not in the 20th century.
<P>
	Newfoundland's territory was recognized in the 1949 terms of 
the union but that has not stopped provincial governments not only 
in Quebec from publishing maps which show all or part of 
Labrador as part of Quebec, but even in the case of the federal 
Progressive Conservatives. It actually in its own campaign 
literature in Quebec used to show Labrador as a part of Quebec. 
That was a federal political party.
<P>
	Churchill Falls is, in my view, Newfoundland's national energy 
program. The national energy program was, as you know, Mr. 
Speaker, probably one of the most blatant attempts of a 
government, in the history of a democratic country, to plunder the 
legal resources of another part of the country through federal 
statutes. It was, as some will use the expression here, a contract. It 
was law. It certainly was law. It did a lot of damage. We know the 
numbers from Alberta. It did a lot of damage. In the case of the 
Churchill Falls contract, the damage has been longer, deeper and, 
in a sense, much more  serious because although strictly the 
financial numbers are not quite as impressive as the national energy 
program, we are dealing with an economy that is much shallower 
and much less developed.
<P>
	In a sense, because nobody would respect the rights of 
Newfoundland and Labrador under the Constitution, it was all 
legal, just like the national energy program was legal. It was just 
like the Pearson airport contract was legal but it did not stop that 
from being torn up. It was just like the EH-101 contracts were all 
legal. It was just like the red book made promises to Canadians 
about their health care, their pensions and the GST. We can tear all 
those up too. But this one is a contract. It is legal.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	The fact is this contract was implemented primarily because 
Quebec was able to use its geographic position to block the sale of 
Labrador power and it was backed in doing so by the complicity 
through silence of the federal government, actually the Liberal 
Pearson government of the 1960s.
<P>
	The contract was signed in 1969. It requires Newfoundland to 
sell power to Hydro Quebec at a flat pre-OPEC price. When it was 
signed Hydro Quebec would not permit Newfoundland to construct 
the hydro facilities necessary to send its power to customers in the 
New England states unless Newfoundland sold the power to 
Quebec which in turn sold it to New England.
<P>
	The situation presents a clear trade barrier. At the time the 
agreement was signed the federal government knew that it was in a 
position to require Hydro Quebec to allow Newfoundland to wheel 
power for export to New England. It simply failed to do so.
<P>
	In 1995 the net result of the power contract is that Newfoundland 
earns only $20 million each year from Churchill Falls electricity 
sales. Hydro Quebec, on the other hand, earns an annual profit of 
$800 million from the resale of Newfoundland power in New 
England.
<P>
	This is an interesting statistic. This $800 million constitutes 
two-thirds of Newfoundland's entire equalization payments. Once 
again, there is the difference I was talking about. There is no 
problem with giving Newfoundland $800 million if it can be given 
in the form of a handout or a welfare cheque where they can then 
say: ``See how dependent they are on the magnificent generosity of 
the federal Liberal government''. When it comes to making sure 
Newfoundland has $800 million in economic opportunity it cannot 
do anything about that. That is business.
<P>
	Patrick O'Flaherty of the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> wrote:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>corridor through its territory-something Ottawa had the authority to do. 
Without  such a corridor, the development of Churchill Falls could take place only 
on Quebec's terms which was exactly what happened.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like to point out the relevant sections of the Constitution 
if they had been enforced by the appropriate authorities. The 
federal government has the right to create a power corridor through 
the following sections of the BNA act: section 92(10), provincial 
legislative authority extends to the following; local works and 
undertakings other than such as are of the following classes: (a) 
lines of steam and other ships, railways, canals, telegraphs, and 
other works and undertakings connecting the province with any 
other or others of the provinces, or extending beyond the limits of 
the province; section 91, legislative authority of Parliament 
extends to the regulation of trade and commerce; and section 121, 
provides that all articles of the growth, produce, or manufacture of 
any one of the provinces shall, from and after the union, be 
admitted free into each of the other provinces.
<P>
	The fact is that successive Liberal and Conservative 
governments over the past 27 years have failed to uphold 
Newfoundland's constitutional right to sell power directly to New 
England.
<P>
	I would also point out that the recently negotiated internal trade 
agreement provides no such guarantee to Newfoundland in the 
future. The energy provisions of the deal are still under negotiation. 
Meanwhile the Churchill Falls power contract extends to the year 
2041.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> A 
point of order, Mr. Speaker. I am forced to rise and interrupt the 
hon. member and I apologize to him for doing so. I understand that 
we have to do these things at the earliest opportunity.
<P>
	I have just received a copy of what is commonly referred to as 
the ``blues'', or the accelerated or fast version of the <I>Hansard</I> of 
today. It is in reference to something that occurred earlier in which 
Mr. Speaker said in reference to unanimous consent and I read here 
from the record:
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, is there unanimous consent 
to make the motion votable?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Very well, do I see-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I will ask again. Is there unanimous 
consent to make the motion votable?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I do not hear any nos. I will assume 
therefore the motion by unanimous consent is made votable-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
<B>(1410 )</B>
<P>
	On two occasions on the record of the House of Commons it is 
stated that members refused unanimous consent.
<P>
	Third, I would invite the Speaker to check the remarks made 
only two or three minutes ago by the hon. member from Calgary 
who had the floor. He admitted hearing the hon. member for St. 
John's West say no.
<P>
	The admission of the hon. member, whose party asked a little 
earlier to make the motion votable, was that consent had been 
refused by another hon. member. Furthermore, there are the two 
references in <I>Hansard</I>.
<P>
	I recognize that it will be difficult for the Chair to rule on this 
immediately. But I invite Mr. Speaker to review both the ``blues'' I 
just referred to and the remarks of a moment ago by the hon. 
member from Calgary in which he admitted that unanimous 
consent had not been achieved and to rule on it, possibly on 
Monday on the return of the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, my point of order is on the same 
issue and is along the same line as the comments made by the 
Liberal member.
<P>
	There was a misunderstanding in the House, I believe. Some 
members did say no. However, when you asked the question a 
second time, a large number of members had already left, probably 
to have lunch. This is the reason for that misunderstanding. The 
fact is that some members from both sides of the House had said 
no.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on the same point of order. I think confusion rests, as is often 
the case when something comes up which is somewhat unexpected, 
with members going back and forth asking what to do, especially 
on the government's side. That is where the confusion seemed to 
be.
<P>
	The Minister of Health specifically said that I had refused to 
make it votable. In my response I said: ``Then let us make it 
votable''. He then spoke to his colleagues.
<P>
	I know you were very definite. You said it several times. 
However, Standing Order 10 says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Speaker shall preserve order and decorum, and shall decide questions of

	We are being appealed to and I think it is out of order.

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I have the ``blues'' as well. 
I think the chief whip to the government has accurately stated what 
the ``blues'' say.
<P>
	The difficulty is that the gentleman or lady who sits at the table 
may hear things that the Chair does not. As you all know, 
colleagues, the Chair is a long way from where members sit. I think 
frequently the gentlemen taking the notes may have heard 
somebody say no. I did not hear anybody say no.
<P>
	I hasten to say that I heard no the first time. But as my colleague 
indicated, the member who said no got up and left the Chamber 
between the first and second question.
<P>
	With respect to the point that the hon. member for Calgary West 
said he heard the member for St. John's West whisper or say no, I 
did not hear the hon. member for St. John's West or any member 
say no at the time the second question was asked.
<P>
	Accordingly, I would remind hon. colleagues, this is what I 
heard and the Chair has to listen with his or her own ears. In future 
if members wish to say no, they should make it very clear as I have 
already indicated to one member. Do not whisper and hope it will 
not be heard. If members wish to say no, they should get up and 
bellow it. If the Speaker is hard of hearing, then they should make 
sure that he or she hears the no, loudly and clearly.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary West has the floor for another two 
minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be brief.
<P>
	I thought I heard the member for St. John's West say no. I also 
thought that senior members of the Liberal Party had really 
discouraged that response because the government would want this 
votable. It has now been clarified and it should be very clear for the 
record that what has happened is that the hon. member for St. 
John's West has joined with the Bloc Quebecois in not making it 
possible for there to be a vote on this issue. That is unfortunate.
<P>
<B>(1415)</B>
<P>
	I would like to conclude by making some observations from the 
point of view of Quebec's role.
<P>
	I notice that the premier of Quebec this week talked about 
amending article 1 of the program of the Parti Quebecois to talk 
explicitly about a new partnership with Canada, presumably after 
Quebec independence. Obviously it is not a secret that Canadians 
outside Quebec overwhelmingly want their country to stay 
together. They value a great deal the partnership which exists today 
among the 10 provinces.
<P>
	If the premier of Quebec is sincere in his desire for partnership, 
even from his own sovereignist perspective, he has a perfect 
opportunity to chart a new course on this issue, to look at the 
injustice that has been done and  to send very different signals to all 
the people of Canada, including the people of Newfoundland and 
Labrador, about what the partnership would entail.
<P>
	We have a partnership today. I do not think in the future that 
Canadians outside Quebec would be interested in a partnership 
with a province that wanted to have blockades, land blockades, sea 
blockades or otherwise. Unfortunately, that is what has been behind 
the particular arrangement which has existed between Quebec and 
Newfoundland. It is extremely unfortunate.
<P>
	I would urge the premier of Quebec, who obviously has a 
somewhat different strategy now-and I do not think we know 
what his long term strategy really is-to take a look at the contract 
and Quebec's relationship with Newfoundland to see if we can 
arrive at a much more just situation. My suspicion is when we have 
a vote on this issue that the federal government will not be willing 
to do its share to reconcile this particular problem.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
I said earlier, the Supreme Court has ruled in favour of 
Hydro-Quebec twice. Furthermore, the federal government did not 
use its political power to override these court rulings because the 
contract no longer suited its purpose or because the political 
balance of power had shifted. A contract is a contract.
<P>
	No one forced Newfoundland to sign this agreement, which at 
the time appeared to be beneficial for both parties. Newfoundland 
benefited from Hydro-Quebec's contribution in terms of both 
money and expertise. In return, Hydro-Quebec would maintain 
fixed prices for the electricity generated. We might even add that, 
had Hydro-Quebec not been involved in this project, Churchill 
Falls might never have been harnessed.
<P>
	As I said earlier, this agreement was negotiated for years and 
years. It is almost insulting to those who signed it. As you know, 
the then premier of Newfoundland, Mr. Smallwood, was one of the 
signatories. I do not understand how those people can be accused of 
acting hastily. On the contrary, they knew exactly what they were 
doing.
<P>
	Obviously, there were pros and cons. It was beneficial. It was 
seen as a good deal. A few years later, we realize that it may be 
true, that one of the parties may have got the short end of the stick, 
but the fact is that the contract was signed.
<P>
	How can my colleague ask the federal government to intervene 
in an area of exclusive provincial jurisdiction, when these contracts 
were originally signed by two companies that were both extremely 
responsible? Why ask the government to intervene? Above all, 
why-and this is what I find most shocking-are they talking about 
injustice in this case?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="788"> 788 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is as though my 
colleague owned a house and I bought all the land around it, 
barring his access to his house unless he gave me 90 per cent of 
it. It is the same thing.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	That sort of action would clearly be illegal and the authorities 
can defend the rights and freedoms of my colleague. But if the 
authorities refuse to do so, I can force my colleague to sign a 
contract. And that is the situation here, the federal government 
refused to defend the rights of Newfoundland. That is the situation.
<P>
	If the Bloc Quebecois members want to talk about the contract 
and the Supreme Court, I will talk about the great Canadian 
contract we have in the form of the Constitution signed by the 
provinces when they entered Confederation, including Quebec in 
1867. It was through this contract that the Constitution was 
amended and the Supreme Court decided that it applied to all of 
Canada.
<P>
	This contract cannot be changed without respecting the 
amending formula and the rights of every province in this 
Confederation. There is no right to separate unilaterally in this 
contract, despite what the Parti Quebecois and the Bloc Quebecois 
said at the time of the last referendum. There is no right to separate 
unilaterally, and that is the contract of this country. My party has 
been very clear in the debate this week about the fact that the rules 
of the game must be respected, that the rules of this Confederation 
must be respected, as with the whole issue of the communiqué to 
the Canadian Armed Forces. In the future, these contracts must be 
respected, and it is our intention to pursue this matter in the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened attentively to the hon. member for Calgary 
West. I was not at all disturbed with the premise that we should be 
having this debate because there is a byelection occurring in 
Labrador. It is quite proper to bring issues from ridings to the floor 
when a byelection is about to take place. This may be the Reform 
Party's motive for bringing the motion forward, but in something 
like this when we are facing a byelection, we should be very honest 
with the voters and not attempt to raise false hopes.
<P>
	I say that because I have listened to the debate very carefully. It 
is very clear that the existing contract is one which has been 
affirmed by the Supreme Court and cannot be broken. I believe 
every member on the Liberal side would agree with me that it has 
been a most inequitable contract and that Newfoundland and 
Labrador is not getting its fair share in this.
<P>
	However, the Reform Party is also a party which argues very 
strongly for provincial rights as opposed to federal power: 
decentralization and more sovereignty to the provinces. Therefore, 
we get into a contradiction  because even though it is an inequitable 
contract, I do not think we can ever realistically believe that the 
current Quebec government or even its predecessors would ever 
agree to the reopening of the contract at a cost to the province of 
Quebec of $200 million to $300 million annually if the contract 
were to be renegotiated in a fair manner.
<P>
	The motion states that ``this House condemn the government for 
refusing to resolve the injustice of the Churchill Falls hydro 
contract''. If, heaven forbid, the member for Calgary West actually 
were the leader of a party that had the majority in this House, if the 
Reform Party ever arrived at that happy state, what would he do to 
resolve this injustice without actually breaking the contract that 
exists or without actually applying great federal power on the 
province? It seems to me he would have great difficulty.
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously there are 
difficult legal and constitutional issues around this. We all 
recognize that.
<P>
	However, when one controls a majority government in the 
federal Parliament it is amazing what one can do. The member 
suggests this could be trampling on provincial rights and asks how 
this could possibly be done. I find this a strange question coming 
from a member of a government that has successively and 
successfully intervened in jurisdiction after jurisdiction of 
provincial authority. It has used its spending power, taxing power 
or whatever it happens to be at the moment.
<P>
	Far be it for me to suggest which mechanism would be most 
appropriate. We do not want to conduct the government in an 
arbitrary manner the way it has been done. However, to suggest the 
federal government could not do something about it is quite 
erroneous.
<P>
	I congratulate the hon. member for suggesting and for saying 
explicitly that while he may not agree with this motion he at least 
recognizes this contract is an injustice and I would presume the 
situation behind it that brought it about is an injustice. His 
colleagues have not been prepared to say that today. I have listened 
to Liberal after Liberal either avoid that issue or state that there is 
absolutely nothing wrong with this situation, including members 
from Atlantic Canada. It is good that somebody on that side 
recognizes this is not proper.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad to have an opportunity to ask a question of my 
colleague.
<P>
	In the beginning of his speech he talked about the economic 
issues. We have talked a lot about that today. It has to do with 
whether there is a role for government to intervene, a role for 
government to work in partnership with the private sector, a role 
for government to work with regions to ensure we level out the 
playing field. We must establish if it is appropriate to use federal 
money,  our financial resources, to help areas like Labrador and 
Newfoundland.
<P>
	The party opposite is absolutely correct that the private sector 
must be the primary engine. However, there is a role for 
government. I believe our government's policies are appropriate 
and need to be implemented in order to help that area. The hon. 
member's party's position and what he is suggesting is that we 
totally withdraw, that we simply leave it on its own even though it 
is a disadvantaged area.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="789"> 789 </A></B>
<P>
	I defer to the member on another point. I was able to check my 
notes and the figure I should have used was $15 billion, not $20 
billion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, of course there is a 
role for government, as I and my colleagues have stated. That is 
why we are here. There is a role for government to lay the 
groundwork for the kind of economy that provides growth and 
opportunity for people, which is what it should be doing. It should 
be concentrating on those things it can do for the people of 
Labrador to exploit their opportunities and have real economic 
growth.
<P>
	If the hon. member thinks the historic policies of the Liberal 
Party have genuinely levelled the playing field in Labrador or 
Atlantic Canada or some of our northern regions and made those 
places areas of hope, growth and opportunity, he is sadly mistaken 
about the economy of those regions and about the economic record 
of the Liberal Party.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 2.30 p.m. it is my duty to 
interrupt the proceedings. Pursuant to the unanimous consent the 
Speaker heard earlier this day I will now put the question.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the 
motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In my opinion the nays have it.
<P>
	<I>And more that five members having risen:</I>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 45, the 
recorded division stands deferred until Monday, March 18.
<P>
	The House stands adjourned until Monday next at 11 a.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 2.31 p.m.)
