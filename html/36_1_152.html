</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from October 1 consideration of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to thank members for giving me the opportunity to 
speak to this motion.  I know that my colleague opposite had six 
minutes remaining, but since he is not here I will take the 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to commend the hon. the member for Fraser Valley for 
introducing this motion, which suggests that the government bring 
in legislation to make the tax deduction for contributions to 
charitable organizations no less than the tax deduction for 
contributions to political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the surface, if one were to look at this motion they would 
say it is great.  For myself, as someone who represents a 
constituency that is urban in nature, I have thousands of 
organizations and community groups who on a daily basis are doing 
good work in the community.  I do not want to name these 
organizations, but I can tell members that they range from 
hospitals to educational institutions to children's organizations 
to health and social service organizations to housing groups and 
so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These men, women, young boys and girls are out in their 
community on a daily basis, reaching out, trying to help those 
who are in need of help.  Frankly, if we want to address the 
issue of charities and charitable work, it is these individuals 
and organizations that we have to acknowledge with regard to the 
well-being of our society and our community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These individuals volunteer because they want to do good.  These 
people contribute thousands of hours on an annual basis.  They 
contribute their time and energy, not because they want to be 
rewarded, not because they want to be recognized, but because 
they want to do something good for the community.  These 
individuals volunteer because it makes them feel that much better 
about themselves and about the society in which they live, and 
they feel good about supporting and helping others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At no time have I ever heard an individual tell me that he or 
she was not going to support an organization or a cause because 
there were no financial incentives.  These people volunteer 
because they want to.  They do it because they know that they 
live in a compassionate and caring community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to pay tribute to the parliamentary secretary for finance 
for speaking on this issue.  He clearly stated to the House that 
what we require in this society is a balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a system which treats political contributions 
differently than charitable contributions.  I will tell members 
how. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT2"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT2"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1110
<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I was to give $100 to a political organization, then at the 
end of the year I would be able to claim a tax credit of $75. 
However, if I was to give a charitable organization $100, at the 
end of the year I would only be able to claim $30. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the surface anyone would say that is unfair and that we have 
to correct this situation.  But that is not the whole issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vast majority of Canadians give more than $300 a year, 
especially those who give to charities.  As a result, the 
government has recognized the need to provide incentives to those 
who want to give to charities.  Therefore, the government created 
a balance.  It created a sliding scale.  Those who contribute 
$250 or more to charities will get more of a tax rebate or more 
of a tax credit.  For those who give to political organizations 
the government has created a sliding scale that decreases in 
terms of a tax credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a sense it is not fair for us to judge the system on the 
first $10, $20 or $30 that my colleague was talking about.  This 
is not what all of these men and women are giving to charities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they are giving to charities over a period of a whole year, 
which in most cases is over $250, is where we see the beauty of 
our tax treatment and the beauty of our system when it comes to 
recognizing those who are giving to charities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It becomes clear at $1,150.  Say, for example, that an 
individual Canadian is giving $1,160 to a charity and is giving 
$1,160 to a political party.  He will get more credit for his 
contribution to the charity than to the political organization. 
If somebody gives a charitable organization $2,000 he will get a 
lot more in tax credits than if he was to give that $2,000 to a 
political party.  If he gave $1,180, for the additional $30 he 
will get no tax credit.  If he gave $2,000 he will get no tax 
credit for the additional $850. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that extent the tax system is fair when one looks at the 
outer end, at those amounts above $250 or $300. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to make large contributions like many organizations 
and individual Canadians do, for example to a hospital or to a 
university, if $10,000 or $20,000 was given, a tax credit of up 
to 75% would apply.  However, if $10,000 or $20,000 was given to 
a political party there would not be a tax credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at the whole spectrum rather than simply looking 
at one small piece of the pie.  If we were to look at the whole 
spectrum I would say we have gone a long way in trying to address 
the inequity in the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, since taking office, has introduced a number of 
initiatives and I would like to list only three.  First, the 
government adopted measures that will lower the threshold for 
eligibility for the 29% tax credit to $200 from $250.  Second, it 
adopted measures that will raise the annual income limit for the 
use of charitable donations to most charities from 20% to 75%. 
Third, it has reduced the income inclusion rate for capital gains 
arising from donations of appreciated publicly traded securities 
to 37.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that the measures which have been taken by the 
government are fair.  Are they the best things we can do for 
charities?  No.  We can do a lot more.  Are we doing more for 
charities?  Yes.  Should we do more for charities?  Yes. 
There are over 80,000 charitable organizations across the land. 
Collectively their voluntary contribution in terms of manpower, 
in terms of men and women contributing through charities, is in 
excess of $12 billion a year.  These are the issues that need to 
be addressed if we want to look at the fairness of the system and 
at the equity of the system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion as proposed by my colleague would not solve the 
problem at all.  It would be a complicating factor rather than 
solve the problem.  What we have before us is a balancing act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak to Motion No. M-318. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will add a few contextual comments and note that we live in a 
time that is unparalleled in human history.  Information is 
flooding our senses.  New developments occur monthly that in the 
past took decades, if not longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the comments of a leading social scientists who put 
it somewhat in perspective.  He said that a 70 year old person 
living today has seen more technological and related social 
change in his or her lifetime than occurred in the entire human 
history prior to his or her birth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Business communities and social communities form, thrive, mature 
and decline in much shorter cycles than ever before.  Boom and 
bust cycles are shorter.  We live in a time of dynamic and 
exciting change all around us.  To attempt to hold to the old 
paradigm of a top down, centralist approach that says we will 
meet all needs just cannot do the optimal job in a dynamically 
changing nation made up of the communities in which we live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform has long recognized this point.  It is one of the reasons 
we advocate that the first order of government should be that 
which is closest to the people:  municipal government first and 
then provincial government.  The federal government should only 
address key national issues.  Government close to the people will 
serve them best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate Motion No. M-318 because it parallels this 
philosophy.  The motion provides an opportunity to empower local 
communities to best tailor solutions which meet the needs within 
their communities.  The motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should bring 
in legislation making the tax deduction for contributions to 
charitable organizations no less than the tax deduction for 
contributions to political parties. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we can provide a strong funding incentive to political 
parties through the tax act, why not charitable organizations 
that work for the good in our communities?  Charitable 
organizations usually combine volunteer or contributed service 
with the dollars they receive, thereby increasing the 
contribution of each dollar in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Charities usually manage their money carefully as it is 
dependent upon charitable giving.  It is not a limitless supply. 
They must demonstrate effective management and results if 
contributions are to continue.  The needs of the community vary. 
Individuals giving to the charities of their choice express the 
needs within the community.  Their choices allow for the matching 
of givings to the preferences of the givers and the priorized 
needs of the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Large scale government programs funded by tax dollars do not 
allow the giver to choose and do not allow for variations in 
community needs.  They are more likely to cost more and deliver 
less.  In short the community approach hits the mark.  The 
government approach is less than the best and often misses the 
mark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the efficient way in which charities contribute to 
the quality of life in our communities, especially considering 
the dynamics of the times we live in and the need to improve the 
effectiveness of government social programs, it is time consider 
changing the tax act to address the inequitable tax treatment of 
charities versus political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can pose this question in our ridings “Do you think a dollar 
given to a charity does at least as much if not more for the 
quality of life in your community than a dollar given to a 
political party?”  I know what the answer would be in my riding. 
I think we all do.  It is time to support the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Calgary Centre is a thriving entrepreneurial business capital 
with more than 103 corporate head offices. 
Calgary is second only to Toronto in the number of head offices. 
Yet contrary to the heartless image of the entrepreneurial profit 
making business people, which is a picture some in the House like 
to paint, Calgary thrives with volunteers and charities that make 
for a rich quality of life in a very caring community.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Calgary's rate of volunteerism is one of the highest in Canada. 
Charities such as CUPS work with street people in the inner city, 
drug addicts and prostitutes.  They train, coach, counsel and 
care for people effectively.  Through the efforts of this charity 
Calgarians have seen many gain victory over their past and find 
joyful purpose again through the work of the dedicated volunteers 
in that charity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could take the example of the Calgary street teens program 
run by a retired vice-squad Detective Ross McInnis who together 
with his volunteers give many hours and often risk their personal 
safety to save the lives of young teenagers who have become 
enticed and trapped in the drug and prostitution activities that 
sometimes occur in the inner city.  Families have been restored 
through this program.  Some of the troubled youth who have been 
helped now work to help others ensnared in teen prostitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Youth Immigration Support Society of Calgary is run by a 
Calgary doctor.  The purpose of this charity is to help integrate 
immigrant second language youth in a healthy way into our Calgary 
community.  I met many of these teens and saw their joyful faces. 
This is work that no other group could do in the same way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For close to 15 years now Jubilee Christian Centre has provided 
a Christmas banquet for the homeless and disadvantaged in 
Calgary.  Over the years, thanks to donations of many corporate 
and private sponsors, this event has grown.  Hundreds of 
volunteers now provide an all you can eat five course meal, 
clothing and gifts for 1,500 people at a massive Christmas party. 
The volunteers have as much fun as the guests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These and hundreds more that I could list are examples of the 
vibrant contributions to the quality of life that charities 
provide to the Calgary community.  Government programs cannot 
duplicate the sense of community, caring and joy giving that 
charity work brings.  If giving to a political party has benefit, 
giving to a charity has no less benefit.  Some would reasonably 
argue that giving to a charity adds far more to the quality of 
life in our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also note that this idea is not foreign to the House.  It was 
a suggestion made by the finance committee in 1996 which 
recommended: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—that the government consider enhancing the charitable tax 
credit for donations to charities currently funded by governments 
to make it as generous as the current political tax credit for 
small donations to political parties. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago the finance committee recommended the change we 
are debating in the motion today.  I hope now is the time to move 
ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For sake of time I move to my summary and note that change is 
everywhere.  Let us empower the charities on the frontline in 
Canada and in Canadian communities to meet the needs of those 
communities.  They are closer to the community.  They add value 
to the dollars they are given through flexible volunteerism. They 
have heart and caring that government programs can never match. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance committee recommended it two years ago.  In a 
post-deficit world it is right to give these charities that are 
giving time and effort to Canadians fair treatment.  Let us give 
this process fair consideration and unanimously support Motion 
No. M-318. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to rise today to speak to Motion No. M-318.  The 
PC Party is willing to support the motion on behalf of charities 
across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the latest round of government downsizing charities across 
the country have been placed under even more pressure and perform 
wider ranging activities.  A perfect example of this is the 
Victorian Order of Nurses.  The VON is a national organization 
with branches reaching across the country. 
In recent years the role of the VON has been forced to expand 
exponentially as our health care services have been cut by the 
Liberal government.  Many branches have been forced to increase 
their fundraising efforts to make up for the decline in funding 
resulting from higher cuts at the federal and subsequently 
provincial levels. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The VON branch in my riding of West Nova and those in many other 
areas have suffered severe funding cuts from the municipalities 
as the counties struggle to deal with cuts from provincial and 
federal governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A charity organization like the VON offers essential health 
services to the elderly in my riding.  Programs like PEP, 
promoting elderly participation, which was initiated with the 
help of Health Canada during the Conservative government, help to 
keep seniors active and involved with other citizens in their 
community.  These are programs that no longer receive government 
funding.  The charities have had to find alternative funding 
arrangements to continue their services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile VON groups are also forced to fundraise to subsidize 
visiting nurses programs to individuals who need to be checked at 
home.  For the elderly who cannot afford to pay for home visits, 
these services are essential to their health care. These visiting 
nurses programs combined with PEP, respite care and Meals on 
Wheels would not exist if it were not for the dedication and 
perseverance of volunteers and the generosity of donors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a person representing a political party in Canada can offer 
a potential donor a greater tax incentive to donate to a 
political party than an individual canvassing for a group like 
the VON, or many other worthwhile charities that provide 
essential health services, it uncovers an injustice in our tax 
system.  It also highlights a larger problem:  the complexity of 
Canada's tax code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had a complete copy of our tax code today it would stand 
nearly the same height as I am from the floor.  Filing a tax 
return should not require an individual to hire a tax lawyer or 
an accountant.  We are talking about dealing with our own 
government and having to hire someone to do it for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I stand in the House to discuss tax relief for low income 
Canadians it should be remembered that tax reform should not make 
tax more complex.  The guiding principle behind tax reform should 
be tax simplification.  Even the finance committee recognizes the 
need to assist our charities in their efforts to expand their 
fundraising activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During prebudget consultations last year witnesses before the 
committee suggested the exact motion we are debating today. The 
finance committee included it as a recommendation in its report 
to the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, charities like the VON and many others should not 
be at a disadvantage compared to political parties when 
canvassing for donations.  If we were to increase the charitable 
donations to be in line with the political system, charities 
across the country would receive enormous benefit.  These 
charitable organizations offer essential services to society and 
should be encouraged, not discouraged, from continuing their 
activities. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham—Kent Essex, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, there is absolutely no question that the government 
thinks it is very important to make sure all charitable 
organizations obtain contributions and recognition for the work 
they do.  I and everyone else in the House would certainly 
support measures to make sure that political contributions and 
the work done by charitable organizations are recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a motherhood issue when we stop to think about it.  On 
the one side we can say that charitable organizations fill many 
gaps that government can no longer afford to pay.  Charitable 
organizations can broaden the spectrum and add to the quality of 
life of many people.  That is a given and is very true.  Every 
one of us sees it in our communities.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend all charitable organizations and all the work they do. 
This bill however brings bring into existence a change in tax 
policy and suggests that whatever we do on the political 
contribution side should be matched equally on the charitable 
side. In that kind of scenario I question whether both of those 
measures have been set up for very specific reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my belief that charitable organizations have been treated 
relatively well by this government.  We have moved the agenda 
forward. We have increased the tax forgiveness for charitable 
organizations over the last four years even though we have had 
very tough times. The government is no longer spending $42 
billion more than it is taking in.  The direction has been to 
make sure that there is a balanced approach to this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talking against a tax structure for charitable donations might 
be like talking against apple pie.  The reality is that for the 
first $200 of charitable donations, the dollar amount people can 
have as a tax deduction is in the neighbourhood of 30% whereas 
for the first $200 of donations to a political party, the amount 
is somewhere in the neighbourhood of 60%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a little better tax break for very small amounts given 
to a political party. However, as the tax structure is built, 
those people who give larger amounts to charitable organizations 
receive a far better tax break.  After that magic figure of $200, 
people who give for example $100 to the heart association, $100 
to the cancer association, $100 to a walkathon or some other 
local fundraiser, will get a better tax break after they have 
given $200 than before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that this government cannot afford to chop money 
out of its operating budgets because we would be placed in a 
position of reducing service to the Canadian population.  In 
talking about the cost of this motion, without taking into 
account all of the donations above $200, it is my understanding 
on the first amount where this bill may equalize the political 
contributions and the charitable donations, it would cost the 
government in the neighbourhood of $125 million on that first 
$200.  That is a pretty hefty cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of work has gone into every government department to make 
sure that they streamline their spending, hold wage increases to 
employees, make certain that all things happening in every 
department to deliver the most vital services at the least 
expense have been looked at.  Now we hear from the opposition to 
spend money here, spend more money there, give tax breaks here, 
give another opportunity there. At every juncture we are being 
asked to run this country using the scenario it ran on for so 
many years:  if there is a problem, run the wheelbarrow full of 
money out and resolve the problem; if somebody wants money for a 
venture or somebody is having a problem, government can solve it 
by spending more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We came out of that.  This country is doing better on the world 
scene today.  We are doing better on the employment initiatives. 
We are doing better on delivery of service to Canadians. 
We are doing better because we have not moved to a different 
course of spending more money than we can, reducing taxes to buy 
in many cases the favour of a few.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point it is important that the government maintain the 
course we are on.  We have to do the best we can for those making 
political donations.  We have to make certain the rules and 
opportunities are there for those offering services to Canadians 
so we can help them as well as we can. However, I am frightened 
because day after day I hear more people suggesting in the House 
that we have money to spend and to give away, that we do not need 
to take in as much revenue.  All those arguments are there, but 
that will inevitably lead us to our own defeat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must maintain a course of being as prudent as we can be. We 
must maintain a course of making sure we deliver services as 
efficiently as we can.  We must make sure we maintain what 
Canadians have elected us to do, to be prudent in the decisions 
we make in the House and to make certain we get this economy back 
on track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people say that since we have $3 billion to $6 billion more 
income than what we are spending, we should spend that $3 billion 
to $6 billion.  I remind everybody in this House that there is a 
debt of $600 billion which must be paid for either by people 
today or by future generations.  We cannot and should not get 
into a situation where we do anything except stay the course and 
try to be as fair with every organization and citizen as we can 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although it is a motherhood and apple pie issue in many ways 
where some say we should give them a better break, the other side 
of the coin suggests that if we continue to move in that 
direction we will be going back to old ways which inevitably will 
be bad for Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today in support of my 
colleague's motion.  The timing is certainly right.  We are in 
the middle of prebudget consultations.  It has been looked at a 
couple of times already, but this year it may have a little more 
credibility when it comes to the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the record the motion is “That, in the opinion of this 
House, the government should bring in legislation making the tax 
deduction for contributions to charitable organizations no 
less”—and I stress no less—“than the tax deduction for 
contributions to political parties”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Examples have been stated before.  Someone giving a $100 
donation to a political party will receive a $75 federal tax 
credit, while a $100 charitable donation, which is the average 
donation given to a charity or less than that, only garners $17. 
There is quite a disparity.  Motion No. M-318 sets out to change 
that and to make it better for everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make it clear that we are not calling for more 
more complexity to the tax code or for more government 
expenditures.  Motion No. M-318 urges the government to make the 
charitable tax credit no less than the political tax credit.  The 
words “no less” give the government flexibility to change the 
tax credit in any way it likes.  It can lower the political 
donation tax credit, increase the charitable donation tax credit, 
or have the credit amounts meet somewhere in the middle, as long 
as the charitable donation tax credit is no less than the 
political donation tax credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means the costs of implementing Motion No. M-318 could be 
as little or as extensive as the parliamentary committee decides. 
The last member spoke to this issue and said that it would cost 
$125 million to implement this type of system.  It is not really 
a cost but an investment in communities.  Charities certainly do 
pick up the slack when governments at all levels pull back.  We 
have seen tremendous lines at soup kitchens and so on. Charitable 
organizations are picking up that slack, not governments. 
Governments are actually helping to create the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government looks at the value charities bring to society, 
it has to admit that giving a huge break for political 
contributions represents misplaced priorities when compared to 
the meagre credit it gives to the efforts of Canadians to support 
the poor and the vulnerable.  As the member for Ottawa Centre 
talked about, despite its efforts the federal government still 
must do more to help charities. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> reported last year that 
Michael Hall, the director of research at the Canadian Centre for 
Philanthropy doubted “the shortfall left by government cuts is 
being covered by increased donations.  That is a huge gap to 
fill”, he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To counter this negative trend and help charities meet the 
increased demands on their resources, Motion No. M-318 recommends 
that the tax deduction for contributions to charitable 
organizations again be no less than political ones.  The 
government can play with the numbers and make them fit as it sees 
fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members have recognized this disparity in the past. 
In the 1996 prebudget report by the Standing Committee on Finance 
and again in 1997 it was recommended that the government enhance 
the charitable tax credit for donations to charities currently 
funded by governments to make it as generous as the current 
political tax credit for small donations to political parties. 
Not for the first time, the Minister of Finance ignored the 
recommendations.  By the rhetoric we are hearing this morning, it 
seems as though the Liberals have already determined that this 
prebudget consultation is finished and again there will be no 
charitable status changes. That prebudget consultation is not yet 
done so they are a little bit ahead of themselves in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can only assume that the federal government ignored the 
recommendation in the 1996 and subsequent budgets because of, as 
it says, public financial costs.  As Canada moves into this 
post-deficit world however, levelling the playing field between 
political parties and charities that leverage more money to do 
their good works in the community is a very timely idea.  It has 
become more affordable to the government and as such deserves 
broader public debate and discussion.  That is what we are doing 
here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it interesting that the report specifies charities 
currently funded by government.  I take that to mean members 
recognize the taxpayers' dollars doled out by government 
generosity could be replaced by money doled out by the taxpayers 
themselves, that big brother knows best.  We are saying get that 
money back to the communities where it came from to begin with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report also uses the phrase “to make it as generous as the 
current political tax credits”.  This is one option, but as I 
mentioned earlier, we are not trying to push the government to 
commit to more expenditures, only to examine how it has skewed 
the present tax structure.  I am interested in promoting two 
things here today, simplicity and fairness in the tax system and 
that this government has an obligation to recognize that 
contributions to worthy charities should be as valuable as 
contributions to political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Volunteers are the backbone of charitable donations to the 
groups that they serve and also form the fabric of the 
communities they seek to make better.  We as legislators must be 
aware of that and continue to support their efforts. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am glad of the opportunity to speak to this issue. I 
have been very interested in charities for some years and have 
done quite a study of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. M-318 operates on the premise that less governance is 
better and to devolve government social services to independent 
organizations is a better thing.  If Motion No. M-318 were acted 
upon, billions of dollars would go into charities as opposed to 
government services.  We would notice immediately the effects of 
changing the tax credit structure with respect to charities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. M-318 operates on the premise that if more money is 
given to charities, the charities will provide the services 
better than government.  It ignores the reality that charities 
operate with the least level of transparency and accountability 
of any organizations in Canadian society today.  At least when 
government provides services, government bureaucracies are 
accountable. Various legislation controls the transparency of how 
government bureaucracies operate.  In the case of charities, this 
is not so, as it applies to all non-profit organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An illustration of that is the Canada Corporations Act which 
provides standards of corporate governance and transparency and 
accountability to for-profit organizations.  It provides nothing 
for non-profit organizations. Charities and non-profit 
organizations can operate and have no requirement under law to be 
transparent and accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite propose that what is necessary in society is to 
give more power over social services to organizations that are 
not accountable to the people.  These organizations are 
accountable to their board of directors, but there is no 
legislation that guarantees that the executive members of the 
charity actually have to report the truth to the board of 
directors.  Therefore we have a situation where many charities 
operate at a high level of inefficiency.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a classic example.  In Ontario the Harris government 
has been cutting back on hospitals.  It is causing all kinds of 
problems in health care.  The hospitals have been ordered to cut 
20% from their total spending. Lost are the nurses, the medical 
care and the beds. The administrators stay on.  The 
administrators are not hurt. The administrators actually raise 
their salary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasingly, talking to my Ontario colleagues, I find the 
Ontario government is becoming aware that it is not good enough 
just to cut a charity.  If someone cannot control how that 
charity actually spends its money, if there is a cut like that, 
the administrators of those charities are the ones who will 
benefit. So in Ontario we have a very severe problem.  I suggest 
it is because hospitals are charities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The anecdotal evidence of the directors of hospitals not being 
informed by their own executive, the administrators of those 
hospitals, of the operation of the hospital is everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who has ever served on the board of directors of a 
hospital realizes that as a director they cannot get good 
information on how that hospital operates.  We are talking about 
charities just in the hospital sector involving billions and 
billions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party motion operates on the premise of getting 
government out of the supplying of social services, returning it 
to the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not have rules, if we do not have legislation in place 
that governs how our organizations spend money, then we are 
abrogating our very responsibility as politicians.  We are here 
to serve the people of Canada who pay taxes to make sure those 
taxes are spent efficiently and well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we abrogate that responsibility, if we give it down the line 
to organizations that are not connected to the government and we 
do not set rules and legislation in place that govern those 
organizations, we are absolutely betraying the trust of the 
people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest Motion No. 318 is certainly a motherhood and apple pie 
issue.  I also suggest that it is a politically correct issue 
because the people putting the motion forward think across Canada 
people everywhere will automatically support charities.  One 
member opposite said that all he had to do was check in his 
constituency and he would find that everyone supports charity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to members opposite that they do that.  They will find 
that in Canadian society today, for very good reason people are 
more and more suspicious that the charities supposed to be doing 
the good work are, in many instances, extremely self-serving.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
welcome the chance to wrap up on Motion No. 318 which I brought 
forward some months ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been some consultation.  I wonder if you would find 
unanimous consent that if a recorded division is asked for at the 
conclusion of this debate, the vote will be deferred to the end 
of Government Orders today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Madam Speaker, it has been a pleasure 
to bring forward this motion.  It has been described various 
ways, as apple pie and motherhood and a few other things. 
However, the intend of the motion was much more serious than 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the member for Wentworth—Burlington read my initial speech, 
he would have realized I mentioned him in my speech.  I mentioned 
that the accountability of charitable organizations is a good 
issue, one he has championed and I do not deny him that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything cannot be done in this one motion.  It has to do with 
helping those charities I think we all agree have done a good job 
of helping Canadian society.  I hope that no one on either side 
of the House is denying that many charities do a lot of good 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion also has come under challenge by the finance 
minister who said it would deny larger donors to charitable 
organizations the right to contribute large sums of money.  That 
is just not true. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1150"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason the motion is crafted this way is to encourage 
the small giver, the ones who are probably typical of an average 
Canadian giver who gives a few hundred dollars to charity, and to 
help those people do more with their money.  This motion is not 
asking the government to give more money to charities.  It is 
allowing those individuals to contribute more and be recognized 
for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the other rules the finance minister has brought in to 
encourage other donors to contribute large amounts to charitable 
organizations, in my first speech I acknowledge that was also a 
good idea.  I appreciate the initiative of the finance minister 
in that area.  However, I wish the finance minister would not try 
to mix apples and oranges together because we are talking about 
two totally different issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion I think does have wide support.  It also has the 
moral suasion behind it that we in political parties would argue 
do some good in society or we think we do at times, but we do not 
have more of a moral bat to swing than charities.  That is for 
sure.  The accountability is no more stricter here than it is for 
charities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance committee has already brought forward an idea and 
this is a takeoff on that. It is high time we recognize charities 
do good work in this country.  We want to encourage more people. 
We want to become a culture of giving. That culture can be helped 
by a government policy that says political contributions will not 
be considered more favourably than charitable donations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is very timely in view of the current budgetary 
situation in Canada.  It is very doable.  For a modest fee we can 
create something I think we all support, looking after our 
neighbour as we would look after our own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason I am pleased that this motion has come forward. 
I look forward to the vote tonight.  I ask members on all sides

</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, I very pleased to have the opportunity 
to address Bill C-42 at report stage and to discuss the amendment 
to the amended bill before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for the record to say that the speed with which 
the bill is being put through the various stages of the 
legislative process is remarkable.  The opportunities for public 
participation have been limited and the significance with which 
amendments have been treated is of deep concern to all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-42 waters down, weakens or dilutes many of the provisions 
under Bill C-71 passed by the House in April 1997. Its tobacco 
sponsorship restrictions would have come into effect on October 1 
of this year but for the amendments to Bill C-42 before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been concerned throughout the process and will continue 
to register concerns about the dilution of the tobacco 
sponsorship restrictions which creates more opportunities for 
young people to be influenced by tobacco advertising, by 
lifestyle advertising, as opposed to the kind of leadership we 
expect the government to offer in terms of being as proactive as 
possible in ensuring that young people are not influenced in any 
way to take up smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My amendment deals with a very significant issue in the package 
before members this morning.  It should be noted that during 
committee stage members of the government on the health committee 
included a weakening amendment that they did not explain at all. 
The original bill grandparented sponsored permanent facilities, 
for example a theatre having tobacco signs, as of the date of 
first reading of the bill.  The amendment has the grandparenting 
effective as of the date the bill receives royal assent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear from this change that the government is 
prepared to allow newly sponsored permanent facilities which 
engage in tobacco advertising between June 3, 1998, when the bill 
was first introduced to the House, and the time when the bill 
gets royal assent—there is no specific date for the royal 
assent; no one can be assured of just how fast it will happen—to 
sponsor advertising and the display of tobacco promotions for 
five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a significant development.  It slipped through committee. 
There was no justification.  There was no explanation.  It is our 
firm belief that as a minimum the government should be changing 
the bill back to the original intention so that the date of June 
3, 1998 comes into effect.  This would at least be a minimal step 
toward restricting the amount of tobacco sponsorship advertising 
that is taking place.  It would also be a tiny step toward 
limiting the exposure of young people to lifestyle advertising.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have tried through every way possible to convince the 
government to accept some amendments that would take us back to 
the original intentions of Bill C-21, which is about protecting 
the health of Canadians.  We have reacted strongly and 
consistently to the amendments before us today which put the 
whole thing off and allows for a greater period of unfettered 
advertising by tobacco companies at events attended very heavily 
by young people who are influenced greatly by the advertising 
that takes place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conjunction with the amendment we put forward it is important 
to remind all members of the House that we are dealing with a 
very grave and growing public health problem.  Although I do not 
need to remind members, I will remind them that we are dealing 
with at least 40,000 deaths per year, if not more, as a result of 
tobacco related illnesses.  We know that every year 250,000 young 
people get hooked on smoking.  We also know that 85% of adults 
today who smoke are addicted because they started before the age 
of 18.  We know that there is a high rate of smoking among young 
people between the ages of 15 and 19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know we have a serious problem which will lead to enormous 
health costs down the road.  Yet on every occasion the government 
has taken the most feeble, cautionary approach possible.  It is 
an approach which flies in the face of everything we know about 
the seriousness of the issue.  It also flies in the face of what 
other jurisdictions are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is shameful that the government is so unwilling to act and 
show political courage to deal head on with the tobacco industry 
at a time when jurisdictions like British Columbia are prepared 
to take serious steps toward making the tobacco industry 
accountable for the damage it has caused among young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for the government to show leadership.  Whether we 
are talking about Bill C-42 and the attempts by the government to 
dilute and weaken the Tobacco Act; whether we are talking about 
resistance to Bill S-13, the Tobacco Industry Responsibility Act; 
or whether we are talking about the government's refusal to 
expend money it promised in the last election for tobacco 
prevention and education among young people, we must keep in mind 
that the government promised $100 million over five years.  It 
has spent about 2% of that and has shown no sign of moving 
rapidly and quickly to put in place the kinds of programs which 
actually deter young people from getting started and becoming 
hooked on cigarettes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our concern is for the government to show leadership and not to 
run away and hide from the serious issues before us.  We would 
urge the government and all members to support our amendment so 
that Bill C-42 is not diluted any further and the true intentions 
of Bill C-71, the Tobacco Act, are adhered to and held up as a 
starting point for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We implore the government to continue working with parliament 
and the many health organizations that want stronger tobacco laws 
for the sake of our health and for the sake of our kids.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to 
participate in the third reading debate of Bill C-42.  We had a 
good and thorough discussion at committee.  The government 
proposed several amendments.  I thought I would like to use my 
time today to repeat for all members of the House and those 
watching this important debate the government's position, the 
government's intention and the government's commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to be here today with the support of the Minister 
of Health on this important initiative.  Bill C-42 amends the 
Tobacco Act.  I reiterate the government's view that Bill C-42 
will toughen the existing Tobacco Act. 
It is another step forward in our work to control a substance 
that we recognize is a killer.  It is at the root of about 40,000 
premature deaths each year in Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-42 places us consistently among international leaders in 
controlling the promotion of tobacco.  I hope all people watching 
the debate and those in the House know that the primary focus of 
the bill is a five year timetable to end the marketing of tobacco 
products through event sponsorship.  That is a very significant 
and important component of Bill C-42. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of five years there will be a complete ban on tobacco 
sponsorship.  We propose to accomplish this through a 
transitional process.  Sports and cultural events that were in 
place with tobacco sponsorship prior to April 25, 1997 would have 
a two year period without new sponsorship restrictions but only 
during that period.  During the following three years we want to 
tighten the limits significantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Onsite promotion of tobacco sponsorships would be able to 
continue.  Offsite promotions would have to meet the 90:10 rules 
of the existing Tobacco Act.  We would place stringent conditions 
on these offsite promotions to limit the exposure of young people 
to the marketing of tobacco products.  In five years there would 
be no more promotions of tobacco sponsorship.  Event names and 
facilities would not longer serve as a none too subtle reminder 
of tobacco and tobacco products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-42 came after substantial discussions and consultations 
with all interested parties.  We heard from the arts, sports and 
other groups that would be affected these changes.  They 
indicated that they needed appropriate time frames to line up new 
sponsors.  Bill C-42 recognizes that reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also heard from the health community.  Health organizations 
have been front and centre in the important work of the 
Government of Canada to help make Canada tobacco free and to 
ensure tobacco strategies and smoking cessation policies are in 
place.  The Government of Canada acknowledges and supports the 
important work of the health community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular I mention the work of the Canadian Cancer Society, 
Physicians for a Smoke Free Canada and the Non-Smokers Rights 
Association in the broader effort.  Many health groups have been 
a part of pushing appropriately for tobacco reduction strategies 
and strong anti-tobacco policies and legislation.  They have been 
the leaders in the action overtime to get the anti-smoking 
message out to Canadians.  They have been powerful forces in 
encouraging Canadians to keep moving the tobacco agenda ahead and 
ensuring that Canada remains among world leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health organizations look at what we were doing in the bill. 
Most understand where we want to go and how we want to get there. 
Most support the directions we are taking in Bill C-42 toward the 
prohibition of tobacco sponsorship promotions.  We recognize that 
most have concerns, and we are aware of those concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They understand that the tobacco industry has constantly sought 
new ways to market its products.  As we in government and 
previous governments have closed off old channel bylaws such as 
this one, we know the tobacco industry has found new channels. 
For example, tobacco companies have begun to use the Internet to 
support events marketing in Canada, something many could not have 
foreseen three or four years ago.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that in mind, the Canadian Cancer Society identified 
amendments that it wanted to see in Bill C-42.  During second 
reading debate many members of the opposition indicated support 
for those amendments.  Many opposition members and I can tell the 
House that many members on the government benches also supported 
the amendments proposed by the Canadian Cancer Society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, at committee, during the second reading clause by 
clause debate, we announced that we were not only intending to 
amend the bill, but we brought forward three particular 
amendments which were supportive of the proposals that had been 
made by the Canadian Cancer Society and supported by many, many 
others in the House and outside the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we proposed that October 1, 1998 would specifically be 
identified as the start date for the transition under this bill. 
In effect, that means that the five year clock has already begun 
to tick down on sponsorship promotions.  If that amendment 
passes, as it did at committee, and this bill passes in the 
House, the clock has already begun to tick and the original 
intent of the timeline is firmly in place, being October 1, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we proposed that the only events that could be 
grandfathered would be those that were already promoted in 
Canada.  Although we never intended that it would be otherwise, 
this change makes it crystal clear that an event cannot be moved 
from the United States or Australia or wherever into Canada and 
be treated as if it had already been here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we proposed that only events that had been held in Canada 
during the 15 months prior to April 25, 1997 could be 
grandfathered.  Once again it was never the intention of the 
government to allow events to be resurrected solely for their 
value as tobacco marketing vehicles.  However, this amendment, 
which was agreed to by the committee and is presently before the 
House in the amended format of this bill, formalizes that intent 
and makes it absolutely clear as to the way this bill will 
function and operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Cancer Society, as I said at committee, proposed 
two other amendments.  One would ban point of sale advertising 
and the other would set a ceiling on sponsorship spending.  We 
looked at these very seriously and, after review, we believed 
that both raised questions of feasibility and enforceability. 
For those reasons we listened very carefully to what witnesses 
had to say at committee.  Today we have a bill before us that 
does not reflect moving on anything that we do not believe is 
either feasible or enforceable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We launched the tobacco control initiative in 1996.  We started 
by setting aside $50 million a year over five years.  We have 
made a commitment to public education, another key component of 
our strategy, one that we believe is critical, and we committed 
yet another $50 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the very beginning we knew that getting the greatest impact 
out of these resources would take co-operation with the 
provinces, territories, communities and non-governmental 
organizations.  We will be designing and are designing and 
implementing the elements of the strategy in conjunction with all 
of those stakeholders who share with us the determination to move 
the yardstick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many years of anti-tobacco programming have given us a great 
deal of information about what seems to work.  Those years have 
taught us that to battle against tobacco is a step by step 
process and that it requires action in many areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-42 is one of the many valuable contributions to that work 
and I look forward to the debate and the passage in the House of 
the next step forward, a step that will lead to a complete ban in 
tobacco sponsorship within five years. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, here we have 
good old Bill C-42.  I listened to the words of the parliamentary 
secretary carefully.  Her words are that Bill C-42 will toughen 
the Tobacco Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe we should always listen to politicians as to 
whether or not a bill will in fact toughen legislation. 
I believe in asking the groups which are affected and I took the 
opportunity to do that.  I asked the Canadian Cancer Society, the 
Physicians for a Smoke-free Canada, physicians' groups and 
nursing groups throughout Canada whether or not Bill C-42 would 
in fact toughen the Tobacco Act.  The answer was universal. No, 
it would not.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer was really quite specific.  They all said that in the 
short term this would significantly weaken the Tobacco Act. 
Interestingly enough, if this bill does come into full force it 
will be after another election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fascinating for me to have viewed the tobacco debate from 
my perspective, which I must say is clouded.  I am very biased in 
this area because of my first patient as a medical student.  The 
patient was a veteran, a fellow who had emphysema from smoking. 
As I got to know him well and spent quite a bit of time with him, 
he ended his life virtually before my eyes.  The last thing he 
said to me was “Doctor, please don't let the kids smoke.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I admit to having a very strenuous bias in this area.  I look 
for bills that will do exactly what that first patient asked me 
to do, which was to prevent kids from smoking.  I look for bills 
that will help my kids, my own children, not to smoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am afraid that I find Bill C-42 a weakening of the Tobacco 
Act.  There is no other way to say it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also found it fascinating that the Minister of Health, who was 
here to debate Bill C-71, has not been present for the debate on 
Bill C-42.  It is interesting that he presented something just 
prior to the last election that I do not believe he himself 
believes in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tobacco Act was really a pretty good act.  It allowed 
advertising in adult publications and bars where kids could not 
go and it prevented advertising and sponsorship directed at 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took the opportunity to ask the head of one of the pro-smoking 
groups a question about advertising for a mountain bike 
championship in Quebec which was held during the summer.  The ads 
were still running today in Alberta.  I saw them in my home 
province of Alberta this week.  I asked him if he felt that 
advertisement did not relate to kids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My own teenagers are keen mountain bike enthusiasts.  I do not 
know anybody older than the age at which we can legally smoke who 
is that keen on mountain biking.  This is a youthful activity, an 
activity that is directed at kids.  Of course if the advertising 
was just to get people to go to an event in Quebec, the 
advertising would be stopped immediately after the event was 
over, but the ads are still running months later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His response was very illustrative.  He said that it is very 
difficult to design a program that does not have a broad overlap 
with youth.  In terms of sponsorship and advertising, that is the 
only thing he said that I agree with.  It is very difficult. The 
overspill is immense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does Bill C-42 place us in terms of international tobacco 
interdiction?  I asked a presenter from Quebec where this bill 
places us in relationship to Quebec. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's tobacco legislation is stronger than Canada's.  The 
legislation in Quebec is very strong, which is not the case for 
the Canadian legislation.  Bill C-42 is weaker than the law in 
Quebec.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Formula 1 racing was the issue that pushed this bill into 
position.  Germany, France, Belgium and Britain took a very 
specific stand against sponsorship in Formula 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had officials say to me that Canada could not do that 
because we do not have as much strength and that Formula 1 will 
disappear from Canada.  It is fascinating to note that Air Canada 
is now the title sponsor for Canadian Formula 1, so we have a 
non-tobacco sponsor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also fascinating to note that Australia, a country very 
similar to Canada in terms of a unique Formula 1 environment, has 
given tobacco a specific exemption from sponsorship laws and that 
has to be done each year.  Australia is moving toward the 
complete ban of tobacco sponsorship in Formula 1.  Canada is 
weaker than Australia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The specific amendment that has been placed on the table today I 
support and I would expect that most of my colleagues will 
support it.  But might I finish this short discourse today by 
saying that Bill C-42 does not toughen the Tobacco Act.  It 
weakens the Tobacco Act.  I trust the health groups in Canada and 
their judgment on this bill far more than I trust the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak this afternoon on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois 
in the debate made necessary by the amendment introduced by our 
colleague from the New Democratic Party, the hon. member for 
Winnipeg North Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am even more pleased because my riding—the people of which I 
take this opportunity to greet—is the home not only of well 
organized anti-tobacco groups raising awareness in the schools 
about the dangers of smoking, but also of the organizers of 
major sporting events, like the Valleyfield Regatta, which the 
Bloc Quebecois has always wanted to see protected to some 
extent, at least for a transition period to be included in any 
anti-tobacco legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment proposed by the New Democratic Party reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-42, in Clause 2, be amended by replacing lines 27 and 
28 on page 1 with the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“peared on the facility on June 3, 1998”. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this amendment is to reduce the grace period 
during which permanent facilities already using a name referring 
to a tobacco company may retain it until the total ban scheduled 
for the year 2003. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be recalled, moreover, that the current Tobacco Act 
allows a tobacco product-related brand element or the name of a 
manufacturer to be used on such facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-42 goes much further than the present legislation in a 
number of aspects. 
For example, clause 2 prohibits the use of a tobacco 
product-related brand element or the name of a tobacco 
manufacturer on promotional material, whether the promotion is 
of an individual, an entity, an event, an activity or a 
permanent facility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This clause will take full effect, under the current bill, in 
October 2003.  In the meantime, Bill C-42 provides that permanent 
facilities already using a name containing a reference to 
tobacco companies can keep it, on condition that the name be in 
use when Bill C-42 is passed.  This is where the amendment under 
consideration comes in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to benefit from the grace period, permanent facilities 
should already be using the reference to tobacco companies, not 
when Bill C-42 takes effect, as provided, but in fact when it was 
tabled for first reading—on June 3.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment would therefore reduce the grandfathering period 
for permanent facilities by a little less than six months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall, Bill C-42 delays the implementation of certain sections 
of the Tobacco Act, Bill C-71, concerning tobacco sponsorships. 
So the amendments introduce a two-year moratorium on the 
restrictions governing sponsorships by tobacco companies until 
October 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the third to the fifth year, the restrictions will apply as 
initially provided in Bill C-71, that is to say, the name of the 
company may appear on only 10% or less of the advertising poster. 
A total sponsorship ban will come into effect on October 1, 
2003. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This initiative was in response to a request from the Bloc 
Quebecois and promoters of sports and cultural events, asking 
that these organizers be given some time to find new sources of 
financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures affecting sponsorship were going to have very 
serious consequences on sports and cultural events. This is why 
the Bloc Quebecois called on the Minister of Health and the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage to provide for financial 
compensation and to act like politicians responsible for their 
actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the minister at the time, David Dingwall, failed to 
assume his responsibilities and refused categorically to follow 
up on all such requests from the Bloc and from witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-42 is thus a little more realistic—as was strongly 
suggested—in its approach to sponsorships, while being 
significantly more rigid on other issues, including the use of a 
manufacturer's name on permanent facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the fight against smoking is a long term battle and the 
Quebec government—as the Reform Party member pointed out—also 
got involved by adopting legislation that is among the most 
progressive in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One wonders whether the amendment before us, which shortens the 
timeframe by a few months, can make a difference. The Bloc 
Quebecois doubts it will. Bill C-42 must be taken as a whole. The 
fight against smoking is one that must be waged by all of 
society. A habit that has been around for many generations will 
not be easily changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, thanks to Bill C-42 and to the Quebec legislation on 
tobacco, authorities will now have better weapons against the 
serious public health problem that smoking represents.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to second the motion put forward by the 
member for Winnipeg North Centre.  She has done a lot of work on 
this bill for which I thank her on behalf of a lot of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-42 does nothing to toughen the Tobacco Act.  I agree 
completely with my colleague from Macleod who just spoke.  It 
does nothing.  It is interesting that the parliamentary secretary 
is here today to speak on behalf of the minister who is out of 
the country.  If I were the minister with the House debating a 
bill like this I would be out of the country today too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember this government was elected five years ago to 
do something and it has done absolutely nothing.  I remind the 
Canadian people that in 1994 the government reduced taxes on 
tobacco.  It was the first and basically the only thing it did. 
The government caved in to smugglers instead of addressing the 
real concern of Canadians, in particular young Canadians who are 
becoming addicted to cigarette smoking. Instead of addressing and 
fighting the smuggling problem with the weapons and resources of 
the Government of Canada, the government caved in to the big 
tobacco companies. 
As a result of that we have 40,000 Canadians a year, documented, 
dying because of smoking.  The government simply adds to the 
problem.  This bill does nothing at all to change that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government now has an opportunity to do something but it has 
done nothing.  It is just a continuation of what it has done 
since it was first elected, absolutely nothing, just caving in to 
the interests of the big tobacco companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the parliamentary secretary spoke about 20 minutes ago she 
did not even consider the amendment to which we are speaking now. 
Without this amendment tobacco companies would be able to put up 
new sponsorships signs on buildings while the bill is still 
before parliament and have those signs up for another five years. 
That is bizarre.  What the parliamentary secretary did to add 
insult to injury when she was before the committee, when we were 
going through this clause by clause, was simply read a statement 
prepared by the Minister of Health to put forth an amendment 
without explaining fully the rational of that amendment.  That is 
devious at best. We will not go into what I would call it if I 
were in a real foul mood. It was not the right thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have is the parliamentary secretary being conned by her 
own minister and his departmental people to put through that 
amendment which would basically allow the companies to advertise 
for another five years if they chose to put up signs between now 
and when royal assent is given.  This is absolutely bizarre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned 40,000 Canadians dying every year in Canada because 
of smoking.  That is documented and every major health think tank 
and association in Canada agrees with those figures, as does 
every member of parliament, including members of the government. 
They do not argue that figure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would be equivalent to 100 Canadians every day dying in an 
airplane crash.  If an airplane crashed every day in Canada and 
killed 100 people on board, we would at the end of the year have 
the same number of deaths, slightly less, as with smoking. That 
is putting it in perspective. What would we do in the House of 
Commons?  What would the Canadian people think of the Minister of 
Transport if we had a plane crashing every day in Canada, killing 
100 people? We would have his resignation on the floor of the 
House of Commons within a week.  But no, this government allows 
this to happen day in and day out, doing absolutely nothing about 
it. That is wrong. Excuse the pun, it is dead wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just had Remembrance Day.  On an annual basis we lose more 
Canadians to cigarette smoking than we did in World War II. 
Combine all the Canadian deaths in World War II between 1939 and 
1945. They do not add up to the number of Canadians who die on a 
yearly basis because of smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under any other set of circumstances this would be an outrage, 
but why is it not?  The cigarette manufacturers use millions of 
dollars to convince us that smoking is okay.  What they are 
advertizing is lifestyle.  They are not advertising reality. They 
are advertising lifestyle and spending millions of dollars to do 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming before parliament from the other place is Bill S-13.  It 
was introduced in the Senate by Senator Kenny.  It will be 
introduced in the House by a Liberal backbencher.  The bill will 
be killed by the government.  It is absolutely bizarre because 
the bill would attack the problem the way it has to be attacked, 
with real dollars to educate young Canadians about the dangers of 
smoking.

Canadians about the dangers of smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will never have a tobacco bill that is worth anything unless 
we attack smoking from the price point, that there is a direct 
relationship between the price of the product and the consumption 
of a product.  That is true of any product.  We need a bill that 
strongly hits advertising and education at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless those ingredients are present in a bill, nothing will to 
change.  We will continue to lose 40,000-plus Canadians a year to 
smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Smoking kills.  The only way we can win this war is to wage war 
on the cigarette manufacturers.  What would be wrong with placing 
50 cents a carton, less than 5 cents a pack, at the manufacturing 
level?  Let us call that a levy.  Let us be realistic.  That is 
what we have to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need real dollars to attack these people.  Some of the 
biggest cigarette manufacturing companies in the world actually 
own chains of drug stores.  Examine who owns Shoppers Drug Mart. 
Find out who owns it. I challenge every Canadian to do some 
research and find out who owns some of these drug chains. They 
are owned by the shareholders who happen to be the same 
shareholders who own the shares of major cigarette or tobacco 
companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have the biggest of the biggest in terms of corporate 
Canada, international corporate strength, day in and day out 
allowing young Canadians to take up the habit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have to do is fight this with every resource we have. We 
have a bill that will soon be introduced here by a backbench 
member of the government, to be shot down by the government 
because it addresses the problem.  It does something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have is the Government of Canada being held captive by 
the big boys, the big corporate giants who figure it is in their 
best interests to sell a product to Canadians that actually kills 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment speaks for itself.  It puts teeth in a very weak 
bill and I think it is incumbent on the government to support 
this amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to this bill.  When 
I spoke earlier to this bill, I iterated that it was a terrible 
bill.  The government had no start-up date at that time.  This 
motion gives some teeth to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member from Winnipeg North Centre.  She has done a 
lot of work on this bill and the members opposite, after what 
they have heard about this bill and after what they know about 
the tobacco industry and the statistics related to tobacco from a 
health point of view, should rally the troops there, backbenchers 
and all, and support the amendment moved by the hon. member for 
Winnipeg North Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of addiction does not apply only to the users of 
tobacco.  This government and previous governments have been 
addicted.  How are they addicted?  They want their hands on the 
huge amount of money they can take in from the product and they 
want to spend very little in educating our youth, a small 
percentage. Governments all over have become addicted.  They are 
addicted to gambling.  They are addicted to alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my recent return home it was sad to note that the rehab 
centre in my constituency has been closed down.  For what reason? 
Money.  The region could not afford it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking very closely at what the hon. member has done in putting 
forth this amendment, we know what the amendment is all about. 
The tobacco industry must advertise. Why does anyone advertise? 
Does General Motors advertise to support the advertising 
industry?  Nonsense.  It advertises to sell more cars. Why do 
tobacco companies advertise?  To sell more of their products.  To 
whom are they advertising now?  What is their target area? Their 
target area is youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolute nonsense that we would have to phase in the 
advertising over a period of five years when we do not know the 
start-up date.  At that time we would be well into the next 
millennium and hundreds of thousands more teenagers would be 
addicted.  Yet we find the government reluctant to give up the 
addiction it has to taxes.  Of course another addiction which I 
mentioned earlier was the huge grants the government gets during 
election time from the tobacco companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the question as it relates to this amendment, would 
members honestly not rise in this House to support the amendment 
by the member for Winnipeg North Centre?  This is a good 
amendment. Thousands of young people would be saved from the 
advertising and hopefully from becoming addicted. Is it not worth 
it?  That has to be worth more to Canadians from all parties than 
the money the government gets.  It has to be worth more to the 
lives of our teenagers who become addicted. It is a question of 
putting something first.  To have the legislation open ended as 
it originally was planned is simply not good enough. 
Out west where we do a lot of curling, at one time they went to 
the Brier.  The big curling event was called the Brier.  Who was 
the Brier?  The MacDonald Tobacco Company. People were going to 
the Brier.  Some still use that term. Then curling associations 
across Canada said “No, this is a healthy lifestyle. We are not 
going to have the tobacco industry involved”.  Is curling going 
downhill?  No.  It is on its way up. Interest is going up.  Did 
it take five years to phase in?  Absolutely not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is really concerned about this country's 
youth, if it is really concerned about the number of people who 
die each year because of this addiction, government members will 
support this amendment, as I am sure every opposition member 
will.  Government members should go back to their people and say 
that this is a good amendment.  The opposition knows what it 
wants.  The government should let its members have a free vote on 
this.  If it is a free vote, the motion by the hon. member for 
Winnipeg North Centre will carry.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>MARINE CONSERVATION AREAS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK28">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from November 2 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-48, an act respecting marine conservation 
areas, be read the second time and referred to a committee; and 
of the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak on Bill C-48, an act 
respecting marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is to provide a legal framework for the establishment 
of 28 marine conservation areas, representative of each of the 
Canadian ecosystems. 
The Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park is the 29th marine 
conservation area, but it will not be governed by this 
legislation since it already has its own legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-48 follows a commitment made by the Prime Minister of 
Canada at the 1996 convention of the World Conservation Union, 
held in Montreal. The United Nations have designated 1998 the 
International Year of the Ocean, and the most significant 
initiatives to mark this event include the World Exposition in 
Lisbon, Portugal, and UNESCO's adoption of the ocean charter, in 
St. John's, Newfoundland, in September 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is in favour of the environmental protection 
measures contained in this bill. 
More particularly, however, the Bloc Quebecois reminds the 
government that it supported the government legislation creating 
the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Bloc Quebecois knows that the Quebec government 
is also pursuing initiatives to protect the environment and sea 
floors in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that, as they assess the parties and candidates 
competing in the ongoing election campaign in Quebec, the people 
of Quebec can appreciate what the Quebec government has achieved 
in terms of environmental protection since 1994. Its re-election 
on November 30 will allow the PQ government to carry on with its 
environmental protection efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government is also open to working together with the 
federal government, as evidenced by the agreement signed by the 
two governments on the third phase of the St. Lawrence action 
plan. However, the Bloc Quebecois has to object to the bill for 
a number of reasons: first, instead of relying on dialogue, as 
it did with the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park, the federal 
government is trying to establish marine conservation areas 
regardless of Quebec's jurisdiction over its territory and the 
environment.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason our party will oppose this bill is the fact 
that Heritage Canada is proposing to establish a new structure, 
the marine conservation areas, which will duplicate Fisheries 
and Oceans Canada's marine protected areas and Environment 
Canada's marine protection zones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the dominating federalism we have come to know in 
recent years, has divided into three parts in order to trample 
on Quebec jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think that the example set by the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine 
park should have been followed in this instance.  We all 
remember that, in 1997, the federal and Quebec governments 
passed mirror legislation creating the Saguenay—St. Lawrence 
marine park. 
These laws led to the creation of Canada's first marine 
conservation area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main component of this legislation is the Saguenay—St. 
Lawrence marine park established jointly by both the federal 
government and Quebec, without any transfer of land.  The two 
governments will continue to exercise their respective 
jurisdictions.  The park is entirely a marine setting.  It 
covers 1,138 square kilometres, and its boundaries may be 
changed by mutual consent and following public consultation by 
both levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to encourage public participation, the federal and 
provincial laws confirm the creation of a co-ordinating 
committee, whose makeup will be decided by the federal and 
provincial ministers.  The mandate of this committee is to 
recommend to the ministers responsible measures that will permit 
the achievement of the aims of the master plan. 
The plan will be reviewed jointly by the two governments at 
least once every seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think this federal Liberal government should have used this 
initial co-operative achievement as a model for the creation of 
other marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason we oppose Bill C-48 is that it does not respect 
the integrity of Quebec territory, in the opinion of the Bloc 
Quebecois.  One of the conditions vital to the establishment of 
a marine conservation area is the federal government's acquiring 
ownership of the land where the marine conservation area will be 
established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 5(2) of the bill stipulates that a marine conservation 
area may be established: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—only if the Governor in Council is satisfied that clear title to 
the lands to be included in the marine conservation area is 
vested in Her Majesty in right of Canada, excluding any such 
lands situated within the exclusive economic zone of Canada. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the Quebec legislation on lands in the public domain 
applies to all lands in the public domain in Quebec, including 
river and lake beds, as well as those portions of the beds of 
the St. Lawrence River and the Gulf of St. Lawrence which belong 
to Quebec by sovereign right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why, then, is Heritage Canada acting so arrogantly today?  Just 
looking at the minister responsible for that department, her 
ongoing arrogance is obvious. 
We see how she behaves in Question Period.  We hear her 
regularly insulting the democratically elected members of this 
House.  So how could we expect Heritage Canada to behave any 
differently than the person in charge of it, the member for 
Hamilton East? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is Heritage Canada acting so arrogantly today, claiming 
ownership of the marine floor where it would like to establish 
marine conservation areas, instead of allowing bilateral 
agreements, between Quebec and Ottawa in particular, so that 
Quebec may maintain its areas of jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our opinion, the environment is a shared jurisdiction. 
By refusing to take the Saguenay—St. Lawrence Marine Park Act as 
its example, by imposing land ownership as an essential 
condition for the creation of marine conservation areas, the 
federal government is, as Robert Bourassa said, acting as a 
centralizing government with a desire to control everything, 
regardless of acknowledged areas of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I know, and the House will no doubt agree with me, 
former Quebec premier Robert Bourassa was far from being a 
leading sovereignist. 
He was an avowed federalist, who did not hesitate to say that 
the Canadian federal system was a centralizing system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the various laws, the Government of Canada is proposing to 
create marine conservation areas, marine protection areas and 
natural marine reserves. According to Fisheries and Oceans, any 
given area could be zoned in various ways and be subject to 
different regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois agrees that this is bureaucratic overkill, 
which will not serve the public interest. The existence of an 
interdepartmental committee of these various departments is no 
reassurance. 
It has been our experience that, when several departments are 
involved in a project, they generally do not work well together 
and it ends up costing taxpayers—the people whose income tax 
is collected, who are tired of paying and find they pay too much 
for the services they are getting from this government—a lot 
of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois believes that the government would have been 
better advised to have a single department oversee the 
protection of ecosystems, with the departments concerned signing 
a framework agreement to delegate their respective 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have had much more to say, but I can see that my time is 
running out and I should conclude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all the reasons I have stated and as a result of the work 
done by our colleague and critic for Canadian heritage, the hon. 
member for Rimouski—Mitis, my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois 
who will speak after me will reiterate the fact that, in our 
opinion, the Liberal government should withdraw this bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to stand today on behalf of our critic in this area 
and express the position of the NDP caucus on Bill C-48. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are glad to say that we can support Bill C-48 in principle. 
We look forward to further debate on this matter because there 
are reservations we have that we would like to share with 
the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of background we recognize the bill provides 
legislation to establish and manage a system of national marine 
conservation areas representative of 29 marine areas in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 29 NMCAs represent unique biological and oceanographic 
features and include both fresh and salt water areas.  A Parks 
Canada system approach has identified the 29 national marine 
conservation areas within Canada's Great Lakes and the 
territorial sea and exclusive economic zones, the EEZ 200 mile 
limit zones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NMCAs are not parks as such in the usual definition.  They are 
conservation and stewardship areas.  These NMCAs are 
fundamentally different from what we would term terrestrial 
parks.  Terrestrial parks are usually associated with a 
semi-closed ecosystem and are essentially fixed in space and time 
and are subject to change over relatively long periods of time. 
We would argue this type of ecosystem would require a completely 
different style of management as compared to the national marine 
conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marine protected areas are associated with an open ecosystem and 
are large and dynamic.  The very nature of their oceanographic 
base is dynamic, moving, fluid and where rates of change to the 
ecosystem can occur over a relatively short time span. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pollution impacts have to be have special consideration when we 
are dealing with so sensitive an ecosystem that is vulnerable to 
these quick changes.  Over-exploitation of our resources is 
another huge concern, in layman's terms overfishing.  These are 
examples of why national marine conservation areas need special 
attention above and beyond that which we give our other parks 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another key difference between terrestrial parks and marine 
areas is the science and knowledge gap between the two.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know relatively little about our oceans and the ecosystems of 
our marine areas.  This came to light for me when I built a house 
for a marine biologist and we were talking about what he did for 
a living.  He said he worked full time, year round, studying the 
aging of groundfish. I thought this was remarkable because he was 
studying when the best time to harvest groundfish would be and 
when did they reach their maximum size and when did they 
reproduce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What really shocked me when talking to this mathematician was we 
did not know that type of thing. We were in the mid-1970s and we 
were just starting to study the ageing of groundfish which is a 
key primary industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A difference between the current parks system or terrestrial 
parks system and the national marine conservation areas is that 
we know very little about this ecosystem. It takes a great deal 
of sensitivity if we are to learn from these areas and their 
natural habitat without interference and development getting in 
the way of that knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process to establish these national marine conservation 
areas began in 1986 with ministerial approval to establish 
national marine parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This decision lead to a 1987 agreement with Ontario to establish 
Fathom Five in Georgian Bay and further to a 1988 agreement with 
British Columbia for a marine park in South Moresby in the Queen 
Charlotte Islands, the Gwaii Haanas marine conservation reserve, 
and with Quebec to examine the feasibility of a 
federal-provincial marine park at the confluence of the Saguenay 
fiord and the St. Lawrence Seaway, the Saguenay—St. Lawrence 
marine park. Bill C-7 entertained this creation which received 
NDP support and royal assent in 1987.  The act came into force on 
June 8, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 Canada and British Columbia signed a memorandum of 
understanding for a shared Pacific marine heritage legacy.  In 
early 1997 a federal-provincial memorandum of understanding was 
signed initiating feasibility studies for marine conservation 
areas in the Buena Vista—Notre Dame Bay areas of Newfoundland 
and the Thunder Cape of the Slate Islands area of western Lake 
Superior. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similar to the successful Saguenay—St. Lawrence project public 
consultations in local communities in both regions are 
progressing and public advisory committees are being established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On completion of the feasibility and the consultation studies 
leading to established agreements, a total of four marine 
conservation areas and reserves would be established and six of 
the twenty-nine marine regions would be represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the international level efforts to develop national and 
global representative systems of marine protected areas have been 
underway since the fourth world wilderness congress of 1987. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992 the international union for the conservation of nature, 
the UCN, tabled detailed guidelines on marine protected areas at 
the fourth world congress of national parks and protected areas. 
The Prime Minister committed to new marine conservation areas 
legislation at the IUCN world conservation congress of October 
1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have mixed feelings about the details regarding the 
legislation and this is why our support at this time is limited 
or rather guarded.  We are pleased that Bill C-48 will provide 
the powers, authorities and procedures required to establish and 
administer a system of marine conservation areas and that 
protection and conservation are fundamental specific stipulations 
on management and used to ensure ecosystems remain intact. There 
is clear reference to the ecosystem and precautionary approach 
which has been a key NDP concern in previous bills and acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many aspects to Bill C-48 that we find beneficial, 
many of which are written in such a way that they are very hard 
to share.  We do have some reservations and concerns, however, 
with Bill C-48. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of these concerns is that the department of fisheries will 
have the exclusive jurisdiction on fisheries management concerns. 
We feel that with the creation of these national marine 
conservation areas we need a special consideration of the 
resources that ply these waters and we wish it were other than 
DFO that had input into how these ecosystems are studied and 
managed.

prohibition of fin fish aquaculture, bottom trawling, ballast 
water dumping, intentional introduction of alien species, 
outfalls, waste discharge, recreational artificial reefs and 
dredging provisions.  We would have liked to see all these things 
limited with more specific limitations on them in Bill C-48.  If 
we have a national marine conservation area, all these things 
will have an impact on the ecosystem and will limit our ability 
to benefit from the intelligence we can glean from studying these 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The allocation of sufficient resources for scientific study is 
not dealt with firmly in Bill C-48.  We wish it were much more 
binding and that it contemplated stable funding for the study of 
the ecosystems we will be looking after within these conservation 
areas.  I made reference to a scientist I knew who 
worked at the Nanaimo biological research station off the west 
coast of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very little of the important research that needs to be done in 
order that we may really know our ecosystem and our fisheries is 
being done in the retail commercial market of fisheries under 
DFO.  We feel that having these national marine conservation 
areas would be a huge benefit in terms of having protected areas 
free of industrial development and hopefully as free as possible 
from industrial waste.  It is an ideal opportunity to truly study 
issues like the ageing of groundfish and the impact of species, 
et cetera, in the wonderful ecosystem we would have as our 
laboratory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been extremely slow progress in establishing the 
NMCAs.  We encourage government to move swiftly in this for the 
29 identified areas.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the future of the fishery depends on the protection of 
the marine environment.  When our rivers and coastal waters cease 
being a safe place for fish, we will no longer have healthy and 
abundant wild stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-48 would do for the marine environment what parks have 
done for the buffalo: save a few.  Perhaps it was never realistic 
to expect buffalo to continue to roam the western prairie in vast 
numbers to survive in the face of settlement, agriculture, mass 
hunting and the railway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today our fish stocks are facing the same pressures the buffalo 
faced a century ago.  Cod stocks on the east coast collapsed 
nearly a decade ago due to the mismanagement of the fishery by 
the department of fisheries, corporate greed and the development 
of new fishing methods that allowed our fishermen to catch 
literally the last fish.  When northern cod stocks were 
devastated, my friend, the member for Gander—Grand Falls, 
demanded that those who failed to protect Newfoundland's most 
valuable resource be held to account.  My friend no longer chairs 
the fisheries committee.  Apparently it is okay to call for the 
creation of marine parks but it is considered threatening to 
those charged with protecting those fish stocks and their marine 
environment if we seek to hold them to account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Salmon stocks on both coasts faced similar devastation to that 
suffered by the cod.  Salmon stocks on the east coast have 
already been devastated.  The Saint John River in New Brunswick 
has three hydroelectric dams on its stem and one on a key 
tributary.  Migrating salmon are blocked.  On the west coast, the 
federal and provincial governments have allowed hydroelectric 
dams, poor agriculture and forest practices and industrial 
pollution to threaten the once mighty Fraser River and its 
tributaries as well as rivers and streams on Vancouver Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> and the Saint John 
<I>Telegraph Journal</I> reported on a study by scientists at the 
University of Ottawa.  That study reveals hydroelectric dams are 
silent killers of our rivers.  The study finds that dams stand 
accused of being the principal stressors on rivers.  Such 
findings are not a surprise to fishermen and environmentalists on 
the west coast where the department of fisheries and its minister 
sold out to Alcan and those who would dam the Fraser.  Although 
it claims to be a protector of the fishery, the Government of 
British Columbia has a long history of being seduced by those who 
would build dams.   There is no doubt the province's current 
agreement with Alcan on Kemano does not adequately protect fish 
habitat.  Marine parks will not halt the devastation to marine 
life caused by hydroelectric dams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Toronto <I>Star</I> recently carried a report on the possible 
threat to wild fish stocks from fish farms on the Bay of Fundy: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The salmon slipped into vacuum sealed bags for shipment from this 
brand new processing plant are manufactured, not caught.  They 
are a genetically manipulated species that is born in a plastic

doused with powerful pesticides before they go to market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Disease is at the heart of the controversy over fish farming in 
Canada.  Environmentalists say the periodic epidemics that sweep 
through the farms are clear evidence the industry is not healthy. 
They worry the antibiotics and pesticides used to treat diseases

had its origin in Norway or Scotland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is now a fear that these diseases or similar diseases will 
spread to the west coast.  Marine parks will not protect our wild 
salmon from such threats.  Rather than turning our federal and 
provincial departments of fisheries into centres for aquaculture 
promotion, their main focus must be to continue the protection of 
the marine environment for wild fish.  That does not mean the end 
of fish farms.  There is lots of room for aquaculture operations 
which respect the marine environment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise today at second reading of Bill 
C-48, an act respecting marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I must point out that, as everyone knows, the Bloc 
Quebecois is in favour of measures to protect the environment, 
but not at any cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, members will remember that the Bloc Quebecois 
supported the government regarding the bill that led to the 
establishment of the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine park, in 1997. 
That legislation, along with the act passed by the Quebec 
government, resulted in the establishment of the first marine 
conservation area in Canada, and we are proud of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the legislation, both governments continue to exercise 
their respective jurisdiction in the Saguenay—St. Lawrence marine 
park. The park includes only the marine environment. Its 
boundaries can be changed, provided there is agreement between 
the two governments and provided they hold joint public hearings 
on the issue. These are among the main legislative provisions 
adopted in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing here is that the establishment of that park 
was the result of a co-operative effort by the federal and Quebec 
governments. It is unfortunate that the federal government did 
not choose to follow the same procedure in the case of Bill C-48.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could have followed other examples, such as phase 
III of the St. Lawrence action plan. Let me briefly remind 
members what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 8, 1998, the environment ministers of Canada and of 
Quebec announced phase III of the St. Lawrence development plan, 
the bill for which would be shared equally by both levels of 
government. This is another example of a joint project that 
respects the jurisdictions of each government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the approach in Bill C-48 is not even remotely 
comparable. How then can the federal government be so naive as 
to think that the Bloc Quebecois would support this bill? 
With this bill, the federal government, far from relying on 
dialogue, is seeking to unilaterally impose marine conservation 
areas, regardless of the fact that Quebec has jurisdiction over 
its own territory and its environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is more. The federal government, not content with 
getting involved in Quebec's jurisdictions and sincerely 
believing that ridicule does not kill anyone, is duplicating 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the bill will establish marine conservation areas, thus 
creating a new structure for Heritage Canada and duplicating 
existing marine protected areas at fisheries and oceans, and 
Environment Canada's protected offshore areas. This means that 
the quarrelling is far from over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear to everyone that Bill C-48 does not respect the 
integrity of the Quebec territory. 
In order to establish a marine area, the federal government must 
first become the owner of the territory where such an area will 
be created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is a problem, that is the Constitution of 1867. 
Indeed, section 92.5 provides that the management and sale of 
public lands comes under the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
provinces. Quebec is still a province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the Quebec 
legislation on crown lands applies to all crown lands in Quebec, 
including beds of waterways and lakes and the bed of the St. 
Lawrence river, estuary and gulf, which belong to Quebec by 
sovereign right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This same legislation provides that Quebec cannot transfer its 
lands to the federal government. The federal government, 
however, is not going to be intimidated by Quebec laws, that is 
common knowledge.  Heritage Canada intends to establish its 
marine conservation areas in the St. Lawrence, the St. Lawrence 
estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, three areas in which the 
ocean floor is under Quebec's jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Heritage Canada will thus force Quebec to cede its exclusive 
jurisdiction over its ocean floor.  What a fine example of 
co-operative federalism.  The condition essential to the 
establishment of marine areas in the St. Lawrence is the 
transfer of ownership rights to the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not satisfied with meddling in Quebec's jurisdiction, the 
federal government is doing its best to overlap a number of its 
departments. 
What is the logic in the federal government's decision to create 
marine conservation areas under the authority of Heritage 
Canada, marine protection zones under fisheries and oceans and 
marine wildlife reserves under Environment Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to fisheries and oceans, one site could be zoned three 
different ways and thus come under three federal departments, 
which would each apply its own specific rules, and all of this 
would come under three different legislative measures.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to have this opportunity to rise before the House to 
address Bill C-48.  The proposed piece of legislation is designed 
to protect and conserve representative areas of Canada's marine 
landscape for the benefit, education and enjoyment of all 
Canadians and the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being the International Year of the Oceans, it only seems 
fitting that we are debating a bill which has as its focus the 
protection and preservation of an important part of our marine 
ecosystems for generations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such legislation is far overdue.  For years we have been guilty 
of taking our oceans, rivers and lakes for granted.  We have 
polluted and pillaged our marine environments to the point where 
some species, particularly Newfoundland cod, are nearing 
extinction.  We cannot afford to remain complacent if we want to 
preserve this environment for future generations. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was born in the region of Acadia known as Mayflower, in the 
municipality of Clare.  Much of my childhood was spent on the 
shores of St. Mary's Bay in the little village of Mavilette.  I 
so loved the briny smell of the sea that I eventually bought a 
house right down by the ocean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a great deal of admiration and respect for our ocean, so 
I must speak of my great sadness to see how our natural 
resources are being abused. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituency of West Nova borders alongside three different 
bodies of water:  the Bay of Fundy, the beautiful St. Mary's Bay 
and the Atlantic Ocean.  Surrounded by so much water, it is only 
natural that many of my constituents derive their living from the 
water in some fashion or another.  The three large bodies of 
water that surround West Nova have been the lifeblood for many of 
my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bay of Fundy is home to many different species of marine 
life.  For years Fundy fishing grounds supported a very 
prosperous inshore scallop fishery.  Groundfish used to be found 
in abundance, helping to create a very lucrative fishing 
industry.  Today many of the species fishers depend upon for 
their livelihood are disappearing due to overfishing.  The 
lucrative lobster fishery still remains, but this is also being 
threatened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we begin to seriously address the problems 
facing our fishing industry.  History has shown that we cannot 
afford to ignore today's realities.  Conservation must be the 
pivotal goal of this government if we are going to leave anything 
behind for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative caucus is supporting Bill C-48 
because we feel it is time that we politicians start taking a 
leading role in helping to preserve our environment so that 
future generations will enjoy the serene beauty that presently 
exists throughout most of this country.  We can only achieve 
these goals by taking immediate action through protective 
measures such as those outlined in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deriving one's living from our oceans is a cultural way of life 
for us.  We depend on the preservation of this large habitat not 
only for our survival, but also for the survival of coming 
generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently our coastal regions have been facing another menacing 
attack.  This time it comes from illegal lobster fishers who have 
been pillaging the ocean floors almost unabated by Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans officials.  The lucrative lobster fishery 
could be endangered if strong measures are not immediately taken 
to put an end to this illegal activity.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 18 of this bill explains the application of the act.  As 
I understand it, the minister may designate marine conservation 
wardens to enforce the act and regulations and to preserve and 
maintain the public peace in marine conservation areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is absolutely necessary to hire these people, but I 
wonder where the minister will find the necessary money for this 
project.  With all the cuts to our museum and national parks 
programs, where will she find the funds? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am rather excited by the prospect of having another body of 
enforcement officers patrolling our coastal waters.  Perhaps 
these new recruits could offer our friends in DFO a hand in 
patrolling our waters in search of illegal lobster fishers.  The 
Minister of Fisheries does not seem to realize the extreme 
seriousness of the problem in West Nova.  Registered commercial 
lobster fishers are already very frustrated and angry with the 
department of fisheries for failing to put an end to the illegal 
activity that is presently threatening their livelihoods.  I am 
scared that no noticeable reduction in the lobster catches in the 
next two months will surely lead to violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party has long been concerned with 
preserving our ecosystems.  In 1986 the PC government approved 
the national marine parks policy.  In 1987 the country's first 
national marine conservation area known as Fathom Five in 
Georgian Bay was established.  Unfortunately it has yet to be 
proclaimed and there are still outstanding issues to be 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that although the proposed legislation 
is designed to establish and manage a system of marine 
conservation areas representative of the 29 marine areas, it does 
not specifically identify precise geographic locations to be 
protected.  These sites will have to be chosen through much 
consultation with members of the general public, provincial 
governments and those individuals who earn their livelihood from 
our waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot stress the points strong enough that much consultation 
must be undertaken before any particular area is singled out for 
protection.  Provincial governments, municipal governments, 
affected federal government departments and all stakeholders must 
be involved in every step of the site selection process.  There 
must be a balanced approach taken when exploring in an area.  The 
interests of our fishing community must be taken into 
consideration with that of marine habitat before any agreements 
on locations are finalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conservation is vitally important to all of us but particularly 
to those who make their living from the water.  We cannot simply 
target a location without exploring the long term effects it will 
have on industry.  Our fishers must have a direct say in the 
management of their industry.  We have already witnessed the 
disaster that can occur when they are excluded from the decision 
making process.  It is important that the Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans be involved in the consultation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important that aboriginal peoples be involved in the 
negotiations.  With many land claims still to be resolved, it is 
imperative that they be consulted on creating any new marine 
reserve areas.  There are restrictions on non-renewable resource 
extractions and careful examination of any proposed site must be 
explored as to its potential for oil and gas exploration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotia is finally to reap some economic benefits from the 
Sable oil and gas exploration, thus fulfilling a legacy started 
by the previous Conservative government.  This economic boom 
would not have been possible if the Sable area had been 
designated as a marine protected area.  This is why we must 
exhaust all opportunities for constructive consultation sessions 
with all those who have a vested interest in ocean floors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that the federal government be prepared to 
allocate the necessary resources to protect newly designated 
conservation areas.  Otherwise we will open the doors to constant 
abuse as has been witnessed in our fishing industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore I warn the government against any possible altering 
of boundaries of future marine conservation areas for economic 
benefits.  We cannot afford to have different rules for different 
marine areas as the department certainly appears to have in the 
national park systems where it allows the expansion of Lake 
Louise for economic reasons yet denies economic development in 
Tuktut Nogait National Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the government set a goal for itself of 
establishing 10 marine parks by the year 2000.  It is obvious 
that it will not achieve this goal, but it is important and 
therefore we must choose these marine conservation areas 
carefully. 
The clock is ticking and we cannot afford to waste any more time 
in terms of this important undertaking.

<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to participate in the debate on Bill 
C-48, the marine conservation area act.  Like the hon. Minister 
of Canadian Heritage I believe that Canada has a national and 
international obligation to protect and conserve marine areas 
representative of Canada's 29 marine regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that such conservation efforts are necessary to 
ensure the future existence and enjoyment of these marine areas, 
and I support the concept behind the bill.  I also support the 
polluter pay principle included in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I have several major concerns with the bill. The first 
is with the structure and wording of the legislation. The second 
is with the potential impact of the legislation on natural 
resource development.  As natural resource critic I want to 
address those concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin with my concerns regarding the structure and 
wording of the bill.  Specifically I am concerned about the 
existence of three Henry VIII clauses which would allow the 
government to circumvent parliament.  In contrast to the 
government's position, I am a firm believer in the parliamentary 
process.  I am disturbed by the way the bill attempts to avoid 
the parliamentary process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its summary of the bill the Department of Canadian Heritage 
stated that the proposed legislation required that any proposed 
amendment to the schedules to establish or enlarge a marine 
conservation area or reserve should be subject to scrutiny by 
parliament.  However, the summary failed to mention the 
constraints placed on this scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation delegates responsibility for the raising of 
objections to schedule amendments to the standing committee.  The 
committee has only 20 sitting days after the tabling of the 
amendment to put forth a motion in objection to the amendment. We 
all know the results of the Liberal majority in each and every 
one of the standing committees of parliament and what the 
government whip does to the decisions of those committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If 21 days elapse without any objection the amendments can be 
made by order in council.  If a motion is put forth, the motion 
is debated for no more than three hours before the House confirms 
or rejects the committee's objections.  Clauses 5, 6 and 7 of the 
bill allow the government to side step the usual legislative 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that similar Henry VIII clauses exist in national parks 
does not make the circumvention of parliament any more acceptable 
either in this bill or in any number of other bills the 
government has introduced in this parliament and in the previous 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This aspect of the legislation is particularly suspect as the 
schedules referred to in these clauses are now empty.  The 
government has put forth the names of five areas already targeted 
as future marine conservation areas under the act.  Therefore I 
am as curious as I am sure others are why these five areas are 
not included in the schedule attached to the bill.  I can only 
conclude that they were purposely omitted to prevent full debate 
on the legislation which might include a controversial debate on 
the proposed areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to my second concern regarding the impact of the 
legislation on current and future natural resources development. 
Clause 13 states that no person shall explore for or exploit 
hydrocarbons, minerals, aggregates or any inorganic matter within 
a marine conservation area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I understand the necessity of this clause for the sake of 
environmental protection, I am troubled by the extent of the 
proposed areas.  If each area under consideration is successfully 
designated through order in council as a marine conservation 
area, the entire coastline of Canada extending some distance 
inland and a considerable distance into the offshore area, 
including a number of already proven mineral rich inland areas, 
will be covered under the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation proposes to prevent all future mining and oil 
and gas drilling projects along the entire coastline of Canada. 
This is absolutely unacceptable in light of the fact that Canada 
is already one of the least mining friendly countries in this 
hemisphere.  Under the legislation projects like Hibernia, Terra 
Nova and Sable Island would not be allowed to exist. 
The opportunities that these projects are providing to Atlantic 
Canadians simply would be disallowed.  That is absolutely 
unacceptable and quite irresponsible on the part of the 
government.

removing the possibility of resource development along the 
coastline the government is potentially crippling the future of 
resource industries in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is set up in a such way that it is very 
difficult to remove portions of the conservation area from the 
act.  It takes only an order in council to add a conservation 
area.  The legislation requires an act of parliament for no net 
loss, swapping or removal of a portion of a marine conservation 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This requirement will have serious impacts on natural resource 
industries.  If a marine conservation area proves in future to be 
a valuable and bountiful source of yet undiscovered natural 
resources, it will be very difficult to have the boundaries of 
the conservation area redrawn to exclude the area containing the 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might remind the House that there are a number of areas on all 
coasts of Canada which potentially hold huge natural resource 
deposits, both fossil fuel and mineral deposits that could some 
day potentially be mined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned by the ease with which each new marine 
conservation area can be created and the difficulty involved in 
removing it from that marine conservation area.  By setting up 
the legislation in this way more area than necessary may be 
included initially and cannot be freed from the legislation 
without enormous difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This major obstacle to future development will undoubtedly 
impact on our energy and resource independence.  This leads into 
the last point I wish to make.  The act is clearly intended to 
fulfil preservationist and not conservationist objectives.  While 
these objectives may be noble, as I stated in my initial comment 
they are hardly the usual objectives for a national park or 
historic heritage site.  National parks normally allow relatively 
free public access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation requires authorization by permit for any 
activities in the area or reserves.  The bill aims to establish 
marine conservation areas and reserves under the authority of the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage, the minister chiefly responsible 
for national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the legislation's aims are clearly environmental it would be 
more appropriate to establish authority under the Minister of the 
Environment.  The legislation could then be evaluated by members 
of the House as well as members of the public for what it is, 
environmental legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate that I support the goals of the legislation.  Too 
often Reform members of parliament are portrayed as enemies of 
the environment.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I am 
a firm believer in conservation and responsible development.  I 
understand the necessity for environmental responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's biodiversity is one of the many things that makes our 
nation unique.  I support the concept of sustainable development 
and preservation of Canada's natural environment for this and 
future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also advocate participation in the world community of 
agreements.  I commend the government on the inclusion of the 
polluter pay principle in the legislation although I have some 
doubts regarding its resolve to enforce this principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I cannot support the bill.  My colleagues and I 
want to see parliament restored as the supreme body responsible 
for the creation and interpretation of Canadian law.  Clauses 5, 
6 and 7 subvert parliament's law making role and therefore 
contradict this fundamental belief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this and other reasons as previously presented I reject the 
legislation and encourage other members of the House to do the 
same, to simply stop for a moment and look at the possibilities 
for future job and wealth creation in the development of Canada's 
offshore resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion it has not been the development of our natural 
resources either offshore or onshore that has endangered, as some 
of my colleagues talked about, the fish habitat in Canada's 
oceans.  It has simply been poor management and overfishing, not 
resource development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is perfectly reasonable to expect that Canada can develop its 
natural resources offshore, off all Canada's shores, in an 
environmentally responsible manner and at the same time preserve 
the biodiversity and the environment that exist there.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In looking at this bill in detail members will find that this 
bill is full of ambiguities. Much of the bill is not clearly 
stated.  Where the responsibility crosses over to the provinces 
is not spelled out. There are many things on which this bill 
needs some genuine bookkeeping and homework done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill changes the previous concept in Canada as to what is a 
park.  Traditionally a park was an area relatively free for 
public travel.  A park was established in some cases for heritage 
purposes.  This adds to the meaning of the word park. It becomes 
a marine park and it is being added to the concept of a national 
park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague has mentioned some of the areas where all of the 
power vested here is given to the minister in charge.  In other 
words we can have something take place within and under the act. 
Changes can be made without having to steer them through 
parliament. More and more often bills come before us which give 
the minister the power to make huge changes to an act without 
having to come back to parliament which has to discuss the act in 
the first place but then gives the authority to make substantial 
changes. We do not believe in that.  We believe that if there is 
a substantial change being made to any act, this is the body that 
should make the changes, the elected people, and not the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a classic example of the government sidestepping the 
usual legislative process.  When that is done, the government 
gets into a dictatorial way of operating the nation's business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government wants the expansion of a new marine conservation area 
or a reserve to belong to a standing committee. It would not come 
back to the House; it would belong to a standing committee. The 
majority of the members on a standing committee are from the 
government side.  As a result, we can almost rest assured that 
the standing committee is going to pass what the minister directs 
or asks for.  That is a dangerous precedent in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also very rapidly shrinks the amount of land that can be used 
for exploration, as my colleague has mentioned.  As a matter of 
fact it could possibly contain the entire coastline of a country 
that has more coastline than most. This could all take place at 
the minister's discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, the bill would require not just the 
federal crown to obey it, but it would also insist with respect 
to the provincial waters and resources off the provincial shores 
that the provinces would not have a say in what becomes a new 
marine park or the waters thereof.  We see all kinds of 
difficulties in this when the provinces are not consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another item in the bill which is terribly dangerous. 
It violates all the Canadian principles I have ever read. Those 
appointed to enforce the act would be designated as peace 
officers as defined by the Criminal Code.  These enforcement 
officers would be authorized to enter and pass through any 
private property in discharge of their duties. As I read that, it 
is without a warrant.  They have that right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also anyone who contravenes the law could be fined $100,000, or 
if found guilty of an indictable offence, be fined up to half a 
million dollars.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be something missing in the bill.  While we want 
the act to have teeth and importance, the due process of law is 
not mentioned in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague said, we agree to the polluter pay principle. 
There is no question about that.  We would strongly support the 
bill in that regard.  However, the bill violates the principle of 
the democratic process so much.  We cannot support acts which lay 
the real power of the act in the minister's hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, the rightful place and supreme body for creating and 
interpreting the laws of Canada is this House.  It does not 
belong to a minister by order in council, nor does it belong to a 
parliamentary standing committee. I do not understand why members 
opposite, with almost every bill that comes up, continually want 
to violate these principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This really is not a park bill but is an environmental bill.  We 
believe in sustainability, development and management for the 
environment to preserve both biodiversity and conserve the 
environment for the present and the future.  This bill expands 
the domain of the Minister of Canadian Heritage and encroaches on 
what is more properly the responsibility of the Minister of the 
Environment.  As such, we have real difficulty with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have difficulty with this bill because it gives powers to 
committees, gives powers to orders in council, gives powers to 
the minister which rightly belong to the legislative body here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill requires, as I said, the provincial governments to fall 
in line.  It also requires that natives under their land claims 
also fall in line without any consultation, if the government so 
wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Note that the enforcement officers may arrest without warrant 
and enter private property without permission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of those things are within a bill which the government is 
asking us to pass.  It violates the rule of law.  It violates the 
longstanding principles of justice.  It violates the authority of 
the House as the legislature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those reasons we cannot support the bill even though it has 
many admirable parts to it.  Canadians need most of the bill but 
we do not need to go down the road to dictatorship in 
implementation of the bill in its present form.

<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, last month the finance minister said that Canada risked 
falling back into a deficit so we had to keep taxes ratcheted up 
high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we learn that the finance minister has actually overtaxed 
Canadians by $10 billion in just the first six months of 1998. 
He has set a new record for gouging taxpayers, taking billions 
from Canadians whom the government itself defines as living in 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could the finance minister miscalculate the budget surplus 
by so much?  Why is he trying to hide overtaxation? 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there certainly has been no miscalculation of the budget 
surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member wants to talk about taxation, the fact is 
that last year not only did the government take 400,000 Canadians 
off the tax rolls, it brought in $7 billion of tax reductions 
which will take place over the course of the next three years. 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, taking an extra $10 billion from taxpayers is not 
tax relief.  It is called gouging.  It is called having the 
highest personal income taxes in the western world.  It is called 
punishing employers and employees with unreasonable payroll 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personal income taxes are up $2 billion and corporate income 
taxes are up by almost $1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the finance minister not admit that his so-called 
surplus is nothing more than evidence that he is overtaxing, 
gouging the taxpayers? 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is very clear that six months does not a year make. 
What is painfully evident is that the leader of the Reform Party 
is unable to accept the fact that Canada has a $10 billion 
surplus going into what is a very uncertain economic climate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is really true is that the leader of the Reform Party is 
unable to accept the fact that Canada is doing well in a world 
that is in considerable uncertainty. 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadian taxpayers want a reward.  Where is the tax 
relief? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This month this finance minister is going to try to twist the 
arm of the Employment Insurance Commission to keep ripping off 
workers and employers with excessively high payroll tax rates. 
He has an option to return those dollars to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the finance minister give workers and employers the tax 
relief and cuts in employment insurance rates that they deserve, 
according to the chief actuary himself? 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in the last budget not only did we bring down taxes by 
$7 billion over three years, but we reduced EI premiums by $1.5 
billion last year, which was the largest single reduction in EI 
premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real problem is that the leader of the Reform Party does not 
like it when Canada is doing well.  It is doing well and it is 
going to continue to do well.

morning, then perhaps the finance minister should talk himself 
right around the circle and give tax relief to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has skimmed $10 billion out of the pockets of people—workers

are advocating $9 billion worth of debt reduction, and now they 
are advocating $6 billion in terms of EI premium cuts.  What they 
are advocating is $24 billion to $25 billion in cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is that money going to come out of?  It will come out of 
our health care system.  It will come out of transfers to the 
provinces.  It will come out of the things that count for

<P><A NAME="LINK80"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
our real agenda is to give tax relief.  Our agenda is exactly 
what the actuary's agenda is, which is for the finance minister 
to lower premiums to $1.90.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

would take $1 billion out of equalization for Manitoba and 
Saskatchewan.  They would gut the amount of transfers that go to 
aboriginal Canadians.  They would not support research and

</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this kind of surplus not show that this is government

put forward anti-deficit legislation. He should speak seriously.

the member should know that this government has taken important 
and effective action to discourage young people from starting to 
smoke.  We have done that by introducing some of the toughest and 
smartest anti-tobacco legislation in the western world, which 
restricts access by young people to tobacco and indeed creates 
offences for those who sell tobacco to persons under the legal 
age.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the finance minister is sitting on a $10

Canadian taxpayers and a full $7 billion of that comes from 
workers and employers through EI overtaxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the finance minister come down off money mountain and

lower EI premiums?

</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to reduce taxes.  We have demonstrated that.  We want to 
reduce EI premiums.  We have demonstrated that.  This is not the

the backs of poor families with children.  We are not prepared to 
do it by gutting the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the Reform Party agenda and at least its members ought

last year 2.5 million Canadians earning less than $30,000 a year 
kicked in $2.5 billion in EI premiums.  That is the government's 
record when it comes to taxation of low income Canadians.  I 
think the air is a little thin up there on money mountain.  The 
oxygen is not getting to his brain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that Canadians pay far too much in taxes, 56% higher 
than the G-7 average.  There is a $7 billion surplus in the EI 
fund.  When will the minister wake up and understand that the 
surplus is not his?  It belongs to workers and employers.  When 
will he give it back to them in the form of lower premiums?

In the month of October 57,000 new jobs were created.  The reason 
for that is that the nation's finances have been cleaned up and 
there is a feeling of confidence across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what will lead to job creation.  That is what will lead 
to lower taxes.  The Reform Party ought to understand that 
Canadians are now on a roll and ought to stop trying to stop it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister confirm that by so shamelessly hiding the

since under accounting rules all unplanned surpluses must be 
applied to the debt?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have always said our projections would not be of our optimum 
performance, but of our minimum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud of Canada's victory over the deficit, and I am very 
happy to see that we have a $10 billion surplus for the first

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, being 
100% wrong one month is certainly the minimum in terms of skill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister wants to use part of the surplus for something 
other than debt reduction, he knows he can table a supplementary 
budget to increase, for example, health transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So why does the minister not want to use part of his $10 billion 
surplus to increase health transfers, when all the provinces are 
asking him to do so, when he has the wherewithal and when he can 
do so by tabling a supplementary budget this week? 
<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that 
is just what we did in the last budget.  We increased transfers 
to the provinces by $7 billion over five years, and the Bloc 
members voted in opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at what the Bloc proposes, we realize that they 
want to spend $15 billion this year and $15 billion next year.

its commitment to health as a priority.  The Prime Minister has 
also said that in the months ahead we will demonstrate once again 
that health is to us a central concern.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general and the APEC inquiry have come under a

This weekend we had a former investigator and a former general 
counsel for the commission say that reports have been changed and 
altered in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the RCMP themselves, the people who work for the minister,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the public complaints commission has all the powers of a 
judicial inquiry. In fact parliament established this process to 
deal with issues just like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To respond to the question of the member, the public complaints 
commission is responsible to parliament.  It is not part of the 
RCMP at all.  It is accountable to this House, as was determined 
in 1988 by this House.

independent of this House.  People who work for this government 
would not be phoning the CBC about a reporter if a judge were 
handling this case.

the role of a judge if he has been appointed to take part in an 
inquiry under the Inquiries Act.  That judge would be appointed 
by the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister would set the terms 
of reference of the judge and the length of time the inquiry 
would take place.  This is not the case with the public 
complaints commission.  The report of the judge in an inquiry 
would go to the Prime Minister and the Privy Council Office.

<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on 
a question of privilege. Very 
briefly it boils down to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 5 in the House the member for Athabasca made a 
statement to the effect that the member for Lac-Saint-Louis and I 
have accused Health Canada, quoting from <I>Hansard</I>, “of 
incompetence, negligence and using Canadians as guinea pigs 
regarding the use of the manganese gasoline additive MMT”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I categorically deny having made such a statement.  To the best 
of my knowledge also the member for Lac-Saint-Louis did not. 
Therefore I urge the member for Athabasca to rise in the House 
and retract that statement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK173"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on the same point of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To quote from <I>Hansard</I>, the member for Athabasca mentioned 
that I accused Health Canada of “incompetence, negligence and 
using Canadians as guinea pigs regarding the use of the manganese 
gasoline additive MMT”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I never did any such thing.  I said that Ethyl Corporation used 
Canadians as guinea pigs.  I never accused the Minister of Health 
in any way.  I would like the member to retract his statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Many times we have in the 
House statements and counter statements.  Let the record show 
that the two members who were named in a statement by another 
member have denied that.   This is not a point of privilege. 
However, if the hon. member for Athabasca wants to join in I will 
permit him to.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
along with some of my colleagues attended the meeting in 
question.  I listened to the entire debate.  My member's 
statement reflected my understanding of what the two members were 
saying. I stick with that position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Now the record is straight on both sides. It 
is an interpretation of the facts, not a question of privilege.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>STANDING COMMITTEE ON PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia—Lambton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a question of privilege pursuant to notice given earlier 
today. The background to my point of privilege flows from the 
following events in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, on November 4 the House unanimously adopted the 13th 
report of the Standing Committee on Procedures and House Affairs. 
Second, on November 5 certain members of the House spoke to a 
point of order raised by the member for Surrey Central.  In a 
ruling later that same day it was noted that recommendations Nos. 
1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 required substantive amendments to the standing 
orders and required various technical interpretations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsequently the Clerk was asked to draft proposed amendments to 
implement recommendations Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 of that report 
and submit that draft to the House leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my submission that submitting the redrafted standing 
orders concerning Private Members' Business to the House leaders 
is a breach of my privileges as a member of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The matter of Private Members' Business as noted in the report 
as adopted at page 7 reflects on the non-partisan and 
non-governmental nature of Private Members' Business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker has implemented this principle of non-partisanship 
by ordering the implementation of recommendation No. 5 dealing 
with the conducting of a vote on Private Members' Business. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1505"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT48"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT48"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1505

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an extension of this principle, I must ask for the 
implementation of recommendations Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 by 
reference to members of this House and not by submitting a draft 
to the House leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the spirit and intent of the non-government and non-partisan 
nature of Private Members' Business is to be upheld, only the 
members of this House may pronounce on them.  No intermediaries, 
such as House leaders, should be consulted since by reference to 
House leaders of the redrafted standing orders my privilege as a 
member of this House, certainly during private members' hour, is 
being directly affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My privileges exist by virtue of the office of member of this 
House and no individual or entity, corporate or political, may 
intervene save and except this House itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the House unanimously adopted the 13th report concerning 
Private Members' Business, the House must also pronounce on the 
redrafted standing orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that to refer these redrafted standing orders to the 
House leaders is a breach of my privileges as a member of the 
House in that it removes my right to examine, study, speak and 
perhaps vote on these important changes to the standing orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing orders, as we know, are the rules and regulations which 
the House has agreed on for the governance of its own 
proceedings.  It is noted in Beauchesne's sixth edition at 
paragraph 9 on page 5: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All rules are passed by the House by a simple majority and are 
altered, added to, or removed in the same way. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That paragraph also refers to the role of the standing committee 
on procedure in being a permanent source of recommendations for 
changes to standing orders.  What is of interest to me is that 
there is no mention of reference to government House leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Briefly, these changes to the standing orders are for private 
members' hour.  Therefore to refer these proposed changes to the 
House leaders is to put into the hands of five people the 
possible fate of the rule change recommendations which were 
adopted in a report by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the House leaders may never agree and hence they may 
never return to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beauchesne's also notes on page 5, paragraph 9: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no procedural reason why any Member cannot introduce a 
motion to alter the rules— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore suggest that a prima facie case of privilege exists 
and with Mr. Speaker's permission I would like to move a motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK177"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to comment briefly on this question of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure the hon. member opposite that as far as the official 
opposition is concerned the spirit and principles contained in 
the 13th report of the Standing Committee of Procedure and House 
Affairs are not up for negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the House leaders will attempt to do is find a swift and 
convenient means to get these draft standing orders changed 
before all members of the House for a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I accept that there is a leadership in the House.  While I hope 
that leadership can come to a unanimous decision, it is not a 
requirement to advance the progress on this very important 
matter. 
We make progress in this House with unanimity or without 
unanimity. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1510"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking for the private members of the official opposition in 
the House, we are not going to back away just because there is no 
unanimity.  The way I see it, if all the House leaders agree then 
a motion will be moved by unanimous consent. If there is no 
unanimity then we move the motion under the rubric motions during 
Routine Proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have considered all other options with the following 
observations other than that process I just described.  The first 
is Private Members' Business.  The terms of consideration for a 
motion under Private Members' Business would be subject to the 
luck of the draw.  A follow-up motion complying with an order of 
the House should not be subject to a draw.  I would discount 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A supply motion would do the same trick to some extent.  It may 
not be appropriate to implement a measure affecting private 
members, a majority of whom sit on the government side the House, 
with an opposition motion.  In addition, there are precious few 
votable opposition motions available to the opposition to be used 
to implement minor rule changes on which the House already 
pronounced itself last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I looked at the government orders and the government 
has the most opportunities and flexibility to introduce and move 
motions.  However, I agree with the member's argument that the 
House, independent of the government, adopted the 13th report of 
the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I would welcome the government's initiative in this 
regard, the responsibility to implement the details of these rule 
changes is not at this stage of the game a matter of ministerial 
responsibility.  The motion that was adopted by the House did not 
ask the government to bring forward these changes.  This is 
clearly a matter for the House to consider and it is not the 
prerogative of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that for the most part the only motion a private 
member can move during Routine Proceedings is a motion to concur 
in a committee report.  However, there are extraordinary 
circumstances where a private member can move a motion under 
motions.  This was done in the last parliament by the member for 
Crowfoot.  The extraordinary circumstances in that case was that 
the Standing Committee on Justice refused to report a private 
member's bill back to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government has many tools at its disposal to deal with 
a similar situation for a government bill, a private member does 
not.  The Speaker recognized this extraordinary circumstance and 
quite correctly interpreted the rules to provide a mechanism for 
a private member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The circumstances today are also extraordinary and when Mr. 
Speaker considers all options, as I just did, there is only one 
logical conclusion. A motion to comply with the order of the 
House from November 4, 1998 regarding standing order changes can 
be moved by unanimous consent or under motions during routine 
proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the timing of these changes is crucial.  One of the 
aspects of the changes would be to protect private members' 
motions or bills from prorogation.  Prorogation is a bill killer. 
It is well known that cabinet does not like some of the 
initiatives of the backbench of late and may be tempted to use 
its bill killing powers to silence them and put them in their 
place.  The government backbench and the opposition have 
effectively filled the policy void of this government. For this 
reason cabinet may be the biggest obstacle for the implementation 
of these new rule changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if it wants to kill this initiative it will have to do 
it democratically.  And in case it has not noticed, there are 
more of us than there are of its members, unless the Prime 
Minister appoints 151 ministers to his cabinet. He is going to 
lose this one.  The private member is going to win.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first of all, the Chair has 
ruled on this issue previously.  To bring this issue today before 
the House and to develop it much further is in a way questioning 
the Speaker's ruling which has already been rendered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, how the House leaders will deal with this issue will be 
determined at the conclusion of the negotiations that Mr. Speaker 
has set out, not before they begin.

proposition and I have not appealed the Chair's ruling.  I could 
not do so, nor would I have the intention of doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, something has just been raised with regard to private 
members' items and prorogation.  Need I remind the House that all 
bills disappear at prorogation:  private members' bills and 
government business.  In the past we have sought, between 
parties, to find ways to reactivate bills at various stages and 
we have achieved a consensus in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have more faith in the co-operation between political parties 
than perhaps some have indicated on the floor of the House today. 
I am confident that such good arrangements can and will be made 
in the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to add a few brief remarks to the 
points raised by the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton.  The point 
he raises is very interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, as a House leader I have a bit of a conflict speaking 
to this.  However, I would say that the House leaders, whom the 
Speaker has said should make the changes to the standing orders, 
are perhaps not the appropriate ones to do so.  I will make that 
argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset, the Conservative Party is in favour of the 13th 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the problem came upon this House without 
notice and perhaps without the forethought which might have 
prevented this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it regrettable that the report of the Standing Committee 
on Procedure and House Affairs lacked the precision and the 
crispness that one would normally associate with that committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, as the Speaker has discovered, the committee 
failed to draft its report in such a way that would give effect 
to its own recommendations if the report was adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assume that this was perhaps a deliberate action on behalf of 
the committee and that it was not prepared to place the changes 
it adopted to the standing orders before the House in its report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past Speakers have intervened to prevent the House from 
going down that road.  However, the Speaker has given a ruling in 
a genuine attempt to assist this House with a difficulty not of 
the Speaker's creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a disturbing trend, I might add, of the government 
trampling over private members' bills, including those of its own 
backbenchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Sarnia—Lambton is quite correct to feel 
aggrieved.  I do not welcome being placed in this position 
myself, nor does the Chair.  Frankly, this all came about as a 
surprise.  I want to assure the member that there was no 
consultation with other House leaders prior to this matter coming 
forward or the Speaker giving his ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the way the committee has drafted its report, the 
House has no vehicle by which to give effect to these 
recommendations.  The committee has a duty to present the House 
with clear recommendations which, if adopted, would achieve the 
changes that the committee desires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the objections of the member for Sarnia—Lambton.  It 
is clear that the Speaker cannot get involved in the process of 
formulating questions for the House, but neither, I suggest, can 
the House leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The simplest remedy, which I offer with respect to the Chair, is 
for the standing committee to do its work again, send the matter 
back, and make the amendments to the standing orders that it 
desires.  Otherwise the House is left with a document which is 
not much more than a vague wish list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the duty of the House officers or the Speaker to clear 
up this matter, it is a matter for the committee itself. 
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to rise in this House today to voice my support 
and my caucus' support for the question of privilege raised by 
the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may not know this, but the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs, which tabled the report which was 
unanimously adopted after concurrence, is composed of a majority 
of Liberal members of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, Mr. Speaker, for your information, I provide to the 
members of this House the fact that not only is the majority of 
the committee Liberals, but that indeed the chief government 
whip, the deputy House leader of the government and other 
prominent members of Parliament from the Liberal Party who have 
significant responsibilities in the government are on the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am puzzled as to why the government is concerned about 
adopting all of these recommendations from the committee when it 
was the Liberal part of the committee which wholeheartedly 
embraced and endorsed the recommendations that were made.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, the NDP member, yours truly, was the only 
one who had some concerns about what was in the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That aside, I would abide by and certainly support the 
initiative which took place in the House with respect to moving 
concurrence unanimously and adopting the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand in support of the question of privilege put forward by 
the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton.  I believe that government 
members should shake their heads in bewilderment if they are 
opposed to this document when it was their own government that 
embraced it, promoted it and put it forward on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the member's question of privilege on this issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
too would like to rise in support of this question of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that in this House there is only one member 
who is not represented by any political party, I believe, and 
that is the member for York South—Weston.  He too is interested 
in private members' business and in fact would not be represented 
at negotiations among House leaders because he does not have the 
privilege of being represented by any of the House leaders in 
this place.  So the private members' business would go forward, 
about which he would be particularly concerned and interested, 
and yet he would not have any input through a party structure in 
those negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this comes back to the House in a format that we again have 
to decide whether we are going to accept it or not—and we agreed 
the other day to concur in the report—all we can do is really, 
really, really agree.  We have no choice.  The House has spoken. 
It is time to move it forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On those two points I agree with the member's question of 
privilege, not only with respect to his privileges, but 
particularly with respect to the member for York South—Weston 
who will be left out of this process. 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  First of all, with respect 
to the question of privilege of the hon. member for 
Sarnia—Lambton, I do not consider the point which he brought up 
to be a challenge to my ruling.  I want to make that understood 
at the outset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what we have had here today is an airing of the ideas 
which were put forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to recapitulate this issue for the House so that we 
are on the same footing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that on November 4 a unanimous decision was made by 
the House to proceed in a certain manner with regard to a matter 
that was before the House.  When the House pronounced on the 
matter, the Speaker, who has to put into effect what the House 
has decided, looked at those points of the decision which were 
procedural.  Those points which were procedural and could be 
implemented at the time were implemented at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reserved a decision on the other points.  Forgive me if I do 
not have the numbers in front of me, but they were the numbers 
cited by the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was left, as the Speaker, trying to decipher what the House 
had decided.  The House had clearly decided to proceed.  That was 
a decision made by the House.  Therefore, on those matters which 
could be changed at the time, I acted on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the others I had to seek advice.  In order to do that, I 
thought the best way for us to proceed would be to ask the clerk 
of the House to draft motions which he would put into the hands 
of the House leaders.  I presumed that the House leaders would 
have discussions with members of their own party.  But at no time 
did I say or did I intend to say that the House leaders would 
decide on these changes.  The House leaders would, I hope, agree, 
but it is the House that will be seized with making this decision 
when it comes to the floor of the House itself.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the member's question of privilege is concerned, I 
would rule that he does not have a question of privilege, but he 
surely has a grievance.  I believe that there are methods by 
which grievances can be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not be so bold as to suggest that any one member, for 
example the House leader for the Progressive Conservative Party, 
has all of the solutions, nor does the House leader for the 
Reform Party.  But surely these are points which might be 
considered when this material is put into the hands of the House 
leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would advise and I would recommend to those members who feel 
aggrieved, if they do not already know all of the means that are 
at their disposal to rectify the situation, that we would surely 
be able to give advice on some of the procedures which would be 
available to members to rectify this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I repeat that the decision will not be taken by the 
House leaders alone.  The decision will be taken by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is no further debate on this matter at this time, we 
will leave you to your devices at this point.

the jurisdiction of a particular minister or any particular 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I am in the Chair and when these decisions have to be 
taken, I have to make a decision on how “personal” they are.  I 
judged today that we were getting a little bit close.  I asked 
the hon. member to be very judicious in his choice of words and 
then I asked the member to put the question.  The question still 
had the preamble and that is why I intervened.

<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> To address the issue of small weeks 
adjustment projects, two 18-month pilot projects were established 
covering a total of 29 employment insurance, EI, regions where 
the unemplyment rate was above 10%.  One of the main reasons 
these projects were put in place is to help supplement the weekly 
benefits for those who qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Human Resources Development Canada, HRDC, is currently reviewing 
available information on the small weeks adjustment projects and 
will be considering whether they should be renewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Preliminary results indicate that between the implementation in 
May and August 1997, 130,000 claims have been established with 
small weeks of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These results also indicated that more women, 61%, that men are 
small week claimants, and individuals, both men and women, who 
participated in the projects received, on average, $19 more per 
week.  This is an increase of about 10% on their benefit level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, 18 of the 22 regions in Atlantic Canada and Quebec 
participate in the projects.  Ontario has 5 regions out of 16 
participating and western Canada has 6 participating regions out 
of 16.  As the projects are directed toward high unemployment 
regions, over 51% of the claims originated from Quebec and 35% 
from the Atlantic provinces.

projects are to the New Brunswick economy, and all EI regions in

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (for the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development)</B> moved that Bill C-56, an act respecting 
an agreement with the Norway House Cree Nation for the settlement 
of matters arising from the flooding of land, and respecting the 
establishment of certain reserves in the province of Manitoba, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise to address the House on Bill C-56, the Manitoba claims 
settlement implementation act.  I am pleased to speak in support 
of this proposed legislation which will address outstanding 
commitments to Manitoba first nations and pave the way for 
greater economic self-reliance and self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will recall that when this government unveiled 
“Gathering Strength: Canada's Aboriginal Action Plan”, we made 
a commitment to renew the relationship with the aboriginal people 
of Canada. This is not a goal that can be achieved overnight.  It 
will involve many steps, large and small.  Bill C-56 is one such 
step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new partnership called for in Gathering Strength must be 
built on a foundation of trust and co-operation between Canada 
and first nations governments and communities.  To establish that 
trust we must first of all fulfill our historical obligations to 
aboriginal people.  Bill C-56 will help us do that for a number 
of Manitoba first nations.  Although this proposed legislation is 
technical, its overriding objective is quite simple:  to 
facilitate the implementation of claim agreements in Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In doing this, Bill C-56 will address a number of specific 
commitments set out in Gathering Strength.  It will affirm and 
honour treaties, which are the cornerstone of Canada's 
relationship with its aboriginal people.  It will strengthen the 
capacity of first nations governments to make decisions about 
community lands and moneys as they move toward effective, 
legitimate and accountable self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By overcoming obstacles that have slowed progress in the past, 
Bill C-56 will foster economic growth and development, consistent 
with our Gathering Strength commitment to support strong 
communities and people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members can see, the bill has two parts.   Part 1 deals 
with the flooded land master implementation agreement signed by 
the Norway House Cree Nation last year.  Part 2 relates to the 
establishment of reserves in Manitoba under claim settlements, 
including treaty land entitlement agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear at the outset that Bill C-56 will not 
give effect to any settlement agreement.  The goal here is simply 
to ensure that land claim agreements, including those that may be 
negotiated in the future, can be implemented quickly and 
effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will review the key elements of Bill C-56 for the benefit of 
hon. members, particularly those across the way, who may not be 
familiar with the proposed legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 1 of the bill is specific to a single Manitoba first 
nation, the Norway House Cree Nation.  Hon. members will recall 
that Norway House was one of five Manitoba first nations that 
were severely affected by flooding caused by the hydroelectric 
projects in northern Manitoba in the early 1970s.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In an effort to address the devastating impact of the flooding 
on first nation communities, property and traditional 
livelihoods, Canada and other affected parties negotiated the 
northern flood agreement in 1977. Unfortunately the passage of 
time has shown the agreement to be flawed and difficult to 
implement.  Despite years of effort, little progress was made in 
implementing many of its important and key elements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 the parties to the northern flood agreement were able to 
reach consensus on a process for resolving the many outstanding 
issues.  The proposed basis of settlement has provided a 
framework for negotiating master implementation agreements with 
four of the five affected first nations, the most recent being 
with Norway House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to report that the Norway House master 
implementation agreement is now being implemented.  However, part 
1 of Bill C-56 is needed to affirm certain elements of the 
agreement in law, just as previous legislation passed in this 
House has affirmed elements of the other three master 
implementation agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically Bill C-56 will ensure that any lands provided to 
Norway House in fee simple title will not become special reserves 
under section 36 of the Indian Act.  This will enable the people 
of Norway House to use and control these lands as they see fit 
without the often burdensome administrative requirements the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development must impose 
under the Indian Act and other federal legislation and strict 
management rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a similar vein, Bill C-56 will ensure that compensation 
moneys owed to Norway House will not be administered as Indian 
moneys under the Indian Act.  Instead these moneys will be paid 
to and administered by a trust that has been established by the 
Norway House Cree Nation and which operates under its direction 
with proper accountability safeguards in place. Again, the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development will have 
no role in managing these moneys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These exemptions from the Indian Act will have two strategic 
outcomes.  Most importantly they will increase the Norway House 
Cree Nation's self-reliance and self-government capabilities. At 
the same time they will lighten the administrative load for the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third thing this part of the legislation will do is give the 
master implementation agreement precedence over the northern 
flood agreement when a claim arises that could be settled or 
adjudicated under either agreement. The adjudication process set 
out in the master implementation agreement is widely regarded as 
being a superior approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, part 1 of Bill C-56 will ensure that Canada has access 
to the provisions of the Manitoba Arbitration Act when dealing 
with disputes under the master implementation agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Norway House Cree Nation will also benefit from part 2 of 
the bill which is intended to advance the implementation of claim 
agreements in Manitoba by facilitating the transfer of lands to 
reserve status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gathering Strength calls for the development of vibrant on 
reserve economies. In order to do that we need to expedite the 
process of establishing reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of background, part 2 of Bill C-56 has its origins in the 
issue of treaty land entitlements.  As hon. members are aware, 
not all first nations received the full amount of land promised 
to them when they signed their treaties. For the past several 
years this government has been working to resolve this historical 
injustice by providing additional reserve lands to first nations 
with treaty land entitlements, including 26 first nations in 
Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of this process, it has become clear that we need better 
legislative mechanisms to facilitate the transfer of lands to 
reserve status.  Toward this end, part 2 of Bill C-56 will 
empower the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
to set apart as reserves any of the lands selected by Manitoba 
first nations under a claim agreement. This will avoid the 
lengthy and cumbersome process of obtaining an order in council 
which is the approach currently used to establish reserve status.

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the main objective of part 2 is to establish more 
effective mechanisms for accommodating and protecting third party 
interests that are identified during the reserve creation 
process.  This will give first nations reasonable access to a 
broader range of lands that have development interests or 
potential.  It will also significantly reduce the time required 
to add lands to reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sooner lands are identified and added to the reserve, the 
sooner they can contribute to the economic and social progress of 
the community.  The key is to allow a first nation to consent to 
a third party interest on lands it wants to add to the reserve 
before those lands have actually been granted reserve status. The 
current wording of the Indian Act does not allow for this.  A 
first nation can only consent to the creation of interests on 
land that is already part of the reserve, not on land that is 
simply being proposed for reserve status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This effectively eliminates from consideration many parcels of 
land that have an existing third party interest, even something 
as basic as a right-of-way.  The first nation cannot deal with 
the third party interest until the land is granted reserve 
status.  The holder of that interest is unlikely to agree to the 
transactions without a guarantee from the first nation that its 
future rights will not be at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-56 addresses the issue by giving Manitoba first nations a 
pre-reserve designation power as well as a pre-reserve permit 
granting power, each power being aimed at accommodating different 
kinds of third party interests.  It also deals with the process 
first nations must follows to grant such interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pre-reserve powers will not only apply to existing interests 
but will also allow a first nation to negotiate new rights that 
will come into effect upon reserve creation.  This will ensure 
that first nations can take advantage of the development 
opportunities on their selected lands even before the reserve 
status is granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I noted earlier, the impetus for the legislative changes set 
out in part 2 of the bill has been the desire of Canada, the 
Government of Manitoba and first nations to expedite the 
settlement of treaty land entitlement.  At the same time these 
mechanisms will be made available to all other Manitoba claim 
settlement agreements, existing or future, that involve additions 
to reserves.  These include the Norway House master 
implementation agreement dealt with in part 1 of Bill C-56, as 
well as the other three master implementation agreements signed 
under the northern flood agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a treaty land entitlement first nation Norway House will also 
benefit from the proposals to facilitate the transfer of lands to 
reserve status, which explains my earlier comment that Norway 
House will benefit from both parts of Bill C-56. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing controversial about the proposed legislation. 
It does not create new powers for first nations governments.  Nor 
does it impose new obligations on Canadian taxpayers.  In fact it 
will do the opposite by relieving the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development of some if its administrative 
responsibilities and by speeding the process of reserve creation. 
It also establishes clear cut legal mechanisms for protecting 
both third party and first nations interests in lands selected 
for additional reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is simply a good, clean piece of legislation that will move 
Canada forward in addressing its commitments to aboriginal 
people, strengthening the capacity for self-government and 
improving socioeconomic conditions on reserves.  It deserves the 
support of hon. members, particularly hon. members of the Reform 
Party.  I urge them to join me in voting to send Bill C-56 to 
committee for proper, due and quick review.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to rise to speak to Bill C-56 which is 
somewhat different from other bills that have gone forward in 
relation to Indian treaty land claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a huge area of land to be transferred.  It is something 
like 1,100,629 hectares and covers much of the northern part of 
Manitoba.  Although we are talking about one specific band right 
now, it will include more with the total land claim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $76 million being provided is not a large amount, but I 
would agree with the hon. member on the government side who just 
mentioned speed.  We in the Reform Party would like to see that 
an additional amount of land could be added to the particular 
reserve with speed so that some of the items outlined in the bill 
could be accomplished in a hurry.   With that in mind, I think we 
will find support from the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree that there are historical obligations.  There is no 
question about that.  Across Canada most people agree 
fundamentally that we should honour those treaties and it is time 
we got at it.  We in the Reform Party are no different.  We agree 
with that as well.  We have these historical obligations.  As the 
hon. member mentioned, this land will be added as quickly as 
possible to the reserve status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The term self-reliance is a very important one.  It is up to the 
government and all Canadians to see that self-reliance in fact 
takes place.  However we do have some questions.  I have some 
questions in particular within my own constituency.  I would like 
the term self-government to mean the same thing for the 
settlement of a land treaty in Saskatchewan or one in northern 
Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that in this negotiation, the acquisition of land 
and the establishment of new reserves we could have different 
types of government for first nations.  At the same time we would 
then have a quasi-judicial group of people not falling under the 
same piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incumbent upon the government to give us some idea and to 
give Canadians some idea of what the new partnership it talks of 
is about.  I believe they are being sincere about that.  I 
believe they are talking about a new partnership, a new way or a 
new understanding.  To me partnership means a new understanding 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What puzzles me with land treaty agreements is that no one seems 
to be able to identify what is meant by self-government, as the 
hon. member mentioned.  Is it right from reading the bill that 
self-government is up for negotiation by each of the land claims? 
As a new reserve is established or land is added to a reserve in 
my constituency, in moving toward self-government is it a 
negotiating matter, much like when they are given money to buy 
new land, which land is acquired through an agreement of the 
seller?  Nobody quarrels with that, but as the land moves over 
into the reserve and falls away from the tax base, is there any 
compensation for the loss of another type of self-government, the 
municipal government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not seem to have anything carved in stone or concrete 
about what we mean by the term self-government.  I support the 
bill wholeheartedly.  It was a long time coming.  I believe it 
was started in 1977 and here we are 21 years later.  That is 
nothing anyone can be proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be quite open with the government opposite, it is incumbent 
that the rest of Canada knows or has some idea in the settlement 
of treaty lands what is being negotiated. 
I have five reserves in my constituency and I know these people. 
I have 43 rural municipalities.  They are all subject to one set 
of rural municipal law and regulations.  I cannot imagine in 
rural Saskatchewan the government functioning without an act, 
some guidelines or some frames of reference.  It just would not 
work.  I think the hon. gentlemen opposite understand that.

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to have a new partnership then that partnership is 
between the new governments and the rest of Canada: other 
municipal governments, the provincial governments and with the 
federal government.  Until that is clearly spelled out that 
partnership is an unknown quantity.  This concerns Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the other day that I first worked among the Nisga'a 
people the second year of teaching school.  I was there with my 
wife.  It was a great time.  They were great people.  I made a 
return visit there.  I talked to the people I hunted moose with 
and the fellow who cut my hair.  I had more hair then; I needed a 
barber.  I asked them at that time what they wanted from 
self-government.  They were not quite sure in this partnership. 
For instance, one chap was very interested in an economic 
venture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my hon. colleague opposite who just spoke to the bill and I 
were going into a business agreement, we would have to follow the 
business agreement criteria set out in the province in which we 
were working.  I think he understands that.  If we were to be in 
negotiation with the local RM, we would have to appear before 
that RM. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that for people wishing to come on to reserve 
status land and wishing to enter an agreement need some 
government. There also needs to be rules in which they can 
operate and in which the other people coming in can operate.  We 
could have all kinds of different agreements and arrangements 
without a clear definition of the statutory laws that must be in 
place.  It would not be healthy for any first nation not to have 
some consistency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In talking to these people I find that this is exactly what they 
want.  They want to break from their traditional past.  They want 
self-government but they want it from the grassroots up like in 
the recent municipal elections in Saskatchewan where so many are 
elected each year and follow the guidelines within the municipal 
act.  We understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the use and control of their lands as they see fit. 
We agree with that.  We agree that a municipality, a city or a 
town can pass bylaws in control of their land.  There will not be 
any opposition or quarrelling in that regard, but there will be 
strict management rules as was mentioned in a statement of 
another hon. colleague.  Once that applies and if I live in the 
RM of 40 in southern Saskatchewan I must follow certain 
management rules of that RM. Therefore, if I move into another 
RM, for example No. 72, the same set of rules apply.  Then there 
would be continuity.  In this partnership we have an 
understanding not only among natives but among other citizens in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like the term the hon. member used respecting accountability 
and safeguards being in place.  In order to have accountability 
and safeguards in place we must move immediately to establish the 
groundwork of self-government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must have accountability.  They are crying out for 
accountability.  All Canadians are crying out for accountability, 
yet more and more we are moving away from accountability.  The 
further government gets from people, the less accountability 
there seems to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I agree with the bill and while I will be supporting it I 
do not support the continuance of further legislation unless the 
House has some idea of a bill or of anything else that may be 
used to describe the situation so all Canadians will know what we 
are negotiating.  Are we negotiating self-government with each 
individual parcel?  Does self-government mean the same with the 
Nisga'a as it does with the Norway House Cree?  These are 
questions Canadians are asking.  Can the hon. gentleman opposite 
answer those questions or does each individual Cree nation become 
a separate identity in itself where the laws and regulations 
regarding the people will not be governed by some other source? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems we are going down a trail in terms of future 
development, which may include mineral development or whatever, 
where there will be all kinds of lawsuits open to ourselves and 
all kinds of lawsuits open to the first nations unless we put 
together some kind of package.  They cannot be sovereign unto 
themselves.  That is not what Canadians understand.  Canadians 
understand that the Government of Saskatchewan is not sovereign 
unto itself. They understand that its capital city of Regina is 
not sovereign and that it must fall under provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a big vacuum out there, a big void in which we have no 
other answers.  I wish we could have some.  The hon. member just 
spoke very well on Bill C-56 and I wish we could discuss these 
issues.  They are very important issues not just for the 
development of the new land treaties but important for the rest 
of us in Canada to know where we are going.  It is incumbent on 
us that we do not proceed within a huge vacuum of 
misunderstanding concerning the meaning of self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform will be supporting the bill and we are pleased to support 
it but we also raise the question being raised from coast to 
coast to coast of why we do not get down and finalize what 
accountability and partnership mean. Accountability and 
partnership mean nothing until we define what we mean by 
self-government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the request 
of my colleague, the member for Saint-Jean and Bloc Quebecois 
critic on native affairs, I am pleased to rise to speak to Bill 
C-56 entitled An Act respecting an agreement with the Norway 
House Cree Nation for the settlement of matters arising from the 
flooding of land, and respecting the establishment of certain 
reserves in the province of Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill has two parts.  The first concerns the agreement 
reached with the Norway House Cree Nation on the settlement of 
matters arising from the flooding of land. 
The second provides for measures to facilitate the settlement of 
claims by the creation of reserves in Manitoba or by the 
addition of lands to existing reserves.  Let us discuss the 
first part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This part concerns the main agreement on implementation signed 
in 1997 by Canada, Manitoba and the Norway House Cree Nation. 
In the early 1970s, the latter was affected by a flood caused by 
the construction of a hydroelectric dam on the Nelson and 
Churchill rivers and by changes to Lake Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1997 agreement settles the obligations of the federal 
government under the 1977 Manitoba Northern Flood Agreement 
between the federal and Manitoba governments, Manitoba Hydro and 
the northern flood committee, on behalf of the first nations of 
Cross Lake, York Factory and Nelson House, and the Norway House 
and Split Lake Cree nations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1997 agreement terminates the Norway House Cree Nation's 
claims regarding obligations unfulfilled by certain parties to 
the Manitoba Northern Flood Agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The flood agreement signed in 1977 was designed to remedy the 
adverse effects of the Lake Winnipeg development and Churchill 
River diversion projects, which had resulted in approximately 
12,000 acres of first nations' reserve land in northern Manitoba 
being flooded, as well as another 525,000 acres of non-reserve 
land that was used by the first nations affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the purpose of the agreement was to compensate 
the first nations affected by Manitoba Hydro work. While nicely 
described by then Indian affairs minister Warren Allmand as a 
charter of rights and benefits for those affected, the fact 
remains that the agreement was a precondition to any work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, people's lives cannot be disrupted without at least 
compensating the communities for the significant changes imposed 
on them by hydroelectric projects. The extensive damage caused 
by the Lake Winnipeg development and Churchill River diversion 
projects completely changed the traditional way of life of the 
bordering communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must bear in mind that more than 1,200 Cree people who lived 
alongside or near the affected areas were faced with an entirely 
new environment overnight. 
The Norway House Cree had always hunted and fished.  They had to 
learn new ways and adjust to a totally different way of life. 
In particular, because of excessive water pollution, there were 
serious problems with fishing and with drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members can imagine what an odd “charter of rights and 
benefits” 
this is for the Norway House Cree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, although the Manitoba Northern Flood Agreement called 
for programs and compensation to make up for unfavourable 
outcomes, the roles and responsibilities of the parties still 
had to be clearly defined.  Because of this, there were delays 
in the project and in the meeting of common obligations, such as 
adding land to the reserves, as well as arrangements to promote 
employment opportunities for the communities and environmental 
monitoring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Implementation was not making any progress, and the parties 
could not reach agreement.  In short, the spirit of co-operation 
was very much absent.  More than 20 years passed without any 
clear definition of the mechanisms.  For far too long, all sorts 
of dispute resolution approaches were resorted to, rather than 
giving preference to a co-operative and co-ordinated approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The four parties, in a desire to enhance the efficiency and 
reduce the costs of this undertaking, resumed negotiations in 
order to settle the claims and better define the obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The four parties therefore negotiated a basic proposal to settle 
the outstanding land claims and the unfulfilled obligations. 
This proposal served as a starting point for negotiations with 
each first nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the help of this proposal, negotiations were successful 
with four of the five first nations. 
As a result, the minister of Indian affairs signed 
implementation agreements with the Split Lake Cree First Nation 
in June 1992, the York Factory First Nation in January 1996, the 
Nelson House First Nation in March 1996, and the Norway House 
First Nation in December 1997.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A law is now required to provide for the comprehensive 
implementation of the provisions of the main Norway House Cree 
Nation agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first part of Bill C-56 will permit the lands provided within 
the framework of this agreement to be exempt from the provisions 
of the Indian Act.  This will also permit the Norway House Cree 
Nation to use them for economic development purposes without

1997 agreement exclusively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this legislation provides recourse to Manitoba 
arbitration legislation in the event of a dispute between the 
parties to the implementation agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first part, we consider these elements satisfactory and 
necessary to the implementation of the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will now discuss the second part of Bill C-56, which concerns 
the federal government's commitments in the Framework Agreement, 
Treaty Land Entitlement, Manitoba.  This part has broader scope 
than that of the framework agreement or of the first part of the 
bill. 
It will facilitate the implementation of all territorial claim 
settlements in Manitoba in which the government agrees to expand 
the size of a first nation reserve with, of course, the 
agreement of the first nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-56, the minister of Indian affairs may set aside 
lands as a reserve and the first nations will be able to create 
or accept the interests of third parties earlier in the reserve 
creation process than is currently possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of agreement is not new.  There are in fact already a 
number of agreements in existence to settle claims in Manitoba 
providing for the expansion of first nation reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first, and most significant, is the one that concerns treaty 
land entitlement, which the federal government has not fully 
honoured. In other words, it has not granted enough land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a major issue for the Manitoba first nations that signed 
or approved Treaties Nos. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 10 between 1871 and 
1910. Each of these treaties provided that reserve land would be 
allotted to first nations by the federal government according to 
the size of each family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the majority of first nations in Manitoba were assigned 
the land they were entitled to under these treaties, 26 nations 
were not assigned land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In most cases, the problem arises from an inaccurate enumeration 
of members of the first nation or from insufficient land 
allocation. Efforts made to remedy this problem in the 1970s and 
1980s were hampered by disputes on issues such as the 
availability, size and suitability of unused crown land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province's public interest requirements regarding new 
reserve land and the applicable area assessment method now 
required to meet the obligations set out in the treaties also 
hamper the settlement of claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seven of the Manitoba first nations affected, who conducted 
separate negotiations, reached specific settlements regarding 
their land entitlements arising from treaties signed with Canada 
between 1994 and 1996. As a result, the federal government is 
required to add more than 170,000 acres to existing reserve 
land. It must also pay in excess of $51 million in financial 
compensation to the first nations affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Manitoba, its main obligation is to set aside 100,000 
acres of unused public land—out of a total of 170,000 acres—as 
reserve land, which represents some $9 million.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 29, 1997, Canada, Manitoba and the Treaty Land and 
Entitlement Committee representing 19 other Manitoba first 
nations from among the 26 first nations that did not obtain 
lands under treaties, signed the framework agreement on land 
rights arising out of those treaties.  These 19 first nations 
obtained reserves in excess of 1 million acres in all, but this 
still represents less than 1% of all of the land base in 
Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the federal government, the total cost of this settlement 
and implementation of the framework agreement relating to the 19 
first nations is in the order of $98.8 million over 15 years, 
starting with the date of signature, May 29, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other settlements in Manitoba which could come under this bill 
are the agreements with the Brokenhead and Sapotaweyak first 
nations, to whom the federal government must pay total 
compensation of $404,883 and provide lands with a total area of 
close to 213 acres for expansion of their reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois, via its aboriginal affairs critic, did not 
oppose the bill on the Split Lake first nation settlement, which 
was given royal assent on December 15, 1994.  Nor did the Bloc 
Quebecois oppose the agreements with the York Factory and Nelson 
House first nations, which were both given royal assent 
in April 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is, therefore, in favour of the underlying 
principles behind this bill. 
So, at first glance, we see no litigious or confusing clauses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Bloc Quebecois has serious reservations about the 
process the Norway House Cree Nation will follow in approving 
this agreement.  In the <I>Globe and Mail</I> of January 30, we learned 
that the federal government had approved a second referendum on 
this agreement, a referendum we consider undemocratic, to say 
the least.  Let me explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the initial referendum on the matter of the Norway House 
agreement failed to pass by five votes on July 29, 1997, the 
Minister of Indian Affairs agreed to another referendum but 
changed the rules beforehand.  First, a problem with the voters' 
list was cited.  This was reviewed, because native people living 
off the reserve had apparently voted in the first referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new rules, only native people living on the reserve 
could vote.  The voting system had been developed by the federal 
government and published in a guide book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the second vote on the matter, the federal government also 
offered $1,000 to each voter supporting the agreement.  We can 
understand that the approximately 5,000 native persons living at 
Norway House, who have a hard time making ends meet, were not 
going to spit on this money.  On the contrary, it was manna from 
heaven just before the holidays.  It seems that the federal 
government simply bought votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out to this House that the second referendum, with 
the vote buying scandal, was held, believe it or not, at the 
very moment the federal government was asking the Supreme Court 
to decide on the legality of Quebec's unilateral separation from 
Canada.  Rather ironic, is it not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously this sort of practice raises some questions.  For 
example, what is the relationship between the federal government 
and the native peoples?  Is vote buying common practice?  Is 
this how the Minister of Indian Affairs consults the native 
peoples in this country?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we trust the federal government in the future, when we 
know that the Department of Indian Affairs supported such an 
unjust operation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the light of the role of the federal government in this 
obviously undemocratic referendum process, how can it then turn 
around and try to give Quebec lessons on the democratic 
consultation of its people and the interpretation of the 
results? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever the case, while the Bloc Quebecois does not oppose this 
bill in principle, rest assured that our native affairs critic 
will be questioning the witnesses appearing before the standing 
committee on this highly irregular event sullying Bill C-56. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I to rise to 
support this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at it in the context of the four categories in the 
minister's statement “Gathering Strength: Canada's Aboriginal 
Action Plan”, this bill would fit very well in renewing 
partnerships considering it has been 21 years with very little 
action or compensation for the first nations that were flooded. 
It is important to be willing to renew an partnership.  It will 
strengthen aboriginal governance.  It will support strong 
communities, people and economies.  But it remains to be seen 
whether it is a commitment to a meaningful and lasting change for 
these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister goes on to say that we have to learn from the past, 
that we cannot afford to repeat mistakes.  First nations people 
have suffered disproportionately for the last 150 to 200 years. 
They cannot afford to have government make any more mistakes on 
their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The document deals with increased access to lands and resources, 
that many first nations lands and natural resources offer the 
most important opportunity for creating jobs and economic 
development.  The government will work with first nations, 
provinces and territories to strengthen the co-management process 
and provide increased access to land and resources. This is a 
very important political document because it reaffirms the 
commitment to self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Reform colleague said he did not know what self-government 
meant and that it should be the same for everyone.  But the whole 
objective of self-government is so that it is not the same.  It 
offers each band within a framework the ability to set its own 
standards and laws.  They develop very differently culturally 
than Europeans.  They have justice systems and access to 
resources that are very different from ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Yukon land claims are not such a scary idea.  Most of the 14 
first nations are now implementing self-governing land claims. 
It has been a real benefit to Yukon.  It was a long struggle. 
Implementation is not easy.  Our auditor general has said he does 
not know if the amount of money settled will be enough to achieve 
the objective of the claims.  But it is still an improvement.  It 
is an improvement in the communities that have self-government. 
We can see the change. We can see the activity.  We can see the 
determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague was also worried about first nations governments 
not being accountable.  By having self-government they are 
accountable to the people who elect them rather than being 
accountable to a bureaucracy that doles out money.  They have to 
answer to their people.  The first nations leaders I know are 
very dedicated individuals who have worked tirelessly on behalf 
of their people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-56 is concrete proof of a movement toward living up to 
the “Gathering Strength” document.  It has two parts.  Part one 
of the bill relates to the settlement of matters arising from the 
flooding of lands as provided for in an agreement concluded with 
the Norway House Cree Nation which is very specific to it. Part 
two establishes mechanisms to facilitate the implementation of 
claims settlement in Manitoba by the creation of reserves or the 
addition of lands to existing reserves.  Some of the first 
nations were shortchanged when their reserves were developed. 
This gives them the opportunity to redress it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part one pertains to the master implementation agreement signed 
in 1997 by the Government of Canada, the province of Manitoba, 
Manitoba Hydro and the Norway House Cree Nation which was 
affected by the flooding arising from hydroelectric projects.

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first nations affected by the flood were Cross Lake, York 
Factory, Nelson House, Split Lake Cree First Nations and the 
Norway House Cree Nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the 1997 agreement which was difficult to implement 
there was very little movement in settling long outstanding 
problems and compensation.  There was a proposed basis for 
settlement and four out of five first nations have signed the 
master implementation agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part two is the reserve establishment.  It is related to federal 
government commitments in Manitoba to treaty land and the 
entitlement framework agreement of 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the basis of agreement from the first nations, part two would 
facilitate the implementation of any Manitoba claim settlement 
where Canada commits to increase first nations reserve land base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This document provides a guide to the future. Treaties impose 
serious obligations and we need to respect those obligations and 
move forward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak on Bill C-56, an act respecting an 
agreement with the Norway House Cree Nation for the settlement of 
matters arising from the flooding of land and respecting the 
establishment of certain reserves in the province of Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This omnibus legislation deals with two issues, the Norway House 
Cree Nation's master implementation agreement resulting from the 
flooded land which we refer to as part one, and reserve 
establishment particularly in reference to the Manitoba treaty 
land entitlement framework agreement of 1997, part two.  I will 
be speaking on these two issues separately and in the order I 
have just outlined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I express my reservations about the combination of bills this 
legislation represents.  While I certainly realize the issues are 
related, I feel these issues should be addressed separately to 
provide each bill with the attention it deserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the Norway House Cree Nation and the master 
implementation agreement that was signed by the first nation, the 
province of Manitoba, Manitoba Hydro and the federal government 
on December 31, 1997, while it was 1997 before the agreement was 
signed it was more than 20 years earlier that hydroelectric 
projects changed the way of life for the aboriginal people living 
in northern Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the early 1970s the Churchill and Nelson Rivers 
diversification projects and the late Winnipeg regulation project 
flooded more than 212,000 hectares in northern Manitoba.  The 
flooded area included 4,800 hectares of reserve land and an 
additional 200,000 hectares of land used by the aboriginal people 
for traditional purposes such as hunting and trapping.  This 
affected five first nations, the York Factory, Split Lake, Cross 
Lake, Nelson House and Norway House Cree Nations, comprising 
approximately 12,000 aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognizing the severe impact of the hydroelectric projects on 
the first nations in the area, Manitoba Hydro, the province of 
Manitoba, the federal government and the affected first nations 
signed the northern flood agreement.  The flood committee 
incorporated was formed to act on behalf of the five first 
nations in the area affected by the flooding.  It was this 
organization that signed the northern flood agreement on behalf 
of the first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the northern flood agreement was to provide a 
framework for compensating the first five nations affected by the 
hydroelectric projects. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These projects included the construction of up to 14 power 
stations, four which were constructed by the mid-1980s and 10 
which will not be finished until the year 2050, a full 73 years 
from the signing of the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a long process and the results of the projects are 
far-reaching, both in terms of the amount of land flooded and the 
future impacts these developments will have on the life of the 
aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since its signing on December 16, 1977, the northern flood 
agreement has been fraught with all kinds of problems.  This has 
led to the failure to implement many of the provisions contained 
in the agreement and the first nations have been forced to seek 
restitution through a dispute resolution program.  This was noted 
by the auditor general in his 1992 report as a major fault and 
something the federal government should address since adversarial 
positions seldom assist those groups most affected, in this case 
the five first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not my intention at this stage of the process to go into 
any detail about the advantages and disadvantages of this 
legislation and the agreement it represents.  That is best left 
for the committee stage when we will hopefully have an 
opportunity to hear from those individuals impacted by the 
flooding and the subsequent agreement.  If it is anything like 
the tobacco bill, that process will not unfold to the 
satisfaction of many of us in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking to the terms of the agreement, under the master 
implementation agreement the Norway House Cree Nation will 
receive $78.9 million in cash and hydro bonds, and approximately 
24,000 hectares of new reserve lands.  The settlements of the 
other first nations range from $47 million and almost 14,000 
hectares of new reserve land as well as 1,100 hectares of fee 
simple for Split Lake to $62.5 million and 22,000 hectares of new 
land reserve for Nelson House.  York Factory received more than 
$24 million and 7,700 hectares of new land reserve as well as a 
segment of fee simple land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money mentioned in these settlements is being placed in 
trust for the first nations.  In the case of Norway House, 
Keenanow Trust will be handling the proceeds.  This is an 
important revision of the agreement since the money will not come 
under the terms of the Indian Act.  Instead, first nations will 
have greater control over how and where this money is spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order for the federal government to negotiate settlements 
individually with the first nations it was necessary for the 
parties to negotiate the proposed basis of settlement.  Since the 
first five nations were at various stages of agreement this was 
the only way for the government to bring to closure the northern 
flood agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cross Lake, the only first nation that has not signed an 
implementation agreement, remains opposed to doing so and has 
been active in seeking support for treaty recognition of the 
northern flood agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Manitoba aboriginal justice inquiry of 1991 stated that the 
governments of Manitoba and Canada recognize the northern flood 
agreement as a treaty and that the two governments should honour 
and properly implement the terms of the northern flood agreement. 
While the master implementation agreement signed by the four 
other first nations will ensure that they begin receiving the 
compensation promised under the northern flood agreement, the 
question of treaty status for the agreement has never been 
completed to the satisfaction of all parties involved.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The community of Norway House voted in a referendum to accept 
the master implementation agreement.  While questions have been 
raised about the validity of the process, the community members 
voted to accept the agreement in the second referendum.  This 
should reflect the community's acceptance of the terms of the 
agreement and their satisfaction with it, or at least a desire to 
move on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is not necessary for the implementation of this 
agreement since it has already been going ahead.  Instead, this 
legislation is another step toward implementing terms of the 
northern flood agreement and the federal government's obligations 
under the agreement with regard to the first nations which have 
signed implementation agreements.  This does not apply to Cross 
Lake as I mentioned earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue is one I look forward to studying more closely at 
committee stage, particularly in terms of the first nations' 
views of the agreement and the northern flood agreement.  One 
advantage of this legislation should be the opportunity to move 
away from the dispute resolution process to a more conciliatory 
form of negotiation and discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a look at the second part of this 
legislation to establish reserves in the province of Manitoba. 
Part 2 of this legislation is expected to assist in establishing 
reserves where an obligation exists in a current or future 
agreement to set aside land for this purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has particular relevance for the signatories to the 
Manitoba treaty land entitlement framework agreement.  Treaties 
signed between 1871 and 1910 and, in particular, the claims of 19 
first nations affected by these treaties make up the treaty land 
entitlement framework agreement.  These 19 first nations signed 
the agreement in May 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the original treaties of 1, 2 and 5, each family of five 
was to receive 65 hectares of land.  Under treaties 3, 4, 6 and 
10, 260 hectares of land was to be provided for each family of 
five. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Problems arose, however, when the first nations claimed they did 
not receive their full entitlement.  Some of the band member 
counts were inaccurate because members of the first nations were 
away hunting when the surveys were taken.  It sounds like what 
happens to us when we attempt to set up a voters' list.  The same 
problems occurred there.  In some cases insufficient land was 
selected by the first nations when given the opportunity to claim 
their land under those very treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These entitlements have never been settled with some of the 
first nations.  In fact, only seven of a possible twenty-six 
first nations that did not receive their full allotment under the 
treaties have since settled their claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The land to be allocated to the 19 first nations who signed the 
agreement last year is 445,400 hectares.  That is slightly less 
than 1% of the land mass of Manitoba and about 8% of the province 
of Nova Scotia.  The province of Manitoba will provide most of 
this land from crown land that the federal government and 
Manitoba agreed would be used for this purpose.  The remainder 
will be provided from private landowners on a 
willing-buyer/willing-seller basis.  In other words, private 
landowners who do not wish to sell their land will be not be 
forced to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this legislation is attempting to do is make it easier to 
establish reserves from both the federal government's and first 
nations' perspective.  One of the ways the legislation will 
achieve this is by providing the minister with the power to 
confer reserve status.  That is an important point.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This eliminates the need to obtain governor in council approval, 
thereby reducing the time the process takes in facilitating full 
implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, changes are made in the legislation to address 
third party interests.  If agreements currently recognize third 
party interests in the land, these interests would typically fall 
under provincial jurisdiction.  With the creation of a reserve, 
however, they would fall under federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accommodating this change in jurisdiction is a very 
time-consuming process.  This has been mentioned as one of the 
major delays in processing land selections for reserves.  With 
the legislation, reserve status will be conferred subject to that 
third party interest so the easement or right of way of the third 
party would be able to continue as the jurisdiction changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps of greater importance or significance, especially for 
the first nations, is that this legislation allows first nations 
to establish new third party interests, not just those existing 
at the time of reserve establishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This also allows first nations to take advantage of economic 
development opportunities as they become available instead of 
being forced to wait for the land to be given reserve status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention again that this legislation, both parts 
1 and 2, requires greater research and consideration on the part 
and on behalf of the Parliament of Canada.  This is something we 
look forward to doing at committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, I certainly realize that the agreement is 
already in place and functioning.  The purpose of the legislation 
before us is to provide the government with the authority to 
implement some of these provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 2 requires further study as well.  It appears to be 
beneficial to first nations by allowing them to take advantage of 
conditions on a timely basis and speeding up the process of 
reserve creation.  Obviously, this would be beneficial to the 
first nations, but again it needs to be examined very closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to studying this legislation, along with my 
colleagues, at committee stage and learning more about these 
issues.  At this time I still have some serious reservations, as 
does my party, about this legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
noticed in the comments of the member for New Brunswick Southwest 
that he said that some portions of this bill are not needed 
because negotiations are ongoing.  I did not quite catch what he 
meant, but it was something to that effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I understand correctly, this is to finalize compensation for 
land flooded for a hydroelectric project that dates back some 21 
years.  I am having an extremely difficult time understanding how 
such a project would go ahead without having the terms of the 
settlement in place before the project was undertaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is the case with a lot of members of this House, I have some 
experience in municipal politics.  I know that if a municipality 
built a road and annexed some land from neighbouring landowners, 
whether crown land, Indian reserves or fee simple land, and then 
later went back to the people who were affected and said “By the 
way, we built a road on your place and we would now like to start 
to negotiate what it is going to cost us for that right of way”, 
for the land that has been taken off the title or out of 
production or whatever, that is an absolutely backward way of 
doing business.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most important considerations in a project that is 
going to go ahead is what the acquisition of the land is going to 
cost. That is something that has to be determined up front, not 
some 21 years later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member for New Brunswick Southwest would like to 
clarify the comments he made so that I could better understand 
where he is coming from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in terms of clarification 
and going beyond the member's question, I mentioned the 
historical impact of this bill.  It goes back to the principle of 
negotiation and how these agreements are established in the first 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the point the member was making was that before we go 
into this we need long term planning.  In other words the 
government sometimes goes into these negotiations in the wrong 
way.  We have seen it happen so many times and it is something we 
could accuse the government of doing almost on a day to day 
basis. We have to put some of those mistakes behind us. We have 
to proceed with the only process available to us. Recognizing 
that there have been mistakes in the past, hopefully we will 
minimize mistakes in the future as we hold the government's feet 
to the fire. Again I go back to the opportunity we will have at 
committee stage with regard to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking the member very seriously, he is absolutely right.  So 
little planning has gone into some of these mega projects, 
developments and settlements that impact on a good many 
Canadians. Sometimes those projects and the disruption of the 
lives of families happen close to home. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like the hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest 
to comment on something that has been troubling me for a long 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government seems to be entering into a multiplicity of land 
settlements with native bands or groups of natives on an 
absolutely ad hoc basis.  Nobody gets the same deal.  It is not 
just a question of wanting one size to fit all, we have one size 
that fits practically nobody. Every time there is a problem or 
every time somebody has been shortchanged on their land 
entitlements, the government sets out through the department of 
Indian affairs and comes up with something absolutely new. This 
is not a sensible way to do business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is made even worse by the fact that most of the 
agreements when made contain what we call a me too clause. If one 
band gets a better deal on a particular problem than some other 
band got on its, then the other deal can be reopened and brought 
up to speed so that everybody gets treated equally. If everybody 
is going to get treated equally, why could we not have a set of 
rules, some guidelines, something to follow before we get into 
these things? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I could not agree with 
the member more. It is a good question to ask. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that we do have the justice minister in the House this 
evening.  She is probably in a better position to answer on 
behalf of the government than I am. More precisely hopefully the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development will be in 
the House before the evening is over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are legitimate questions that have to be answered by the 
government itself.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to get involved in the last bit of the debate that is 
going back and forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some personal knowledge of the hydro dams in northern 
Manitoba.  I worked on them as a carpenter.  It was a good source 
of work for me but I was also quite sympathetic with what was 
being done in the outlying areas. 
I visited some of the communities prior to their being flooded 
and then again after they were flooded.

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To help shed some light on the questions raised by the member 
for Wetaskiwin, I think that in 1977 when the northern flood 
agreement was finally negotiated it was actually about seven 
years after the main damage of flooding was done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the first big wave of flooding happened, the Notigi 
diversion from the Churchill River into the Nelson River, nobody 
really understood just how devastating that would be.  They 
actually thought raw land could be flooded without clearing any 
of the trees first. They were flooding whole forests.  They did 
not realize that mercury and other stuff leeching out of the soil 
after years would kill off the fish stocks.  A mumbo-jumbo of 
trees fell to the point where the lakes were not navigable, even 
if people did want to fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In and around 1970 it was an NDP government that orchestrated a 
lot of the original flooding.  It completely underestimated the 
damage from what it was doing.  The government thought it could 
simply take people from one community, transplant them and flood 
the old land and they would still be able to use the lake and 
land in the same way.  It just was not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the northern flood agreement was negotiated, it was clear 
that far more compensation would be needed and far more impact 
studies would have to be done before any real package could be 
arrived at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Happily we are now at the point where a lot of this stuff is 
being remedied.  A lot of measures are being taken to try to put 
these people's lives back in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somebody mentioned that $76 million is involved in the Norway 
House case.  It is a lot of money, but the net profit to Manitoba 
from selling hydroelectricity is $250 million to $300 million per 
year.  It is a huge revenue producer.  Manitobans also get the 
lowest hydroelectricity costs anywhere in the country, two and a 
half cents per kilowatt which is about one-third of those in many 
other places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the comments of the 
member for Winnipeg Centre speak highly of him and show that he 
is very sensitive to the issue before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of sensitivity, I will go back to what the member said 
on the human tragedies that result because of some of these 
developments.  That is something I do not think we have ever, 
regardless of what colour or stripe the government is, considered 
in the sense of how it should be considered when it is the 
environment and human tragedies that play out. Those are things 
that are left for others to clean up and deal with. It goes back 
to what some of the other members have mentioned.  It goes back 
to planning, talking to the human beings who are affected by some 
of these developments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a legacy we do not want to leave.  We want to show that 
we are compassionate, that we have to act in the best interests 
of all Canadians. Disrupting people and the environment is not 
the answer. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight 
at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Davenport, the Environment; the hon. member for

Insurance; the hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest, Bill

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate on Bill C-56, the Manitoba 
claim settlements implementation act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My comments will be on part 2 of the legislation which 
establishes a means to facilitate the implementation of land 
claim settlements in Manitoba through the creation of new 
reserves or the addition of land to existing reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When government is adding new land to reserves or creating new 
reserves would be an ideal time to look at the problems in terms 
of accountability on reserves now and to deal with some of the 
problems. 
It is unfortunate that did not take place in conjunction with 
this legislation.  There was very little change that will lead to 
any improvement in accountability.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my presentation I am going to refer to a task force I put 
in place.  It is a process that three aboriginal people from my 
constituency of Lakeland and I went through.  We wanted to find 
out how aboriginal people felt on these issues. I will go through 
all the recommendations later and then talk a bit about how the 
task force was set up. I will start by summarizing the comments 
on accountability made by some of the aboriginal people who 
presented their cases before the task force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They said that more transparent financial reporting by band and 
settlement administrators is needed.  That is no surprise.  We 
have brought example after example before this House of the 
complete lack of proper fiscal accountability on reserves. They 
were clear that governments at all levels, including native 
leaders, need to consult their members far more often to ensure 
that those consultations are reflected in policy.  They even said 
that they would like an ombudsman set up to act on complaints 
laid out by aboriginal Canadians.  They also said that more 
scrutiny needs to be applied to bands during elections. These are 
only some of the recommendations made by task force members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I looked at this piece of legislation, I asked how many of 
those recommendations have been implemented in this legislation. 
The response from Liberal members across the floor was why should 
they implement changes that came from a Reform MP. I would like 
to respond by saying that these recommendations did not come from 
a Reform MP.  They came from a task force which included three 
aboriginal people and myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We make it very clear that the recommendations do not 
necessarily reflect Reform policy, which is fine.  The fact is 
that none of the task force members are Reform Party members.  I 
do not even know if any of them are Reform Party supporters yet, 
although I do believe that because of the work we have done some 
of them probably are. However, that is not important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important is that the recommendations came from the 
aboriginal people themselves.  And my question is, why are those 
recommendations not reflected in this piece of legislation?  I 
believe the members across the floor will probably say “Why 
would we want to act on a document that has been presented by a 
Reformer”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read the response from the Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development to the task force report we 
presented to her.  She finally agreed after a little public 
pressure was applied to meet with the task force members.  We met 
in September during the first week that the House sat in this 
session.  She gave us ample time to present our case and I 
appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very disappointed however by some of things she said.  I 
will begin by referring to her letter of response to the task 
force report.  My disappointment will become evident as I read 
through part of this letter: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that accountability is an important issue. 
Accountability is key to governance.  We cannot build 
self-sustaining, self-governing First Nation communities without 
it.  It is an issue for us as Parliamentarians with a 
responsibility to Canadians, and it is an issue for First Nations 
who must be accountable both to their communities and to 
Parliament for the resources appropriated to support service 
delivery. 
That is clearly the conclusion of the work of the Lakeland task 
force, just as it was also identified as important in the work of 
the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples and in “Gathering 
Strength: Canada's Aboriginal Action Plan', our response to the 
work of the royal commission.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the minister is saying is the Lakeland aboriginal task 
force presented really fits in perfectly with what has been 
presented in the past, including by the most recent royal 
commission and by her response to that commission.  So she is 
acknowledging that what is in the report is what they heard 
through their commissions as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess my question is why has the minister not acted on it. Why 
has she not at least made some movement toward acting on some of 
these recommendations in this piece of legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read more of the minister's response: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within “Gathering Strength”, we set out four themes to be the 
foundation of a changed and better relationship with aboriginal 
people in Canada: renewing the partnership; strengthening 
aboriginal governance; developing a new fiscal relationship; and 
investing in communities, people and economies.  In each of these 
themes, there is an opportunity and a commitment to focus on 
accountability. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She goes on to reinforce that accountability is important and 
there is a lot of work to be done: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the tremendous challenge of building sustainable 
governments, and what a complex and difficult process that is, we 
need to recognize that there are reasons for this.  For decades, 
we have tried to control virtually every aspect of the lives of 
the aboriginal people.  First nations are making their own 
decisions—defining how they want to be governed; setting their 
own priorities; and speaking up to hold their leaders 
accountable. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with part of that statement. Aboriginal people are 
speaking up to hold their leaders accountable.  But what I do not 
agree with is the minister's statement that first nations are 
making their own decisions and defining how they want to be 
governed.  What really is happening is that the leadership of 
first nations and the national leadership such as Phil Fontaine 
are saying what they want to see in terms of accountability. 
They are saying how they want leadership to look.  But the 
aboriginal people have not been listened to at all.  The 
grassroots aboriginal people have not been listened to and that 
is reflected in this legislation and what is missing from this 
legislation. I think I will leave my reading of the minister's 
response at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to explain a bit about the Lakeland aboriginal task 
force and why we started it, how it was set up and then refer to 
some of the recommendations.  I know I am not going to get 
through the recommendations but I am going to really try this 
time to get through the first five, because it is the first five 
that deal with accountability, both fiscal and electoral. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think those examining this legislation and my colleague and 
others who have spoken on this legislation already have pointed 
out some of the things missing in terms of accountability.  I am 
sure as this debate goes on others will point out how the 
minister has really missed the target in terms of taking the 
opportunity when she is expanding reserves and establishing new 
reserves of making sure accountability will be there.  She has 
really missed the boat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I established the aboriginal task force in the 
Lakeland constituency was that shortly after the last election my 
constituency boundaries were changed substantially. Beaver River 
and Vegreville were put together, two-thirds of each, into a new 
Lakeland constituency. In Vegreville the constituency which I 
represented before the election, there were no reserves or Métis 
settlements.  In the Lakeland constituency there are eight 
reserves and four Métis settlements, an aboriginal population of 
probably around 30,000 people which is quite substantial out of a 
total population of about 110,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly after the election I started getting phone calls from 
aboriginal people, some on reserves, some in Métis settlements 
and some living in communities near reserves.  Over the first 
couple of dozen calls I started to see common themes developing. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These themes were that there is virtually no accountability on 
reserves.  What we have are chiefs and councils taking in the 
money, not accounting for it and spending the money the way they 
see fit.  They do not necessarily follow the guidelines that are 
laid out by Indian affairs.  What became very clear is that many 
people living on reserves, the people the money was supposed to 
find its way to, were being completely missed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard one story after another of extremely crowed living 
conditions.  People had nowhere to stay and did not know where 
they were going to spend this winter.  People were not covered by 
health care for special expensive medication. They were being 
completely missed.  I heard from a lot of people who are covered 
under Bill C-31 and who were supposed to have some of the 
benefits of reserves.  They were being pushed aside and felt they 
belonged nowhere.  Chiefs and councils decided they were not 
going to accept those people, so they did not.  I heard from 
dozens and dozens of people throughout the task force process, 
some by telephone calls before we set the task force up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also got calls from people who pointed out specific examples 
of how money was being completely misspent.  In some cases they 
pointed to cases of fraud which were borne out later by 
investigations and audits. Many of these people called for a 
forensic audit.  They wanted audits that determined where the 
money was coming from, how much was coming in and how it was 
being spent.  They felt that the current audits being done on the 
reserves were virtually useless.  It was chiefs and councils that 
ordered the audits and determined what kind of audit they wanted. 
Furthermore, they would only make available a summary and in 
some cases nothing at all.  The accountability was not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After I received enough of these calls I decided that I had to 
do something about it.  As a member of parliament it is my job to 
represent my constituents.  I went to some friendship centres in 
towns near reserves.  I got together with a few people and asked 
them what could be done.  They said they had different ideas but 
said we should get a group of aboriginal people together in one 
place and decide what could be done.  We did that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A group of about 20 aboriginal people met in Bonnyville and we 
set up the aboriginal task force of originally four aboriginal 
members and me.  Then we laid out guidelines that would guide us 
in our process.  We first determined that the purpose of the 
aboriginal task force would be to hear grassroots aboriginal 
people in the constituency.  That was the purpose, to hear them, 
not to tell them what we thought on issues. That is what we did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the process we heard from about 300 aboriginal 
members.  That may not sound like a lot, but several of these 
people, recorded on tape and TV cameras, said they had never 
before in their lives had anyone in any position in government 
really listen to them.  I thought that was a pretty sad 
statement.  It did not come from just one. It came from several 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They did say that from time to time they had a minister of 
Indian affairs listen to certain chiefs and council members.  But 
it was rare.  They said that people listened to Phil Fontaine all 
the time.  The minister listens to Phil Fontaine but nobody has 
ever listened to them before.  It was time and the task force was 
put together to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did listen and we did it in three stages.  We started in the 
first stage with private, confidential consultations.  We held 
these consultations at various native friendship centres around 
the constituency.  The reason we did this was that more 
aboriginal people, particularly from reserves, felt comfortable 
coming in to native friendship centres.  They did not feel that 
they would be detected easily.  Think about that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They felt more comfortable coming to native friendship centres 
but they certainly would not go to a hall in a community near a 
reserve because they were afraid they would be detected and that 
there would be a price to pay from chief and council.  This was 
very common.  Some people who went said they knew they would pay 
for going but they decided it was time to go anyway.  And so they 
did.  We heard from them.  Some of them did pay a price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Charles Favel was there more than once throughout the 
process. I heard from him before we started.  I have a letter 
from his chief and council that says Mr. Favel will be banished 
from the reserve because he went to the media in Edmonton and 
because he was involved with this member of parliament.  He was 
banished from the reserve.  The letter is quite unbelievable.  I 
have copies of it for anyone who would like to see it.  It was a 
bit of a baptism for me as to what can happen and just how 
serious it can be for aboriginal people from reserves to dare to 
say things are not as they should be on reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also put the invitation to chiefs and councils by letter to 
all chiefs and Métis settlement councils in my constituency.  The 
letter we got back said that I basically had no right to do this. 
I could not quite understand that so I sent a letter back saying 
I thought I did.  They invited me to a tribal chiefs council 
meeting.  I went to that meeting where some of the chiefs said 
that I had no right to do what I was doing.  I thought that as a 
member of parliament I had not only a right but a responsibility 
to represent all constituents.  I had not heard that Indian 
people living on reserves or Métis people living in Métis 
settlements or aboriginal people living in communities near 
reserves were not my constituents.  Of course they are.  I am 
going to represent them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk more about this aboriginal report during debate on 
this bill and on Bill C-49.  Then I may get through all the 
recommendations.  I am extremely disappointed that this 
legislation does not show the Indian affairs minister really 
means what she said in her letter of response to the task force 
when she acknowledged there are serious problems of lack of 
accountability, fiscal, electoral and democratic. She 
acknowledged that is the case but I would like someone to show me 
where that is reflected in this legislation, ensuring that as 
these reserves are expanded and as new reserves are established a 
proper level of accountability will be put in place so we will 
know the money that is going to the reserves is getting to the 
people it is intended to go to. It is not happening now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, for 
months we have been listening to the Reform Party thread together 
isolated incidents of problems on reserves.  Reformers have been 
trying to thread those incidents into an overall package that 
aboriginal leadership is corrupt, inept or incapable of handling 
its own self-government.  It is no coincidence that this kind of 
talk is escalating now as we get closer to the historic Nisga'a 
deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout B.C. there has been a very organized campaign to try 
to stop the Nisga'a self-government deal.  We have seen newspaper 
editors manipulating their stories in the press, those who are 
convinced they are against us.  We have seen a former Reform 
Party researcher leave his job with the Reform Party, move to 
British Columbia and set up the B.C. chapter of FIRE, the 
anti-Indian organization from the United States. 
This is now the B.C. chapter of FIRE dedicated to holding 
aboriginal people back.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have sat here and listened day after day to speaker after 
speaker trying to convince everyone that aboriginal people are 
corrupt, mismanage all their funds and some even wear expensive 
jewellery.  I even heard allegations that aboriginal leaders are 
dressing too well, that they are rich and people on their 
reserves are poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To try to imply that it is some kind of national trend, that all 
aboriginal communities are corrupt, is absolutely intellectually 
dishonest.  I have listened to it for about as long as I care to. 
I am sure we will hear more of it as the whole Nisga'a debate 
continues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some comments have been very revealing of the true attitudes.  I 
heard the Reform member for Athabasca say “Just because we 
didn't kill the Indians and have Indian wars, that doesn't mean 
we didn't conquer these people. Isn't that why they allowed 
themselves to be herded into little reserves in the most 
isolated, desolate, worthless parts of the country?”  Other 
Reform members likened Indians living on reserves to people 
living on a south sea island, courtesy of a rich uncle.  Another 
member of the Reform Party accused native Indians of practising 
South African style apartheid because they want to set up their 
own aboriginal self-government and have control of their own 
communities, as if that is apartheid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first time that I heard of that position was on the front 
page of the <I>Up Front</I> magazine.  <I>Up Front</I> is the 
publication of Heritage Front.  That was the postulation of the 
president of Heritage Front, Wolfgang Droege, another former 
Reform Party member, two years ago.  I have a copy of it if 
anyone would like to see it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a disturbing connection between the extreme right 
winger in the country vehemently opposed to aboriginal 
self-government and the comments made by the Reform Party.  It is 
being picked up in the mainstream media by other anti-Nisga'a 
campaigners like Gordon Gibson, the former leader of the Liberal 
Party in British Columbia, who is also involved with FIRE, the 
Foundation for Individual Rights and Equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people believe that all people must be treated equally, 
whereas Judge Murray Sinclair, an aboriginal leader in Manitoba, 
pointed out clearly that to treat all people equally when they 
are in fact unequal is in itself a problem that compounds the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear people laughing.  To try to imply that we can allocate 
the same type of principles to all people equally is not 
recognizing the unequal situation that aboriginal people find 
themselves in now.  Special circumstances are in order.  That is 
why we as Canadians are willing to give special consideration to 
aboriginal self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess I like the comments of the member of the Reform Party 
who spoke previously.  Do you or do you not agree with the 
positions of the anti-Indian movement, FIRE, as chaired by a 
former federal Reform Party researcher, Greg Hollingsworth? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I remind members to 
direct their comments through the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>   Mr. Speaker, I do not know anything 
about this member's reference to a former Reform researcher being 
involved in some sinister kind of organization.  It does not 
sound like something a Reform researcher would be involved in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have heard from this member today is some of the most 
despicable kind of mud slinging I have ever heard.  I have heard 
a lot of it before coming from across the floor, but I do not 
think I have ever heard anything any worse than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He virtually used all the ism words that he could imagine 
without saying them directly.  I think the kind of tactic used by 
this member is what is killing fair and proper debate in the 
House of Commons and across the country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He should be thoroughly ashamed of himself.  For him to imply 
that Reform is trying to do anything but help aboriginal people 
completely ignores the truth.  I hope the member would stand and 
apologize when he gets the next opportunity, because it is a 
despicable approach to take to debate in the House and he should 
be ashamed of himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to refer to one of the member's comments.  He 
thought I sounded like I was saying that all chiefs and councils 
across the country were corrupt.  I do not believe that is the 
case, although we did hear from all eight reserves in the 
Lakeland constituency of very serious claims about money not 
being allocated properly.  Whether that constitutes corruption or 
not I guess is a matter for debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases it is very clear that there was corruption because 
the audits have been done and it was proven through the audits. 
In some cases charges were laid and guilt was affirmed through 
the justice system.  To say that it is across the country, I do 
not believe that is true.  I do not believe it is on all 
reserves, but it is on many reserves and it is certainly a 
problem in my constituency.  We are trying to rectify the problem 
by calling for proper accountability.  That is what the Lakeland 
aboriginal task force heard from grassroots aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get some real accountability into the system so the money 
that is being spent and coming into the reserves from taxpayers' 
through the federal government, the department of Indian affairs, 
and the money from oil and gas revenue as an example are 
accounted for.  How much is coming in needs to be clearly 
accounted for and the people themselves need to know where the 
money is being spent.  On all eight reserves in Lakeland 
constituency the people said very clearly that there was not 
proper accounting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the report we certainly were not attacking chiefs and 
councils.  We were maybe a little kind but that is the tone we 
wanted in the report.  Our recommendation No. 2 was on 
accountability.  To assure sound financial management on reserves 
and settlements the government must provide better financial 
management support for aboriginal councillors and administrators. 
The second recommendation called for some help from the 
department of Indian affairs to teach chiefs and councils how to 
account properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does that sound like we are slamming chiefs and councils?  We 
deliberately took a very conciliatory tone.  We did not attack 
chiefs and councils although some of the individuals who made 
presentations did.  That is reality.  We cannot change that.  We 
deliberately presented it in a way that would allow chiefs and 
councils to improve so that they would become truly accountable. 
That is the tone we took and that is what we presented to the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close by saying that it is extremely sad and troublesome that 
after all this time we would still have the kind of attack 
launched by a member of the New Democratic Party against any 
member of the House.  It would be unfair for any member to be 
painted in the way that he painted some of us today.

Speaker, I am pleased today to be in the House once again to talk 
about aboriginal affairs, particularly where they come into play 
in Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Selkirk—Interlake is located in the centre of Manitoba.  It 
borders and includes the very lake we are discussing today, Lake 
Winnipeg, which flows north into the Nelson and Churchill river

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I could reiterate a bit, Bill C-56 deals with a settlement of 
matters arising from the flooding of land on the Norway House 
Indian Reserve and on other reserves.  It is with respect to the 
establishment of certain reserves, the adding of land to land 
currently held.  The land which was flooded belonged to the 
Norway House Indian Band and would ultimately have become their 
land under treaty entitlements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Manitobans, myself included, have benefited greatly through 
the actions of the Government of Manitoba and its crown 
corporation, Manitoba Hydro.  Native people in Manitoba have also 
benefited greatly in that we now have hydro going into most 
reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members from Manitoba, including the member for Provencher, 
seem to indicate they are experts on Manitoba natives.  I agree 
that no doubt the member has some knowledge.  However, like the 
member from Winnipeg Centre, they do not have all-encompassing 
knowledge of what is going on in reserves.  They could have had 
historical references for the last six to ten years when the 
Reform Party talked about accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal with the bill in two parts.  The first part will be 
with regard to the flooding of land and the second will be with 
regard to some accountability issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Norway House band land which was flooded was excellent 
trapping land.  It was land they had occupied for thousands of 
years.  They should be compensated for that land.  There is 
absolutely no problem with that on my part.  I encourage the 
provincial and federal governments along with the aboriginal 
people as they proceed to compensate for the damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parties to my right, my left and opposite seem to want to 
isolate aboriginal affairs into a stand alone situation.  We 
share this land together.  Our national boundaries are well known 
from coast to coast to coast.  We and the aboriginal people share 
this common land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For just a minute I would like to show that is the case. 
Organizations on Lake Winnipeg in my riding have had some spill 
over effect from the flooding.  The organizations of which I 
speak are the Lake Winnipeg Property Owners' Association and a 
lady by the name of Lorraine Sigvaldason who is important in that 
organization, along with Baldur Nelson and Mr. Nelson Gerrard of 
the Bifrost Lakeshore Homeowners Coalition.  Nowadays the lake is 
at a high level in order to accommodate the generation of hydro. 
All Manitobans are sharing in the benefits and the losses 
associated with major hydro electric developments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some problems experienced in the south end are with respect to 
ongoing excessive and rapid erosion of land, physical loss of 
highly assessed residential property, permanent destruction of 
prime sandy beaches, rapid deepening of the inshore lake bottom, 
devaluation of prime real estate, destruction of wildlife 
habitat, hazards to marine activity in the form of floating and 
submerged debris, and severe financial losses and burdens for 
lakeshore residents.  They suggest some solutions. 
This is a concern that has been around my riding and the province 
of Manitoba for some time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal people live along this lake that is affected by the 
flooding, including the Norway House band and the organizations I 
have spoken of, say the problem has to be acknowledged and 
addressed in an honest fashion.  Lake level regulation must take 
into account actual water levels rather than statistically 
altered and wind eliminated or monthly average levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their request to various levels of governments has been that 
those who have suffered losses deserve compensation whether such 
losses were the direct result of an act of God as in the flood in 
the Red River Valley or the acts of government and hydro. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Issues dealing with aboriginals have to be thought of in the 
context of dealing with all Canadians.  That is what seems to be 
missing in some of the debates on the particular bill as it is 
with many other bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to solutions on Lake Winnipeg, Mr. Wilfred L. 
Arnason suggested that additional causeways near Hecla Island, a 
narrow opening between the north basin and the south basin of 
Lake Winnipeg, could be spanned by additional bridges 
accommodating the inflows of all rivers, creeks and ditches 
entering the south basin.  The idea that there would be an 
additional flow of water out of the south into the north basin 
would help to provide a solution with regard to erosion problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not privy to all the details of how the $78.9 million in 
cash and hydro bonds with regard to how compensation for the 
Norway House band was arrived at, but if the Manitoba government, 
the federal government and the aboriginal people agreed to that 
it would seem to be fair.  I could support that on my part.  The 
moneys owed under the agreement are not payable to the crown as 
Indian moneys but as moneys to be held by the minister in trust. 
I will deal with that in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly agree with the creation of a resource co-management 
board with Manitoba.  Co-management of resources is exactly what 
I have been talking about.  It will be a good aspect of the 
agreement.  As I have noted in past speeches, the ability of an 
aboriginal first nation to pass laws in conflict with federal 
laws, in other words the aboriginal law supersedes, is not in the 
best interests of Canada, of all Canadians or of our living 
together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result when I see the terms co-management and working hand 
in hand, the people of Manitoba both aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal working hand in hand, that is exactly the way it 
is supposed to be.  That is what I am attempting to promote as 
the member of parliament representing Selkirk—Interlake and, I 
might add, representing all Manitobans.  I have been involved in 
various accountability issues with the first nations people where 
people from all parts of the province and most of the aboriginal 
first nations approached me with their problems, concerns and 
their solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned that this money was to go to the first nations 
people to be administered in trust.  This is where the member 
from Winnipeg Centre said that the Reform Party was—he did not 
say crying wolf—trying to take a few little incidents and make 
them into some kind of statement that all chiefs and councils are 
either crooked or mismanaging funds.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier in my speech I said that members opposite, along with 
the members to my right, have not kept an eye on what happened in 
terms of the northern flood agreement which included about six 
other bands.  I would like to refer to what happened when the 
Nelson House band was paid several million dollars from the 
federal government.  It went into a Winnipeg account and through 
a lawyer.  I will not repeat the exact amount of money that was 
to go to the band.  A non-aboriginal consultant and the ex-chief 
of the Nelson House band were involved in handling the moneys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is well known in the House and back in Manitoba that I was a 
member of the commercial crime section of the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police.  We received a complaint with regard to how those 
moneys in trust were handled.  We conducted an investigation.  I 
will not take credit for doing the whole investigation because I 
had some able assistance from other members of the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police.  We laid charges of misappropriation of that 
money which was held in trust, the big guarantee, the guarantee 
that is referred to in the agreement, the money in trust.  Many 
thousands of dollars were taken contrary to the trust agreement. 
We ended up in a court case that went on for some time and that 
chief was convicted of stealing the moneys held in trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear members talk in the House about the Reform Party making 
up stories about possible problems.  I am telling the House and 
all members that the problems are real.  The white consultant 
still had some assets which we were able to seize under proceeds 
of crime legislation and ultimately have forfeited to the crown. 
He passed away before the case went to court so I will not 
mention his name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as we have seen in many thousands of cases across the 
country, when people receive something in trust such as moneys or 
other goods like lands or whatever it cannot be automatically 
assumed that with the fiduciary responsibility, the trust 
responsibility, they will handle the moneys in a manner according 
to the trust conditions, in this case for the native peoples of 
that reserve.  I have told members how the trust agreement did 
not protect the moneys of the Nelson House band. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years I went through RCMP investigations, many times 
with aboriginal reserve complaints from people who felt that 
moneys were being mismanaged.  There was no way, due to a number 
of different factors, of ever laying charges or having a solution 
through the criminal courts.  We laid charges in this one case, 
the Nelson House case, with regard to northern flood agreement 
moneys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ended up retiring from the RCMP and in politics which is why I 
am standing here today.  Once again I have a responsibility to 
the people of Manitoba and my constituency to speak out on behalf 
of constituents in my riding.  Many people on reserves in my 
riding have come to me and said there was an accountability 
problem on their reserves. 
Not only did they have a lot of problems with social conditions 
and lack of housing.  They could not find out where in the heck 
the money coming into the reserve was going.  They saw some 
people doing very well on the reserve, primarily at the elected 
level, but they needed answers.  They needed to find out what was 
going on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When members opposite and the community at large in Canada see 
reports in the paper of Reform speaking out about these issues, 
we are speaking out on behalf of people who do not have a voice 
to speak out on their own.  These are the non-elected people. 
Many of them are women and young people who are not in the 
aboriginal electoral process.  They are not elected officials and 
are not in non-aboriginal government offices.  That is why my 
colleagues and I speak out so strongly on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accountability should be included in these agreements.  Actually 
it should be included for aboriginal governments at the band 
level because each of the bands is separate.  Certain things make 
for accountability in government.  One of the biggest 
accountability factors is money, and I will start with that one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Winnipeg Centre certainly tried to indicate that 
we were trying to scare people and to paint people with a broad 
brush.  I hope what I have said today shows how untrue that is. 
I would certainly be pleased to answer questions after my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been advocating a couple of cornerstone democratic 
principles since the accountability meetings were held.  I will 
list them before finishing speaking so that they remain in 
everyone's mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 31 the aboriginal people of Manitoba, not the Reform 
Party, organized a big meeting in Winnipeg at the Airliner Inn. 
Before that meeting took place I stood in the House and told all 
members about it.  It is in <I>Hansard</I>.  I told them October 
31 was the date of the meeting and that all were invited.  It was 
organized and run by the aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One outside politician came.  It was not the member for 
Provencher.  It was not the member for Saint Boniface.  It was 
not the member from Winnipeg Centre.  It was the Indian affairs 
minister David Newman from the province of Manitoba government. 
He attended the meeting and spoke for at least half an hour about 
all the serious issues dealing with financial funds and problems 
with aboriginal leadership and what could be done about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From all these meetings I have four basic cornerstones of 
democracy that would help provide accountability for the chiefs 
and councils.  The first one is absolute, independent, fair 
election laws to ensure that elections of the chiefs are fair and 
true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is an independent auditor general.  That is the one 
that would provide for accountability of the financial funds. 
There is no reason the leadership of the aboriginal people in 
Canada and the federal government could not already have set up 
some kind of independent auditor general to take care of moneys 
that are for the benefit of aboriginals on our reserves.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have been listening very carefully for the past couple of hours 
to a number of interventions made by members of the Reform Party. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1745"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT80"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT80"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1745

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the comments made by the member of the New 
Democratic Party.  His interventions speak very clearly to the 
problem of the misuse of language and the misrepresentation of 
the issues we are dealing with. I find the debate quite 
interesting as we debate the northern flood agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard talks about self-government, dealing with the 
Nisga'a deal, references to RMs, the most recent intervention 
from this member claiming that he speaks for the people of 
Manitoba on aboriginal issues and talking about the participation 
of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development at 
this rather odd undertaking at the Airliner Inn in Winnipeg.  I 
find the debate is moving off into areas that are not intended in 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is about a bill of compensation that was properly 
addressed by the New Democratic member from Winnipeg.  It is a 
bill about compensation.  The member for Selkirk—Interlake 
talked about the fact he lives on the inlet.  So do I.  We were 
transferred to Norway House when they were building the power 
lines.  My father was a pilot for the government air services for 
many years in 1950s.  We spent a summer there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the hon. member misses the entire point of the debate 
about compensation.  Some of his colleagues have referred to 
that.  The hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest has spoken to 
it very clearly.  This is a question of hydro flooding these 
lands in northern Manitoba and doing it improperly without 
consulting the native people.  I wonder, for example, whether the 
provincial minister who is responsible and is signatory to this 
agreement talked about that at the Airliner Inn in Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an agreement about compensation.  It is an agreement 
about a contract and a breach of contract.  There is a settlement 
between the parties, Manitoba Hydro, the Government of Canada and 
the first nations people, in this case the people of Norway House 
who voted on the bill.  He referred to the cottage owners in Lake 
Winnipeg. Is it not proper, is it not right, that when somebody 
floods somebody's land, that the first nations people would be 
compensated for the lands that were flooded, that this is the 
proper thing for the Government of Canada and Manitoba to do? 
They all signed the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member for 
Provencher and I end up on the same plane lots of times, so we 
may even talk about this again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we will refer to <I>Hansard</I> tomorrow and we will 
see that I spoke quite eloquently, I would say very eloquently, 
with regard to the fact that the Norway House band had serious loss 
of lands and that the compensation of $78 million that was agreed 
to by the various levels of governments, the aboriginal chiefs 
and the people was very fair and should be paid to them.  We have 
no problem in agreeing on that fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The accountability problems deal with much more than this one 
agreement.  As a member of parliament, where the issue at hand 
has brought the broad ramifications it has for the people of 
Manitoba, I would be remiss if I did not touch on those issues 
attached to the bill we are dealing with.  One attached issue is 
accountability for the moneys that will be received by the band 
in trust.  I agree it is normally a very good legal means by 
which money does not go missing.  As I have said, I have seen so 
many thousands of cases of dollars go missing over the years, 
millions, from non-aboriginal and aboriginal holders of trust 
moneys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not make light or cast aspersions on members of the 
House or others who speak up and say that everybody who is 
elected in aboriginal reserves to councils and chiefs are not 
crooks.  They are average people who are getting elected to these 
things.  But there are enough problems that have to brought to 
the attention of legislators and they have to be dealt with.  To 
sit back and pretend that nothing is going wrong and that there 
is no room for improvement is sheer lunacy, to put it bluntly. 
I take pride in speaking out in my riding for my constituents.  I 
have had so many comments from both aboriginal and non-aboriginal 
people that previous members of parliament did not stand up and 
speak in the very means that I am speaking today on behalf of 
aboriginal women and children and others who want to see 
accountability in first nations government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
seeing as I was made reference to a number of times in that 
address, I want to clarify a few things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I said in my remarks is that it is intellectually dishonest 
to try to take a bunch of isolated incidents of problems with 
funds and try to thread that together into an overall picture 
that aboriginal people in Canada are not ready for or capable of 
self-government or the implementation of the recommendations of 
the royal commission which our party stands for. I am not saying 
they are allegations. I am saying they probably are well founded 
incidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made a number of connections with anti-Indian organizations 
like FIRE.  The hon. member can deny any connection to them if he 
likes.  As the ONFIRE begins now, the Ontario version of the 
anti-Indian organization, the director is a Reform Party member 
and activist Judy Kilgore.  Brian Richardson, the founder of the 
Ontario FIRE organization, left his job with FIRE so he could run 
for the Reform Party in the last federal election.  He did not 
want that crossover too public I guess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mel Smith, who was the salaried, paid consultant for the Reform 
Party's Indian task force, is the author of the book <I>Our Home 
or Native Land</I>.  It is a play on words instead of our home and 
native land.  The three major points are that aboriginal 
self-government must be stopped; that some government treaties 
with first nations should be either ignored or modestly 
interpreted; and that all government programs related to native 
people should be phased out, i.e. first nations people should be 
made real Canadians.  In other words, no special affirmative 
action measures to try to recognize the historic imbalance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Reform Party stand behind the implementation of the 
recommendations of the royal commission on aboriginal people or 
does it subscribe to Mel Smith's points? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we talk about listening 
to each other's speeches and I certainly hope that my speech was 
also listened to because there is no place that I would ever say 
that aboriginal self-government should not come about.  I do not 
think that anybody can show me any place in Reform Party policy 
where it says we are against aboriginal self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would certainly not like to see condemnation by association or 
whatever, which the member for Winnipeg Centre is somehow trying 
to place on my shoulders.  I think I have spoken quite clearly 
about what my beliefs and stand are and what I believe the 
beliefs and stand of the Reform Party are.  My 59 colleagues as 
far as I know believe exactly along the lines and in the same 
general principles.  The other groups or whatever the member for 
Winnipeg Centre is talking about, I do not know if they have been 
authorized by the Reform Party to speak like that.  I would very 
much doubt that.  In fact I know it is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in the House have made some pretty wild promises over the 
years.  I think back to some members who are currently sitting 
who talked about how they would get rid of the GST and all this. 
I would simply say that our politicians do need to have 
accountability imposed on them and I think the aboriginal leaders 
are no different.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the House on Bill C-56, 
the Manitoba claim settlements implementation act.  My colleague, 
the hon. member for Provencher, has made it clear that the 
proposed legislation will address outstanding commitments to 
several Manitoba first nations. I will comment on the elements of 
the bill that pertain to the establishment of reserves in 
Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overall objective of this part of the bill is 
straightforward, to advance the implementation of claims 
agreements in Manitoba by facilitating and thereby accelerating 
the transfer of lands to reserve status.  In “Gathering 
Strength: Canada's Aboriginal Action Plan” this government 
stated its belief that treaties provide a basis for developing a 
stronger partnership with aboriginal people.  But in order to 
move in partnership into the future we must first honour our past 
commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of Canada's longest standing commitments is to deal with 
treaty land entitlements, claims that involve lands promised 
under treaties and signed mainly with the first nations of the 
prairie provinces.  This is for a variety of reasons.  Not all 
first nations received the full amount of land promised to them 
when they signed the treaties.  For example, in certain first 
nations incorrect counts of memberships occurred when reserves 
were created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members can appreciate, this has been a contentious 
issue with first nations in western Canada for many years.  Our 
government intends to bring closure to this difficult problem by 
fulfilling Canada's obligations to provide additional reserve 
lands to first nations with treaty land entitlements.  This 
process has been spearheaded in Saskatchewan where a treaty land 
entitlement framework agreement signed in 1992 has paved the way 
for the final agreements with individual first nations.  Now we 
are focusing our attention on righting this historic wrong in 
Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the majority of Manitoba first nations received their full 
land allocations when they signed treaties between 1871 and 1910, 
others did not.  Over the past 50 years or so numerous efforts 
have been made to resolve this problem.  Some progress was made 
between 1994 and 1996 when seven of the affected Manitoba first 
nations signed individual treaty land entitlement agreements that 
provided about 170,000 acres of land to be added to reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major breakthrough came in May 1997 when the governments of 
Canada and Manitoba signed a framework agreement with the treaty 
land entitlement committee of Manitoba on behalf of 19 first 
nations whose claims had been accepted.  Under this agreement 
about 1.1 million acres of additional reserve land will be 
provided to 19 first nations.  About 90% will be crown land 
provided by the Manitoba government.  The remaining 10% will 
likely be purchased from private landowners by these first 
nations using cash contributions provided by Canada.  The 
remaining 10% needs to be purchased privately because certain 
first nations are in the areas of the province where there is not 
sufficient crown land available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have now moved into the next phase of the settlement process 
in which each of the 19 first nations ratifies its own treaty 
entitlement agreement based on the broader framework agreement. 
Six such agreements have been completed and we hope to finalize a 
number of other agreements this fiscal year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process is moving forward but our experience in Saskatchewan 
has taught us the importance of having better legislative 
mechanisms to facilitate the transfer of land to reserve status. 
This is particularly true where these lands carry one or more 
interests held by third parties.  Bill C-56 provides these 
mechanisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring the attention of hon. members to three main provisions 
of the bill that relate to the establishment of reserves under 
the Manitoba claims settlement.  First, Bill C-56 will empower 
the minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to set 
apart as reserves any of the lands selected by Manitoba's first 
nations under a claims agreement.  The Indian Act is silent on 
the power to create or add to reserves.  However, the historic 
practice has been for the governor in council to issue an order 
in council granting reserve status. 
For the purposes of Manitoba claims agreements only, Bill C-56 
will eliminate the added step of obtaining the order in council.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second and third measures both deal with the issue of the 
third party interests on proposed reserve lands and in 
particular, with the timing of first nations' consent to the 
continuation or replacement of existing interests or the creation 
of new interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the government's additions to reserve policy, the reserve 
status can only be conferred on lands if third party interests on 
these lands have been identified and resolved prior to Canada's 
acquisition of the lands.  Unfortunately it is often very 
difficult and sometimes impossible to meet this policy goal using 
the existing laws which can act to impede resolution of these 
interests. Let me give an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Manitoba first nation has selected a certain parcel of land 
that it would like to purchase under its treaty land entitlement 
agreement.  A hydro company happens to have an easement across 
this land which was previously granted to it by the province. 
Before the first nation can purchase that land, the additions to 
reserve process requires that the hydro company's interest be 
resolved.  Typically the hydro company would require the first 
nation's consent to continue the easement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the catch.  The Indian Act gives a first nation the 
power to consent to the creation of interests on land that is 
already part of a reserve but not on land that is simply being 
proposed for reserve status. Thus, the first nation would not 
have the power to consent to the continuation of the hydro 
easement.  It would be a fairly big problem for anyone who is 
taking hydro off of that line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members can no doubt see the dilemma.  Without the first 
nation's consent that the easement will continue, the hydro 
company may be, quite understandably, unwilling to cancel its 
existing provincial easement.  Through no one's fault, a 
potential addition to the reserve becomes stalemated. An 
opportunity to forge a new working partnership between the first 
nation and the hydro company is delayed and possibly even lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-56 will resolve this potential catch 22 by allowing a 
first nation to consent to a third party interest on selected 
lands before those lands have been granted reserve status.  In 
this manner the third party interest is continued and not put at 
risk as it would be under the current regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process for the first nations to grant such consent will 
depend on the nature of the interest.  For example, exclusive use 
interests, such as leases, would require the first nation 
membership to give consent through a designation vote. 
Non-exclusive interests, such as rights of way, would require 
only the consent of the first nation council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These distinctions are parallel to those applicable to the 
existing reserves under the Indian Act.  That is to say the 
important feature of these new designation and permit powers is 
that they would allow the first nation to give consent when it is 
most needed, indeed at the very time at which it is the most 
helpful to the reserve creation process. Of course the interest 
consented to would take effect only if and when the land becomes 
a reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out that the pre-reserve powers to designate 
lands or issue permits would be available to deal with the 
protection of existing interests and to allow the first nations 
to put in place new development deals that would take effect upon 
reserve creation.  This ability to take advantage of the new 
opportunities will ensure that first nations do not have to leave 
their selected lands undeveloped until reserve status is granted 
and that first nations can compete on an equal footing even while 
the reserve creation process proceeds.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The driving force behind this legislative proposal is Canada's 
commitment to settle treaty land entitlements with 19 Manitoba 
first nations.  The mechanisms in Bill C-56 will also be made 
available to the seven Manitoba treaty land entitlement 
agreements negotiated in advance of the framework agreement 
reached last May.  Canada is also prepared with full provincial 
support to make the bill's mechanisms available to all other 
Manitoba claim settlement agreements, existing or future, which 
have addition to reserve components. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, two specific claims have been settled with the 
Manitoba first nations that oblige Canada to create new reserve 
lands.  These first nations will be able to use the reserve 
establishment provisions of Bill C-56 in this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will also be aware of the master implementation 
agreements signed by four Manitoba first nations to implement the 
northern flood agreement.  In fact part 1 of Bill C-56 will 
affirm to certain elements of the agreement recently completed 
with the Norway House Cree Nation, an agreement that provides for 
the conversion of about 55,000 acres to reserve status.  The 
reserves establishment provisions of Bill C-56 speak to this 
commitment and to reserve creation commitments Canada has made to 
other northern flood first nations. Given that Norway House is 
also owed additional reserve lands under its own treaty 
entitlement agreement, it will benefit from Bill C-56 on two 
fronts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally as I have said before, any first nation that negotiates 
future claims that include a commitment to create a reserve land 
in Manitoba may opt into the new process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear that the mechanisms to be made available 
by this legislation will be limited to additions to reserves that 
are the result of the Manitoba claims settlements where first 
nations ought to avail themselves of the legislation.  The 
extension of these mechanisms to all types of additions to 
reserves in Manitoba and elsewhere across the country cannot 
happen now and would not happen without broad and extensive 
consultations with all our first nations and provincial partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members should also know that part 2 of Bill C-56 is not 
needed to give effect to any claims agreement in Manitoba. These 
legislative proposals are intended only to facilitate the 
creation of reserves under these agreements, in large part by 
achieving a key objective: enabling first nations to accommodate 
and to protect third party interests that are identified in the 
reserve creation process.  This bill will significantly reduce 
the time required to add lands to reserve which under the current 
system can approach three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the technical nature of these provisions, it is fair to 
ask what the practical day to day effect will be on first nations 
communities, on children, on families and on businesses. The 
answer is this.  By accelerating the implementation of the claims 
agreement, the proposed legislation will pave the way for 
improved socioeconomic conditions in the first nations 
communities throughout Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sooner that selected lands can become reserve lands, the 
sooner the affected first nations can develop these lands and 
benefit from them.  In many cases, lands will be selected because 
of their development potential, or for commercial and 
institutional ventures which in turn will contribute to real 
improvements in the lives of the aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-56 will move Canada forward in meeting our goal set out 
in Gathering Strength: to build stronger first nations 
communities and to end the cycle of poverty.  The treaty land 
entitlement first nations of Manitoba have waited patiently for 
the day when their claims would be resolved.  Bill C-56 will 
facilitate and accelerate this process to the benefit of all 
parties. 
It could serve as a legislative template for similar efforts in 
other provinces.  It will send a clear message that parliament 
not only intends to live up to the commitments made to the 
aboriginal people but also stands ready to legislate a process 
that helps make this happen.

Their continued interests will be protected by having the first 
nation's consent prior to the reserve addition, giving them the 
commercial certainty in the face of this process that they have 
long been seeking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I want to assure hon. members that the Treaty Land 
Entitlement Committee of Manitoba has been consulted on this 
legislation.  The bill was also shared with the province of 
Manitoba and the seven first nations that had previously signed 
individual treaty land entitlement agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has also been made available to the Assembly of 
Manitoba Chiefs and to the Treaty and Aboriginal Rights Research 
Centre which is operated by the representatives of the Manitoba 
first nations.  The centre recently expressed its support for the 
legislation in a letter dated September 18 to the Department of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development.  In it Chief Jim Prince 
notes that with the new legislation in place, “the process of 
conversion of land to reserve status will be considerably 
enhanced”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other parties were extensively consulted and represented by the 
province of Manitoba during the negotiations which led to the 
signing of the Manitoba treaty land entitlement framework 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have consulted.  We have listened and we have acted. 
Manitobans want this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge hon. members to join with me in supporting this bill so 
that it can be sent to committee for review.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to compliment the hon. member for 
Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey for the ease with which he read 
a speech which he had not seen before.  I think it was a 
wonderful job. I wonder if the hon. member was gambling.  Did he 
lose the coin toss or did he get the short straw?  Exactly how 
was the hon. member for Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey selected 
to read the departmental speech? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member opposite 
has probably taken shots at any one of us over here out of his 
absolute frustration of the success of this government over the 
last five years.  We have taken a deficit of $42.5 billion down 
to zero in five years.  We have taken unemployment from 11.9% 
down to 8.1% in five years.  I can understand the hon. member's 
frustration in making a statement like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the hon.

Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey on his speech.  I certainly 
enjoyed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members have been taking part in the debate today, 
especially those from Manitoba and that is as it should be. 
However, some of us take a great interest in these matters even 
though in this particular case we are not from Manitoba.  The 
member and I share this very personal interest. I have in fact 
seen from the air and the ground the results of the flooding 
which we are dealing with in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As some members may have noticed today, the Reform members have 
been dragging the puck for whatever reason.  I do not know what 
the reason is.  They do not like this legislation and have been 
drawing out the debate this afternoon at great length.  We are 
now getting very close to voting time.  They keep mentioning the 
matter of accountability.  They raise the spectre of 
accountability of first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question will be based on my understanding that the trust 
fund which is going to be established manages the compensation 
moneys which was stressed by the parliamentary secretary.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about compensation for many, many years; decades 
of hardship resulting from the flooding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trust fund that manages the compensation moneys will be 
subject to provincial trust laws and will be administered 
according to generally accepted accounting principles.  As well, 
all of the parties to the master implementation agreement will 
receive an annual report on the trust's business affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know the laws of the province of Manitoba, but I would 
ask my colleague:  Is it not true that in fact the moneys which 
will be allocated under this legislation will be properly managed 
and accounted for in the way that I have just described? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the 
member for Peterborough for his question.  Yes, is the simple 
point and the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are debating this bill at second reading and it is going to 
go to committee.  The hon. member across the way wants to know 
why I was chosen.  My interests concern all of Canada.  I am not 
only interested in what happens in Ontario, I am also interested 
in what happens in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  We are a national party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder:</B>  That is right.  That is the point. 
Unfortunately, the Reform member opposite belongs to a regional 
party which represents the west and that is his only interest. 
My interests concern the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this bill is in committee, if the member has any problems 
with this legislation, that is the time and that is the place— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  On questions and 
comments, the hon. member for Wetaskiwin. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to say first of all that a member opposite said we have 
drawn out the debate at great lengths.  I think it would only be 
appropriate if four, five or six Reform members spoke to this 
legislation, and I believe that is how many have spoken today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing I would like to comment on is the fact that my 
colleague for Winnipeg Centre is completely off the mark when he 
tries to cast aspersions on the Reform Party by implying that 
somehow we have condoned, possibly spawned and encouraged this 
organization, which none of my colleagues in this caucus have 
even heard of, let alone been made aware of what the aims or 
goals are.  I think that is probably one of the sleaziest things 
I have seen happen in this parliament up to this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I would like to ask a question of my colleague 
from Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey.  This agreement is an 
attempt to bring to a close 21 years of negotiation.  The first 
thing that occurs to me is that when we are in negotiation for 21 
years the people that benefit are not the stakeholders, they are 
the negotiators.  This looks to me like a career for somebody to 
continue negotiations which started in 1978. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage my colleague across the way to remark on that 
or to enlighten me as to how he feels about the fact that this 
has dragged on and on.  Who does he think have been the—

Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the fact that this has 
dragged on for 21 years and that it has taken this government to 
find a solution is the answer to the member's question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For five years we have brought forward good legislation that has 
put this country back on track.  For five years we have been 
working on solving problems that previous governments have not. I 
think we have done a darn good job of it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is 
all about talking to the folks back home who are watching.  It is 
all about Bill C-56.  It is all about the government making a 
commitment it could not keep.  That is basically what this is all 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote from an article written by John Gray of the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I>.  It is entitled “Referendum process leaves 
a House divided”.  It is about a government trying to go ahead 
by buying votes.  That is what it is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maggie Balfour is the former chief of the Norway House reserve. 
She and other people on the reserve wanted to challenge the 
legality of a referendum with regard to the implementation of 
this whole agreement.  She and other people had problems with the 
process and the way these things were done.  They were going to 
put forward their challenge to what had happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened then?  Ms. Balfour described it as bribery in the 
article.  She said that basically everybody who had problems with 
the process was offered $1,000 just in time for Christmas.  If 
they accepted the $1,000 then these dissidents would thereby kind 
of fall off this challenge.  As a result, with $1,000 the 
government could buy silence from these people on the reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only was the government complicit in these things, but the 
band council got control of the $1,000 payouts and could decide 
who would get them and who would not.  It was even more selective 
than just whether or not you took your name off the list.  There 
was complicity between the federal government and the band 
council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article touches on some other issues that we are dealing 
with in the country, particularly a province that I have in mind. 
They say here that if a referendum loses, then a second one 
should be called, and that is exactly what this situation had in 
mind.  They were continuing to call referenda until they got the 
results they needed.  This was all something the federal 
government was up to because it had made commitments that it just 
could not keep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, the federal government and the band were complicit 
in holding referenda again and again on the implementation on 
this whole agreement until they could go ahead and pass this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says here that money and land was exchanged for a formal end 
to the obligations of the northern flood agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote directly from the article because it is 
particularly relevant in this case.  It states:  “When the votes 
were counted on the night of July 29, the majority in favour of 
the implementation agreement was almost two to one.  But the 
referendum was defeated because there was not a majority of 
eligible voters on the reserve in favour”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened then?  On August 1, three days after the defeated 
referendum at Norway House, Ms. Jackson, the federal negotiator, 
was laying the groundwork for a second referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened here is that they could not get what they wanted 
in the first one, so by offering $1,000 and by plunging ahead 
into a second referendum the federal government, along with the 
band, hoped they were going to be able to get the results they 
wanted, despite the objections of some of the dissidents who had 
problems with what was being done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government asked questions about the accuracy of the 
voters' list at Norway House.  By asking questions about the 
accuracy of the voters' list it was able to go ahead and force a 
second referendum.  It even admitted that the rules could be 
changed for the second vote.  “If you consider it changing the 
rules, I suppose that is what it is”.  That was a quote taken 
directly from Ms. Jackson, the federal negotiator in this whole 
deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the days after the first referendum a group of Norway House 
residents took the band council to court on the grounds that the 
entire referendum process was improper.  Some 186 band members 
signed the application to the court.

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the ensuing three months, three-quarters of those who had 
supported the legal challenge signed affidavits saying in effect 
that they did not sign or did not mean to sign the court 
application.  This is because they were being bought off, bit by 
bit, with thousand-dollar increments of federal money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unemployment rate on this reserve is 80% to 85% and most 
people in town live on social assistance of only $205 per month. 
Not surprisingly, the money figures prominently in this glossy 
guide book to the implementation of the agreement published by 
the federal government.  Most of these people are not very well 
off and $1,000 of federal government money to buy their votes 
seems like a pretty lucrative deal for some of them.  If they 
only make $205 a month, $1,000 would be five months' salary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 3 of the government's guidebook describing the 
implementation agreement is the promise of a $78 million trust 
fund.  Page 13 has the promise that if the agreement is approved 
there will be three payments totalling $1,000 for all band 
members.  Even more so, those aged 55 and older will get $1,500. 
This will pay off the band elders with a little more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Omand was one of the 186 who signed the challenge to the 
legality of the referendum.  She acknowledges that later she 
signed the affidavit because she wanted the money.  She speaks, 
frankly, for many of the people who were bought off with federal 
government money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first challenge to the referendum was rejected by the 
federal court.  The dissidents discovered in the two referenda 
that it is difficult to be effective in a town where the band 
council owns and controls the only newspaper, the only radio 
station and the only television station.  There is complicity 
among the band, the federal government, the money being spent by 
the federal government, the newspaper, the radio station and the 
television station.  How are these dissidents, these people who 
have problems with it, supposed to be able to have their voices 
heard?  Ms. Omand wrapped up her article by asking “How can the 
government put us in such a devastating mess?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of this, what does the Reform Party propose as a 
solution?  My NDP colleagues criticized us earlier today so I am 
sure they would ask that question.  The Reform Party believes 
that the chief electoral officer of Canada should have authority 
over Indian government elections to ensure they are fair and 
lawful.  What we had here was a case of the federal government 
and the band buying votes.  It was a thousand dollars a pop to 
have dissidents drop a legal challenge.  It was easier to buy 
their votes than it was to have a fair election and get the 
results they wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members have said today in the House that the Reform Party 
is bringing up these unfair elections and these problems in terms 
of democracy and what happens on the reserves.  I think that is 
only fair.  We are doing that in the spirit of people like Ms. 
Omand and Ms. Balfour, the former chief of the Norway House 
reserve.  It is only fair that their type of consideration be 
heard in the House.  These are not just allegations because they 
were willing to press ahead with them in court.  These types of 
consideration should be taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us think about how this plays with the Liberal strategy in 
other areas.  Liberals do not just buy votes on reserves and buy 
the complicity of bands and councils to get their way, they buy 
votes in provinces too.  It is not only a strategy they keep up 
with aboriginals in this country.  They buy votes in this country

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
May 15 I asked the Minister of the Environment whether she plans 
to introduce legislation this fall to ban water exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water is our most important natural resource.  A price cannot be 
put on the value of fresh water to people, plants, animals and 
ecosystems.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people say we have a limitless supply of water but the fact 
is there is a limit to how much we can use and abuse.  Once we 
contaminate the quality of water, as we have done in the Niagara 
River, the cost of replacement is high.  It can come at the 
expense of another watershed.  We have learned that water is a 
resource which must be treated carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1983 the Liberal government commissioned a federal inquiry on 
water policy.  Two years later inquiry chair Peter Pearse and his 
fellow commissioners recommended a full range of water related 
policy initiatives including drinking water, safety, research 
programs, intergovernmental arrangements and water export. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The central message of the inquiry's report, in the words of 
Peter Pearse, was: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must protect water as a key to a healthy environment, and 
manage what we use efficiently as an economic resource. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of water exports the Pearse report recommended the 
federal government adopt legislation setting out clear criteria 
for approving or rejecting water export proposals to ensure that 
Canadian economic, political and environmental interests would be 
protected.  According to Peter Pearse: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the late 1980s, the federal government's handling of this 
issue has been unhelpful.  Although it declared its intention to 
adopt our proposal for legislation to enable it to regulate 
exports, it did not do so.  Instead, it assigned the question to 
the interdepartmental legislative review group in 1989, which 
never reported. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been 14 years since the Pearse report.  We are still 
waiting for a water export policy and for a comprehensive water 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the vacuum created by the absence of a comprehensive policy 
and in the absence of a federal law banning the export of water 
came the application last spring by the Nova Group in northern 
Ontario for a permit to take water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March the Government of Ontario, in one of its frequent 
moments of galloping madness, granted the permit to take up to 10 
million litres per day.  At the time the government said it had 
no choice but to issue the permit, saying “you can get a permit 
to draw water in Ontario as long as it doesn't cause any 
significant environmental damage”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the Ontario government a little later came to its senses 
and decided to cancel the permit.  Consequently the Nova Group 
appealed the decision to the Ontario Environmental Assessment and 
Appeal Board.  While a number of public interest groups from the 
U.S. and Canada will be represented, it is sad to note that the 
federal government is not represented at the hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to July it is important to note that at the panel 
convened in Toronto by the ministers of the environment and 
foreign affairs, panellists from all sectors of society agreed 
that interbasin diversions, domestic or transboundary, should not 
be undertaken because of the serious environmental consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now at the end of 1998.  We still face a legislative gap 
crying out to be filled.  We know there is broad support for the 
gap to be filled.  We know we can expect proposals in future for 
water exports.  Therefore I am again asking the minister when 
legislation will be introduced banning water exports. 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to go on record 
as saying that the federal government is opposed to bulk water 
exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no bulk exports taking place at the present time.  The 
company to which my hon. colleague referred has had its permit 
revoked.  The decision has been appealed to the Ontario 
environmental appeal board and the hearings are set for early in 
December. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cumulative effects of tanker shipments by river or lake 
diversions are unknown and might be very serious.  There might be 
effects on levels and flows of lakes and rivers.  We want to take 
a cautious approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out to my hon. friend that this year particularly in 
parts of Canada one in 40-year droughts are taking place. Ontario 
is one of those that is suffering greatly at the present time. 
The levels of the Great Lakes are down, even to the risk of 
transportation on the seaway.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considerable progress has been made regarding consultation with 
provinces on options to deal with this matter.  Both federal and 
provincial governments have a role to play in deciding the 
outcome.  The government will lay out its strategy for a 
comprehensive approach to water exports later this year.  I can 
assure my hon. friend we will proceed with the utmost caution.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>BILL S-13 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I had a question for the government House leader 
relating to the Minister of Health and Bill S-13, a bill that 
obviously originated in the Senate.  We often call it Senator 
Kenny's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an anti-smoking bill that would place a 50 cent levy on 
every carton of cigarettes.  In a sense it appears as though the 
government will attempt to derail that bill.  In other words, the 
government does not want that bill to come to the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take exception to this because today in the House we were 
debating Bill C-42, amendments to the Tobacco Act.  We were 
saying the bill does not have enough teeth in it.  It does 
nothing.  At the end of the day we will still have 40,000-plus 
Canadians dying each year from smoking. The point we are 
attempting to make is that Bill S-13 addresses some of the very 
problems we know exist with regard to the acceptance of smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-13 does something about this.  It would levy 50 cents per 
carton of cigarettes at the manufacturing level.  The money would 
go into a foundation to educate Canadians, particularly young 
Canadians, on the dangers of smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned that 40,000 Canadians die every year.  Senator Kenny 
and many members on both sides of the House agree that it is a 
big problem, particular with our youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a very simple comparison but very graphic.  If 100 people 
a day in Canada died as a result of an airplane crash, we would 
have slightly fewer than 40,000 Canadians dying a year.  To be 
exact, 36,500 people.  That would be absolutely unacceptable if 
the government did nothing about it but instead sat back and let 
it happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a recurring problem such as an airliner going down every day 
in Canada killing 100 people occurred, the transport minister 
would have to resign within days.  At the end of 365 days, there 
are 40,000 Canadians dying because of smoking.  The government 
sits back and simply lets the tobacco giants control the agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to see something done.  We are saying that Bill C-13 
would do something about that.  Senator Kenny's bill does 
something about it.  We are asking the government to give this 
bill some consideration, at least get this bill on the floor of 
the House of Commons so that it can be debated on its merits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hoping the government will be receptive to this bill, 
consider it and debate it openly and honestly in the House of 
Commons where all members can express their points of view. 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
share the concern of the member regarding smoking.  On November 3 
he asked whether the government would provide time for 
consideration of Bill S-13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the government in the House replied that the 
appropriate forum for discussion of the future business of the 
House is the weekly meeting of all party House leaders. 
That answer stands.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member may, if he desires, ask his own House leader to 
raise the matter in the appropriate place.  As the hon. member 
knows, the House has been developing in recent years increasingly 
effective procedures for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business and, if otherwise found in order, Bill S-13 would 
already benefit from certain advantages that our rules provide 
for private members' public bills emanating from the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member also knows, however, there are certain 
fundamental procedural and constitutional considerations 
surrounding Bill S-13 that must be ruled on by the Speaker of the 
House of Commons, who is the only person authorized in our 
parliamentary system to rule on matters relating to the 
constitutional monopoly of the House of Commons to initiate 
fiscal legislation, and it is only fitting that we should await 
such a ruling to be made at an appropriate time.

House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
