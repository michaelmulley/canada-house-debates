Speaker, I rise in this House today with great pleasure to draw 
attention to the presence in the gallery of students from

Villa Anna provided bilingual instruction and encouraged

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
today is the second anniversary of an agreement in the House of 
Commons to develop a national victims bill of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it was April 29, 1996 when the Liberal government agreed 
with the Reform Party to put the rights of victims front and 
centre in this nation.  Once again, however, the Liberal 
government did nothing.  That is right, nothing.  The Minister of 
Justice recently said that victims rights were just rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the right to know the status of the criminal rhetoric?  Is a 
person's right to know what their rights are rhetoric?  Is the 
right to know when plea bargaining is taking place rhetoric? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am ashamed to say that I sit in this House of Commons with 
those who are more concerned with the rights of criminals than 
the rights of victims.  I am ashamed to be involved with those 
who say one thing and do nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fight for the rights of victims will continue and I am 
committed to be at the forefront of that battle, full time, now 
and when I leave this place of false hope.

suggestions made by the International Association of Firefighters 
which has been meeting here in Ottawa at its seventh annual 
legislative conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Firefighters, as members know, are primary guardians of safety

duties.  I would like to officially recognize them for their 
continuing dedication, sacrifice and service to this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Firefighters from across Canada have been to Ottawa to advance a 
number of very important issues.  Among them is their request for 
the establishment of a federally regulated, third party 
investigative agency that would lessen the risk to firefighters 
who must deal with tragedies like the 1997 Plastimet fire in 
Hamilton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They ask that we extend funding to complete the testing of 
Operation Respond, a program designed to ensure the safety of 
firefighters.  I support these requests.

and its respect for firefighters.  I urge it to implement—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have learned in the newspapers of the decision made 
by the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe to 
completely ban asbestos. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, as Canadian parliamentarians from the Liberal Party, 
the Conservative Party, the Bloc Quebecois and both Houses of 
Parliament, as well as observers at this interparliamentary 
assembly, we ran into a wall of misunderstanding and faced total 
rejection of the Canadian position, which is the same as the one 
held by the Russians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of a comprehensive ban on asbestos regardless of type or 
use, the Canadian position is based on the following consensus: 
asbestos may be a hazardous product, but its use can be 
controlled by putting workers' and public health first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This consensus is shared by all levels of government, industry 
and labour in Canada. Unfortunately, the vast majority of 
parliamentarians in the Council of Europe have remained 
insensitive to any argument that might have softened their 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore important that the Canadian consensus be put 
forth again before the Committee of Ministers of the Council of 
Europe, which will make a final decision on this recommendation.

Speaker, this is Ontario Mining Week and I would like to pay a 
special tribute to the mining communities in the riding of 
Timmins—James Bay and, more specifically, to the city of 
Timmins, the largest gold mining community in Canada.  I would 
also like to acknowledge the more than 3,000 individuals who work 
in the mining sector and contribute to this region's growing 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New mines are opening up in my riding, such as the Agrium 
phosphate mine near Kapuskasing.  This means new jobs and 
economic opportunities for the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The value of production from metal mines in Timmins—James Bay 
has amounted to $836 million or 19% of the total value of output 
in Ontario.  Exploration expenditures are up to $43 million. 
There is no doubt that mining is a vital contributor to my riding 
and to the country. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

our region's economy, quality of life and lifestyle. We must

grave message for this Liberal government and the health minister 
from a constituent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to read her words, expressing the pain suffered by 
her and her family: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I received tainted blood during the course of surgery in 1985 and 
I was notified in 1996, by the blood bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have hepatitis C, and now understand the symptoms I have 
experienced for years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Added to the physical problems is the emotional and mental 
anxiety of passing this disease on to my husband, my children and 
my grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To only compensate victims between 1986 and 1990 is totally 
unfair.  I battle the same health problems, the same outcome, 
possibly death and we are just as innocent as the “window” 
victims.  Are we not just as deserving of compensation? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She ends by saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are politics and dollars worth more than people and lives? 
</UL>

Shame on all the wimp Liberal MPs.

their homes remain uninhabitable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, tonight marks the 50th anniversary of the modern State 
of Israel.  Born out of the ashes of the Holocaust and invaded by 
five countries on the very day of its independence, Israel has 
survived and thrived against all odds.  Israel at 50 is a 
remarkable nation where Jews from all over the world go to live 
in freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years hundreds of thousands of Jews from the former 
Soviet Union and from Africa have immigrated to Israel, adding 
their own distinctive character to that growing country.  In 
Israel, Arabs and Jews sit side by side in the Israeli Knesset 
and all citizens are allowed to practise their own religious and 
political beliefs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps nothing speaks to Israel's spirit more than its national 
anthem, called “Hatikvah” which means “The Hope”.  I call upon 
all members of this House to join with me in expressing our hope 
that Israel's next 50 years will be peaceful and prosperous and 
that she will live in harmony with all of her neighbours.

to extend compensation to all victims.  The NDP government 
refused to permit a free vote in that exercise.

It is not closed for the tens of thousands of hepatitis C victims

closed for most members of parliament, not even for the

credibility.  Canadians remember that it is the party that would 
gut medicare.  Canadians know that they are the members who would 
eliminate the Canada pension plan.  Canadians are not prepared to 
believe that the Reform Party is truly on the side of the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have many petitions to present, but all on the same theme. 
There are two different forms of the petition.  They all have to 
do with the multilateral agreement on investment, the 
negotiations around which have broken down or have been suspended 
in Paris as a result of the efforts of many of the same people 
who have signed these petitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners call upon parliament to reject the current 
framework of MAI negotiations and instruct the government to seek 
an entirely different agreement by which the world might achieve 
a rules based global trading regime that protects workers, the 
environment and the ability of governments to act in the public 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the current framework of the MAI has been rejected this 
petition from these particular petitioners becomes even more 
possible and hopeful.

on parliament to impose a moratorium on ratification of the MAI 
until full public hearings on the proposed treaty are held across 
the country so that all Canadians can have an opportunity to 
express their opinions about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the commitments made by ministers at the end of the 
negotiations in Paris was that there would be further public

<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order concerning the failure of 
the government to respond to Question No. 21 which was tabled in 
the House on October 2, 1997, seven months ago.  I have regularly 
asked the government when it would reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary has constantly been vague, verging 
on stonewalling when asked questions about a response to this 
inquiry.  The question concerns visits of ministers to the 
Drummondville-Trois Rivieres vicinity during a time that we now 
know—it has been confirmed—a Liberal fundraiser was engaged in 
criminal activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We keep hearing the words “timely fashion” and “in due 
course”. There is every reason to believe that ministers of the 
crown were used as props in these nefarious activities.  I invite 
the parliamentary secretary to outline for the House what actions 
he has taken during the time period when we have been repeatedly 
asking for this very basic straightforward information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to know if the parliamentary secretary is refusing to 
come clean on this or if we will actually get some answers. There 
has been an admission of criminal involvement in this matter.  We 
want a response and we want one soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with respect to Question 
No. 21, I looked into the matter previously and I will look into 
the matter again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that it is a question which involves a 
number of departments and such questions take longer than those 
which involve one department. 
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this matter involves only one department.  Question No. 
33 was asked on October 28, 1997, with regard to the refusal of 
sport fishing lodges, in particular the lodges owned by the Oak 
Bay Marine Group, to provide catch data during the summer of 
1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am fully aware that the minister may be reluctant to respond 
to this question because it concerns the actions of Velma McColl 
on behalf of the sport fishing institute at that time.  She is 
now employed as his west coast assistant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been asking about this question persistently and I would 
like to know when I can expect the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with respect to Question 
No. 33, I looked into it very recently and it is my hope that the 
answer to this question will be presented in a timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this point of order 
concerns Question No. 56 which was asked on December 2, 1997. 
The question again concerns the failure of the B.C. sport fishing 
institute to provide timely catch data to the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand perhaps the reluctance of the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans to respond to the question because shortly 
after the minister went fishing with Randy Wright of the Oak Bay 
Marine Group the charges which had been laid against the company 
were dropped.  I can understand why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know when I can expect an answer.  I have been 
told countless times that I could expect it in a timely fashion 
and so on, but I would like to know when we can expect an answer 
to the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I note the concern 
regarding Question No. 56 as I did on the previous occasion when 
the member outlined the history of the particular question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will again look into the matter and do my best to see that the 
answer is delivered as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this point of order 
concerns Question No. 51 which was asked on December 1, 1997 and 
the aboriginal commercial fishing in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been led to believe that an answer to the question has 
been provided, but the minister was not happy with the reply and 
sent it back to his officials.

question.  He has been constantly misinterpreting to the public 
the response of the Provincial Court of British Columbia on this 
issue and ignoring the Supreme Court of Canada.  He is again 
reluctant to answer this very important question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need an answer to the question.  We want it now.  We are 
getting stonewalled on it time after time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will also note Question 
No. 51 along with Questions Nos. 33 and 56.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin my remarks by briefly outlining the background of the 
agreement and what it means to Canadians.  I will elaborate on 
these points in greater detail but I would like to start with the 
overall picture. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The UN fisheries agreement was concluded in August 1995 at a UN 
conference arranged to discuss problems of conserving and 
managing straddling stocks and highly migratory species.  The 
agreement was ready for signing in New York on December 4, 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Straddling stocks migrate for much of their life cycle beyond 
the jurisdiction of the coastal states and in the high seas 
where they may be found on either side of the 200-mile limit. 
Highly migratory species migrate in high seas and in the marine 
areas of coastal states.  Both types of stocks have been 
overfished in the high seas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problems with the straddling stocks occur in several areas 
of the world: on New Zealand's Challenger plateau, along 
Argentina's Patagonian shelf, along the coast of Chile and Peru, 
in the Barents Sea, along the Norwegian coast, in the heart of 
the Bering Strait, in the Sea of Okhostk and, as the hon. 
members are well aware, along the Grand Banks of Newfoundland 
outside Canada's 200-mile fishing limit. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have been the effects of this unregulated fishing?  The 
Food and Agriculture Organization told the grim story in its 1995 
report “The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture”.  I quote 
from that report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989 world fish production reached a peak of 100.3 million 
tonnes.  Marine catches subsequently declined as a result of 
significant overexploitation.  About 70% of the world's marine 
fish stocks are fully to heavily exploited, overexploited, 
depleted or slowly recovering. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Food and Agriculture Organization report identifies key 
causes of this global depletion of fish stocks.  One is fishing 
industry overcapacity and the provision of subsidies to ensure 
continued operation of vessels.  Another cause is the failure to 
take the precautionary approach to resource management.  A third 
cause the FAO cites is inadequate control of fishing activity, 
resulting in widespread overfishing contrary to conservation 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overfishing by foreign vessels outside 200 miles has been a 
major factor in declines in northwest Atlantic straddling 
groundfish stocks of cod, flounder and turbot.  These declines 
have devastated hundreds of Canadian coastal communities.  They 
have left more than 30,000 fish harvesters and fish plant workers 
unemployed in our Atlantic Canada region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea allowed 
coastal states, that is, states which border on the oceans, 
exclusive rights to control fisheries within 200 nautical miles 
or 370 kilometres of their shores. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea does not 
specify what the states' legal rights and obligations are 
regarding straddling and highly migratory fish stocks in high 
seas. The new fisheries agreement fills this gap left in the 
Convention on the Law of the Sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada played a leading role at the conference on straddling and 
highly migratory fish stocks, which resulted in the UN fisheries 
agreement, and in the lengthy negotiations that led to it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT20"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT20"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1535

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement will come into force once the required 30 states 
have ratified it. These states will therefore help develop a new 
legal framework for high sea fisheries. This framework will 
ensure effective regulatory control and enforcement to protect 
straddling and highly migratory fish stocks in high seas. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it is fully implemented, the United Nations fisheries 
agreement will provide a significant deterrent to unauthorized 
fishing of straddling stocks on the high seas.  The parties to 
the agreement will have to comply with management measures made 
by regional fisheries conservation organizations such as NAFO, 
the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement will give coastal states such as Canada the power 
to take action outside 200 miles if the flag state is unable to 
control its vessels. The flag state is a state that licenses the 
vessel to fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally the UNFA will also provide for binding and compulsory 
settlement of fishing disputes among states.  The UNFA is good 
news not only for Canada but for the whole world.  Overfishing of 
these straddling stocks on the high seas deprives coastal states 
of legitimate catches and threatens the viability of this 
critical food source for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A word on the history of Canadian involvement.  Canada can take 
great pride and a great deal of credit for this United Nations 
fisheries agreement.  It is important that we understand the 
tremendous Canadian effort and the Canadian involvement in 
bringing us to where we are now. By recalling this effort, I also 
want to show how important it is that Canada continue its 
international effort.  I also want to show how crucial it is that 
we show an example to the world by the way we manage our own 
fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada signed the United Nations fisheries agreement along with 
26 other states on December 4, 1993.  Fifty-nine other states 
have also signed.  Seventeen, among them the United States, 
Russia, Norway and Iceland, have now ratified the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The UN fisheries agreement strengthens and supplements the high 
seas fisheries provisions of the 1982 United Nations Convention 
on the Law of the Sea.  It does so through specific rules 
designed to ensure the long term conservation and sustainable use 
of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members are well aware of the depleted state of our 
straddling Atlantic groundfish stocks.  It was not always so. For 
almost 500 years fishers harvested from a seemingly limitless 
bounty of cod in the waters of the Grand Banks.  From the 
earliest settlement of Canada, in fact even before, commercial 
fishing provided the economic base for many in the area in 
question. Cod and other groundfish stocks were once abundant but 
by the mid-1960s and in particular by the mid-1980s they declined 
sharply due to excessive fishing by both foreign and domestic 
fleets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say a few words about the 200 mile limit and 
NAFO. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1977, new developments at the UN Conference on the Law of the 
Sea prompted Canada to declare a 200-mile exclusive fishing zone 
and to exercise strict control over this zone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada was not the only state to take such action. Other coastal 
states also declared a 200-mile limit. In most cases, all major 
ocean resources were within national jurisdiction, but not in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian 200-mile zone does not include the Grand Banks 
southeast of Newfoundland. Approximately 10% of the area known 
as the nose and tail of the banks is outside the Canadian 
200-mile limit. 
Important groundfish stocks like cod, sole, halibut and perch 
straddle this limit and have been harvested commercially in 
international waters outside Canadian jurisdiction.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1977, we drew a line in the ocean, but straddling stocks do 
not see it and do not stay within that line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1979, the responsibility for conservation of fish stocks in 
the Northwest Atlantic outside Canada's 200-mile limit was given 
to NAFO, the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NAFO now has 17 contracting parties:  Bulgaria, Canada, Cuba, 
Denmark for the Faroe Islands and Greenland, Estonia, France on 
behalf of St. Pierre and Miquelon, Iceland, Japan, Korea, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, the European Union, 
and the United States of America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NAFO's responsibilities include straddling stocks on the nose 
and tail of the Grand Banks and other fish stocks on the Flemish 
Cap, a part of Canada's continental shelf which lies outside our 
200 mile limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1982 another breakthrough for conservation occurred when the 
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea was signed.  Even 
though that convention did not come into force until 1994, some 
12 years later, its fisheries provisions have been considered 
customary international law. I would like to cite two important 
articles of that convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 118 provides that states must co-operate in the 
conservation and management of the living resources of the high 
seas and use regional organizations such as NAFO to work toward 
that United Nations goal. Article 119 requires all states to work 
together to maintain or restore populations of harvested species 
at levels capable of producing the maximum sustainable yield. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of NAFO and the signing of the United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea did not save our straddling 
stocks. As is well known, in the mid-1980s the European Community 
used the objection procedure in the NAFO convention so as not to 
be bound by the quotas established for NAFO stocks. The European 
Community catches were far above the quotas set by NAFO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then another problem arose.  Vessels from states that were not 
members of NAFO, including Panama, the United States and Korea, 
began to fish in the NAFO area despite having no quotas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time we began a major Canadian conservation campaign. In 
1989 scientific evidence showed that there was a serious decline 
in fish stocks in areas where overfishing had been prevalent. 
Canada launched a comprehensive campaign at home and abroad aimed 
at ending overfishing by foreign vessels in the northwest 
Atlantic Ocean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 Canada hosted the St. John's Conference on High Seas 
Fishing.  There, experts from key coastal states joined together 
to launch a new initiative to develop more effective rules for 
high seas fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991 in another advance for conservation the European 
Community adopted most NAFO quotas for the following year, 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In May 1991 in Santiago, Chile, another significant step was 
taken in the quest for effective controls in the high seas 
fisheries. A meeting of experts was held on high seas 
conservation around the world. At that meeting three countries, 
Chile, New Zealand and Canada, developed a text of principles and 
measures based on the conclusions reached at the St. John's 
conference.  The text of principles and measures became known as 
the “Santiago text”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991 NAFO began discussions on improving surveillance and 
control in the regulatory area and eliminating non-NAFO fishing. 
Steps were taken by the European Community and other NAFO members 
to improve surveillance and control and to stop fishing by 
non-members.  A European Community fisheries patrol vessel was 
assigned to the NAFO regulatory area for seven months of the 
year.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992 the European Community took stronger steps to control 
fishing by vessels of its member states. The European Community 
patrol vessel was to be in the NAFO area for 10 months of the 
year.  The European Community fisheries were closed when NAFO 
quotas were reached.  Canadian surveillance and inspection 
confirmed that the European Community had complied with the 
closure and the NAFO fishing rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At its 1992 meeting NAFO unanimously accepted a ban on fishing 
for northern cod outside Canada's 200 mile limit for the 
following year 1993.  NAFO also decided on improvements to the 
surveillance and control systems, improvements that were to go 
into effect for the 1993 season.  The European Community agreed 
to all NAFO conservation decisions made at that 1992 NAFO annual 
meeting. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also in 1992 that the United Nations Conference on 
Environment and Development was held. During that conference, 
better known as the UNCED conference or Earth Summit, Canada got 
global support to organize an intergovernmental conference on 
high seas fisheries management, including that of straddling and 
highly migratory stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the long negotiations that led to Rio's Earth Summit, 
Canada took the lead in drafting the initial UNCED text on the 
problems associated with high seas fisheries. That document was 
eventually incorporated in the chapter on oceans adopted by the 
UNCED conference. 
That draft document basically included the Santiago text, to 
which I just referred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>UNCED participants had to deal with various issues and submit a 
series of non-binding recommendations. For these reasons, coastal 
states concluded that UNCED's recommendations should include the 
holding of a UN conference exclusively on the conservation and 
management of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also in 1992 as a result of strong pressure applied by Canada, 
the republic of Korea agreed to withdraw three of the six vessels 
it had in the NAFO regulatory area by April 1993 and to phase out 
the use of Korean crews on third country vessels which were 
operating in the NAFO area.  Korea withdrew its vessels from the 
NAFO regulatory area at the end of April 1993 and became a 
contracting party of NAFO in the following year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of continued diplomatic pressure applied by Canada, 
Panama also agreed to impose sanctions on Panamanian vessels that 
violated conservation measures of NAFO.  Those actions included 
fines and removal from the registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In May 1994 Canada became the first nation to become party to 
the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's compliance 
agreement regulating high seas fishing.  Parties to that 
agreement must control high seas fishing by vessels flying their 
flags to ensure they do not undermine conservation decisions of 
international or regional fisheries management organizations such 
as NAFO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada had participated actively in negotiating the FAO 
agreement.  The agreement required acceptance by 25 nations to 
come into force.  So far, 10 acceptances have been received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also in May 1994 that Canada took another powerful step 
for conservation.  Parliament passed new legislation.  The 
amendments to the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act introduced as 
Bill C-29 enabled Canada to take action against stateless vessels 
and vessels flying flags of convenience outside the 200 mile 
limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law had an immediate impact on all such vessels clearing off 
the nose and tail of the Grand Banks. 
Bill C-29 constitutes an effective deterrent to the return of 
these flag of convenience fishing vessels to the nose and tail.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One serious conservation issue remained, Greenland halibut or 
turbot which was not a stock initially managed by NAFO quotas. 
The Greenland halibut had been fished entirely in Canadian waters 
until the late 1980s.  Then when other major groundfish stocks 
declined, the Greenland halibut became the object of a large 
scale foreign fishery outside 200 miles primarily by Spanish 
vessels. Abetting this development was the fact that more of the 
Greenland halibut stock had moved out of Canadian waters. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February 1994, Canadian researchers surveyed Greenland 
halibut stocks along the Labrador coast and eastern 
Newfoundland.  Their findings were surprising.  The biomass had 
decreased by no less than two-thirds since 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A still greater reduction was detected in the number of large 
fish. Their findings indicated as well that the population 
included a higher proportion of young fish, three or four years 
old.  If they were to contribute to increasing the stocks, these 
had to be left to age and reproduce. 
Greenland halibut cannot reproduce before they are at least ten 
years old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1994, the NAFO Scientific Council re-examined the 
Greenland halibut situation, and warned that deep-sea fishing 
levels in all of the sub-zones were in excess of what stocks 
could sustain. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada immediately responded by reducing its domestic quota off 
Baffin Island, which is in division O of the NAFO charts, by more 
than half and by terminating a fisheries development program in 
area 2GH which is the area off the coast of Labrador. Canada also 
substantially reduced its quotas for divisions 2 and 3 and 
limited access to harvesters who had fished in those areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At its annual meeting in September 1994, NAFO agreed for the 
first time to establish a total allowable catch for Greenland 
halibut.  That total allowable catch of 27,000 tonnes was a 
significant reduction from annual catches of more than 60,000 
tonnes in previous years when NAFO had not set a total allowable 
catch for the stock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now come to the 1995 turbot dispute.  At a special meeting 
held from January 30 to February 1, 1995—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
opportunity of getting my voice back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am actually getting to an interesting part, which is the 
turbot dispute of 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a special meeting held from January 30 to February 1, 1995, 
which marked a substantial discord, a majority of the NAFO 
members agreed on a sharing arrangement for the total allowable 
catch of turbot, or Greenland halibut as it is also known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These decisions divided the total allowable catch in this way: 
Canada, 16,300 tonnes; the European Union, 3,400 tonnes; Russia, 
3,200 tonnes; Japan, 2,600 tonnes; and 1,500 tonnes for other 
NAFO members.  However, that was not enough to save the stocks of 
turbot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly thereafter the EU lodged an objection and set its own 
unilateral quota which was five times higher than the allotted 
quota of NAFO.  Therefore, on March 3, 1995 the then minister of 
fisheries and oceans, my predecessor, the hon. Brian Tobin, now 
premier of Newfoundland, announced that the Government of Canada 
had amended its coastal fisheries protection regulations so that 
Canada could protect Greenland halibut on the Grand Banks from 
the Spanish and Portuguese vessels of the European Union.  Until 
that date the regulations had applied only to flags of 
convenience and stateless vessels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members know what happened next.  Canada took action under 
the legislation and on March 9, 1995 seized a Spanish fishing 
vessel, the <I>Estai</I>, and charged its master under the Coastal 
Fisheries Protection Act.  Fisheries' patrol vessels also cut the 
net of another vessel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inspection of the <I>Estai's</I> hold when it was brought 
into St. John's showed that the vast majority of the product on 
the vessel was processed from undersized turbot.  The net which 
the master had cut loose and which Canada later recovered had a 
mesh size of 115 millimetres, but it had a liner with a mesh size 
of 80 millimetres, which was 50 millimetres smaller than the NAFO 
requirement of 130 millimetres for Greenland halibut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians everywhere, in every province, applauded the action 
and so did the people of other countries.  Canada's strong stand 
in defence of fish stocks struck a sympathetic chord in other 
fishing communities right around the world.  Especially strong 
support came from communities in other coastal states that had 
suffered from foreign overfishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had thousands of telephone calls, faxes and messages of 
support from outside our borders.  In fact, some other European 
Union countries, such as Britain, France, and of course the 
Irish, started to fly the Canadian flag as a mark of support.

</I></B></P><P align=left>British parliamentarians urged their government to stand with 
Canada in the dispute and the British government did take a 
public stand on the need for tougher enforcement of conservation 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British government also blocked several attempts by other 
members of the European Union to impose trade sanctions on 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By April 15, which was some six weeks after the seizure of the 
<I>Estai</I>, Canadian and European negotiators reached a new 
conservation agreement.  Under that agreement a new mandatory 
fishing enforcement regime would govern all Canadian and European 
Union vessels fishing in the NAFO regulatory area.  The agreement 
included: independent, full time observers to be on board vessels 
at all times; enhanced surveillance by satellite tracking; 
increased inspections and quick reporting of infractions; 
verification of gear and catch records; timely and significant 
penalties to deter violators; new minimum fishing size limits; 
and improved dockside monitoring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In May 1995 Spanish authorities ordered a Spanish vessel to 
return to a Spanish port after officials of the Canadian 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans retrieved an illegal net 
suspected of coming from that vessel.  That enforcement action 
gave us reasons for cautious optimism that the agreement with the 
EU would be effective. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>September 1995 marked another important step.  At its annual 
meeting, NAFO adopted the control measures of the agreement 
concluded between Canada and the European Community as control 
measures for all contracting parties effective 1996.  They were 
welcomed as the most rigorous series of measures of any 
fisheries management organization in the world.  At this 
meeting, NAFO decided to continue its moratoriums on dangerously 
weakened straddling cod and turbot stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Saint John's, Newfoundland, in October 1995, Canada hosted 
the very first meeting of North Atlantic fisheries ministers. 
This meeting brought together representatives of Canada, the 
European Union, Ireland, Russia, Norway, the Faeroe Islands, and 
Greenland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All participants agreed to implement the cautious approach to 
fisheries management.  They agreed to manage resources with 
respect for ecosystems.  They agreed to restore resources in 
order to attain optimum yields.  They agreed to work together in 
fisheries sciences.  Finally, they agreed to ratify the new UN 
agreement and to encourage others to do the same. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the September 1996 NAFO meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia, 
Canada won the right to effectively determine the total allowable 
catch for northern cod, that is, cod in NAFO regulatory area 
2J3KL.  The total allowable catch will govern the level of 
catches both inside and outside the Canadian 200 mile limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the fishery in the NAFO regulatory area is resumed, the 
NAFO decision will limit catches in the NAFO area outside 200 
miles to a maximum of 5% of the total allowable catch.  This 
arrangement must be renewed in the year 2005.  This measure 
ensures that no fishery can commence until Canada sets a total 
allowable catch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unregulated catches of northern cod outside of Canada's 200 mile 
limit were a contributing factor to the serious depletion of this 
vital stock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the 1996 meeting and again in 1997 NAFO confirmed the 
moratorium on northern cod as it had for most of the other 
straddling stocks of cod and flounder on the Grand Banks.  This 
is vital to continue the process of rebuilding these resources. 
When the northern cod stock rebuilds to the point that fishing 
can again take place safely, the threat to foreign overfishing 
will no longer be there as it has been in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1995, following the Canada-EU turbot agreement of 
the previous spring, NAFO, with the aim of eliminating foreign 
overfishing, adopted new conservation and enforcement measures.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures took effect in January 1996, including a two year 
pilot program for independent, full time observers on board NAFO 
member vessels, satellite tracking on 35% of a fleet's vessels in 
the NAFO regulatory area, as well as mandatory dockside 
inspections and quick reporting and follow up on infractions. 
These measures were hailed as the toughest measures of any 
international fisheries management organization in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the new conservation and enforcement measures have been 
put in place there has been a sharp decrease in the number of 
infringements by NAFO member vessels.  This decrease is an 
obvious sign that the NAFO enforcement regime has become 
significantly more effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NAFO's implementation of new conservation and enforcement 
measures was the cornerstone in the recovery of Greenland halibut 
and other flatfish stocks currently under the NAFO moratorium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now seeing a glimmer of hope for a modest recovery of the 
3LNO yellowtail flounder stock which had been under a NAFO 
moratorium for the last three years.  At the 1997 annual meeting 
NAFO agreed to reopen, subject to a number of conditions, the 
yellowtail fishery.  The TAC, the total allowable catch, was set 
cautiously at 4,000 tonnes, 97.5% of which was to be fished by 
Canada. Recovery of that stock is good news for Canadian fishers. 
I hope that this limited opening signals the beginning of 
recovery for other NAFO managed stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NAFO's observer program, with 100% coverage in a NAFO regulatory 
area, is a key element in ensuring the conservation and 
rebuilding of important groundfish stocks in the northwest 
Atlantic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the September 1997 annual meeting in St. John's, NAFO members 
agreed to extend 100% observer coverage for another year.  It has 
again been extended and NAFO members will consider implementing 
100% observer coverage on a permanent basis effective January 1, 
1999.  This decision, however, is subject to amendments to 
improve the current scheme which may reduce cost without 
compromising the effectiveness of current conservation efforts.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to outline how the UN fisheries agreement, once 
fully implemented, will act as the main tool to protect from 
overfishing straddling fish stocks in the waters of Atlantic 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fisheries agreement contains strict provisions regarding 
regulatory enforcement on the high seas by member states of the 
organization responsible for the management of regional 
fisheries or subregional organizations, such as NAFO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It states that coastal states and states that fish on the high 
seas must work together to develop measures to ensure the 
conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly 
migratory fish stocks by applying a number of general 
principles. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those principles include a requirement to adopt measures to 
ensure the long term sustainability of such stocks, an obligation 
to apply the precautionary approach to management and a 
requirement that conservation and management measures for 
straddling and highly migratory fish stocks on the high seas and 
those coastal states in their exclusive economic zone for the 
same stock be compatible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once these provisions come into effect Canada will be able to 
implement conservation and management measures in its 200 mile 
zone secure in the knowledge that a significant deterrent is in 
place to ensure the effectiveness of these measures and that they 
will not be undermined by fishing on the high seas by vessels 
from states party to the UN fisheries agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to ensure that the conservation and management measures

agreement whether or not the latter is a member of the 
organization or participant in the arrangement.  In practice this 
means that Canada as a NAFO member could board and inspect a 
vessel of a NAFO or non-NAFO member that is party to the United 
Nations fishing agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If evidence of an infraction is found, the flag state will be 
notified and must respond within three working days and either 
investigate itself or if the evidence so warrants take 
enforcement action or authorize the inspecting state to 
investigate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a vessel has 
committed a serious offence, as defined in the agreement, and 
that the flag state has failed to act or take the necessary 
action, after three working days, the inspecting state may take 
steps, including bringing the vessel to port to pursue the 
investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In such cases, the inspecting state shall advise the flag state 
of the name of the port where the vessel must go and forward the 
findings of any subsequent investigation.

obligations under the agreement. 
If and when it does so, Canada, as the inspecting state, must 
return the vessel to the flag state, along with any information 
available concerning the conduct and conclusions of the 
investigation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Canada this means these provisions will permit Canadian 
enforcement action in the NAFO regulatory area against vessels 
flying the flags of states parties to the United Nations 
fisheries agreement whether or not they are also members of the 
Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The UN fisheries agreement also makes provision for compulsory 
and binding dispute settlements concerning the interpretation or 
application of the UNFA itself.  At Canada's initiative the UN 
fisheries agreement provides for compulsory and binding 
settlement in any dispute concerning the interpretation or 
application of subregional, regional or global fisheries 
agreements related to straddling stocks or highly migratory fish 
stocks such as the NAFO convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision establishes a mechanism that could be used to 
settle future disputes arising out of the future use of the NAFO 
objection procedure unless NAFO adopts its own dispute settlement 
procedure in the meantime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a dispute is not settled by the state parties concerned by 
means of their own choice the UN fisheries agreement mandates 
recourse to the provisions set out in part 15 of the United 
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea whether or not the state 
parties concerned are also parties to that convention.  Where a 
state, party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the 
Sea, has chosen a compulsory or binding settlement procedure 
under that convention that will also apply to dispute settlements 
under the UN fisheries agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under both the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 
and the UN fisheries agreement state parties may choose at the 
time of signature ratification or accession or thereafter from 
among the international court of justice, the international 
tribunal for the law of the sea and either general or special 
arbitration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments before us will enable Canada to ratify the 
fisheries agreement.  The amendments will enable Canada to 
implement new high seas enforcement provisions. 
They will enable Canada to authorize foreign state enforcement 
authorities to take enforcement steps against Canadian vessels 
suspected of committing a violation outside our waters.

Because the United Nations fisheries agreement straddling stocks 
can occur anywhere in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also creates new offences to enable Canadian

I rise today on behalf of the constituents of Saanich—Gulf 
Islands and my colleagues in the Reform Party to speak on Bill 
C-27.  This bill is the enabling legislation that will implement 
the United Nations fisheries act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it hard to stand here today and speak about 
this although I do agree with the minister that it is 
important. However, I had to make my way through groups of 
protesters from Newfoundland this week whose livelihood has been 
devastated by the collapse of our fishery and who will see their 
TAGS benefits expire in a couple of days. What is the minister's 
response to them?  Why are we going to ratify the UN fisheries 
agreement, UNFA? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is asking Canadian fishermen to forget about the 
fact that it has taken over three years to bring this 
legislation to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is asking fishermen to forget about the fact it 
promised TAGS benefits to them until May 1999. The government has 
reneged on this promise and is now about to cut them off in a few 
months.  The government is asking the fishermen to forget about 
the fact that they have been provided with no real long term 
solutions. We are going to talk about this at length. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no solutions to resolving the crisis that this 
government has created except throwing money at it and hoping it 
will go away; $3.4 billion and we are no better off today than we 
were when this government took office in 1993. This government is 
asking Canadian fishermen to forget all these facts because today 
we are debating Bill C-27. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was quite a technical speech the minister gave and I am not 
too sure how many viewers, unless they are really involved, 
understood what was going on.  I will try to put this in terms 
they will understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations fisheries agreement will ensure long term 
conservation and sustainable use of straddling fish stocks such 
as flounder and turbot. These stocks go back and forth across the 
200 mile line off the coast of Newfoundland.  I agree completely 
that we need control of these stocks. We need rules and 
regulations in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to criticize this legislation because it does not do 
that.  This is an issue we heard at length when we were 
travelling in our committee.  Let us go back a little and look at 
exactly what this legislation does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important to point out to all the people listening 
that it requires 30 signatures, 30 countries to adopt this 
legislation, to ratify this legislation in their own country 
before this takes effect.  I think there are 16 or 17 countries 
to date that will have ratified that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is really going to do nothing for a long time.  We are 
years away from this ever taking effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This actually started way back in 1982, 16 years ago.  That was 
UNCLOS, the UN convention on the law of the sea.  When that 
agreement was negotiated, and ironically it was a Liberal 
government in power in 1982, the agreement was full of holes. 
Nothing ever became of it.  It was brought back before the UN in 
1995 under the UN fisheries agreement in order to plug some of 
the holes and do something with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Brian Tobin was the minister at the time.  I am reading from a 
news release dated August 4, 1995: “Tobin foresees permanent end 
to foreign overfishing when new UN convention is implemented”. I 
will read a few paragraphs from the press release because I do 
not believe that is what is going to happen today. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada played a leading role in the conference, which approved 
new international controls on high seas fishing.  Canada's major 
concern was to end foreign overfishing of cod, flounder and 
turbot on the nose and tail of the Grand Banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new UN convention provides for binding and compulsory 
dispute settlement. As well, for the first time, international 
law will prohibit any unauthorized fishing of straddling stocks, 
thereby making fishing by flag of convenience vessels illegal. To 
ensure that vessels abide by the new international rules, the new 
UN convention authorizes Canada to take action outside 200 miles 
where the flag state fails to control its vessels. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact this is not going to do that.  I think the intention was 
there but our government has watered down this enabling 
legislation.  It will not be able to enforce it. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“This new UN convention, when fully implemented, will protect 
straddling stocks better than Bill C-29”, Mr. Tobin said. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-29 was brought in by this government in 1994, the 
Canadian Fisheries Protection Act, and that was the legislation 
the Government of Canada used to seize the <I>Estai</I>, to bring 
that ship back to port, to press charges against the captain and 
the vessel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Until the new UN convention is fully implemented, the 
Government of Canada will stand ready to exercise powers granted 
to it by Parliament under Bill C-29. These powers will no longer 
be needed to protect straddling stocks once the new UN convention 
is fully implemented”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What he is saying is that we are going to get these new laws by 
this international agreement and we will not have to rely on the 
former legislation, the Canadian Fisheries Protection Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go to the bill.  We can have all the legislation we want 
but if we cannot enforce it, it is not much good to us.  There 
are two sections that are quite troublesome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 16.2(1) says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After boarding a fishing vessel of a participating state, a 
protection officer who believes on reasonable grounds that the 
vessel has contravened section 5.3 shall without delay inform 
that state. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That says that once the protection officer boards that vessel he 
has to inform the flag state.  If we have a Spanish vessel out 
there in violation, he has to inform Spain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 16.2(2) says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A protection officer may, with the consent of the participating 
state, exercise the powers as provided for in section 16.1. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before he can board this vessel he has to get the consent of the 
flag state of that vessel.  That is arguable.  Some will say not 
but the way the bill is worded it is left open for 
interpretation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say he gets permission of the flag state. Then section 
7.01(1) comes into play: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A protection officer who believes on reasonable grounds that a 
fishing vessel of a participating state found in an area of the 
sea designated under subparagraph 6(e)(ii) has engaged in 
unauthorized fishing in Canadian fisheries waters may, with the 
consent of the participating state, take any enforcement action 
that is consistent with this act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The frustrating part of this legislation is that if they go 
outside the 200 mile limit on the nose and tail or the Flemish 
Cap of the Grand Banks and find a foreign vessel in violation of 
our laws or in violation of an international agreement, the 
Government of Canada or the enforcement officers must first go to 
the flag state of that vessel and get permission to board it. If 
they get permission to go on board and they find that the vessel 
is in violation and there are charges which can be laid they have 
to go back—and this is absolutely true and is in the bill, I 
read it word for word to the House—to that flag state and ask 
for permission to press charges against the vessel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to March 1995.  I will read a paragraph or two 
from the book <I>Lament for an Ocean</I> by Michael Harris.  It is 
subtitled “The Collapse of the Atlantic Cod Fishery:  A True 
Crime Story”. I will start on page one.  This will set the scene 
for what happened in March 1995 when the old legislation, the 
Fisheries Protection Act was used to press charges against the 
<I>Estai</I>.  This is the scene our fisheries officers were up 
against. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the other shot that was heard around the world.  The 
50-calibre machine gun bursts from the <I>Cape Roger</I>, three in 
all, marked the first time since Confederation that Canada had 
fired on another country in defence of the national interest. 
When the order came to open fire, the officers aboard the 
fisheries patrol vessel were so taken aback, they asked that the 
command be repeated.  The fateful words crackled once more over 
the ship's radio:  an initial burst was to be fired over the bow 
of the Spanish trawler <I>Estai</I>, the next rounds into her 
screw 60 seconds later if she refused to stop. After warning the 
Spanish captain to move his crew forward, Captain Newman Riggs 
nodded to Bernie Masters, who adjusted the sights on the <I>Cape 
Roger</I>'s heavy gun and sucked in a deep breath as his finger 
squeezed the trigger. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was when a Spanish vessel was illegally fishing straddling 
stocks off our coast.  Our enforcement people went to take 
control of that vessel.  There was a four hour pursuit, a very 
tense moment.  We were engaging in an “act of war”, as the book 
goes on to tell.  We had the right to do so.  We had the laws at 
that time to suggest that we could go out. They boarded the 
vessel and brought the vessel back to port.  They held that 
vessel until appropriate charges were laid.  The captain of that 
vessel was detained and we are proceeding and prosecuting on 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that same incident occurred today, if a foreign flag state 
vessel was out there fishing illegally, that is the very thing 
for which this legislation is supposed to be the saviour.  I 
agree that we do need some international agreements.  What would 
happen today is our control boats would go out. Their 
observations would be that the <I>Estai</I> was fishing illegally. 
Then they would have to ask our government to get permission 
from the Spanish government and ask if it would be okay for them 
to board the vessel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree it is open for debate.  There is some inconsistency in 
the way it is worded.  It is arguable.  I do not know how long 
that would take.  It took four hours of hot pursuit.  The vessel 
actually cut its nets, dropped them to the bottom of the ocean 
and tried to run away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say they got permission to board after they observed what 
was being done.  They knew the vessel was fishing illegally and 
they wanted to bring the vessel back to port.  No sir. 
They could not do that.  They would have to stay onboard and 
inform the flag state, which was Spain in this case.  They would 
have to get permission first to lay charges. Then the vessel 
would go back to Spain.  We would never see it again.  We would 
never be able to follow it up.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of fisheries at the time stated that this new UN 
fisheries agreement would be the saviour, that it would give us 
some teeth.  We have taken the teeth out of it.  My research has 
shown that of the 15 countries that have ratified the UN 
fisheries agreement, not one has clauses like the ones Canada has 
put into its legislation which take the teeth right out of it. I 
find it unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are members in this House who travelled with me and the 
rest of the fisheries committee and who have great interest in 
this matter.  They are listening today.  We travelled to 
Newfoundland and we heard these concerns.  They want somebody to 
stand up and fight for the fishermen out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the minister for about 40 minutes today.  He told us of 
all the wonderful things the government has done over the last 10 
years.  He went over a chronology of all the great things.  We 
heard words like major conservation program and when the stocks 
recover. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the minister look at the record.  I ask him to 
look at the record of this government with respect to the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the management of the 
fish.  I have never seen such a dismal failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no confidence from the fishermen.  There is no 
confidence from the people of Newfoundland.  I understand that 
the federal government buildings in Newfoundland have been taken 
over by frustrated fishermen.  I do not blame them.  When I went 
there these fishermen told me that they want to work and pay 
taxes. They told that to the Liberal government prior to the Tory 
days, but all we hear from this government is that it took over 
this mess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not accept responsibility for what it has 
not done over the past five years and even before that.  Back in 
the eighties these fishermen were telling that Liberal government 
that there was something wrong, that the fish were not there, and 
nobody listened.  We have heard this over and over again in 
committee.  We have heard evidence from scientists who were 
ordered to be silenced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked about this legislation and that they have to get 
the consent of the flag state to board the vessel and get the 
consent of the flag state to lay charges.  Imagine that a police 
officer sees a young person committing a crime.  Then he 
discovers he has to call the young person's parents before he can 
talk to him.  After the police officer talks to the parents, he 
has to get their permission to arrest the young person.  This is 
the same type of scenario. We have to take control of these 
straddling stocks and we have not done so. There should be an 
agreement but we should be putting some teeth into it so we can 
actually enforce and take control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that as this day proceeds the minister or somebody 
from the government will tell us that they had no option, that 
these clauses were agreed upon in the agreement negotiated at the 
UN in 1985.  I am sure they will say that they had no other 
option, that this is what was agreed upon and they had to put 
this in the enabling legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic. Bill C-96 died on the Order Paper last April.  It 
was brought before the House about 10 days before the last 
election.  Bill C-96 has exactly the same title as this 
legislation, an act to amend the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act 
and the Canada Shipping Act to enable Canada to implement the 
Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United 
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982, and 
it goes on.  It is exactly the same.  Section 1 is the definition 
of straddling stocks and in section 2 the Coastal Fisheries 
Protection Act is repealed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get to the sections I am talking about.  This is the same 
government.  This enabling legislation is for that very same 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking back, Minister Tobin went out with our navy and 
50-calibre guns and took charge.  At that time the current 
Minister of Veterans Affairs was the minister.  This is what he 
put in the enabling legislation: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A protection officer may, subject to subparagraph 6(e)(iii), in 
respect of any fishing vessel found within Canadian fisheries 
waters, the NAFO Regulatory Area or an area of the sea designated 
under subparagraph 6(e)(ii), 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) for the purpose of ensuring compliance with this Act and the 
regulations, including any measure incorporated by reference 
under subparagraph 6(e)(i), board and inspect the vessel. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are just saying that they can board it. Then it goes on to 
the placing of arrests: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A protection officer may, subject to any regulations made under 
subparagraph 6(e)(iii), arrest without warrant any person who the 
officer suspects on reasonable grounds has committed an offence 
under this Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It allows the custody and seizure of vessels, the seizure or 
delivery into the custody of such person the minister may direct. 
The minister retains control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with this enabling legislation is that it has no 
teeth in it.  The government has taken all the teeth out of it. 
They have to ask for permission.  This is absolutely ludicrous. 
How long is that going to take?  Is it really practical? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to support this, but we need to go back to enabling 
legislation much like what we had a year ago which had some teeth 
in it.  The government could actually do something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other frustrating part of this whole agreement is that the 
minister brought this legislation in for first reading in 
December.  He has been the minister for almost a year.  Our 
fisheries on both coasts are in a state of crisis.  The 
government comes in here and is proud of the situation when there 
are thousands of people in Newfoundland who have occupied federal 
offices out of frustration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans has tabled 
reports.  I can read some of the recommendations.  I agree that 
foreign overfishing is a problem.  We made nine specific 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One, the committee recommended that Canada withdraw its support 
for any turbot quotas assigned to foreign nations, and it goes 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two, the committee recommended that Canada cease giving 
permission to Canadian companies to hire foreign vessels and 
foreign crews to catch fish in Canadian waters.  We heard all of 
these concerns.  These are real concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three, the committee recommended that Canada withdraw its 
support for the redfish quotas given to foreign nations.  It goes 
on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could read the entire report.  I am not sure if the government 
has read it, because it is not acknowledging it.  It is not 
adopting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has come in with enabling legislation for an 
agreement that was negotiated three years ago.  The first 
agreement was back in 1982.  I do not know if it is just going to 
go to sleep and say that it has fixed the problem with fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a disgrace.  There are so many problems out there, 
starting with the foreign nations.  Some nations have four times 
the quota on certain species that Canadian fishermen have. An 
example is tuna.  Somewhere in the neighbourhood of 120 to 125 
tonnes go to Japan and Canada's quota is 30 tonnes.  One fish is 
worth $30,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government will not put its people first.  The bureaucracy. 
I have asked the minister in this House if he will move the 
management of the fishery from Ottawa closer to the resource. 
Right now there are 1,100 bureaucrats in Ottawa.  I am sure there 
are a lot of good people but I cannot believe that we are 
managing the fishery from Ottawa.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to move the management of the resource out to where the 
resource is on the coast.  That makes sense.  That is what the 
fishing community is asking for.  We need to bring the provinces 
in as partners in trying to get this issue back on track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting that the government can divest its 
responsibility but it definitely needs to include the provinces 
at the table, which it is not doing right now.  I would ask the 
government to look at issues like this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I raised these concerns with the minister, he suggested 
that I should be aware there are more taxpayers in Ontario than 
there are in British Columbia.  This is not about Ottawa versus 
B.C. or Ottawa versus St. John's.  This is trying to put the 
interest of the fishery first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This report was written by 16 members of parliament.  The first 
nine recommendations I am referring to with respect to foreign 
overfishing were supported by every person on the committee—nine 
members of the Liberal government including the parliamentary 
secretary—and we have had no response from the minister.  In 
fact he stood in the House earlier and stated that no fish were 
given to foreign nations unless Canadian fishermen had first 
crack at them.  We know that is not true.  That is absolutely 
false.  We have heard this from fishermen after fishermen when we 
travelled out there and in committee.  It is absolutely wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find incredibly frustrating what the government is not doing. 
We need Bill C-27 with some changes, I might add.  Enabling 
legislation the way it is worded now will not amount to a hill of 
beans.  We have to do something about that before we can support 
the legislation.  We have to amend it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has to do a lot more.  It promised the TAGS 
program to all people in Atlantic Canada until May 1999, and it 
is about to cut them off.  In the coming days about 3,000 people 
are to be cut off.  These people were given letters, went to the 
banks and relied on the program.  The government has gone against 
its word.  It has not come through. It is absolutely terrible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the agreement let us go off on another vein. All 
the minister talked about was the Flemish Cap and the nose and 
the tail of the Grand Banks.  To a lot of listeners out there 
there is another straddling stock, although it is not technically 
a straddling stock, and that is the salmon out in British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the coho is facing extinction and again the government 
is doing nothing.  The minister has been in power for almost a 
year and we are no better off today than we were four or five 
years ago.  It is terrible.  Fishermen out there are in a crisis 
situation.  They are losing their livelihoods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some would argue that we are really talking about the salmon 
which would fall into that category.  They swim in and outside 
the 200 mile limit.  They are highly migratory species. What was 
negotiated was straddling stocks and highly migratory species. 
However the legislation is silent with respect to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go out on a limb.  At the time Minister Tobin was 
negotiating I would suggest his interests were primarily 
Newfoundland and Atlantic Canada.  British Columbia was put 
somewhere on the back burner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Salmon are considered an andromous species.  The act only 
applies to highly migratory species and straddling stocks.  An 
andromous species is one which begins its life cycle in fresh 
water, lives in the oceans but returns to fresh water to spawn, 
for example salmon and trout.  The agreement is silent on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the minister not in New York or at the UN fighting for 
British Columbians and for Canada?  We are on the eve of another 
fishing season in British Columbia and absolutely nothing is 
being done.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw the frustrations last time.  We have been constantly 
after the minister not to wait until the night before this 
fishing season starts but to do something about it now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government appointed a new negotiator, the one person it has 
who stood up and fought for the people of British Columbia. Mr. 
Fortier.  I suggest he resigned out of frustration because he was 
not getting any backing from the government.  He worked very 
hard.  He was the one person that we had who actually fought for 
the people of British Columbia on the American fishing dispute. 
He is gone.  We have a new negotiator.  We are back to square 
one.  Where is the minister on that?  I did not hear one word 
from him on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says in the act that it only applies to highly migratory 
species and straddling stocks and the definitions are to come 
under the UN convention.  These definitions were arrived at in 
the conference on straddling stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The UN fisheries agreement does not apply to salmon.  Why not? 
Where is the minister?  He has lost the confidence of the people 
of British Columbia.  I represent his neighbouring riding and, 
believe me, the people of his own riding are frustrated.  They 
want action.  They want something done and the government is not 
doing anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the minister to start doing something in these other 
areas.  He has an opportunity to look at the interest of the 
fishery as the committee did.  Ten of the sixteen members of the 
committee spent a week to 10 days travelling throughout Atlantic 
Canada and spent a little better than a week in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now that committee is travelling through other parts of 
the country where there are fishery concerns.  They are listening 
to the people.  They are listening to fishermen. They are 
listening to provincial representatives from the legislative 
assemblies of those provinces.  They are listening to the 
fisheries ministers of those provincial legislatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there was nobody from the government's department on the 
Atlantic trip.  They did come on the Pacific trip.  They did not 
come to listen to the people of Atlantic Canada.  They did not 
come to listen to the people of Newfoundland.  This is an 
absolute disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some would way I am digressing from Bill C-27, but the minister 
spoke on this wonderful bill saying that it would solve the 
problem.  First, it has no teeth.  Second, it needs approximately 
14 countries to ratify it before it takes effect.  Is that the 
best the government can do for the last three years and this 
minister for the last year?  Is that the best he can do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be embarrassed if I had to come into the House and say 
that is all I have done in the last year as minister of fisheries 
and oceans.  Why is he not fighting for Canada with the United 
States on the Alaskan fishing dispute?  We have heard his 
comments on newscasts down there that he may have to cut Canadian 
quotas in half in the name of conservation if the Alaskans 
continue.   That is what he is telling the Americans when he goes 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need somebody who can stand up and fight for fishermen.  The 
government should be here announcing that it will not go back on 
its word, that it will honour its commitment to continue to pay 
recipients of TAGS until May 1999 who are now overtaking federal 
offices in Newfoundland out of frustration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have met with these fishermen.  They have said to me  “We 
read in your report that you were against TAGS”.  I explained to 
them that we should be giving them TAGS until May 1999.  That is 
what my colleagues and I believe.  The government has to honour 
its commitment.  Fishermen want to go to work.  That is what they 
have been telling us.  They do not want truckloads of money. They 
want to go to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to move the management of the resource out to the coast. 
We have to instil confidence in DFO.  We have to get rid of the 
politicization.  We have to get rid of the corruption.  We have 
to get rid of some of the regulations in the sealing industry 
which prohibit the export of seal products.  These are all things 
the people of Newfoundland want to do.  We have to get rid of 
foreign quotas and make sure that our Canadian fishermen have 
access to the quotas first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard arguments from the department saying that it is not 
economically feasible for our guys to do that and that it will be 
given to Cuba because it would cost our fishermen 21 cents per 
pound to catch them and they can only sell them for 19 cents.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we not investing in the infrastructure?  Why are we not 
finding some way to put these guys back to work?  Why are we not 
looking at the fishery of the future, identifying what species 
are there and ensuring that our people have access to them?  Then 
we could look at what we could do to make sure the industry will 
be sustainable and viable in the years to come? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we have?  Bill C-27 is what we have.  It is pretty 
impressive for the minister, is it not, to bring in enabling 
legislation on something that was negotiated three years ago 
after being in the House for a year as Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government and the minister do not get off their butts 
and do something they will have a crisis, a revolt in 
Newfoundland.  They will have a revolt in British Columbia. These 
people are frustrated beyond imagination and what they are doing 
in Newfoundland is evidence of that.  They are very frustrated. 
There is no confidence in the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have written a note on my speech on the positive side and I am 
not sure I have found a positive side in the last 10 or 15 
minutes.  On the positive side of coming to parliament has been 
being able to work with the fisheries committee, to sit down with 
16 members from five political parties, to leave our political 
baggage outside the door, to try to bring forward witnesses and 
to make recommendations for the benefit of the fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note there are eight members of the 
government on that committee.  There has been a few exceptions 
but generally that is what we try to do.  Sixteen members of 
parliament from five political parties are in agreement.  We know 
how hard it is to get 16 members of parliament from the same 
party to agree.  We have witnessed that in last few days.  It is 
difficult to get 16 members of parliament from five political 
parties to agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did that in the east coast report, and the government is not 
even looking at it.  There are good recommendations in there that 
look at foreign overfishing.  There are suggestions in there 
about moving resources from Ottawa to the fishery.  The minister 
is just brushing it off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government to take a hard look at the report.  There 
needs to be some more work done on Bill C-27 so that it will have 
the teeth it needs for our enforcement officers to actually do 
something with it.  We need international agreements.  I am in 
full support of that.  However we have to go a long way before we 
solve the fishing crisis.  This is not a drop in the bucket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the minister to listen to what I have said.  It is time he 
started acting instead of giving us smoke and mirrors.

</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK203">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-27, an 
act to amend the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act and the Canada 
Shipping Act to enable Canada to implement the Agreement for the 
Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to 
the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and 
Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and other international fisheries 
treaties or arrangements, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am rising this afternoon to speak to the famous 
Bill C-27 which, I will remind those who have just joined us, is 
the act to amend the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act and the 
Canada Shipping Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must begin by admitting that I am somewhat disappointed to 
have to speak to this bill today,  With all the problems there 
are with the fisheries, I do not think I would have started with 
this one, if I were the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give one example of what is going on in Newfoundland 
today.  The people of Newfoundland are out in the streets 
protesting to let the government know they have a problem and 
need financial support under TAGS.  In response, the government 
pulls Bill C-27 out of a hat, to amend the Fisheries Protection 
Act. However, does that really solve their problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will try to review the situation in the time I have at my 
disposal today. 
I will try to trace the history of this bill. I have said that 
this bill amends the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act and the 
Canada Shipping Act. However, I should also describe its intent. 
It is intended to implement the agreement to apply the 
provisions of the UN convention, which came into effect on 
December 10, 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subject chosen for discussion today is the conservation and 
management of groundfish stocks.  So there were provisions in 
the United Nations fisheries agreement, or UNFA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill started with the December 10, 1982 convention on the 
law of the sea.  Between the two, there was the famous Bill C-29, 
which we voted on in this House and which was the legislation on 
the protection of the straddling stocks, in which the Bloc 
Quebecois participated with pride, because protection of the 
stocks was important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were aware we were writing international law with the former 
Bill C-29, because the other provisions did not exist.  There 
were no treaties or arrangements between countries.  In other 
words, all the member countries fishing in the Atlantic agreed 
on the principle, but few of them agreed on how to honour it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, after the famous Bill C-29, there was the UN fisheries 
agreement, UNFA, which has just arrived and which contains 
provisions drawn from the convention on the law of the sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first like to say that no one opposes the principle.  In 
general terms, the Bloc will support Bill C-27. 
We naturally have some reservations about the bill and we will 
have the opportunity to speak at report stage in the House and 
in committee before third reading and passing of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would mention two reservations today, and some of my 
colleagues will have an opportunity to speak.  The first 
reservation concerns measures for monitoring and boarding 
vessels at sea. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT37"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT37"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1705

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they say they want the means to ensure respect for these 
principles, what will those means be?  What I want to point out, 
first of all, is the lack of transparency of these so-called 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the same problem during debate on Bill C-29, an act to 
amend the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act.  The government 
decided to establish these measures by order-in-council.  In other 
words, cabinet decided behind closed doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must not be forgotten that the public in Canada and 
throughout the world will have to live with these measures.  If 
the government wants its legislation to be complied with by the 
whole world or by all Canadians, it is only fitting that it be 
debated by the 301 members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second aspect of Bill C-27 about which the Bloc Quebecois has 
reservations is the UNFA management philosophy that the 
government is trying to introduce in Bill C-27.  I know that 
this is not easy for those listening at home, so I will try to 
explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does the bill contain measures to board and inspect 
vessels suspected of contravening our Canadian legislation, or 
NAFO's legislation, but it contains a management philosophy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not wish to contest the management philosophy set out in 
general terms in this policy, but I have some questions.  What 
is Canada's management policy?  What does it have as a 
management policy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was elected in 1993.  We already had moratoriums on fishing 
back then.  In the spring of 1994, Mr. Tobin, then fisheries 
minister, introduced the program known as TAGS, or the Atlantic 
Groundfish Strategy. 
A strategy implies having an active tool, but is it the case? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least, Mr. Tobin had the political courage to give a figure. 
He expected he would have to reduce by 50% the size of the 
industry, of the catch. Again, at least he gave a figure and, in 
doing so, he got the debate going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened to that debate? What has happened since 1994? 
The Prime Minister was obsessed with reducing the deficit. 
Because of a lack of funds, the government opposite was penny 
wise and pound foolish. Indeed, four years and $1.9 billion 
later—although that money was needed to provide financial 
support to fishers and plant workers—the government still has 
no idea, no vision about the future of fisheries. Worse still, I 
do not think it has even started working on the issue. This is 
very serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois does make criticism, but it is constructive 
criticism. I want to talk about the most recent report of the 
Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans. My colleague from 
the Reform Party alluded to it earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report includes unanimous recommendations. One way to define 
an approach is to first identify the problem. Then, together we 
can look at the solutions that each one of us puts forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans—and I have not 
yet blamed any party in this House—identified one problem, 
among others. It blamed the federal government—regardless of 
the party in office—for the poor management of fisheries in 
Canada and in Canadian waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members opposite refuse to believe or to hear this. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT38"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT38"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1710

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why? We did not blame any one party in particular. But what can 
we do now to try to correct the situation, again thinking in 
terms of constructive criticism? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After indicating that the problem was poor management by the 
federal government, the committee recommended, among other 
measures, that the department review its management procedures 
and its ways of setting quotas and determining the total 
allowable catch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far, regardless of which party we represent in the House, 
this issue does not present any real problem. Why do we not 
discuss it? 
It is serious because they are preparing to pass a bill that 
imply the existence of management measures and approaches, 
whereas Canada has none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All representatives of the Canadian fishing industry have said, 
some more crudely than others, “We do not trust the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans any more.”  That is the main point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, the Minister of Human Resources Development and 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans are lobbing the ball back 
and forth in an effort to come up with a way to provide 
financial support to workers and fishers.  Neither has specified 
any criteria, set up a committee or consulted the public.  There 
are lots of avenues to explore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a lot to say, but I am afraid of running out of time. 
Time is rushing past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we going to do to get around this?  We explain the 
basis and they come back with the potential result of the work 
begun—Bill C-27—which is supposed to contain management 
measures and approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point I would like to raise, still in connection with 
the report of the Standing Committee on Fisheries— 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to call for 
quorum.  There seems to be a lack of respect on the other side of 
the House for people speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Call in the members.

</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the bells having rung:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> We now have quorum. Resuming 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> Madam Speaker, I was saying that Bill C-27 
showed a lack of vision and management philosophy.  I indicated 
my sources with respect to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans has pointed out 
that the main problem is that the federal government is to blame 
for poor management.  In its report, the committee also 
indicated a way of restoring this credibility, which consists in 
reviewing management methods and ways of establishing total 
allowable catches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to cite article 5 of the United Nations Fishing 
Agreement or UNFA.  This document was written in general terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to look at the purpose of Bill C-27.  What is its 
real purpose?  We do not have to pass a bill to allow a 
participating country, such as Canada, to ratify the agreement. 
It is therefore false to say that the bill is being introduced 
in order to implement the international agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will look at the specific purpose of the bill.  Does it help 
us provide better protection for our straddling stocks?  Bill 
C-29 already does that.  Does it sort out British Columbia's 
problem, as the Reform member said.  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first conclusion I come to today is that Bill C-27 serves 
primarily to introduce a red herring.  All the while the 
government is urging the House, when there is a quorum, to 
debate the fishery, it is trying to give the illusion that it is 
doing something about the fishery problem.  The real problem 
sits across the way and the real impact can be seen in the 
streets of Newfoundland and it will soon be seen in the streets 
of New Brunswick and the Gaspé. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of problems facing the few remaining small 
fishing operations—it is too bad I did not think to bring the 
list with me—the plan for managing the crab fishery in zone 12 
for example, which the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has yet 
to resolve. This concerns Quebec, particularly the Gaspé 
Peninsula, and New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of having us believe that Bill C-27 is incredibly 
important, why does the minister not try to resolve the crab 
management problem? That is something he could do. It would have 
a direct, immediate impact. This would put bread and butter on 
the table for many families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Life in the regions follows the seasons. When the ice starts to 
melt, it is time to go fishing. Wait too long and the water gets 
too warm; there will be strawberries in the fields but crab 
shells will be soft and their flesh white. So, what is the 
minister waiting for? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that there is no crab fishery plan. I think 
there are temporary ones for the shrimp fishery. We are hearing 
complaints from crab fishers in the Sept-Îles area as well. What 
is the minister waiting for to look into it? These are issues 
that need to be resolved and which would have an impact in the 
short term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get back to Bill C-27 now that I have let off some steam. 
As far as I could see in perusing it, Bill C-27 sets out some 
general management principles. Canada has not yet developed its 
own policy, as I said earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote a section—section 5 and its five 
paragraphs—stating general principles for managing fisheries. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In article 5(a) one of the wishes contained in the United 
Nations Fisheries Agreement is to promote optimum utilization. 
What is the department's or the minister's opinion on this? 
Most of all, what is the industry's opinion? Nobody has asked, 
and I believe they are entitled to have the first say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In article 5(f), still in that international agreement which 
Canada would like us to sign with Bill C-27, reference is made to 
fishing gear.  I will spare you all the details, but it ends 
with mention of “environmentally safe and cost-effective fishing 
gear and techniques”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the meaning of this?  Did anyone ask the industry what 
this represents? 
What are they thinking about, when we see Canada preparing to 
commit to such a thing?  This can be interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that, if the government wants MPs to pass a bill to 
help it sign an international agreement, it needs to go first to 
the grass roots.  It could sign it directly, I tell you.  If it 
can, let it not bother us with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still under “general principles”, I have another little 
question.  It will be a good exercise at the same time.  We will 
see whether the Minister of Fisheries himself has read the 
famous agreement he wants so badly for us to adopt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 5(i) states “take into account the interests of 
artisanal and subsistence fishers”.  Here is another good 
question.  Does this mean that Canada is prepared to allow 
artisanal fishing when the fishery starts up again? 
So, we no longer have offshore or midshore fishers. What is 
Canada's position on this issue? What is the industry's 
attitude? What will fishers think? What will the processors who 
will receive the resource think? There is an impact, but we do 
not talk about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told “Pass this bill and all our problems will be solved. 
That is how we managed to stop that Spanish boat, the <I>Estai</I>”. 
This has already been done with Bill C-29. The minister does not 
know what he wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These questions will have to be answered. And I only read three 
paragraphs of clause 5. Already, if the minister was willing to 
have a debate, we could get some idea as to whether Canada hopes 
to have an industry that will more or less operate in this or 
that fashion. But we do not know that and the government is 
introducing legislation to protect our stocks. It is tabling a 
bill that will confirm a management philosophy, but we still do 
not know what it thinks. 
We still do not know what this implies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main problem is that we need to answer these questions to 
deal with the fate of those who are concerned about TAGS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Human Resources Development seems like a nice 
guy. I am taking this opportunity, since he is sitting across 
from me. While he may try to show a great deal of compassion in 
the House when we put questions to him during oral question 
period, his job as human resources minister is to help people 
retrain, after they have been declared surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But who will declare them surplus in the fishing industry, if 
not the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans? I hope the latter will 
assume his responsibilities and not leave them to the 
parliamentary janitor, even though I have a lot of respect for 
him.  Someone must be in charge. 
Someone must get the debate going on this issue, but it is not 
being done right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very concerned by what the government opposite is doing. I 
do not know who will sit on the committee to be set up by the 
Minister of Human Resources Development. First, the members of 
this committee must have some idea of what our industry will 
look like, before determining what must be declared surplus.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something else is not included.  The government is trying to 
regulate the fate of the industry and protect our stocks, but 
under the Canadian Constitution, the federal government is 
responsible for the catch.  Processing, once the fish is landed, 
is a provincial matter.  Everything is related. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The image is distressing: a live fish is federal and a dead fish 
is provincial.  It is not because I come from Quebec that I 
underscore this point and say there are problems.  If I am the 
first to say so, it does not matter because others will say the 
same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an impact on the provinces.  The Minister of Human 
Resources Development knows full well the number of workers 
involved on land. 
He knows a lot of people are involved.  In the Gaspé we have 
always said that one fisher provides work for five people on 
land.  Everything is connected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say, in relation to article 5, that Canada has not had 
discussions with the fishing community—those who catch and 
process—on the general principles of management in the UN 
fisheries agreement.  I wonder what provincial ministers are 
waiting for before initiating discussions with them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before Christmas, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, during 
an opposition day debate on a Progressive Conservative motion 
dealing with an eventual fishing policy, recognized that one 
reason the Atlantic groundfish strategy did not work was that 
the provinces may not have been sufficiently involved. 
To my way of thinking, that does not mean they were not involved 
enough financially, but that they were not involved enough in 
resolving the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the sort of debate we need.  There is a little time yet 
before the House adjourns and before the ministers take their 
holidays, which are perhaps justified.  But I do not want them 
to leave on holiday without providing some security for the 
public, which will be faced with the end of the Atlantic 
groundfish strategy in August 1998.  The people of Newfoundland 
and the Gaspé have got the message and that is why they are in 
the streets today.  It is their only recourse.  They say they 
have no choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see time is passing, please tell me at the end of the day how 
much time I will have tomorrow morning, because I have a lot 
more to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the start and that is what needs to be done.  Tomorrow 
morning I will be back and will carry on. 
I will suggest other approaches, but the message the public is 
waiting to hear is that we at least agree on what the problem is 
and that, once it admits there is a problem, the government 
agrees on a timetable for trying to do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public also expects the government to be transparent in its 
approach and share its criteria, to be sure that it has not 
forgotten anything.  Nobody will be hurt because there are not 
yet any names attached, but we can agree on wording and 
objectives.  That will give us enough to go ahead with.  Later 
on, after we have looked at it together, figures can be added 
and responsibilities assigned, if that is what we are asked to 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am all for decentralization to the provinces.  I would like 
those who are not to adopt the approach I have just outlined, 
which is to define the problem and seek a solution, and not to 
rule out any solution a priori, but to consider them all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill 
C-27 does not address the problem, and that is what I would like 
to continue to do.  It is also a way of improving Bill C-27, 
because management philosophy comes up in this agreement.  If 
the members opposite have not seen it, it is time they went back 
and read the United Nations Fishing Agreement and did their 
homework.  Then we can talk.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-262, an act to amend the Criminal Code (probation order), be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, there are times in this Chamber when one 
realizes the responsibility that we have as members of 
parliament, indeed the privilege, of being able to come to this 
place where laws are made in Canada and have direct input such as 
I have at this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill I have brought to the attention of the House has arisen 
from a situation that is not unique in my constituency but which 
was drawn to my attention in 1996.  It is not unique in my 
constituency that when we have crimes committed the presiding 
judge has the opportunity, at the time of sentencing when the 
sentence is two years less a day, to include in the file, indeed 
in the sentence, terms of probation. In the case of giving a 
sentence in excess of two years less a day unfortunately that 
provision does not exist in criminal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From time to time governments come forward with omnibus 
legislation in particular in the area of justice.  Omnibus 
legislation is simply a gathering together of all the bits and 
pieces of improvements that can be made to Canada's Criminal Code 
and moving this forward through the House of Commons to clean up 
a number of details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no way this bill is inspired by any partisan interest 
whatsoever. This is a bill that I am sure would receive the 
support of all members of this Chamber.  It is a simple piece of 
fine tuning on existing legislation that would improve Canada's 
justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I confess I am not a lawyer.  In some circles that would be seen 
as a bonus.  However, we will leave that one where it sits.  I am 
a simple layman who went to a lawyer and said what is the 
improvement that should be made, and it is from that that this 
legislation flows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the situation?  Unfortunately back in 1996 a 34 year 
old man was convicted of beating his own 28 day old son, a very 
despicable crime.  The judge at the time of sentencing noted this 
individual had a prior record of doing this kind of thing.  It 
was the judge's contention that if there had been some sort of 
provision in the sentencing in either the first or second 
instance the wife of this man, the woman who bore this child, 
would have been aware that she would have to be more protective 
of her own child.  There would have been the possibility that 
such a union would not have taken place in the first place 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very difficult case.  I am not trying to tack on to 
this sentencing by this judge.  I am not trying to make a 
mountain out of a mole hill.  I am simply saying that the judge 
was right.  This is as good an indicator as any. 
Judges should have exactly the same opportunity as they have in 
sentencing two years less a day to affect the outcome and the 
considerations at the time of probation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read from a news report at the time: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time of the sentencing the judge criticized the federal 
laws from preventing him from attaching a probation period to the 
sentence. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now hope that [my] proposed legislation will take 
into account the conditions at the time of sentencing to allow 
judges to attach probation periods to federal sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this kind of fine tuning that allows all hon. members of 
the House to come to this place and say here is a problem, what 
can we do to fix it.  However, as private members we are thwarted 
by the system within the House.  As I said at the beginning of my 
address I am very pleased and privileged to have the opportunity 
to come to the House to make a plea for this change on behalf not 
only of my own constituents but all Canadians and to improve the 
justice system.  At the same time as a private member I am really 
constrained as to how far I can take this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I brought the bill to the House following that instance in 1996. 
We are already in 1998.  This is a two year process.  In the 
intervening period of time there has been an election where the 
people of Kootenay—Columbia chose me to come back to the House 
so again I presented the same bill to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill then goes into a lottery.  I have three bills in this 
hopper at this time.  My name was drawn and I had to choose one 
of the bills.  I considered this bill to be the most important of 
the three I have presently in the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then go before a committee that makes a judgment as to 
whether these bills are going to become votable.  If it is 
votable it will be able to move from this Chamber after second 
reading to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am fully aware that the justice committee is exceptionally 
busy at this time.  There is a tremendous amount of pressure on 
the committee.  There is no intent with this minuscule change 
that we are talking about to add to this already onerous 
workload.  It is a simple matter of saying here is an 
improvement, could we get this small improvement included in a 
future omnibus bill that will be brought forward containing many 
other bits and pieces of improvements to the legal system. That 
is my direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went before the committee and said could we make this votable 
so that the House could move the proposed bill to the committee. 
That committee in its wisdom said, for whatever reason, it is not 
important enough and that it will not permit this to be votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore it seems logical that with the committee's having 
arrived at that decision I should ask for unanimous consent of 
this House to permit this to become a votable bill.  I do not 
expect a tremendous amount of debate on the bill but at the end 
of the day that the House allow this to move forward to committee 
work. I ask for unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sure there is some good 
reason why the government would not want to see this moved to 
committee in its present form.  I would ask for unanimous consent 
for the intent of this bill, the wording, to be drawn to the 
attention of the justice committee to become part of what it is 
doing in terms of improving Canadian law.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak to Bill C-262, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code (probation order), introduced by the member for 
Kootenay—Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill has only one clause.  It is intended to replace 
paragraph 731(1)(<I>b</I>) of the Criminal Code with the following: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>) In addition to fining or sentencing the offender to 
imprisonment, direct that the offender comply with the 
conditions prescribed in a probation order. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions of sections 731 and 731.1 of the Code currently 
deal with probation orders. 
They were updated and modernized with the in depth reform of 
sentencing, which was completed in Bill C-41, a bill the House 
passed in the first session of the last Parliament.  It became 
chapter 22 of the 1995 Statutes of Canada and currently is 
included in part XXIII of the Criminal Code of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 731 enables the sentencing judge to subject a delinquent 
to a probationary order.  Under paragraph 1(<I>a</I>) the court may 
defer sentencing and order probation if no minimum sentence is 
provided for the offence at issue. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this last limitation which the hon. member proposes 
parliament remove from the section.  Judges would then be allowed 
to attach a probation order to any sentence of imprisonment no 
matter how long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a few other related provisions to which I draw the 
attention of the House.  Section 732.2(1) describes when a 
probation order comes into force: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A probation order comes into force 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>a) on the date on which the order is made; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>b) where the offender is sentenced to imprisonment under 
paragraph 731(1)(b) or was previously sentenced to imprisonment 
for another offence, as soon as the offender is released from 
prison or, if released from prison on conditional release, at the 
expiration of the sentence of imprisonment; or 
</I></B></P><P align=left>c) where the offender is under a conditional sentence, at the 
expiration of the conditional sentence. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 732.2(2) provides that no probation order shall continue 
in force for more than three years after the date on which the 
order came into force.  Section 732.1(2) sets out the mandatory 
conditions which must be contained in a probation order and 
section 732.1(3) provides a list of optional conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might be useful for hon. members to be reminded of some of 
these conditions: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) abstain from: 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) the consumption of alcohol or other intoxicating 
substances, or 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(ii) the consumption of drugs except in accordance with a medical 
prescription; 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) abstain from owning, possessing or carrying a weapon; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) provide for the support or care of dependants; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(f) perform up to 240 hours of community service over a period 
not exceeding eighteen months; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(g) if the offender agrees, and subject to the program 
director's acceptance of the offender, participate actively 
in a treatment program approved by the province; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(h) comply with such other reasonable conditions as the court 
considers desirable, subject to any regulations made under 
subsection 738(2), for protecting society and for facilitating 
the offender's successful reintegration into the community.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That final reference, the so-called basket clause, underlines 
the fundamental purpose of probation which is to protect society, 
but also to facilitate an offender's successful reintegration 
into society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is also the purpose of parole or conditional release.  It 
is parole which provides that reintegration for offenders 
sentenced to sentences of over two years.  I will have more to 
say about that later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give two examples of the span of control that probation 
can provide.  It is quite common to see a conditional sentence, 
for example two years less a day, accompanied by a three year 
probation order containing similar conditions to those found in 
the conditional sentence order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This protects society by providing a five year period of control 
and supervision over the offender with conditions that can be 
tailored and indeed changed over time to reflect changing 
circumstances and needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An offender sentenced to, say, 18 months in provincial custody 
could be under a period of probation supervision for up to three 
years.  This, too, is commonplace and a sensible societal 
response to crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be useful to give some historical perspective on the use 
of probation in Canada.  Probation started in this country in 
1889 under the authority of an act to permit the conditional 
release of first offenders in certain cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our first Criminal Code, passed in 1892, provided that first 
offenders convicted of offences punishable by not more than two 
years' imprisonment could be released on probation of conduct 
under a recognizance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsequent 1921 legislation provided for the supervision of 
probationers in the community and thereafter most provinces 
enacted legislation creating probation services.  There is no 
federal probation service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member's proposals were carried through, there would 
be potential for conflict with the role and understanding of 
parole and other forms of conditional release for federal 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Penitentiary sentences already incorporate an appropriate range 
of supervised releases which have been carefully put in place for 
the safe and controlled reintegration of offenders into the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As recently as late August the government introduced a new 
sentencing category to the Criminal Code called long term 
offender.  A court which designates an offender as a long term 
offender can sentence the offender to a penitentiary sentence 
followed by a period of long term supervision of up to a maximum 
of 10 years which begins when the period of incarceration, 
including parole, expires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is only one example of the measures that have been 
implemented to ensure the protection of society.  There are many 
more.  To illustrate, there is work release, escorted and 
unescorted temporary absences, day parole, full parole, statutory 
release and long term supervision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me take a moment to describe these supervised releases in 
more detail so that members of the House can appreciate the 
comprehensive range of release mechanisms that are in place at 
the present time for the safe reintegration of federal offenders 
into society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is work release which is a release program allowing 
a penitentiary inmate to work for a specified duration in the 
community on a paid or voluntary basis while under supervision. 
Generally, an inmate is eligible for work release when he or she 
has served one-sixth of the sentence or six months, whichever is 
greater. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institutional head has authority to grant a work release of 
up to a maximum period of 60 days under specified conditions 
which always include supervision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Correctional authorities grant work releases to carefully 
selected inmates who perform work and services of benefit to the 
community, such as painting, general repairs and maintenance of 
community centres or homes for the aged.  Work release is one of 
the first steps in the safe, gradual reintegration of offenders 
into society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the escorted temporary absence.  This is a short 
term release to the community under escort.  Most inmates are 
eligible for such an absence at any time during the sentence. 
The duration of an escorted temporary absence varies from an 
unlimited period for medical reasons to not more than 15 days for 
any other specified reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institutional head may authorize an escorted temporary 
absence.  In certain instances involving lifers, National Parole 
Board approval is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, escorted temporary absences are granted to allow 
inmates to obtain treatment that is unavailable in a 
penitentiary, to attend critically ill family members and to 
prepare for other types of conditional release.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is parole.  This is a form of conditional release 
which enables some offenders to serve part of their sentence out 
in the community, provided they comply with certain conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since most offenders will eventually be released, the best way 
to protect the public is to help them to reintegrate with 
society through a gradual and supervised release mechanism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parole is a privilege, not a right, and the National Parole 
Board has the power to grant or deny it. 
In order to reach that decision, board members carefully examine 
the information provided by the victims, the courts, the 
correctional authorities, and the offender. A number of factors 
are taken into account, but protecting society is foremost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is followed by statutory release. Generally speaking, the 
offender is entitled to be released into the community once he 
has served two-thirds of his sentence.  As is the case for 
parole, offenders who have been given statutory release serve 
the final third of their sentence in the community under 
supervision, provided they comply with certain conditions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every long term offender is subject to standard conditions such 
as keeping the peace.  Special conditions can be added to ensure 
close supervision of the offenders, such as electronic monitoring 
and monetary participation and counselling.  Correctional Service 
Canada provides the supervision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the hon. member's proposal would create a 
potential conflict with the role of parole and other forms of 
release appropriate for federal offenders. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to rise in the House to speak to this bill.  I 
am encouraged that the hon. member has brought forward this 
legislation.  It is an interesting reflection of what he has 
experienced in his own constituency.  I commend him for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to hear him recognize how busy the justice committee 
is.  In fact, I came here tonight from the justice committee 
where we have been meeting for most of the day.  We had the 
opportunity to question the commissioner of correctional 
services, a timely witness given the bill that is currently 
before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the government member pointed out, the bill would seek to 
replace a section of the Criminal Code and provide judges with 
the power to provide a probationary period for an individual who 
is convicted and sentenced to more than two years less a day. For 
those who are not familiar with the reason for that distinction, 
it should be made clear that offenders who are sentenced to two 
years less a day serve their time in a provincial correctional 
facility, while those who are sentenced to two years or more 
serve their time in a federal penitentiary. There is a 
difference.  There is a distinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having been a legal aid lawyer for some time I am aware of the 
many different programs available in the different jurisdictions 
to assist offenders in reintegrating into society.  Those are all 
calculations which any defence counsel will make in discussions 
with the crown.  They are all calculations made in the sentencing 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice talked 
about the potential conflict between different programs.  I 
appreciate that, yet I fail to see reasons for not supporting 
this legislation which is a common sense approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Kootenay—Columbia said he is not a lawyer.  He 
is, in fact, a lawmaker.  I understand how confusing it can 
sometimes be to read through these sections for those who are not 
schooled in the law.  Those of us who practise law on a regular 
basis are familiar with them.  I will not refer to the Criminal 
Code too much, but I think there are some provisions worth noting 
in addition to those noted by the parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the reason people argue against this kind of bill is 
that the court cannot foresee what will happen to an offender in 
two years.  The reason the court has the power to place the 
probationary conditions referred to on an offender of two years 
less a day is because the court still maintains some control over 
that offender.  Realistically, if the offender is sentenced to 
four or five years, the court cannot gauge what kind of progress 
that individual will make in an effort to rehabilitate himself or 
herself to re-enter society.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that while that is a compelling argument, it is not one 
that necessarily stands in the way of this proposed change 
because the code also provides at subsection 732.2(3): 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A court that makes a probation order may at any time, on 
application by the offender, the probation officer or the 
prosecutor, require the offender to appear before it and, after 
hearing the offender and one or both of the probation officer and 
the prosecutor, 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) make any changes to the optional conditions that in the 
opinion of the court are rendered desirable by a change in the 
circumstances since those conditions were prescribed, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) relieve the offender, either absolutely or on such terms or 
for such period as the court deems desirable, of compliance with 
any optional condition. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is in favour of the legislation proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those who would say we do not know where the offender 
is going to be in three years.  If an offender is sentenced to a 
period of time, accepts the help offered in a facility to 
rehabilitate himself or herself, they can come back to court and 
ask that the conditions in the probation order be lifted.  If in 
the opinion of the court they are no longer a threat to the 
public, the court has the power to lift the order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find myself commending this piece of proposed legislation 
because I think it provides the court more remedies to try to 
rehabilitate an offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it heartening that the hon. member sees value in 
providing offenders with a period of probation.  It is heartening 
to see that the hon. member recognizes that greater options for 
probation and parole are mechanisms to reintegrate the offender 
into the community.  The system is not simply restricted to 
sentencing him to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will give the judge the option.  Instead of having to 
say that the offence is serious, but there are compelling 
circumstances for the offender and, therefore, he does not want 
to sentence him to five years, he can sentence him to three years 
with a period of probation for two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will allow the judge to have more flexibility in sentencing 
the offender to less time with a probationary period.  I must say 
that it comes as a surprise to me that this would come forward to 
allow the court to do that, but I see some merit in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some problems with it.  It is too bad it is not being 
referred to the justice committee, but our plate is full right 
now with a number of pieces of legislation that have been 
referred to us.  It is an interesting piece of legislation which 
would provide the court some flexibility and I thank the member 
for presenting it to the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will indicate at the outset that I am in support 
of Bill C-262 which was first introduced in October by the hon. 
member for Kootenay—Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not often that we in this House have an opportunity to 
debate a piece of legislation that, while brief in detail, could 
have a very important impact on protecting the public at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned by previous speakers, and in particular my 
colleague from Nova Scotia, we have an opportunity in the House 
to impact directly on our criminal justice system.  The Minister 
of Justice has stood in this House many times and in response to 
questions from the opposition benches has said there are no 
simple answers. 
That may be partly true but at times there are simple answers. 
This bill in its present form is a very straightforward and 
simple answer to a problem that exists in our Criminal Code. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT48"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT48"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1800

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Nova Scotia has already spoken about some of 
the nuances that exist when it comes to sentencing, the 
principles of sentencing and the difference between a provincial 
and federal sentence and the designation of two years plus or 
minus a day. I will not go into detail on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an opportunity here to allow judges to have greater 
discretion in the sentencing process, that is, judges who in the 
first instance place sentences on offenders and put in place 
conditions in the instance of a provincial sentence. Judges are 
in a unique position to assess the circumstances of the offence. 
They would have the benefit of the input of defence and crown 
counsel.  They would have potentially heard a trial and made 
rulings of fact.  Therefore the judge in the first instance has 
the unique opportunity to craft a sentence that is best aimed at 
meeting the principles of sentencing which are reformation and 
rehabilitation, not to mention the protection of the public and 
society's denunciation of certain criminal acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill allows judges to become more involved in the process 
for sentences that go beyond the two year mark.  I would like to 
commend the hon. member as well.  This is a unique and 
straightforward bill he is bringing before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make a few comments with respect to the Reform Party's 
position on this.  In the past we have heard derogatory remarks 
in this House from members of the Reform Party about judges 
generally.  I am not going to get into the details of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that this bill gives judges more 
discretion.  It is very important that we in this place do not 
stand up and be overly critical of a certain institution, such as 
judges, and then turn around and want to empower them with 
greater discretion in what I would interpret as a means to give 
judges greater respect and control within the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-262 clearly gives judges additional power.  With that 
comes additional responsibility. Although judges have been given 
greater discretion by this legislation, I caution Reform members 
about some of their comments about judges generally.  When 
members of Canada's Parliament refer to judges in this 
institution I do caution them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As referred to earlier, the justice committee has a great deal 
on its plate.  I would like to inform the hon. member that I took 
the opportunity today, because I knew this piece of legislation 
was coming forward, to ask the director of Correctional Service 
Canada what his reaction would be to this initiative. I was 
interested by his response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The director felt that it was not necessary.  He felt that there 
were sufficient safeguards in place and that Correctional Service 
Canada and the parole board had the ability and were in a better 
position to craft the conditions of release when a prisoner had 
served his or her time or, as we have come to know it, a portion 
of his or her time prior to being released. I was somewhat 
surprised that he responded so quickly with that. As I indicated 
earlier in my remarks, I think this opportunity to have judges 
craft a sentence in the first instance early in the process might 
have long term ramifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thought which came to mind while I was listening to some of 
the remarks of the other speakers would be that the parole board 
or Correctional Service Canada would have the discretion to add 
or subtract certain conditions based on the progress of the 
offender or the rehabilitative steps the offender had made while 
incarcerated, depending on whether it was a long term or a short 
term sentence.  The parliamentary secretary to the minister has 
referred to the fact that it is perhaps not necessary because for 
long term sentences the parole board or Correctional Service 
Canada are in a better position to assess that progress.

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I hearken back to my earlier remarks.  It is very 
important in all the steps an offender goes through from 
apprehension to eventual release into society that all the 
interested parties should have and through this legislation could 
have greater input into the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer quickly to a couple of cases. These are factual 
cases before the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One involves an individual by the name of Raymond Russell who 
was a convicted killer.  On May 29, 1996 he murdered Darlene 
Turnbull in her Vernon, British Columbia home.  At the time Mr. 
Russell had been released on full parole and was boarding with 
Ms. Turnbull. Problems came to light as a result of a Corrections 
Canada inquiry after the fact.  The Canadian Resource Centre for 
Victims of Crime has done a great deal of research into this 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Parole Board in conjunction with CSC did the 
report.  It focused on the fact that there was a lack of exchange 
of information.  It highlights the fact that apparently in many 
instances a breakdown in information exchange is occurring in the 
justice system.  It poses very grave consequences for the public 
at large if all that information is not available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of this bill, we have an opportunity for judges 
early on to have input into long term sentences.  They would then 
be subject to those conditions the judges might deem appropriate 
in the first instance and would be subject to review from the 
contemplated time of release to see if they were still 
appropriate. Although the Minister of Justice has said that there 
are no simple solutions, I would suggest that this is a very 
simple change that could take place.  We should embrace it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing Canadians have hoped for and have come to expect is 
that we should be looking for solutions that make the law more 
pliable and more applicable.  If that involves updating or 
changing the law, we should encourage that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are times when the law could be made simpler.  It could be 
made more user friendly.  It could be more user friendly for 
police officers who have to be the first line of contact when the 
law is broken.  It could be more user friendly for victims and 
people who are brought into the system through no will or no want 
of their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another case involves Michael Hector who was a convicted armed 
robber and on parole when he was involved in the murder of three 
innocent people in the Thunder Bay area.  He was on parole at the 
time he committed these heinous crimes.  Prior to his release the 
National Parole Board had granted him day parole.  It came to 
light that factually some of the conditions that had been placed 
upon him were not being followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It highlights again the need for appropriate conditions to be in 
place.  They have been described in some cases as abstention from 
alcohol, non-association with prior comrades, or staying away 
from playgrounds in the case of a sexual offender.  Those types 
of conditions could be diagnosed.  Perhaps I am using that word 
inappropriately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A judge in the first instance could make that determination and 
put those conditions in place.  They could be reviewed prior to 
the offender's release, whether that is two, four, six or eight 
years down the road.  They could be reviewed by the parole board 
and deemed to be appropriate or not appropriate.  The important 
thing is the conditions are there and everything humanly possible 
is done to ensure that the proper conditions are in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support this piece of legislation. I commend the hon. member 
for bringing this bill to the floor of the House.  I am sure the 
policing community, the victims advocate community and the public 
at large would see this as a positive change to our Criminal 
Code.  I am encouraged that all members have spoken favourably on 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party, we support this 
legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am also glad to 
participate in the debate on Bill C-262 presented by the member 
for Kootenay—Columbia. 
Criminal justice issues such as this one are of much concern to 
all Canadians and to myself.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed bill would amend the Criminal Code. More 
specifically it would amend it such that it would allow a court 
to direct that a federal offender, that is to say any offender 
serving two years or more, comply with a probation order. 
Currently as it stands, the court's authority to impose a 
probation order is limited to provincial offenders.  That is the 
way it should remain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member's proposal were carried through, there would 
be potential for conflict with the role and understanding of 
parole and other forms of conditional release for federal 
offenders.  Frankly what would be the point if it is going to 
confuse the issues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal sentences already incorporate an appropriate range of 
supervised releases which have been carefully put in place for 
the safe and controlled reintegration of offenders into the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As recently as last August the government introduced a new 
sentencing category to the Criminal Code called long term 
offender.  A court which designates an offender as a long term 
offender will sentence the offender to a penitentiary sentence 
and a period of long supervision of up to a maximum of 10 years 
which begins when the period of incarceration, including parole, 
expires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is only one example of the measures that have been 
implemented to ensure the protection of society.  There are many 
more I could give. To illustrate, there is work release, escorted 
and unescorted temporary absences, day parole, full parole, 
statutory release, and long term supervision as I have just 
mentioned. Let me take a moment to describe these supervised 
releases in more detail so that members of the House can 
appreciate the comprehensive range of release mechanisms that are 
in place for the safe reintegration of federal offenders into 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First there is work release, which is a release program allowing 
a penitentiary inmate to work for a specified duration in the 
community on a paid or voluntary basis while under supervision. 
Generally an inmate is eligible for work release when he or she 
has served one-sixth of the sentence or six months, whichever is 
greater.  The institutional head has the authority to grant a 
work release of up to a maximum period of 60 days under specified 
conditions which always include supervision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Correctional authorities grant work release to carefully 
selected inmates who perform work and services of benefit to the 
community.  Work release is one of the first steps in the safe 
gradual reintegration of offenders into society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An escorted temporary absence is short term release to the 
community under escort.  Most inmates are eligible for such an 
absence at any time during their sentence.  The duration of an 
escorted temporary absence varies from an unlimited period for 
medical reasons for example to not more than 15 days for any 
other specified reason.  Again the institutional head may 
authorize escorted temporary absences at his discretion. In 
certain instances involving lifers, National Parole Board 
approval is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, escorted temporary absences are granted to allow 
inmates to obtain treatment that is unavailable in the 
penitentiary, to attend critically ill family members and to 
prepare for other types of conditional release. An inmate may be 
granted an escorted temporary absence to meet with the staff of a 
community residential centre where he or she wishes to reside or 
to confirm employment as part of his or her release plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An unescorted temporary absence is another form of short term 
release but without an escort.  Most inmates in the penitentiary 
system are eligible for unescorted temporary absences at 
one-sixth of the sentence or six months into the sentence, again 
whichever is later.  Lifers and inmates with indeterminate 
sentences are not eligible for unescorted temporary absences 
until three years before their full parole eligibility date. 
Maximum security inmates are not eligible for this type of 
release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An unescorted temporary absence can be for an unlimited period 
for medical reasons and for a maximum of 60 days for specified 
personal development programs.  Unescorted temporary absences for 
community service or personal development can be for a maximum of 
15 days, up to three times per year for a medium security inmate, 
or four times per year for a minimum security inmate. The 
duration of other types of unescorted temporary absences ranges 
from a maximum of 48 hours per month for a medium security inmate 
to 72 hours for a minimum security inmate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is parole.  Parole is a form of conditional release 
which allows some offenders to serve part of their sentence in 
the community, provided they abide by certain conditions imposed. 
Because most offenders will ultimately be released into their 
communities, I believe the best way to protect the public is to 
help offenders reintegrate into society through a gradual and 
controlled supervised release.

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parole is a privilege rather than a right and the National 
Parole Board has discretion whether to grant that parole. In 
determining whether to grant parole board members carefully 
review information provided by victims, the courts, correctional 
authorities and the offender.  In arriving at a decision the 
board considers a number of factors, above all the protection of 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two types of parole, day parole and full parole.  Day 
parole requires the offender to return to the institution or 
halfway house each evening unless otherwise specified by the 
National Parole Board.  Most federal inmates can apply for a day 
parole at either six months into their sentence or six months 
before the full eligibility date, again whichever is later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Day parole is normally granted up to a maximum of six months. 
Lifers, those serving for first and second degree murder, and 
inmates serving indeterminate sentences are eligible three years 
prior to full parole eligibility date.  Day parole therefore 
provides inmates with the opportunity to participate in community 
based activities to prepare for full parole or eventual statutory 
release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Full parole is a conditional release which allows an offender to 
serve the remainder of a sentence in the community.  It is the 
culmination of an offender's gradual structured and controlled 
release program.  Under this form of release an offender may live 
with his or her family and continue to work and contribute to 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next there is statutory release.  As a general rule an inmate is 
legally entitled to be released into the community at two-thirds 
of the sentence.  Similar to parole, offenders on statutory 
release serve the remaining third of their sentence in the 
community, again under supervision provided they abide by certain 
conditions.  However, not all inmates are entitled to statutory 
release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, there is a new sentencing category recently 
added to the criminal code called long term offender.  This 
procedure is similar to the dangerous offender category process 
in place and applies to offenders convicted of sexual offences 
such as sexual assault, sexual interference, invitation to sexual 
touching, sexual exploitation, exposure, aggravated sexual 
assault and sexual assault with a weapon or causing bodily harm. 
The procedure is also applicable to an offender who committed 
another offence with a sexual component. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An offender designated as a long term offender at a special 
sentencing hearing will be sentenced to a penitentiary sentence 
and a period of long term supervision for up to a maximum of 10 
years which starts when the period of incarceration, including 
any parole, expires.  A court can impose long term supervision 
where in its judgment the risk presented by the offender can be 
managed in the community through appropriate supervision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every long term offender is subject to standard conditions such 
as keeping the peace.  Special conditions can also be added to 
ensure close supervision of offenders such as electronic 
monitoring and mandatory participation in counselling. 
Correctional Service Canada provides the supervision in these 
cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's proposal is well intentioned but falls short 
of the impact intended by the recent changes to the Corrections 
and Conditional Release Act added to the Criminal Code brought by 
the government to enhance the protection of the public.  At the 
risk of repeating myself, federal probation would create a 
potential conflict with the role of parole and other forms of 
release appropriate for federal offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal sentences already incorporate a comprehensive range of 
supervised releases for the safe and gradual integration of 
federal offenders into the community.  Probation is a part of a 
variety of supervised releases which are suitable for provincial 
offenders and that is where the probation should remain in my 
opinion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie—Lincoln, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise this afternoon and address Bill C-262 put forward 
by my colleague, the hon. member for Kootenay—Columbia.  I would 
also like to compliment the member for Sydney—Victoria for 
showing us the distinction between the sentences of two years 
less a day and two years and beyond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the hon. member for Kootenay—Columbia has 
responded to the concerns of a judge in his riding and the need 
for trial judges to have input on probation orders.  I compliment 
this member of the bench for coming forward with constructive 
comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases it is true that trial judges have a detailed 
knowledge of a case that may not be accurately reflected at the 
time of probation.  For reasons outlined by the hon. 
parliamentary secretaries, such traditional discretion concerning 
parole in all cases may be in conflict with the existing role of 
parole and other forms of release appropriate for federal 
offenders.

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For reasons discussed by the hon. parliamentary secretaries, the 
government feels that Bill C-262 may contravene the fundamental 
purpose of probation which is not only to protect society but to 
facilitate the offender's successful reintegration into society. 
While in these cases of sentences over two years judges may not 
have influence, an important fact to keep in mind is that victims 
do.  A balance has been struck between the rights of the victim 
and the rehabilitation of the offender by the ongoing involvement 
of the victims and the victims' families.  They are the ones who 
should also influence probation decisions and conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conflict of Bill C-262 and the comprehensive range of 
releases has already been discussed by my colleagues.  This 
discussion on Bill C-262 should be unnecessary in light of the 
far ranging reforms made to sentencing in Bill C-41 in the first 
session of the last parliament.  Bill C-41 was a response to and 
a product of over 14 years of effort to achieve comprehensive 
reform in the sentencing process as part of the criminal justice 
system in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need for reform in the sentencing process has long been 
recognized by judges, parliamentarians, lawyers and by Canadians 
themselves.  For over a decade there have been calls for such a 
reform, a royal commission on the subject, the law reform 
commission, the Canadian Sentencing Commission which reported in 
1987, and in 1988 an all-party committee of the House which had a 
comprehensive set of recommendations with respect to sentencing, 
conditional releases and corrections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While many of those recommendations were reflected in the 
government's sentencing bill, my hon. colleagues opposite chose 
to reject the entire bill.  Here they stand today asking for 
changes in sentencing that may well have been addressed in 1995. 
If this judicial problem existed at that time it would have been 
prudent of the member for Kootenay—Columbia to have meaningfully 
participated in a debate on the fundamentals of that bill rather 
than on the semantics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the terms of that bill Canadians now have a say through 
parliament on the purpose and the principles of criminal 
sentencing for the first time.  Previously, parliament's role in 
sentencing was limited to setting certain maximum levels of 
incarceration and rarely minimum levels rather than dealing with 
the policy objectives of the sentencing process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-41 brought together a statement of the purposes and 
principles of sentencing, the rules governing procedure and the 
admissibility of evidence in the process, and the various 
sanctions the courts may impose to punish, to deter, to 
rehabilitate, all in a form that represented the collective view 
of parliament.  The changes proposed then, unlike the one today, 
were broadly accepted by criminal justice professionals, the 
provinces and the territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of a statement of purposes and principles was 
endorsed by the Canadian Sentencing Commission, the justice 
committee of this House and the former law reform commission of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through Bill C-41 parliament provided the course with clear 
guidelines.  It effectively granted discretion to the judiciary. 
Parliament stressed the need to punish certain types of behaviour 
by clearly stating that the purpose of sentencing must be to 
denounce unlawful conduct, to deter offenders and other persons 
from committing crimes and to separate offenders from society 
where necessary.  This provided judges from coast to coast to 
coast with much of the discretion to sentence according to the 
motivation and severity of the crime rather than being boxed in 
by the word of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statement of the purposes and principles of sentencing 
provided that a sentence must take into consideration the will to 
protect society, to assist in rehabilitating offenders in 
promoting their sense of responsibility, and to provide 
reparations for harm done to victims of the community. A general 
principle that ran throughout Bill C-41 was that jails should be 
reserved for those who should be there.  Alternatives should be 
in place for those who commit offences but who do not need or 
merit incarceration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What alternatives will be available?  For the first time Bill 
C-41 introduced diversion for adult offenders.  At the discretion 
of the investigating officers and the appropriate authorities, 
persons charged with minor offences, in particular for the first 
time, could be sent into a parallel stream away from the 
courtroom to be counselled or to be helped to overcome whatever 
problem led to the infraction.  This government saw fit that 
judges have a great deal of discretion in determining whether 
alternative sentencing was appropriate. To date courts continue 
to have probation as an appropriate sanction in the cases that 
require it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-41 was only one of the many initiatives in the area of 
criminal justice this government has implemented in order to 
provide a balance and a comprehensive approach to the challenge 
of crime in Canada.  We have worked hard and long with the 
judicial community to form policy that addresses its unique 
considerations. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it has been interesting to listen to government members today. 
They have talked about this bill in terms of release mechanisms 
for offenders.  We heard from the last speaker that this bill 
should be unnecessary because of Bill C-41 introduced in 1995. 
I point out to the government that the offence that prompted my 
moving this bill took place in 1996 and that the presiding judge 
in my constituency clearly did not find the provisions in Bill 
C-41 to be adequate to answer the problem.  Perhaps the problem 
is best reflected in the comments that have been made by the 
government.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has addressed this bill strictly or almost 
exclusively from the point of view of release mechanisms for 
offenders.  This bill addresses the rights of the victims and the 
responsibility of the government, the law makers of this land, to 
see that the people who are affected by these criminal acts are 
more properly protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was interested in the qualified support from both the NDP and 
the Progressive Conservatives.  I was encouraged by the NDP 
member when he said this is a common sense approach.  That was 
also reflected in the words of the Progressive Conservative 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one problem with the bill that appears to have become clear 
is that the presiding judge probably would not have any way of 
knowing and cannot foresee what kind of progress the offender 
might make. The remedy to that has been proposed, particularly by 
the speaker from the NDP.  It could come back to the sentencing 
court. The presiding judge who was there at the time of the 
conviction and the sentencing would be able to have some input. 
As has been pointed out by the Progressive Conservative member, 
the bill I have proposed would allow more flexibility within the 
judicial system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask for unanimous consent that Bill C-262 be withdrawn, that 
the order for second reading discharged and the subject matter 
thereof referred to the standing committee on justice for further 
study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is quite disappointing 
that the government would have such a closed mind on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To recap, the government takes great pride in enacting 
legislation in the previous parliament which it says solves all 
the problems.  We have a situation in my constituency that I am 
sure is not unique where the judge says there is not sufficient 
latitude.  I have support of colleagues in the House on this side 
speaking of a common sense approach and allowing more 
flexibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is just regrettable that the government cannot see fit to 
look at options presented to it in good faith by people on this 
side of the House.  That is all that I have to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The time provided 
for the consideration of Private Members' Business has now 
expired and the order is dropped from the order paper.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT

<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the chance to follow up on my question about the multilateral 
agreement on investment, providing a broad based public 
consultation, and having the government do that so the people of 
Canada can participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before taking that step, the government should analyse the 
implication and the impact of the multilateral agreement on 
investment on our democracy in light of being locked in to it for 
20 years, the impact on employment and environmental standards 
and the subjugation of lower levels of government in relation to 
the conditions of the multilateral agreement on investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were concerned about the potential implications of national 
treatment for foreign companies and want the government to table 
the analysis particularly when it comes to first nations 
governments and their ability to look after their people or 
territorial or provincial governments.

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By consulting the people, the government will show it is 
concerned about trade in the country and who will benefit the 
most, which should be the people and not just the owners of large 
amounts of capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian economy has always been global.  That has never 
been a question.  However it is how we organize that global 
interaction and who it is to benefit, the people of the country. 
It has always been the objective to have good levels of wages and 
to sustain our health care and education system and not to remove 
the people's choice for democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the multilateral agreement, the federal 
government should not sign the agreement or any other agreement 
unless there is a binding agreement protecting the abilities of 
provinces, territories and the national government to protect 
their interest over the long term and not be subjected to the 
short term interest of foreign investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ask the government to let us know what kind of consultation 
it is willing to undertake and what time schedule it is looking 
at.  Considering the agreement has made a pit-stop as it is 
called in negotiations, this is the perfect time to do an impact 
analysis and consult the people of the country on what direction 
they want their government to take when it comes to international 
trade. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
concern expressed by my colleague across the way.  It is the 
right and responsibility of every citizen of the country to be 
concerned and as fully informed as possible on all these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend should understand that interaction between two 
countries goes both ways.  There is the part of any agreement 
that resides in Canada and there is the other part that resides 
in the other country.  In other words, when investment takes 
place part of that agreement is designed to protect our 
investment in other countries.  It is a complete two way street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend talked about consultation.  I should like to read into 
the record part of a bulletin from the Canadian Conference of the 
Arts in terms of consultation.  It points out that the minister 
has done much to make the process of negotiating trade agreements 
much more transparent to the Canadian people.  He has ushered in 
a new era for negotiations where interested Canadians can inform 
themselves and participate in the shaping of ideas and positions 
Canada takes to the negotiating table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words this process was initiated by my minister.  It is 
well under way.  The people of Canada are now able through 
mechanisms we have established to make their views known.

House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, the House
