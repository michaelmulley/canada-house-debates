	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
recently been informed that Environment Canada has decided to 
move the Saint John weather office to Fredericton, New 
Brunswick.
<P>
	I believe this change will have a wide-reaching negative 
impact on the city of Saint John. Because of the government's 
decision the Saint John city works department supervisors who 
plan snow removal for the next day will have to base their 
decision on a forecast from Fredericton which is 60 miles inland 
or else rely on the local forecast that may be five hours old.
<P>
	Having up to the minute forecasts is critical to the Saint John 
works department, schools, the airport and our port. Saint John 
has a reputation for having its own unique weather. For example 
fog which can occur without warning and certainly is 
undetectable from Fredericton, New Brunswick.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Environment for safety's sake to 
reconsider this decision and return full meteorological service 
to Saint John, New Brunswick.

	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday in this House we remembered the fifth 
anniversary of the tragic death of 14 young women at l'École 
polytechnique in Montreal. We strongly emphasized the need to 
end violence against women.
<P>
	All violence is an assault on the sanctity of human life and the 
thief of personal dignity. Whether this violence occurs in the 
home or on the street, whether it is directed at men, women or 
children, it abuses the soul and violates the body.
<P>
	Human beings have the potential for immense noble acts 
while at the same time we can be immensely cruel. By a single 
word we can make our neighbour feel like a king or a pauper. By 
a single act we can create life or destroy it.
<P>
	I call upon all members of this honourable House to enhance 
their efforts to end not only violence against women but 
violence against all people.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last Saturday, the Mouvement national des Québécois 
et Québécoises presented one of Quebec's most noted authors, 
Michel Tremblay, with the 1994 Silver Medal.
<P>
	A prolific writer, Michel Tremblay is one of a short list of 
Quebec playwrights whose works are played on all five 
continents.
<P>
	Approximately 100 artists from Quebec paid tribute to the 
recipient in a skilful production directed by André 
Montmorency.
<P>
	At the end of this magnificent evening, Mr. Tremblay 
impulsively, and with characteristic generosity, dedicated his 
award to our leader, Mr. Bouchard.
<P>
	Louise Laurin, the president of the movement, said that the 
tribute being paid to Michel Tremblay that evening was in 
recognition of the generous contribution of the author to the 
development and dissemination of our culture. Thank you, 
Michel Tremblay.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the defence review has acknowledged that Parliament needs to 
have criteria in place for peacekeeping missions, criteria like 
when should a mission be undertaken, what are the goals for our 
peacekeepers and more important, when should Canada 
withdraw.
<P>
	The lack of criteria has resulted in the distressing capture of 
55 courageous Canadian peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia. 
The government dithers on while the UN mission becomes the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8744"> 8744 </A></B>
<P>
laughing-stock of the world and our soldiers are held hostage by 
armed forces intent on finishing their war and not contributing 
to peace.
<P>
	Today I will introduce a private member's bill called the 
peacekeeping bill. It would require the government to pass a 
resolution in this House before a peacekeeping mission starts. 
The resolution would lay out the goals, duration and maximum 
cost of the mission. Once the resolution expired, troops would 
be withdrawn or a new resolution passed to continue the 
mission.
<P>
	A peacekeeping bill would allow Parliament to ask the hard 
questions before peacekeeping missions begin and help to 
secure the lives of our peacekeepers.

	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today is the 50th anniversary of the International Civil 
Aviation Organization, ICAO.
<P>
	As the only United Nations agency with headquarters in 
Canada, it covers the bilateral international accords governing 
landing and access rights and passage through air space, control 
of aerial piracy, illegal diversion of aircraft. It also covers issues 
of hostile military action against civil passenger aircraft as with 
the Korean Airlines incident of 1983 and the Iranian airbus 
incident of 1987.
<P>
	As a former director of the McGill University Institute and 
Centre of Air and Space Law, I salute ICAO and its mandate for 
the freedom of the air and politically secure and economically 
viable international air transportation.

	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I recently spent 
two days at the international border crossing at Fort Erie in my 
riding. I observed the operation of our hardworking customs and 
immigration officers and discussed various issues with them.
<P>
	After spending some time observing the procedures on the 
primary inspection line during the evening shift I became 
concerned about the lack of sobriety of motor vehicle drivers 
returning to Canada from the United States.
<P>
	The public fully expects that our Canadian roads are to be 
protected from drunk drivers and are of the opinion that our 
customs officers have the right to detain such individuals. The 
reality is that our customs officers have no such authority. The 
inability of our border personnel to lawfully detain suspected 
intoxicated drivers or demand that they submit to a breathalyser 
test is unsatisfactory.
<P>
<B>(1405) </B>
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Justice and the Minister of National 
Revenue to reconsider the powers of our customs officers with a 
view to correcting this unacceptable situation.

	<B>Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
recent decision by the Supreme Court of Canada that 
drunkenness is a defence for rape has led to cries from 
Canadians for a change in these laws. These cries have grown 
louder in recent weeks as we have seen a number of cases in 
which individuals have successfully used the drunkenness 
defence to escape conviction for the horrendous crime of sexual 
assault.
<P>
	I have been contacted by a number of my constituents who are 
upset and disillusioned with the Supreme Court of Canada's 
decision. I share their concerns and their outrage.
<P>
	On behalf of my constituents I would like to inform all 
members of this House that the people of Brampton support the 
introduction of new legislation which will ensure that 
individuals who commit a serious crime serve the time, whether 
or not they have consumed alcohol.
<P>
	It is up to every member of this House to ensure that the 
outrage which Canadians feel is promptly translated into new 
legislation.

agency based in Canada and one of its oldest components, is 
celebrating its 50th anniversary today in the presence of the UN 
Secretary-General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
<P>
	Based in Montreal, like more than 30 other international 
organizations, including the International Air Transport 
Association and the secretariat for the Montreal Protocol 
Multilateral Fund on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, 
ICAO exemplifies the vitality of Quebec's chief city 
internationally.
<P>
	It is this internationalism that the federal government was 
forced to recognize last winter by allowing the head office of the 
NAFTA environment committee to be based in Montreal. 
Dynamic, cosmopolitan and open to the world, Montreal will 
make a proud chief city in a sovereign Quebec.

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there has 
been much debate about sexual orientation and issues 
concerning the rights and status of gays and lesbians in our 
society. I believe that there are two parts to this issue. The first is 
a matter of discrimination and the legal rights of the individual; 
the second is group rights.
<P>
	I personally support the addition of sexual orientation as a 
prohibited ground of discrimination in the Canadian Human 
Rights Act providing that sexual orientation is defined as 
homosexuality, heterosexuality or bisexuality.
<P>
	Canadians must decide whether or not they want to give same 
sex relationships the same rights and benefits as heterosexual 
relationships. Personally, I do not support granting gay and 
lesbian couples the same status as heterosexual couples with 
regard to marriage, adoption and common law rights.
<P>
	A spouse should continue to be defined as a member of the 
opposite sex and the family defined as those related by blood, 
adoption or marriage.

	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today marks the 19th anniversary of the Indonesian 
invasion of East Timor. Since 1974, over 200,000 people, 
one-third of the population, have died in the genocide. Recent 
reports indicate that the repression continues with acts such as 
shutting down key media outlets, banning trade unions and 
arresting union leaders.
<P>
	At the recent APEC summit, Canada managed to secure a 
number of important contracts but the silence on human rights 
abuses was deafening.
<P>
	The situation in East Timor received international attention 
during the APEC meeting, but with the international spotlight 
gone the Indonesian government can continue to repress the 
people of East Timor.
<P>
	It is imperative that pressure be put on now. Canada should 
end its arms sales to Indonesia and support an international 
embargo. We should put pressure on the Indonesian government 
to release all political prisoners, in particular Xanana Gusmao, 
leader of the independence movement. Canada should support 
independence and self-determination for the people of East 
Timor and show full respect for UN Resolutions 389 and 384.

	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, the Premier of Quebec tabled his so-called draft bill 
on Quebec independence. The object of this exercise is to rush 
Quebecers into an empty debate on what an independent Quebec 
state would look like, without even knowing if they are in favour 
of this ill-advised venture. This bit of trickery amounts to 
putting the cart before the horse.
<P>
	Given the fragile mandate which the Parti Quebecois received 
in the last provincial election, I can easily understand why the 
separatists do not dare ask the only question that counts: Do you 
want to stay in Canada, yes or no?
<P>
	Despite the games being played by the Parti Quebecois, I have 
no doubt that Quebecers will choose to remain and continue to 
grow in Canada.

and friendship.
<P>
	These touching messages come from pupils in grade two at 
École Saint-Paul, Maria, in grade four at École Père-Pacifique, 
Pointe-à-la-Croix, in grade one at École Bourg, Carleton, and 
in grade four at École Bois-Vivant, New-Richmond. Their 
drawings convey messages such as: ``Every child has a right to

Canadians, at a time when we are debating the gun control issue

yesterday, the Quebec Premier unveiled his proposed 
sovereignty plan to Quebecers. The process is characterized by a 
deep respect for the democratic principles in which Quebecers 
firmly believe.
<P>
	The fact that those who patriated the Constitution in 1982 
without Quebec's approval and those who concocted the 
Charlottetown referendum without any mandate from 
Canadians are now criticizing a transparent and legitimate 
process is confirmation that cynicism never killed anyone.
<P>
	In 1990, the Parti Quebecois agreed to participate in the 
Bélanger-Campeau Commission, even though the Liberal 
government had no mandate and the conditions were far from 
equal for all involved. The difference is that the PQ had 
convictions and a vision to propose.
<P>
	Today, the sovereignists are in control. They want to invite all 
Quebecers to participate in the process. The federalist parties 
are free to boycott it. As for us Bloc Quebecois members, we 
will listen to Quebecers and build a country that reflects who we 
are.

There is one shining star that western diversification can

entrepreneur. He saw a unique opportunity created by federal 
government largesse.
<P>
	Williamson wrote the book entitled: <I>Your Guide to 
Government Financial Assistance for Business in Manitoba</I>. 
You guessed it. He writes about finding taxpayers' money for 
your business. If you run a small business and are in 
receivership or default of a loan, don't worry, be happy. Just

	Ten out of eleven candidates running won for the pro-board

side ever elected. It comes at a time when promoters of the open 
market dual marketing system so-called were sowing seeds of 
misinformation on the board and trying their hardest to 
undermine orderly marketing. Some even supported tactics of 
breaking the law. It goes to show that the rhetoric and publicity 
tactics of the anti-board groups are just that, rhetoric but no

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. Yesterday, the 
Premier of Quebec announced his government's approach to the 
referendum and invited Quebecers to a wide-ranging debate on 
their political future. The Deputy Prime Minister called the draft 
bill on Quebec's sovereignty a fraud and an illegitimate, 
undemocratic manoeuvre.
<P>
	How can the Deputy Prime Minister call this draft bill 
illegitimate when it fully respects the provisions of Quebec's 
referendum law, the same one under which referendums were 
held in May 1980 and in October 1992 on the Charlottetown 
Accord?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in our opinion, neither the form nor the content of 
the draft bill presented yesterday complies with Quebec's 
referendum legislation, which requires parity among the parties. 
As Mr. Johnson clearly showed yesterday, Mr. Parizeau's law 
does not provide for regional commissions where the various 
parties are represented equally. As for the substance, once again, 
they talk about the process even before the consequence of the 
process leading to separation has been put to a referendum.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, are we 
to understand that the federal government refuses to participate 
in the process initiated by the Government of Quebec because 
the Prime Minister of Canada and his government have nothing 
to offer but the constitutional status quo, which they know is 
rejected by a very large segment of Quebec's population?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, what we have to offer is a federalist option which is 
clearly supported by most Quebecers.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> It is clear that well over 60 per cent of Quebecers 
oppose separation and it is also clear that if they are given a 
clear, honest question, the great majority of Quebecers will 
support the federalist option.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, you will 
agree that it is harder and harder to define what the federalists 
are proposing, since the Prime Minister talks about a fixed 
status quo and the federalist spokesman in Quebec, Daniel 
Johnson, talks about renewed federalism.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs justify his 
government's refusal to get involved in this debate? Are they so 
afraid of presenting Quebecers with a real debate on the two 
options: sovereignty or their status quo?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, speaking of returning to models from the past, we 
can very well ask the opposition why they talk about economic 
association.
<P>
	That being said, the federalist option is not only closest to 
what Quebecers want but is also the one we intend to defend 
when the referendum will be called. There must be not only a 
separatist option but also a federalist option. The federalism 
which we propose is flexible; it is a federalism that works. In the 
last year, it produced 63 agreements between the federal 
government and the various provinces, including 8 with Quebec. 
What the opposition shows us is that it is not prepared to 
co-operate for the good of Quebec through proper relationships 
between the federal government and the government of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	In response to the draft bill tabled by the Government of 
Quebec yesterday, the Deputy Prime Minister stated, and I 
quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``We do not intend to play that game. We intend to ask the 
people of Quebec a very clear question: Do you want to stay with 
Canada or do you want to separate?''
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	By saying this, she implied that the federal government might 
again conduct its own referendum to ask Quebecers to decide on 
their political future.
<P>
	Could the Deputy Prime Minister tell us whether her 
government still intends to conduct its own referendum on the 
sovereignty of Quebec, thus bypassing the National Assembly?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, what I said yesterday 
and what I am saying again today is that if the Premier of Quebec

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister has therefore not excluded 
that possibility, although the federalist leader in Quebec, Daniel 
Johnson, made it quite clear yesterday that it was up to 
Quebecers and Quebecers alone to answer this question, in a 
process initiated by the National Assembly of Quebec and not by 
the federal government.
<P>
	Nevertheless I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister if 
by excluding any federal participation in the consultation 
process, she means that a federal strategy is already in place and 
will be limited to spending tens of millions of dollars to sing the 
praises of Canada, as was the case in 1980.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Quebec government began to put forward 
in legislative terms its vision of a sovereign Quebec. Canadians 
are now expecting the federal government will be putting 
forward in clearer terms its vision of the federalist option which 
can be used to counter separatist sentiments in Quebec and to 
challenge discontented federalists across the country.
<P>
	Can the Deputy Prime Minister share briefly with the House 
the essence of the federalist option with which the government 
proposes to counter the narrow separatist vision?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister 
and the Government of Canada will pursue the option that we 
have pursued for the past year and that is challenging the status 
quo, being prepared to move on areas like social policy reforms 
in areas that are desperately needed; being prepared to move to 
get our financial house in order so that we meet our 3 per cent of 
GDP objective.
<P>
	We propose to convince Quebecers that Canada is a pretty 
good place by providing good government.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the government is not prepared to be visionary at 
least it must have given some thought to the principles that 
would guide its reactions to separatist initiatives.
<P>
	For example, the charter says that Canada is founded upon the 
principle that recognizes the supremacy of law. If that principle 
is to guide federal government reactions then at least it should 
be willing to put forward an opinion on the legality or illegality 
of separatist initiatives.
<P>
	Can the Deputy Prime Minister at least tell the House as a bare 
minimum what principles will guide federal reactions to 
separatist initiatives?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the guiding principle 
of the Government of Canada is that we have an obligation to all 
the people of Canada to keep this country together and we are 
going to fight very hard to ensure that every Canadian shares in 
the wealth and the greatness of the greatest nation on earth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the inadequacy of the Deputy Prime Minister's 
response simply illustrates our concerns. It would appear that 
the federal government after having had a year to think hard on 
this issue is making up its responses as it goes along.
<P>
	Do these half baked political answers actually represent the 
best thinking of the national government on the most profound 
challenge that a federal administration can face?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is the intention of 
the Government of Canada to support the objectives of this great 
nation at every turn. It is the objective of the Government of 
Canada to encourage all opposition parties that believe in 
Canada to work with us in building this great nation. Do not 
work with the opposition, whose sole objective is to destroy it.

explicit on the point that if the United Nations forces were to 
leave Bosnia and Croatia in light of the conditions of the last few 
weeks this would cause a great deterioration of the situation and 
we believe the bloodshed would be considerable.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

then hoped that the combatants would get down to meaningful

<P>
	We continue to remain extremely concerned about the plight

those people detained, including the Canadians. We hope they

	The reasoning the hon. member is using is not shared by the

the return of the Canadians who are being detained.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the complete 
failure of the CSCE summit in Budapest and the failure of the

<P>
	We are doing our job. We met with more than 40 groups, as 
well as representatives of the various provincial governments. 
We are preparing both a short-term and a long-term plan that 
will consider not only the technologies themselves but also 
sexual and reproductive health, because it is a matter not only of 
technology but also of prevention of infertility. We must do all 
we can to prevent potential problems.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, does the Minister of Health seriously believe that 
the reasons she has just listed are sufficient to justify her 
department's delay in producing the report that the Minister of 
Justice needs to take action in this very urgent matter?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is passing strange that members of the Bloc 
Quebecois will on the one hand say: ``We want a separate 
country; we want to do everything by ourselves'', and on the 
other hand when it suits them will say: ``We want you to impose 
your will on the provinces''. If they want us to impose our will 
on the provinces in relation to new reproductive technologies,  
we will be glad to, but that is not the way the government 
normally operates.
<P>
	We work with the provinces and the stakeholders. We have 
done a considerable amount of work and we will continue to do 
that work to address these very complex issues.

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley,

about the escape of Ian John Hutton from a halfway house in 
Vaughan, Ontario. It was apparent that the minister had not been 
informed of Hutton's unlawful absence.
<P>
	Could the Solicitor General explain why a murderer, who is 
classified on CPIC as being violent and an escape risk, could be 
unlawfully at large for four days without the minister or the

<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House

responsibility to have this person returned to custody.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> I have a supplementary question, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	When I asked the minister on Friday why a murderer who was 
classified as being violent and an escape risk was serving his 
sentence at a halfway house, the minister replied that it was a 
serious matter.
<P>
	Given the fact that the seriousness of the matter has been 
compounded by the non-notification of the escape, is the 
minister prepared to hold a public inquiry into the matter?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is a matter based on a decision made by the parole 
board which operates at arm's length from the minister and from 
the House of Commons.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> I apologize, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Not only have the 
six largest banks made record profits of over $4 billion, but they 
are also holding Canadians for ransom with high interest rates.
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	A study done by his own department points out that the top 
four banks hold 53 per cent of depositor assets. Inflation is at an 
all-time low, yet we are still being stung with a high interest rate 
policy that will stifle our economy and add to our debt.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance direct the finance committee to 
hold a full investigation into bank practices and profits to ensure 
the banks pay their fair share of taxes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is certainly the 
intention of the government that the banks pay their fair share of 
taxes. As the member knows, in addition to the normal corporate 
tax there is an additional large corporation tax imposed upon the 
banks. In addition to that there is a tax on the capital of all 
financial institutions.
<P>
	We are obviously very concerned about the health of the 
economy. There have been extensive committee reports 
involving the banking system. I thought the industry committee 
came up with a very good report this year. The finance 
committee has as well looked at these issues. Unfortunately I am 
not in a position to direct the finance committee, but I obviously 
would be prepared to co-operate with it in any way, shape or 
form.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my supplementary question is for the minister.
<P>
	If the minister will not direct the Standing Committee on 
Finance to investigate and make a recommendation to the House 
of Commons, will the minister give assurances to the House that 
the Department of Finance will ensure that the banks are at least 
paying their fair share of taxes on the huge profits they are 
earning and that they are not gouging consumers with high 
interest rates on loans, mortgages and agricultural and business 
loans.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, again I am sure the 
hon. member knows that according to the rules of the House I 
cannot direct the finance committee. In fact I can tell it very 
little.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member the Department of Finance will 
certainly make sure that the banks live up to proper business 
practices and that the banks pay their fair share of taxes.

<P>
	Although it is 1994 it seems that the Stone Age has returned to 
certain quarters in the House. We have listened to the 
Neanderthal ramblings of the third party on social programs, 
women and violence, and employment equity.
<P>
	Will the President of the Treasury Board please explain 
slowly, so that our friends opposite will understand, why it is 
only fair to apply employment equity to the public service?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, employment equity was established by a Liberal 
government over a decade ago in the public service.
<P>
	It was established because we wanted to ensure that the public 
service reflected the kind of population Canada has today and 
that it would remove unfair barriers to women, to aboriginals, to 
visible minorities and to the disabled from being able to gain 
employment in the public service. We wanted to make sure we 
created a level playing field.
<P>
	For those who are concerned about reverse discrimination, let 
me point out that over half the employees of the public service 
are able-bodied males and half of all hirings in recent years have 
been able-bodied males.
<P>
	The bottom line is that the merit principle is a cornerstone of 
hiring in the public service.

what he calls strategic reasons. And yet this was one of the

Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister have said, this 
government is committed to the introduction of amendments to 
the Human Rights Act to add sexual orientation as grounds on 
which discrimination is prohibited. I think it is not so much a 
question of timing. It is a question of principle and commitment 
and that bill will be introduced in this House.

works together with the provinces.
<P>
	My question is for the justice minister. The legislative 
assembly of Saskatchewan has voted unanimously to oppose any 
further gun controls and he has had a letter to this effect. The 
chief law enforcement officer for the province of Saskatchewan 
is concerned about how he will be able to enforce gun control 
laws which the majority of voters in the province know are 
unfair and unnecessary to control violent crime.
<P>
	The minister said he has consulted. He should be aware he has 
a major problem. Has he taken a head count of all of the justice 
ministers in this country to find out which of them support his 
proposals and which do not?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we do not govern by 
head count. We govern by what is right.
<P>
	This government's assessment of what is right was 
demonstrated last week in writing when I tabled our decision

	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a very important question of privilege that 
touches on my ability to represent my riding in this House.
<P>
	Yesterday all hon. members received, I believe from Your 
Honour, a book entitled <I>The Prime Ministers of Canada</I>. It is a 
green book presented by the House of Commons and the 
National Archives of Canada.
<P>
	I was appalled when I opened the book and read on the page 
describing my distinguished predecessor, Sir John A. 
Macdonald, that he represented three constituencies at various 
times: Marquette, Manitoba; Victoria, British Columbia; 
Carleton and Lennox, Ontario.
<P>
	Everybody knows that Sir John A. Macdonald was the 
member for Kingston. He was first elected as the member for 
Kingston in 1844 and he served in the legislature of the United 
Canadas until Confederation. From 1867 until 1891 he was a 
member for Kingston in this House except-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I knew that. I am not sure it is a question of 
privilege but I am sure that he does have a grievance and I 
undertake to have a look at the book and if I can do anything at 
all to change it I will do so.
<P>
	If it is necessary I will get back to the House but I think I 
would like to let that matter sleep. If the hon. member wants to 
see me later in my chambers I will be there.

touches on a ruling made by the Chair in debate during private 
members' hour last night.
<P>
<B>(1505 ) </B>
<P>
	I want to assure you off the top, Mr. Speaker, that I intend no 
disrespect toward you. I seek only explanation and clarification.
<P>
	In debate last night I used the word ``meanspirited''. That 
word was ruled by the Speaker as being unparliamentary. I must 
say that I was surprised but I withdrew the word immediately.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8756"> 8756 </A></B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am looking for guidance and clarification from 
you because I do not find the offending word in Beauchesne's 
and I wonder whether we have wandered unintentionally into 
territory where there is undue restriction on expression in this 
House.
<P>
	I appreciate that the Chair made similar rulings on November 
23 and November 25 past, but my examination of those rulings 
leads me to believe they are based more or less on context. In 
other words, I do not see ``meanspirited''-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member is referring to a ruling that I 
made in this House with regard to the word ``meanspirited''. As 
a general rule I do not take time to explain all of the decisions I 
make. However, I was hoping in ruling out the word 
``meanspirited'' to lower the tone of words being used in 
Parliament.
<P>
	The hon. member is absolutely correct, the word does not 
appear as unparliamentary in any of our books we look at for 
words that are unparliamentary. However, from time to time 
words are added to it. In my judgment on the spirit in which the 
word was used, I thought if it were withdrawn it would make for 
better debate in the House.
<P>
	As for the ruling made by our Deputy Speaker, this was in 
keeping with his responsibilities. The context of the word, the 
context in which it is used many times and the tone of the word 
sometimes make that decision for us.
<P>
	With respect to my hon. colleague, I would prefer that the 
word ``meanspirited'' not be used in our vocabulary as we go 
back and forth. It is not my intention in any way to restrict 
debate in this House. I would hope that all members would give 
enough latitude to the Chair to see to it that at least in debate 
with one another we would use words where possible that are 
less offensive.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member and I would hope that he would 
respect the decision we had made earlier with regard to this 
word.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to rise on the same point of order to reiterate 
what my friend has said. The words that Your Honour just 
used-I say this with the greatest respect-are clearly indicative 
of what Your Honour meant when you ruled this out of order in 
Question Period on November 23. Question Period is a different 
time when there is no opportunity for discussion. However, on 
two occasions since then the Deputy Speaker has chosen to state 
that this word is out of order because of the ruling on November 
23.
<P>
	While the word may be one that in certain circumstances 
could cause disorder in the House and may therefore not be 
permitted, it is one that has been used in this House for a long 
time. I do not understand why it is automatically out of order 
now whenever it is used.
<P>
	I think the point the hon. member was seeking to make is 
while it may have been out of order in Question Period on 
November 23 and Your Honour has given a reason why that was 
so and that is accepted, to say the word is therefore 
unparliamentary on all other occasions is taking a word which is 
not a particularly nasty one when compared with the others in 
Beauchesne's which I could read at length that have been ruled 
to be unparliamentary-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. We are going on here. I am going to 
permit an intervention by the member for the Reform Party and 
then I would like to go from there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I was present in the House when this incident 
occurred. I point out that the term ``meanspirited'' does indicate 
some motivation. I can also assure you that there was some 
irrational emotion by the member who used the term. I support 
the Speaker in his determination.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. The decision has been made. The 
Speaker who made the decision was acting within his 
responsibilities. In view of what has gone on with that, I would 
let that decision stand and I would like this matter to be closed 
now.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFINDUSTRYACT">DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRY ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-46, an act to establish the Department of Industry and to 
amend and repeal certain other acts, be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Berger (Saint-Henri-Westmount, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am glad to have the attention of the minister 
while I speak and I thank him for being here. I am also happy to 
see that the spokespersons are here for the opposition parties.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am pleased to participate in the debate at third reading of the 
bill to establish the Department of Industry. Those who have 
followed the debate know that this bill concerns the organization 
of the Department of Industry. The minister and the department 
have been given a broad mandate: industry, science and 
technology, consumer and commercial affairs, communications 
and investment. All are brought together under the 
responsibility of a single department and a single minister.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	The bill, as I was saying, concerns the organization of the 
department and the responsibilities it has been given. It is a 
housekeeping bill, if I may use that expression.
<P>
	It is perhaps more important to know what the department will 
be doing. What is the minister's vision with respect to economic 
development? He made an important statement earlier this week 
that answers this question and gives us an idea of where he is 
headed. In his statement, he says that the government does not 
accept that Canadians must choose between high unemployment 
and stagnation of their incomes. Nor does Canada want to accept 
the American approach of low unemployment and a large 
number of low-paying jobs. But neither do we want to adopt the 
European approach, which is characterized by a relatively low 
number of low-paying jobs and a rate of unemployment that is 
chronically very high. The government believes that we can 
move forward on both fronts, employment and income, at the 
same time. In other words, the government would like to create 
good jobs that pay well. This is an objective to which all 
Canadians would give their approval. But you will agree that it 
is not so easy to put into practice.
<P>
	In his statement, the minister observed that although Canada 
is a large trading nation, it has not yet acquired a large trading 
mentality, particular with respect to small and medium size 
business.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8762"> 8762 </A></B>
<P>
	The report of the Special Joint Committee reviewing 
Canada's Foreign Policy, which was also tabled in the House a 
few weeks ago, is even blunter. It reads: ``Canada is a trading 
nation but has not yet proved itself to be a nation of traders''.
<P>
	We are reminded in this report that only one in ten Canadian 
manufacturing companies exports and that automotive, natural 
and energy resources trade account for three quarters of our total 
exports. The picture is brighter for trade in services and 
high-tech products, but 25 per cent of total trade in these 
industries is done within three companies. Furthermore, exports 
to the rest of the world, outside North America, account for less 
than 10 per cent of our exports.
<P>
	In short, the natural resource industry is doing well. It has its 
ups and downs, but for the time being, it is doing well. The 
current price of resources on the world markets is high. The 
automotive and automotive products industry is also faring 
well, in southwestern Ontario in particular, but in 
Sainte-Thérèse, Quebec, as well. While high technology is 
somewhat successful, we have a substantial trade deficit in that 
area. This means that we import far more high-tech products 
than we export.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	To sum up, we have not managed to put in place the fully 
developed structure of an industrial economy. As everyone 
knows, the wealth of Canada comes mostly from its natural 
resources. So, if we want to get somewhere, we need to know 
where we stand so as to determine where we need to go from 
here.
<P>
	I think that we will also have to take a realistic view of the role 
of small and medium size businesses in the Canadian economy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	While it is true that many jobs have been created by small and 
medium size businesses over the last 10 years, they are not the 
be all and end all of our economy. Many small and medium size 
businesses exist because of the existence of large companies. 
They are suppliers to these large companies.
<P>
	Second, as I have already noted, few Canadian small and 
medium size businesses are exporters. Small and medium size 
businesses contribute only 9 per cent of total exports and less 
than 8 per cent of manufacturing exports.
<P>
	Third, the contribution of small and medium size businesses 
to manufacturing in Canada is anaemic. In 1990 manufacturing 
firms with less than 100 employees were responsible for only 32 
per cent of manufacturing employment.
<P>
	In Japan I understand that small and medium size businesses 
account for 75 per cent of manufacturing employment. That is 
quite a difference, 32 per cent in Canada of manufacturing 
employment accounted for by small and medium size businesses 
versus 75 per cent, over twice the proportion in Japan.
<P>
	In the report that the industry committee tabled several weeks 
ago on financing small and medium size businesses, we referred 
to the role of such businesses in today's economy. We referred to 
the significance of these businesses. We remarked that 
globalization requires a rapid response capability in design, 
production, marketing and other activities. We added that 
flexibility, innovation and technological capability are critical. 
This applies to all firms regardless of their research intensity or 
the nature of their product. It applies just as well to firms in the 
traditional sectors of our economy.
<P>
	As a result, finely subdivided, highly specialized linear 
production processes are no longer advantageous and the large, 
traditionally structured firms do not achieve the best results. We 
noted that small, knowledge intensive firms are moving into the 
vacuum.
<P>
	However, we noted that in Canada we have few new 
competitors. New competitors are the firms which are 
characterized by managerial and technological capability, by 
flexibility in their production processes, by the emphasis that 
they place on developing and nurturing their human resources. 
We need more new competitors if we wish to maintain our high 
standard of living.
<P>
	The industry committee made a number of recommendations 
which relate to such new competitors, to those Canadian firms 
that have set themselves national and international goals. Our 
whole focus on venture capital is the solution only for firms with 
growth potential. Therefore, our focus on venture capital is 
directed to those firms.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	We also made, for example, a recommendation that the 
government establish a limited working capital guarantee for 
small and medium size business exporters, again because of the 
importance of exports to our economy and because of the fact, as 
I mentioned earlier, that so few Canadian businesses and small 
and medium size businesses are exporters.
<P>

<P>
	Recently, two young men came to my riding office and asked 
me to help them find work here in Canada. They are both 
doctoral students in the same field, engineering. One of them 
wants to do research in robotics. They approached me 
independently a few months apart. One came to see me in 
September, perhaps, and the other more recently, in October. By 
coincidence, one of these students is from Saint-Henri and the 
other from Westmount, the two parts that make up my riding. I 
must say that the riding also covers all of downtown Montreal, 
but those are two important parts of my riding.
<P>
	These two young men applied to the Canadian Space Agency, 
but unfortunately opportunities are limited now. They have 
looked all over. They applied for work in the private sector, in 
Quebec and elsewhere in Canada. Unfortunately, they have not 
had the desired success. One of these young men recently 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8763"> 8763 </A></B>
<P>
accepted a job in  Philadelphia and I was told that the other 
might go to Detroit.
<P>
	I was told that many of their engineering classmates from 
Concordia and McGill universities had to go to work in the 
United States.
<P>
	I firmly believe that the Canadian government is on the right 
track by emphasizing employment and growth. However, it is 
regrettable that the Government of Quebec does not have the 
same priorities. Once again, we will waste so much energy 
debating existential questions instead of dealing with the real 
needs of Quebecers.
<P>
	The Canadian government must stay the course. We must 
continue to emphasize the economy and growth with the policies 
which have been announced since the last election, following 
the direction taken by the industry committee and with the same 
priority for growth and jobs that underlies and is in fact the main 
theme of the action plan tabled this week by the Minister of 
Industry.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I take part in this third 
reading debate on Bill C-46. Since my colleague for 
Saint-Henri-Westmount said that Quebec is a province, a 
region that cares more about existential issues than about job 
development, I rise to examine sections of this bill which 
provide precisely for job creation and development.
<P>
	At this third reading stage, I would like to go into the details 
of the regional development concept. I want to base my speech 
on two distinct approaches, which are the key factors of the 
regional development problem in Quebec.
<P>
	The dynamic policies of regional development in Canada are 
based on the concepts of growth and development. Both these 
concepts continually bring the central government in Ottawa 
into conflict with Quebec and its regions: it is the Quebec 
government versus the centralizing Canadian federation.
<P>
	Let us ask ourselves what regional development is really 
about. First of all, let me remind the House that Canada is 
composed of four main regions: the West, Ontario and Quebec, 
in the heart of the country, and the Atlantic Provinces. Each of 
these four regions has its minister responsible for regional 
development. What should be examined is the impact the 
concepts of economic growth and development have.
<P>
	In its 1989 report on social and demographic development, 
the social affairs council describes its approach as follows: 
``Growth is a quantitative measure of the increase in a society's 
wealth.'' That is how the increase in the gross domestic product 
per capita, for example, is presented. ``Development implies a 
kind of growth that does not create inequality and is aimed at 
giving all individuals, wherever they live, the same 
opportunities for fulfilment.'' This is a major difference 
between the two concepts of growth and development.
<P>
	In this perspective, regional development originates in each 
of Quebec's regions and is based on a dynamic of balanced 
economic growth among the regions. The member for 
Saint-Henri-Westmount knows Quebec very well. He knows 
that there are sixteen regions and that regional development 
means a balance among these regions. This notion of 
development versus growth underscores the federal 
government's approach with regard to regional development.
<P>
	Indeed, given how all the federal government's regional 
development policies have evolued over the last 40 years, one 
can say objectively that the federal system has favoured growth 
as measured by economic output over development and the 
structural changes it involves.
<P>
	The economic dimension, that is favouring a particular area or 
industrial region in order to stimulate Canada's gross domestic 
product, is clearly given priority over the structural dimension 
in most of what the federal government does in the regions. This 
approach, this federal involvement in regional development, 
will have an extremely detrimental effect in the long run on the 
development of our regions, in Quebec. That is the point I want 
to make.
<P>
	I would like to start by reviewing a number of Quebec's 
demographic characteristics tied in with the economic problems 
faced by peripheral regions. Let us keep in mind that Quebec's 
share of Canada's population has been eroding steadily, down 
from 30 per cent at the beginning of the century to 25.8 per cent 
in 1986. The problem in Quebec is due mainly to the 
acceleration this trend. It took exactly 70 years from 1901 to 
1971, for its share of the total population to decline two points 
but a mere 15, from 1971 to 1986, to drop two more.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	In the regions, it has dramatic effects and the federal 
government's regional development policies are partly 
responsible. In Quebec, more communities are loosing 
population than growing. In Quebec, more regions are declining 
than growing.
<P>
	Between 1971 and 1986, the number of young people in 
communities with declining populations fell by 43 per cent and 
that of adults by 9.5 per cent, while the number of seniors 
increased by 24 per cent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8764"> 8764 </A></B>
<P>
	Over the same period, in communities with growing 
populations, however, the number of young people remained 
more or less the same, while the adult population of 
childbearing age increased by 49 per cent. This means that when 
they leave their community, young adults take with them their 
reproductive potential, causing a further decrease in the birth 
rate.
<P>
	The communities, mostly in peripheral regions, that 
experienced a substantial decline in population between 1971 
and 1986 are also those with the highest rate of unemployment. 
Basically, a decline in population spells social problems.
<P>
	In April 1994, for example, the rate of unemployment in the 
Gaspé and the Magdalen Islands was 27 per cent; in the Lower 
St. Lawrence region, 17 per cent; in 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, 15 per cent; in the Laurentians, 16 
per cent; in Lanaudière, 16 per cent. An analysis of rural 
depopulation over a 15-year period shows that people are 
moving to major centres of economic growth with significant 
impact on Canada's Gross Domestic Product, which determines 
smaller communities and regional development in Quebec.
<P>
	This is demonstrated by a historical overview of federal 
involvement in Quebec's regional development and the impact 
of these policies on Quebec's dynamics in this area.
<P>
	In the 1960s, despite some valid initiatives, federal efforts as 
a whole lacked a global development strategy and co-ordination 
among the various departments involved. The departments 
operated sector by sector, each pursuing their own goals, 
without co-ordinating their actions regionally and correcting 
regional disparities. In the early 1990s, this attitude became a 
trademark of the federal government's regional development 
efforts in Quebec.
<P>
	The Liberal government's current dismantling of VIA Rail 
networks in the regions shows that this Crown corporation did 
not receive the mandate to promote Quebec's regional 
development. There is only one criterion: profitability and 
economic growth and not regional development and people's 
well-being.
<P>
	Such an attitude to regional development threaten the 
infrastructure of outlying areas, speeds up the depopulation of 
outlying municipalities and aggravates regional 
underdevelopment.
<P>
	Let me give you another example: The disappearance of local 
post offices and of some local CBC TV stations shows the same 
disregard for regional development and the priority given by 
Ottawa to profitability and sectoral economic growth. There is a 
lack of global vision. They are busy saving the furniture while 
the house is burning down.
<P>
	In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the need to co-ordinate the 
federal government's regional development initiatives in 
Quebec led to the creation of the Department of Regional 
Economic Expansion. The department focused its efforts on 
several economic  growth centres, hoping that their 
development would extend to disadvantaged regions.
<P>
	At the same time, the Higgins-Martin-Raynauld report 
commissioned by the department, on which the federal 
government's new regional development policies are based in 
part, concluded that Quebec's economic difficulties lie in the 
weakness of its only growth centre, Montreal.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	The purpose of the study which led to this report was to define 
the main development objectives for the province of Quebec, 
simply from the perspective of territorial development. What 
this report has to say about the approach to development is 
important. It says that growth centres have an attractive force 
that drains human, financial and managerial resources from the 
outlying regions and that this process feeds on itself. The policy 
is to invest in the major centre and bring people, money and 
resources in from the outlying areas. Some kind of 
development! How can you be more centralizing?
<P>
	Further on, the report says that no territory can become a 
development centre unless it was first a satellite-so it must 
have grown-and that being a satellite should have no pejorative 
connotation because it is the only way to strengthen a territory's 
competitiveness. That is the federal approach, philosophy and 
thesis for developing Quebec.
<P>
	Further on, the report says in the same vein that much more 
important today are the innovations related to technological 
progress, concentrated in the relatively large and dynamic cities 
which are the centres of development. As far as this report is 
concerned, and it remains an important document in the 
evolution of federal policies and of the Liberal philosophy of 
regional development, even though the report is old, Quebec's 
economic future will be mainly determined by the competitive 
position of Montreal compared to the economic space 
dominated by Toronto and other regions dominated by big cities 
elsewhere in the world.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the Government of Quebec is just as ignorant 
about some outlying communities and at times even denied their 
existence.
<P>
	Influenced by the liberal line of thought which promotes 
megaprojects and seeks to build momentum for economic 
growth, sometimes by expanding large urban centres, the 
Quebec government decided, in the mid-sixties, to concentrate 
in regional centres the public services provided by various 
institutions, so as to reinforce the natural poles of economic 
attraction. At that time, a Liberal government was in office in 
Ottawa, while another Liberal government was controlling 
Quebec's destiny. The growth of Quebec cities over the last 15 to 
20 years 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8765"> 8765 </A></B>
<P>
would have been stronger without this concentration of public 
services in natural poles of economic attraction.
<P>
	Unlike communities which did not provide such services and 
which experienced a decrease in population, the centres offering 
these services experienced a population increase. So, the 
development of some 16 Quebec regions, that is the structural 
planning of fringe areas, necessarily included the setting up of 
important services, as well as the development of a stable 
economic infrastructure adapted to the need of the community 
for a dynamic economic activity of its own, generated by local 
people instead of being subjected to the remote interests of a 
centralizing pole.
<P>
	Again, the influence of this liberal and centralizing 
federalism is responsible for the delicate situation of most 
remote regions in Quebec, as well as for their demographic and 
socioeconomic underdevelopment.
<P>
	The seventies saw the emergence of general development 
agreements between Canada and Quebec, the second generation 
of ERDAs which, incidentally, will expire a week from today, on 
December 14. However, these agreements all suffer from the 
same deficiency, that is the lack of a development policy based 
on eliminating the structural problems which impede regional 
growth. This problem is an inherent part of the federal regime, 
which helps maintain and even increase regional disparity, and 
which also jeopardizes the evolution and the survival of a whole 
nation.
<P>
	The unilateral patriation of the Constitution in 1982 was, to a 
degree, a form of federal interference in regional development.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	This was undemocratic, since Quebec has yet to endorse the 
Constitutional Act of 1982. It was a show of force against 
Quebec, by the federal Liberals and their friends from the other 
Canadian provinces, to increase, among other things, the federal 
spending power in Quebec, so as to control its regional 
economic development. In the eighties, Ottawa increased its 
interference in regional development matters, thus showing 
more clearly than ever its enormous potential for developing 
parallel structures and for generating duplication, which costs 
Canadians and Quebecers dearly, and which also accounts for 
their indebtedness.
<P>
	This disastrous federal policy on regional development in 
Quebec continues to apply. The Department of Regional 
Economic Expansion was replaced by the Department of 
Regional Industrial Expansion. They are very good at inventing 
new structures and duplicating what has already been done. 
DRIE was to focus industrial policy on economic growth 
strategies. Unfortunately, and this was to be expected, the 
department was dominated by sectoral concerns, so that 
industrial development got more money than regional 
development.
<P>
	Today, legislation to establish the Department of Industry is 
about to be adopted. We are now on third reading. Bill C-46 
provides that the Department of Industry has the power to 
``initiate, recommend, co-ordinate, direct, promote and 
implement programs and projects in relation to regional 
economic development in Quebec''. In other words, the 
department will go on investing and having an impact on 
regional development in Quebec, but its activities will not be 
part of a comprehensive approach to deal with the structural 
problems of the regions.
<P>
	The federal government should withdraw from regional 
development in Quebec, since it tends to ignore the process for 
the development of regional structures, initiated by Quebec and 
its regions through its regional county municipalities, its 
regional development secretariat and its regional economic 
development councils. As a result, the federal government has a 
negative impact on regional development in Quebec and on the 
general development of Quebec's potential.
<P>
	In Bill C-46, the federal Liberal government has 
irresponsibly ignored Quebec's clear-cut and traditional claim 
to sole jurisdiction over regional development. Furthermore, 
with its total lack of concern about duplication and overlap, the 
federal Liberal Party helps waste public funds, and it has done so 
by creating and putting in place structures that Quebec has 
already had for more than 20 years.
<P>
	The approach taken by the federal Liberal government, with 
its two-fold obsession with developing the industrial centres of 
Quebec's metropolitan areas while ignoring the rest of the 
province, and with spreading the federal centralist gospel right 
and left, without a co-ordinating policy, has not only proved to 
be disastrous for the development of the regions but in many 
cases has been an obstacle to Quebec's attempts to decentralize 
socio-economic responsibilities to the regions.
<P>
	As a distinct society, Quebec has a creative and innovative 
potential for regional development that, in terms of its 
perspective and emphasis on long-term solutions, goes well 
beyond anything the federal government has been able to do in 
the West, Ontario, Quebec or the Maritimes with its regional 
development policies.
<P>
	In response to invasive federal policies and intent on saving 
Quebec society from regional underdevelopment and eventual 
cultural assimilation, since the two go together, in 1979 Quebec 
passed the Act respecting land use planning and development, 
Bill 125, and created regional county municipalities. These 
regional centres were to become a vehicle for involvement at the 
grass roots level.
<P>
	In Quebec, decentralization of decision-making powers, 
together with a planning approach that differed substantially 
from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8766"> 8766 </A></B>
<P>
the federal government's growth  policies, were subsequently 
seen as essential components of a regional policy for the year 
2000.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	At the same time, in an unprecedented spirit of planning and 
development, the Government of Quebec divided its territory 
into 16 administrative regions. These are strategically important 
to Quebec. They are based on geographic, economic, industrial 
and cultural components in which we find the only real actors 
responsible for Quebec's development. And this is something 
that the federal government cannot and does not want to 
understand, because acceptance of the principle of 
decentralization is fundamentally at odds with the federal 
Liberals' idea of centralization that has come straight from 
Trudeau.
<P>
	Regional county municipalities, or RCMs, are groupings of 
municipalities with a combination of economic, cultural and 
social activities reflecting their proximity, and the movement of 
people to the places where they work and live. Administrative 
regions have called upon these RCMs to define development 
thrusts setting forth the whole range of problems being 
experienced by these regions with respect to employment, and 
social, educational and cultural development.
<P>
	These diagnoses were used to develop a strategic plan for each 
RCM. The government in power must listen to and recognize the 
work already accomplished through the expenditure of public 
money, and the investment of resources and skills.
<P>
	Take the example of the Eastern Townships, a region that 
includes seven RCMs. These local bodies analysed and pooled 
their strategic development plans, and then gave priority to the 
major development thrusts and development projects, in line 
with the regional decentralization policy of the Quebec 
government.
<P>
	These priorities, which are determined by the particular 
environment, reveal areas where correction is required, where 
development is indicated. Thus, by promoting the development 
of human resources, training and manpower, research, 
technological development and the linkage of businesses, the 
decisions made locally have an influence on the economic 
development of the whole country.
<P>
	We have to go back to the real make-up of the country, beyond 
the administrative regions, and focus on the sub-regions and the 
local communities, assess successes and failures and rethink 
development. That is what the Parti Quebecois and the Bloc 
Quebecois have being working on in their joint plan for a 
sovereign Quebec. Regional economic development must be 
coupled with a social development policy to provide every 
citizen with an equal opportunity to achieve their full potential 
in a healthy and challenging environment, wherever they live in 
this huge area. A growing majority of Quebec players, we hope, 
will be able to pull along in their wake all of Quebec, and 
Quebec society, through its  regional players, fully supports the 
decentralization proposal put forward by the new Quebec 
government.
<P>
	So, at the third reading stage of Bill C-46, the Bloc 
Quebecois, the Official Opposition, objects to the domination 
exercised by the Department of Industry and the powers 
assigned to the minister, relating to regional development in 
Quebec. We definitely denounce the new powers and duties of 
the Minister of Industry to formulate and implement policies, 
plans and integrated federal approaches in Quebec, as stated in 
Clause 9(<I>a</I>) of the bill.
<P>
	We also denounce the power to lead and co-ordinate the 
activities of the government of Canada in establishing 
co-operative relationships between various agencies of the 
government of Canada and Quebec. The government has the gall 
to have the legislation provide that the minister may deal 
directly with certain bodies in Quebec, going over the head of 
the Quebec government and National Assembly, and going as far 
as identifying municipal bodies, which come under provincial 
jurisdiction. Incredible!
<P>
	This bill shows how stupid and wasteful it is to want to 
interfere like that, further compounding duplication and 
overlap.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Essentially, Bill C-46 reflects the federal government's 
resolve to take over regional development in Quebec and set it in 
a Canadian perspective of economic growth and efforts to bring 
the federal deficit down, a perspective that greatly hinders the 
enfranchisement and development of the people of Quebec.
<P>
	The only option acceptable to us is the structural development 
of our regions through the decentralization program developed 
by the new government of Quebec. It is therefore by leaving the 
current federal system that we will achieve our goal as a society, 
a society destined to really develop structurally, all over its 
territory, and one looking towards the next century and open to 
the world.
<P>
	The Official Opposition's position on this bill is no to the 
federal government and yes to Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Berger (Saint-Henri-Westmount, Lib.):</B> On a 
point of order, Madam Speaker, I wonder if there would be 
unanimous consent to let me ask the member a short question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Berger:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to ask the member 
how he can speak on industry for about 30 minutes without even 
mentioning small and medium size businesses or even 
mentioning the word business.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8767"> 8767 </A></B>
<P>
	His whole speech concerned the administrative structure. 
Does he not recognize that the Government of Quebec is quite 
free to structure itself as it wants, to create regional county 
municipalities, which have already existed for many years under 
the federal system, to set up its own decentralization plan, to 
plan as it wants? The federal government has absolutely nothing 
to do with these internal decisions of a province.
<P>
	Does he not admit either that almost all government subsidies 
were or will be abolished for budgetary reasons and because we 
recognize that these subsidies are ineffective?
<P>
	Once again, I am amazed that his speech dealt only with the 
administrative structure and that he did not even mention 
business; his speech was almost a Marxist treatise. His approach 
contrasts sharply with what the Minister of Industry said here 
earlier this week, when he said that the Canadian government 
recognizes that it is up to the private sector and not the 
government to create jobs. What the government can do, 
however, is to make the climate favorable for job creation by 
business.
<P>
	I think that the member has absolutely no idea that it is 
business which creates jobs and not all the wonderful structures 
which he would like to set up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Madam Speaker, I think 
that the hon. member was more interested in making comments 
than in asking a question.
<P>
	At the beginning of his speech, the hon. member himself said 
that this was a housekeeping bill. This piece of legislation sets 
out the directions given by the minister with regard to the power 
to take action. I referred to the bill, to the powers the minister 
gives himself by addressing regional development directly 
without going through the National Assembly, by allowing 
himself to negotiate and deal directly with Quebec structures, 
including municipalities which come under provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	The basic question in this case is clearly one of jurisdiction; 
the bill determines federal jurisdiction over regional 
development. The hon. member knows full well that according 
to all analyses of the federal government's regional 
development initiatives in Quebec, results are quite negative 
compared to all regional development.
<P>
	When Quebecers talk about business, they mean small 
business. The hon. member knows full well that Quebec's 
strategic plans also include everything that goes with it, all the 
structures needed to finance small business. He knows very well 
that Minister Paillé's latest program is a vigorous 
small-business support program aimed at helping Quebec 
entrepreneurs start their own businesses and create jobs, since 
we know that small businesses do create jobs.
<P>
	Although the hon. member is well aware of that, he tried to 
insinuate that we were all talk and no action-since it took him a 
long time to put his questions, allow me, Madam Speaker, to 
respond to all the matters he raised. In my opinion, he merely 
showed that Quebec's regional development program is 
currently ahead of anything that the Department of Industry may 
suggest in this area.
<P>
	I want to add that when talking about this-as the hon. 
member pointed out-we should try to define the real needs 
instead of raising existential questions. Is the hon. member 
willing to admit that to do so, we must start by asking those 
involved to define their real needs? Regional county 
municipalities, regional development councils and a regional 
development secretariat were put in place to define the real 
problems and needs of the regions, instead of commissioning 
Price Waterhouse to conduct various studies here and there.
<P>
	Local people are defining their own needs. They developed 
strategic plans, and I remind the hon. member that the 
government itself has just produced a series of reports 
evaluating Quebec's regions when Quebec issued such reports 
just last year. This duplication of regional analysis is a waste of 
energy and public funds.
<P>
	Quebec is capable of developing itself.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to participate in the debate. I did not 
reckon to stand to debate this bill. I want to recognize the 
chairman of the Standing Committee on Industry with whom it 
was a pleasure to work during the last number of months. I look 
forward to continued work with him. There are times when we 
need to recognize good work that is being done.
<P>
	We also want to recognize that this bill is probably one of the 
most significant pieces of legislation that has appeared before 
the House.
<P>
	It has been interesting to watch the progress of the bill. I am 
pleased to acknowledge and to recognize that Reform was able 
to achieve certain amendments in committee. This shows there 
is a role for the opposition even though we do not have as much 
influence as we would like to have. However sometimes good 
sense does prevail and even the government side recognizes 
common sense.
<P>
	It has been a pleasure to address the House on several 
occasions on different parts of this bill. To date, I have spoken 
more specifically to its particular aspects. This afternoon, I wish 
to look at certain other aspects. For example, I have spoken in 
the past about the need to curb the power of the minister to 
dispense public funds with impugnity, to intervene in the 
economy and to pick winners and losers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8768"> 8768 </A></B>
<P>
	I have spoken of the need to eliminate regional development 
as an economic tool of not only this minister and his department 
but of the government as a whole. I have spoken of the need to 
curb the powers of centralized economic planning that the bill 
imparts to the minister and to the cabinet. I have spoken about 
the disappointment, and even to this day, the lack of efficiencies 
realized in the amalgamation of the four departments that came 
together last year to form this new industry department.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	I have spoken of the lack of vision that the bill represents 
because in reality it is nothing more than a rubber stamp of Tory 
policy set by Prime Minister Campbell last year.
<P>
	I have spoken about the confusion created by having 
responsibility of aboriginal economic matters in this department 
and not in the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development.
<P>
	I have spoken about the need to provide for interface between 
departments, for example with Heritage Canada and the 
Department of Communications.
<P>
	I have spoken about the confusion over technical and 
spectromanagement and who is really in charge. I have spoken 
about Heritage Canada and neighbouring rights and the 
questions of overlap and jurisdiction.
<P>
	I have spoken about this and more in the time I have had, only 
to scratch the surface. Today we will look at some of the 
fundamentals, the principles and the challenges that are 
involved with this department and the future that it faces.
<P>
	Where are we now? Bill C-46 puts into effect the machinery 
for the new Department of Industry. In my opinion this is the 
most important department in government. Why? Because in 
effect it constitutes the engine that will bring about the 
economic growth and development of our country.
<P>
	By that I mean it is the department that is directly responsible 
for shaping the way businesses, both large and small, function in 
our economy. The department is responsible for science and 
technology. It is responsible for directing research and 
development. It is responsible for shaping a good chunk of the 
regulatory field under which business operates. It is, in 
conjunction with the Department of Finance, responsible for 
establishing the banking environment, both public and private.
<P>
	In short the department influences most of the important 
economic levers in Canada and for that reason I call it the most 
important department in government. It allows Canadians to 
achieve their most fundamental goals, that is the acquisition of 
food, shelter and clothing. It helps to structure the economy so 
that we can work to provide ourselves with these things.
<P>
	Under the new law this department is both powerful and weak. 
It is powerful because the authority granted to the minister 
under the bill allows that minister the opportunity to intervene 
directly in the marketplace through various instruments and 
actually have the power to pick winners and losers.
<P>
	It is powerful because of the financial consequences of some 
of its actions. It is powerful because of its control over small 
business through the various programs that are geared to that 
sector.
<P>
	Yet under the bill the department is also a weak one. For 
example, the department has a very poor record of success when 
it comes to its more famous interventions on behalf of certain 
businesses and sectors, Canada's well known corporate welfare 
recipients such as Bombardier, de Havilland, SNC, MIL Davie, 
and others.
<P>
	The department is weak because it has not been successful in 
achieving its goal of revitalizing regional economies through its 
regional development programs. It is weak because of the 
inefficient path it sets for science and technology investment. It 
is also weak because it has great difficulty resisting the urge to 
micromanage Canada's economy on a sector by sector basis.
<P>
	It is also confusing in the number of responsibilities the 
department carries. May I just give a brief list of what some of 
those are. It is not a complete list.
<P>
	Based on this bill and what is in the main estimates, this 
department is responsible for a variety of quasi and independent 
agencies and tribunals which include the following: the office of 
the federal chief negotiator, internal trade negotiations; the 
office of the chief scientist; the Canadian aboriginal economic 
development program; Canadian Workplace Automation 
Research Centre; the Defence industry productivity program; 
the Canada scholarships program; the Information Highway 
Advisory Council; the National Advisory Board on Science and 
Technology; the Industrial research assistance program; the 
remnants of Investment Canada; the Canadian Network for the 
Advancement of Research Industry and Education, commonly 
known as CANARIE; the Natural Sciences and Engineering 
Research Council; the Federal Office of the Regional 
Development-Quebec, which requires an order in council to 
pass these responsibilities to yet another minister, the Minister 
of Finance; regional development in northern Ontario under 
FEDNOR; the network of centres of excellence, the National 
Research Council; the Social Sciences and Humanities Research 
Council; the Standards Council of Canada; the Canadian Space 
Agency; the Communications Research Centre; Statistics 
Canada; Emergency Preparedness Canada; the Bureau of 
Competition; the Copyright Board of Canada; and more. It is 
pretty clear from this admittedly incomplete list that the 
minister has a wide range of responsibilities which makes it 
difficult for the department to develop and keep a clear focus.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8769"> 8769 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	What is the bottom line? The bottom line is a challenge to 
create a Department of Industry for the end of the nineties and 
into the next century that is efficient; that makes the right 
decisions for the economy when needed; that is administratively 
sound; that is co-ordinated properly and carefully with a 
concerted focus on providing the best service for the least cost 
as its private sector clients are required to do; and most 
important and above all, that is fiscally responsible and uses 
available dollars in a way that produces maximum possible 
return for the taxpayer while exposing that same taxpayer to the 
minimum possible risk.
<P>
	This fiscal emphasis must recognize the fundamental tenet 
that the marketplace is the best equipped to do something and to 
help business operate. The marketplace should be allowed to 
proceed without undue interference from government.
<P>
	In short, the role of government should be to set the 
department in such a position that its mandate is to establish and 
maintain a culture which rewards entrepreneurship, innovation 
and research, and that it ensures a level, competitive and honest 
marketplace. That is the way in which the department should be 
organized.
<P>
	Where do we go from here? In terms of small business we 
should recognize that it is probably the single most important 
sector in the Canadian economy. Why? It is because it creates 
the lion's share of new jobs in the country. We all know that 
when people are working, the country and taxpayers benefit 
most.
<P>
	The government's approach to small business should be based 
on sound fundamental principles. The government's own 
recently published paper by its small business working 
committee stated a set of principles for growing small 
businesses. It said that the government should have the 
following priorities.
<P>
	The government should be removed from the market to let it 
function freely rather than seek to influence or distort it. The 
government should restrict its own activities to fulfilling gaps 
not currently served by the private sector. It should do so on a 
temporary basis until the private sector can take over. It should 
redesign the taxation system as a vehicle for economic 
development rather than its current narrow role as a generator of 
tax revenues. It should focus on helping small businesses access 
the information and intelligence they require. These are four 
very significant foundation setting principles given to the 
government by one of its own committees.
<P>
	I have spoken before in the House about the report of the 
Standing Committee on Industry entitled ``Taking Care of Small 
Business'' in which the government could find much in the way 
of directing its activities to actually influence our economy to 
reach the goals that need to be reached.
<P>
	I focus now on the other sector of business, large business. 
Government can rely on the same principle enunciated just a 
moment ago. I would encourage government to refrain from 
undue interference through grants, contributions, subsidies and 
bail outs of large and small businesses.
<P>
	It may seem harsh to some on the government benches, but if 
the free market decides that a company should fail as a result of 
its own activities then the government has no business 
intervening to save it. It is just that simple.
<P>
	We have too many examples of corporate welfare in Canada 
which highlight how wrong a policy of intervention can be. 
Certain names in the corporate community are synonymous with 
government largesse. For this past taxation year alone, based on 
the public accounts, we are reminded of how extensive the 
problem is. I want to give some examples.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	Bombardier received from the federal government a little 
over $21 million; SNC Lavalin received over $1 million; Boeing 
received $3.7 million; Litton Systems, over $4 million; Pratt &amp; 
Whitney, $36 million; Canadian Marconi, $10,750,000; Apotex 
Pharmaceuticals, $3.3 million; and de Havilland, $81,350,000. 
That is just a short list; the list goes on for pages. It is the tip of 
the iceberg and is only for last year.
<P>
	It is easy to understand why companies would take advantage 
of government largesse. They would be crazy not to do so. If we 
are dumb enough to give it to them, they are smart enough to 
pick it up. The point is that government should not offer it in the 
first place.
<P>
	Big business also must reverse its attitude that government's 
role is to pay to ensure its survival and must stop reinforcing that 
notion. A good product or service, a sound knowledge of the 
marketplace and an efficient business plan will ensure survival 
and jobs on a permanent or long term basis without an 
expenditure or burden on the taxpayer. Let the marketplace 
decide.
<P>
	I focus now on the area of science and technology which 
requires a very significant and comprehensive overhaul. The 
Auditor General cited in his report this year how poorly the 
government had done with respect to spending $7 billion. He 
made several useful recommendations in this area.
<P>
	He said that priorities needed to be established, including 
what is the need, what is the opportunity and what is the 
potential payback. This will require co-operation among all 
stakeholders. Overall performance must be monitored, 
according to the Auditor General, to measure success and 
provide a framework with indicators for that performance. 
When that is established the program can go ahead with some 
success.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8770"> 8770 </A></B>
<P>
	Then he went on to say that our science and technology 
strategy should be appropriate, should be balanced and should 
be workable. He then said that parliamentarians-that is those 
of us in the House of Commons-have no basis under the present 
arrangement on which to assess whether the government's 
expenditures on science and technology reflect Canadian needs 
and opportunities and to hold the government accountable for 
results. Implementing his recommendations as soon as possible 
should therefore be a critical priority for the government.
<P>
	These are some of the items that need to be looked at in terms 
of getting the department to work at the cutting edge of 
economic development in the next century.
<P>
	Some members of the government respect and appreciate 
these approaches. The minister's parliamentary secretary, for 
example, is forward thinking in many ways. He is the leading 
proponent of some very positive changes in Canada's taxation 
system. His flat tax proposals have generated much interest with 
academics and economists alike. Many of my colleagues 
including myself on this side of the House find his ideas 
intriguing and worthy of considerable study with likely 
implementation. We hope he can convince his colleagues that it 
is the proper way to go.
<P>
	In addition, there are two ministers for whom I have a lot of 
respect: the ministers of industry and finance. They both seem to 
have a good grasp of what needs to be done and what the 
direction should be for the future. I believe their personal 
philosophies tell them we cannot continue with business as 
usual. We require some radical shifts in our fundamentals. 
Unfortunately the two ministers appear to be having some 
difficulty with their cabinet colleagues, some of whom are still 
pursuing the thinking of the past that put us into the mess we are 
in today. This is reflected in the strategies released by them.
<P>
	What is the government attempting to do now? I would like 
briefly to look at this point on a couple of fronts. First is the 
orange book that was delivered on Monday morning. The 
minister released the government's new industrial strategy in an 
orange coloured book. The report was praised by the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I> and others for its sound forward thinking principles. 
However many business groups have said that it is short on 
detail. The content seems to be based on the old thinking that we 
know does not work any more.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	An example is the government's proposed increase in the 
ceiling for the loans it guarantees under the Small Businesses 
Loans Act. It is well known that some of the banks are using this 
program to grant loans to businesses that would otherwise 
qualify. That is not the purpose of the act.
<P>
	If the free market were allowed to operate and prevail, as I 
have suggested, there would be no need for such a program. 
Businesses that were sound would be considered a secure risk by 
the banks and receive their  loans. Those that were not would not 
get a loan and would not require the subsidy. This is as it should 
be. The government should not be encouraging the banks to lend 
by assuming most of the risk on the taxpayer's back rather than 
the operation of the market forces.
<P>
	Banks in Canada show a profit of over $4 billion, referring to 
the big chartered banks, for this year. They should be 
accountable for the risks they make and not depend on the 
taxpayer to underwrite their small business loans.
<P>
	Moreover the orange book fails to address the most pressing 
problem identified time and time again by businesses, that is the 
business of overbearing taxes. We are overburdened with taxes 
and that is true of business. The way to address the tax burden 
problem is to reduce spending which in turn will allow us to 
curtail the deficit, begin to deal with the debt and in turn reduce 
onerous tax levels, interest rates and the cost of doing business. 
That creates jobs.
<P>
	If the government really wanted to lay out a comprehensive, 
coherent, industrial strategy for the coming century, it would 
focus its energy on creating a climate for entrepreneurship. It 
would create an environment in which the free market could 
work and would stay out of it to the greatest degree possible.
<P>
	Some positives in the orange book include the government's 
commitment to reduce the paper burden, that is to get businesses 
off the government payroll and back working for themselves as 
they should be. The paper also recommends expanding our 
foreign trade horizons, a natural for building more business.
<P>
	Now I come to the restructuring which was also a positive part 
of that book. The minister has indicated in the House that his 
department faces up to a 50 per cent reduction in its overall 
budget inside of the next two years. I wish him much success in 
his endeavour and will help in whatever way I can.
<P>
	Coming back to the Auditor General, I have a few more words 
about what he said. The government spends $7 billion each year 
on science and technology research, $6 billion directly and $1 
billion in tax credits. The Auditor General concluded that there 
was a lack of overall government-wide leadership, direction and 
focus on results and accountability for implementing desired 
changes. It is gone; it is not there. Then comes his most 
shattering statement. He said that Industry Canada, the 
department, was not well positioned to provide effective 
leadership among departments with science and technology 
responsibilities. That is the Auditor General's conclusion. I fail 
to see in this reorganization how that will be resolved.
<P>
	The science and technology consultations that were 
conducted under the Department of Industry produced nothing 
but the regurgitation of the same problems identified 30 years 
ago. The orange book industrial strategy shifts the money 
around and increases the government's liability in favour of the 
banks. The  reorganization was dreamed up by Kim Campbell 
and others. It 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8771"> 8771 </A></B>
<P>
does nothing to deal with the problems identified by the Auditor 
General.
<P>
	In conclusion, I return to the principles enunciated earlier. We 
know the foundation needs to be an efficient, administratively 
sound and fiscally responsible department that encourages a 
sound environment so that business can build and support itself. 
Our science and technology policy must have an eye to the needs 
and opportunity for potential advancement.
<P>
	I encourage the minister to move ahead with aggression, 
courage and success as he reduces his department, as he makes it 
fiscally responsible, and as he gives it the direction to meet the 
needs of business and the needs in terms of science and research 
so we will become the economic leader in North America that 
we could be. We have tremendous talent in our people. We have 
tremendous resources. This department could marshal the 
resources and bring it together so that all of us benefit. I wish 
him good luck and Godspeed.
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, as the 
assistant to the Official Opposition critic on regional 
development, I am pleased to address Bill C-46.
<P>
	Back on September 26, I had the opportunity to express my 
strong disagreement with this piece of legislation, since it does 
not recognize Quebec's jurisdiction over its regional 
development. That bill was unacceptable in its original form. 
Yet, this House rejected the amendments to clauses 8, 9 and 10 
proposed by the opposition critic on regional development. 
These amendments read as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-46 be amended by replacing, in Clause 8, line 23, in Clause 9, line 
22, and in Clause 10, line 36, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>with the approval of the Lieutenant Governor in Council of Quebec where 
such powers, duties and functions relate to regional development in Quebec-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We simply asked that Quebec have control over its regional 
development. Who, if not Quebec, is in the best position to 
develop policies in that sector? Certainly not the federal 
Minister of Industry, although he could, through this legislation, 
have the authority to set up such policies and exercise control 
over Quebec's regional development.
<P>
	The previous government wanted to streamline federal 
bureaucracy with this bill. The current government admits to 
looking for ways to eliminate duplication and overlap. Is it just 
paying lip service to the idea? It looks like it, since Bill C-46 
would allow the federal government to intervene at will in 
Quebec.
<P>
	This government is ignoring, or pretending to ignore, the 
efficient regional development programs which have been in 
place for a long time in Quebec. Incidentally, the new Quebec 
government has developed a dynamic regional development 
policy which will be implemented by the stakeholders and 
which takes into account the fact that trade liberalization 
eliminates trade barriers and exposes regional economies to stiff 
competition.
<P>
	The Quebec government devised a new sharing of 
responsibility between itself and the regions, including the 
Quebec union of municipalities, as well as the Quebec union of 
regional county municipalities and local municipalities. As we 
have already explained to this House, RCMs will become 
decision-making centres for Quebec's socio-economic 
development. These RCMs will be designated as independent 
and multi-purpose political authorities.
<P>
	Municipal councils will have to rely more on participation. 
Under the authority of the RCM's board, sectoral commissions 
will be delegated various powers, depending on the sector 
concerned. Regional delegates were appointed to provide direct 
liaison between the regions and the Premier.
<P>
	The Quebec government also developed a sectoral 
development policy which puts the emphasis on the agri-food, 
fisheries, forestry, energy, recreation and tourism sectors. But 
what about the federal government? Has it demonstrated an 
ability to develop programs which take into account already 
existing provincial and regional policies? The answer is no, 
Madam Speaker.
<P>
	No, because the federal government has never been able to 
reach a consensus where regional development is concerned. 
No, because the priorities of the Liberal government differ from 
those of the provinces and the regions. Let us decentralize the 
funding and the decision-making authority! Then, the regions 
would be able to develop according to their own priorities.
<P>
	With this bill, the federal government is trying to control the 
economic development of Quebec. The government party is 
digging in its heels and the results are duplication and overlap.
<P>
	People do not seem to understand the situation; either we have 
not been able to explain it to members opposite well enough or 
they are not listening. We all remember the three little monkeys: 
see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. The government is 
following the advice of the first two monkeys too closely; it 
should pay more attention to the third one. Several commissions 
have clearly stated in their reports that the federal government is 
impeding our regional development.
<P>
	In its report, the interdepartmental working group on regional 
development, set up by the Quebec government in 1991, when 
the Liberals were in office, I might add, examined the issue of 
the proliferation of regional development initiatives.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8772"> 8772 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	The working group came to a very clear conclusion: 
confusion, duplication and overlap.
<P>
	Confusion in terms of regional divisions: the federally 
defined regions do not match Quebec's administrative regions. 
Frequent confusion concerning regional officers, since there are 
too many government officers.
<P>
	Duplication of structures: regional advisory bodies, economic 
development organizations, creation of program management 
committees to reconcile all the various types of initiatives.
<P>
	Duplication that leads to operating costs that are high 
compared to the amount of money actually spent on 
development.
<P>
	The Bélanger-Campeau Commission, also established by 
Quebec's former Liberal government, draws conclusions that 
are equally clear. If Quebec assumed responsibility for existing 
federal programs without any reduction in services, there would 
be annual savings of $289 million in spending related to the 
collection of customs duties and taxes, $250 million in 
manpower and $233 million in transportation and 
communication costs.
<P>
	A study indicates that 67 per cent of federal programs overlap 
provincial programs to some extent. This study, conducted by 
Germain Julien and Marcel Proulx, tells us that overlap accounts 
for 65 per cent of government spending, excluding the public 
debt and unemployment insurance. This represents $67.5 billion 
and 45 per cent of personnel or 114,000 full-time employees for 
1991 and 1992.
<P>
	What is the origin of this overlap? Seventy-six per cent is 
attributable to the authority to legislate in shared areas and 24 
per cent to federal spending power in areas under provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	We know all too well the consequences of these overlapping 
programs: increased cost of government action when it would be 
more economical to give one government exclusive 
responsibility for services provided at both levels.
<P>
	Redundancy in programs: irrational use of personnel and 
equipment by both levels for similar activities.
<P>
	The exorbitant cost of co-ordination: officials meet hundreds 
of times a year to check whether they are offering the same 
services, to harmonize program objectives and to ensure they 
are compatible.
<P>
	Reduced effectiveness of government measures: how many 
times have we seen measures that are put in place by two levels 
of government cancel each other out for lack of consensus on 
objectives and priorities. Of course, no one wants to make 
concessions.
<P>
	An additional burden on the target population, which has 
trouble finding its way through the labyrinth of government 
programs, especially when there is duplication.
<P>
	Turf wars that make governments act irresponsibly. And who 
pays for all this? The taxpayer.
<P>
	In spite of these factors, the Liberal government insists on 
passing legislation like Bill C-46 which dismisses out of hand 
Quebec's policies on regional development. The government 
says that it wants to eliminate duplication and overlap and then 
introduces a bill in which it maintains its hold on regional 
development.
<P>
	Unlike Quebec, the federal government does not consult but 
implements policies from coast to coast. Consider the changes 
made within the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec. The new focus targets four areas: 
exports, new technologies, entrepreneurship and catalyst 
projects. According to the government, that is what the directors 
of SMEs want.
<P>
	However, every region has to identify its own priorities. In 
our region for instance, these include tourism and culture. It will 
not be easy to get approval for these projects, since proposals for 
a cultural centre in my own riding have just been turned down. 
The federal government refuses to consider the specific needs of 
each region. We have developed instruments, including the 
CRD, the Conseil régional de développement, to promote 
regional priorities. The government could have consulted to 
harmonize its actions.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	All this duplication and overlap is very costly. Why should we 
believe today that the Department of Industry will be able to 
reduce waste? When reading Bill C-46, I see, like everybody 
else in this chamber, that it maintains the status quo-an 
expression dear to the Prime Minister-between the mandates 
and the grouped departments.
<P>
	Quebec's demand for exclusive jurisdiction over regional 
development is nothing new. Since the Quiet Revolution, it has 
been constantly restated. These are not whims, contrary to what 
the Prime Minister said. Since then, Quebec has had 
governments of every political stripe, but its demands have 
remained the same. Federal interference is still ubiquitous, and 
the regions are no better off as a result.
<P>
	Let us recall why the Department of Regional Industrial 
Expansion disappeared in 1987: the regions were not involved in 
the funding request development and review process. The 
money that could have been used to fund excellent projects was 
instead given to useless ones. Industrial development was 
favoured at the expense of regional development. Since then, we 
have been living the same nightmare. If the federal government 
believes its general agreements have improved the situation, it 
is quite wrong. There may be no complaint from western Canada 
and the Maritimes which received $630 million and $1.2 billion 
respectively, whereas Quebec received $165 million. Is this 
fair? Regions can and must do more than simply supply 
domestic and foreign markets with raw materials.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8773"> 8773 </A></B>
<P>
	It is the processing industries which create jobs and develop 
local resources. If we do not look after them, regions become 
more and more dependent. The federal government refuses to 
acknowledge that its approach to regional development are 
wrong. Yet, studies clearly show that the economic base is 
eroding, the social fabric is unravelling, the depopulation of 
rural areas is continuing, and young people are moving out of 
the regions.
<P>
	All Ottawa is doing is regionalizing its operations by setting 
up regional structures. It might increase visibility, but it 
certainly does not improve efficiency. As we already said, 
federal interference causes duplication and inconsistency. The 
result is an administrative mess which slows down economic 
development in the regions and makes them the big losers.
<P>
	The federal government's scope is so broad that it cannot 
correctly target the particular needs of a given region. As far as 
we can tell, FORD-Q is not free to make its action fit any total 
vision of local development.
<P>
	It would be so simple for the government to promise to accept 
the priorities set by the regions, in order to maximize the impact 
of measures initiated by regional leaders in Quebec. Going 
along with the priorities set by the regions is one thing, having a 
third party role in the financing of regional development 
projects is another.
<P>
	On this point, the rise in administrative costs and the 
squabbles with the provinces should convince the federal 
government that duplication between the two levels of 
government is damaging. This is why we insist so much on the 
need to decentralize budgets and decision-making. The future 
of the regions lies in the decentralization of power towards 
regional decision centres.
<P>
	The government is not proposing anything to redress the 
imbalance in funding. While federal regional development 
funding has increased 50 per cent in Quebec since 1983, it 
jumped 300 per cent in the West and 250 per cent in the 
Maritimes.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	Based on figures from the Federal Office for Regional 
Development-Quebec itself, the federal input in regional 
development is inequitable. Quebec's per capita share is $230, 
compared to $240 in Western Canada and $920 in Atlantic 
Canada.
<P>
	Master agreements were mentioned earlier. The per capita 
results are catastrophic for Quebec in that regard as well, with 
$64 spent in Quebec in 1987, compared to $431 in Atlantic 
Canada and $259 in Western Canada.
<P>
	The government could restore equity by cutting expenditures, 
as the Auditor General said, by eliminating tax breaks such as 
family trusts and the waste from duplication and overlap caused 
mostly by infringing on provincial jurisdictions, as mentioned 
earlier.
<P>
	What would these billions of dollars be used for, Madam 
Speaker? This money could be used to restore equity in the 
amounts received by Quebec from the federal government for 
regional development. Quebec does not want its regional 
development to be built only on an industrial vision dictated by 
the Department of Industry in Ottawa.
<P>
	Quebec has had its fill of inconsistent federal initiatives and 
policies. Why is it that the Quebec government has realized that 
the regional stakeholders are the only ones who grasp the real 
needs of their respective regions and the people across the way 
have not?
<P>
	This bill is far from putting to rest the concerns that regional 
development organizations and all stakeholders have. The 
government must change course. We want Quebec to have 
exclusive control over the development of its regions.
<P>
	We want to repatriate, in the form of tax points, the budget 
allocated to local development. We want decision-making and 
spending powers to be decentralized to the regions. This is a 
must for the economic development of Quebec. It is also a major 
component of our people's plans for sovereignty.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It is my duty, pursuant 
to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to 
be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for London-Middlesex-Refugees; the hon. 
member for Mackenzie-Canadian Wheat Board; the hon. 
member for Berthier-Montcalm-Bovine somatotropin.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais (Madawaska-Victoria, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened with great interest to the 
speech delivered by the Bloc member for Lotbinière, which was 
full of statistics-my congratulations to your researchers.
<P>
	I find it very hard to understand logically how one can make 
such a wide-ranging speech in the House while demonstrating to 
this House that there is a lack of logic in Quebec on the subject 
of duplication.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8774"> 8774 </A></B>
<P>
	The regional county municipalities that were created in 
Quebec in the last decade add another level of government, thus 
increasing administration and other costs and generating 
inefficiency. They then tell us that duplication must be reduced.
<P>
	On the other hand, I agree that in the last nine years, the hon. 
member may have felt that the previous government did not look 
favourably on Quebec's demands.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	Naturally, since our government's first year in power, we put 
in place a process to eliminate duplication. We said that before 
asking, or requiring each province to put its house in order, the 
federal government would start by putting its own house in 
order, thus eliminating duplication in all the various 
departments. The process is well under way. Public 
consultations on industry, finance and social programs were 
held at all levels before we started putting our house in order.
<P>
	I also find it a pity that the member for Lotbinière does not 
admit that maybe Quebec should eliminate duplication among 
levels of government which may not meet the needs of small 
communities. We know that normally, the larger communities in 
a group or collection steer the ship.
<P>
	The member also raised a very interesting point, that the 
federal government should withdraw from provincial 
jurisdiction, and he mentioned forestry, for example. Today, 
there is a very interesting article in which the president of the 
Quebec farmers' union, the UPA, demands that the federal 
government not withdraw from programs that subsidize 
agriculture in Quebec.
<P>
	So are people talking to each other in Quebec? Are you 
members from Quebec listening to what your constituents are 
asking for, like continued federal participation in programs?
<P>
	Considering the various federal programs which assist 
development in Quebec, I think that the member's speech should 
seriously be revised because it is quite illogical.
<P>
	Something else you mentioned-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> Ask the question.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais:</B> You will have your question. You 
had your speech, so I will ask my question.
<P>
	He said that processing industries are a priority for the 
regions. I agree, but if the primary industry for developing 
natural resources in these regions is not a priority in the first 
place, how can you develop a manufacturing industry in that 
field?
<P>
	So the question is this: How can the member, in concluding 
his speech, ask for a transfer of tax points, when yesterday he 
wanted to withdraw completely from this beautiful country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> Madam Speaker, how much time do I have left 
to answer? I would like to know before answering-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> You have five minutes 
left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> Thank you.
<P>
	I am very pleased to give an answer to the hon. member. First, 
I want to thank her for confirming that my figures are accurate. I 
might add that she could not have said that they were not. In any 
case, I am very pleased because it confirms that we are telling 
the truth.
<P>
	I could mention other examples, other incidents which have 
occurred in the context of the federal government versus Quebec 
or the United States. I agree that we have a free trade 
arrangement, but still. Earlier, I referred to the Federal Office of 
Regional Development. Where did it invest in industry? It 
invested many hundreds of thousands of dollars. Some people 
asked me not to raise this issue. The office invested hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in a given Quebec industry, yet the federal 
government simply turns around and, for a comparable or 
similar price, buys in the United States.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	I can tell you about this issue because I was involved in it. I 
said: Wait a minute; did this industry have an opportunity to bid? 
We are talking about a Quebec industry from my region, in 
which the federal government invested-listen to 
this-hundreds of thousands of dollars for research and 
development. If the federal government does not buy in Quebec 
but buys elsewhere in Canada, I say fine.
<P>
	These are examples of duplication and mismanagement. I am 
telling you about what I know to be true, about what is really 
going on. The figures I mentioned are the actual figures.
<P>
	I want to say something further about the industrial situation. 
In my riding, we have what is called BDCs, business 
development centres, which can also be found, I am sure, in 
other ridings as well. With $5,000, I can create a job. And if 
some people can deny this, I will listen to what they have to say, 
but I know that with $5,000, I can create one job. At the federal 
level, the infrastructure program needs $100,000 to create just 
one job. Did you hear that? With $5,000, I can create one job, but 
the federal government needs $100,000 in its infrastructure 
program to create just one job. This is quite a difference. In fact, 
it is a $95,000 difference to create just one job, since we go from 
$5,000 to $100,000. I thought I would just mention these 
figures.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, you are indicating that I have two minutes 
left. I will take what time I have left to stress how important Bill 
C-46 is.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	I do not want people to think that I criticize all the time. That 
is not my role. My role is to make suggestions, to ensure that 
there is some openness, but you, on the other side of the House, 
also need to show that you are open-minded. That is how we will 
be able to harmonize some of the various programs and 
initiatives.
<P>
	The hon. member said earlier that I was very good at quoting 
statistics and that she could not deny these figures. I know she 
cannot deny them, I am not crazy!
<P>
	Do you understand what we want? The hon. member 
recognized earlier that for the last nine years the situation has 
not been fair. I said so myself earlier. I always come back to the 
same example: it is important for a father with three or four 
children to treat them all equally. By treating his children fairly 
and equally, he avoids creating any type of quarrel.
<P>
	I used some figures earlier. I understand what Quebec wants. I 
have seen other industries in Western Canada receiving millions 
of dollars in subsidies to gain access to Quebec's market, while 
Quebec's own industries were not receiving one penny for 
exactly the same products.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, on the issue of fairness, let me give some 
advice: Render unto God what is God's and unto Caesar what is 
Caesar's, and everybody will be happy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
my honour to rise in this House today and speak to the third 
reading of Bill C-46, an act to establish the Department of 
Industry.
<P>
	Given that this act gives the Minister of Industry powers 
relating to trade and commerce in Canada, consumer affairs, 
competition, and restraint of trade, it seems only appropriate to 
discuss a very major impediment to growth in the economy, the 
interprovincial trade barriers. This act gives jurisdiction to the 
industry minister to deal with the very serious situation that 
exists in trade between our provinces.
<P>
	When Canada was created out of four British colonies in 
1867, the founding Fathers of Confederation had one purpose in 
mind. They believed that if they united they could resist being 
pulled into the American sphere of influence and would retain 
their distinct cultural heritage.
<P>
	There were two strategies to implement this which they saw as 
essential to resisting American pressures. The first was a unified 
military which could better defend the borders of Canada and 
which did so. The second was free trade between the provinces. 
It was believed that the free flow of goods and services would 
strengthen economic, political and cultural ties east to west 
instead of north to south. It is quite obvious in which strategy we 
failed to accomplish our objectives.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	The fact is that trade in many goods between Canada and the 
U.S. today is freer and easier than the trade between provinces. 
For generations we have allowed the inefficiencies of small, 
protected regional markets in many goods and services to 
constrict the economy, hurt our political and cultural objectives 
and cost us jobs.
<P>
	The United States is a good example of a country where wide 
open commerce between jurisdictions, negotiated and enforced 
by a national government has led to greater prosperity for the 
whole nation.
<P>
	We are a trading nation and we have spent great energy 
concentrating on our external trading relationships which 
account for 25 per cent of our economy. The Americans count on 
exports for about 8 per cent of their economy yet they are a more 
prosperous nation. There is certainly a lesson for Canada in this. 
We must become much more focused on reducing barriers when 
it comes to domestic trade.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry and the Prime Minister recently sat 
down with provincial counterparts to discuss eliminating some 
barriers. Unfortunately very little was agreed to and the status 
quo of small, inefficient and protected industries continues to 
reign.
<P>
	A renewed effort is needed and if some parties are resistant to 
the movement the federal government should consider using 
some of its powers to force agreements into place. As the Prime 
Minister stated during the first ministers conference, thousands 
of new jobs will be created and this will benefit all Canadians 
regardless of region.
<P>
	There is over $146 billion worth of trade happening between 
the provinces. There are also over 300 barriers to interprovincial 
trade in Canada and each one costs jobs, money, growth, and 
competitiveness. This has hurt the province of Ontario and 
indeed all Canadians directly. These barriers are a problem that 
can be solved. Even small improvements in reducing barriers 
can mean big gains for the country. It is time for us to get serious 
about dealing with them.
<P>
	I am going to examine a few examples of barriers that exist to 
internal trade in Canada and the effect they have on Ontario and 
the country as a whole. The first barrier that comes to mind is 
one that has a large effect on employment in my riding.
<P>
	There is a modern brewery in Simcoe Centre that employs 
hundreds of Canadians. Over the years this brewery could have 
employed more people, expanded its operations and become 
efficient enough to compete with major American brewers. This 
did not happen because its market has been restricted by trade 
walls enforced by provinces in an attempt to protect their local 
brewers. The protectionism that insulated and sustained these 
inefficient brewers for so long could now be the death of many 
of them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8776"> 8776 </A></B>
<P>
	International trade pressures are forcing small breweries out 
of business. Brewing is a $9.6 billion retail industry in Canada 
so even small reductions in production costs due to greater 
economies of scale will produce better prices for consumers in a 
much more competitive economy.
<P>
	American brewers are gaining more and more access to our 
domestic beer market through the GATT, NAFTA and the free 
trade agreement. They will force out those who cannot compete. 
For example, a single brewery in Colorado Springs, Colorado 
produces all the beer under a particular label for the entire 
United States, a market of some 250 million people. How can we 
expect breweries that produce only enough product for a few 
million consumers to compete? It is extremely difficult to 
compete with that economy of scale.
<P>
	Another barrier that may be less obvious to my constituents 
but affects them directly is the variation in provincial trucking 
regulations. Since each province has different size, weight, and 
licensing requirements there is a lowest common denominator 
that takes effect in interprovincial trucking. Truckers take a load 
that is the smaller and lighter of the two provinces' requirements 
and therefore a more expensive load. This ultimately hurts 
consumers who will have to pay more for the same products.
<P>
	I believe that all Canadians wish to see this type of waste done 
away with and receive the most efficient and economic value 
possible for their hard-earned wages.
<P>
	A barrier of major importance that must be dealt with quickly 
is the barrier each province erects when conducting its own 
government procurement. The provinces have a long history of 
purchasing from within their own borders regardless of cost. 
This raises the cost of purchasing, raising government 
expenditure and raising taxes. It also costs jobs in other 
provinces because the most efficient producers cannot sell 
outside their own provinces.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Some jobs may be protected locally but just like the brewing 
industry, these local producers are insulated and inefficient. The 
higher taxes affect all Canadians and cost in total more jobs than 
protecting the local industry will save. This hurts Ontario as it 
hurts all Canadians.
<P>
	The industry minister attempted to achieve a deal on this 
important subject over the summer but due to the 
short-sightedness of some provinces, the agreement ended up 
being window dressing only. It is important that he make it a 
high priority to get the provinces back to the table and remove 
these barriers to competitiveness.
<P>
	Interprovincial barriers to trade and financial services creates 
once again a higher cost to consumers, costs financial 
institutions their competitive position and costs Canadians jobs. 
It also affects another major employer in my riding which finds 
restrictions on selling its services outside Ontario.
<P>
	Trust companies for example find barriers to trade in the 
different regulations that each province sets up. Much like the 
trucking industry a lowest common denominator approach must 
be taken to selling services in more than one market thereby 
increasing costs. A standard set of regulations for all provinces 
would eliminate administrative overhead, produce more 
competitiveness, lower costs for consumers and again 
ultimately create more jobs.
<P>
	A further barrier to trade is the restriction placed on various 
types of labour mobility between provinces. This is of particular 
concern to an area such as Ottawa-Hull which straddles a 
provincial boundary but still affects people in my riding and 
indeed all Canadians.
<P>
	Many of us are familiar with the dispute that erupted earlier 
this year between Ontario and Quebec on the issue of 
construction jobs. This was one of many barriers that prevented 
professionals and labourers from offering their services across 
Canada. This means competition is reduced and will result in 
higher costs in taxes for consumers.
<P>
	Fortunately, Ontario and Quebec managed to resolve their 
differences on this single issue to the benefit of both. However 
this is the exception rather than the rule. It is time for us to sit 
down at the bargaining table and eliminate the many other 
barriers that are still in place.
<P>
	It is important to reflect on the statements that have come 
from this government on the recent GATT agreement. The 
finance minister estimated that the economy would grow .4 per 
cent as a result of the implementation of this freer trade 
agreement. Estimates by the Fraser Institute on the effect of 
removing interprovincial trade barriers range from 2 to 6 per 
cent.
<P>
	In other words, with GATT we spent seven years and millions 
of tax dollars to negotiate with 120 foreign countries an 
agreement to open up trading, yet we have an opportunity to 
realize five to fifteen times the economic benefit by negotiating 
among only ten provinces. Unfortunately this government has 
only given a very half-hearted effort to this point.
<P>
	The bottom line is that interprovincial trade barriers mean 
lost jobs for Canada, higher taxes and product cost and a less 
competitive economy with which to face the world.
<P>
	It is within the substance of this bill and the industry 
minister's mandate to reduce and eliminate all barriers to 
interprovincial trade and make Canada as competitive as it can 
be. The speed with which this minister takes action on this 
important issue will indicate to Canadians how serious the 
Liberals are about their promise of jobs, jobs, jobs.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8777"> 8777 </A></B>
<P>
	We have an opportunity here that should not be missed. We 
can improve the economy. We can create jobs here in Canada 
and indeed hone our edge to be more competitive in the global 
market we are competing in today.

	The House resumed from October 25 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-237, an act to amend the Bankruptcy Act 
(priority of claims), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> On a point of order, Madam Speaker, I think 
you would find unanimous consent that any division bells called 
on the private member's item now before the House later this 
day be deferred as well until tomorrow at 5.30 p.m. There has 
been consultation with the whips of all parties to defer that vote 
until that time. I think you would find that consent if you were to 
seek it, Madam Speaker.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, this bill provides that in cases of bankruptcy wages be 
paid as a first priority, up to a limit of $9,000 for each worker.
<P>
	The present Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act passed in 1992 by 
the Conservative government maintains the preferred claim 
status for wages when an employer files for bankruptcy. It 
covers wage-earners by giving them preferred creditor status 
for wages earned during the six months previous to the 
bankruptcy, up to a limit of $2,000.
<P>
	Wage claims rank fourth in the priority of preferred claims. 
Since claims of secured and preferred creditors must be paid 
first, there is not always enough money left to cover wage 
claims. Workers suffer the consequences.
<P>
	Progress on that issue did not lead to a fair solution for 
workers. The problem has been dragging on since 1980, when 
the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and 
Commerce mentioned three possible solutions. The first was to 
give absolute priority to wage claims by putting them first, 
before those of any other secured creditor. That is exactly what 
the hon. member for Portneuf suggested today and I want to 
commend him for that.
<P>
	Therefore, for almost 14 years now, this House has been 
analyzing the possibility of amending this legislation which is 
unfair to workers. For 14 years, by not addressing this 
problematic issue, this House has shown that it does not give a 
hoot about the interests of workers and what they produce.
<P>
	Why hesitate so much on this single issue? Because we have 
to choose between the workers and the banks. That is the choice 
we have to make.
<P>
	Why have we not made any progress? Because successive 
governments have not had the courage to come to the defence of 
the most disadvantaged in our society.
<P>
	We are talking here about a ludicrous situation that has been 
going on for years. The struggle in this area has been tough. It 
took 40 years of fierce fighting to have the Bankruptcy Act 
reviewed in 1992. Extensive consultations were held with the 
stakeholders and people concerned because many divergent 
interests were involved.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8778"> 8778 </A></B>
<P>
	Undeniably, some social choices are at the basis of such a bill. 
Unfortunately, and we must be clear on this, each time it has 
been proposed, the idea of giving first priority to wage claims 
has always been defeated by the banking lobby. This is obvious 
in all the documents dealing with this sensitive issue.
<P>
	Some members claim that this bill would cause a rise in the 
unemployment rate, since according to them, lending 
institutions might reduce the amount of credit available to 
businesses if employees were given absolute priority over other 
creditors.
<P>
	Of course jobs must be protected, but one can hardly argue 
that the success of an SME depends on whether it can avoid 
paying employees the wages, leave and pension fund 
contributions they rightly earned.
<P>
	We must also consider the precarious situation facing 
employees who have no way to recover wages in arrears. We 
cannot endorse the principle of protecting the banks and letting 
employees who earn a modest wage fend for themselves.
<P>
	Of course bankruptcy is an unpleasant situation and it always 
means someone will have to pay. In this instance, the House has 
the option of identifying four preferred creditors and deciding 
which creditor will be first in line to be reimbursed. These four 
creditors are: the government, suppliers, lenders and 
employees.
<P>
	The House must now decide which of the four is best able to 
absorb the loss resulting from the bankrupt individual's lack of 
assets to reimburse each creditor. Who has the most to lose and 
who is the most vulnerable? Is it the government? Is it the 
suppliers? Let me explain my point of view.
<P>
	For the government, despite the dismal state of its finances, 
the loss would be negligible, compared with the national debt.
<P>
	As for the suppliers, they can claim losses due to bad debts 
and thus reduce their taxable income.
<P>
	I am not worried about the lending institutions. They can 
consider bad debts as an incentive to improve their follow-up in 
the future, which should increase their sense of responsibility to 
society instead of encouraging them to ignore their customers' 
problems the way they do now.
<P>
	Finally, we have the employees, who have no way of 
absorbing the losses they suffer following a bankruptcy. In fact, 
under our existing legislation, employees are forced to absorb 
these losses. They have no alternative, no way out.
<P>
	This is not intended to be an exhaustive analysis of the 
subject, but employees are not only penalized by being unable to 
recover their salaries but also because they will not be 
reimbursed for expenses incurred during their period of 
employment: food, transportation and accommodation, in some 
cases.
<P>
	Why up to $9,000? Because even when employers pay their 
employees wages every week or every two weeks, in some cases 
where substantial amounts well in excess of the $2,000 
guaranteed thus far may have accumulated. Money owed to the 
employees in excess of this ceiling is not reimbursed and they 
have to absorb their loss.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	In my view, this bill is a tool to motivate workers, a tool to 
foster productivity. Workers will be encouraged to take chances 
and accept compromises to help their SME go through rough 
times, if they are assured that at the end of the day, they will get 
their salary or their investment back, that is to say that they will 
recover their outlay before the government, banks and suppliers.
<P>
	This is a far cry from the present legislation which makes 
workers bear the brunt of the losses by paying them back last, 
while we know full well that they do not get one extra penny 
when business is booming.
<P>
	The government, by refusing to amend this unfair act, is 
applying double standards more than ever. I believe that 
amending the act and putting employees at the top of the list of 
preferred claims would be a matter of basic social justice, but it 
would seem that fairness is not a priority for the Liberal Party.
<P>
	I will draw a parallel with the family trusts the Liberals are 
intent on protecting. This is another example of double 
standards where the rich are favoured at the expense of the 
poorest members of society.
<P>
	Just as banks are protected by the Bankruptcy Act which 
makes sure that they are paid before the employees, the rich are 
protected once again through family trusts which make it 
possible for them to be granted a tax exemption for up to 80 
years. This is a tax loophole available to the rich, while there is 
talk of taxing RRSPs, a plan designed for private sector 
employees who do not have a generous pension plan.
<P>
	I repeat, this is a case of double standards.
<P>
	It must be said: maintaining family trusts and the Liberals' 
refusal to change the order of priority of claims guaranteed 
under the Bankruptcy Act, serve only one purpose: to protect the 
wealthiest members of society.
<P>
	Indeed, the family trusts the Liberals are steadfastly 
defending are not used by middle-income families. In this 
respect, I would like to quote the findings of a study by Ernst and 
Young which showed assets averaged $47 million in a random 
sample of 121 family trusts.
<P>
	I repeat, Madam Speaker, this is a blatant case of double 
standards.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I oppose this bill to amend the Bankruptcy Act because 
it would result in inefficiencies and an unfair burden on the 
general public.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8779"> 8779 </A></B>
<P>
	I can understand the motive behind the proposed legislation. 
Why should banks, funeral businesses and accounting firms be 
paid out of the proceeds of a bankrupt firm before workers who 
typically have fewer resources than these enterprises?
<P>
	The new law presumably would reduce profits of these firms 
without any dire social consequences while it would prevent the 
misery for the families of workers who can ill-afford to lose 
income they have earned. However, this view is shortsighted.
<P>
	In a free society and under current law funeral businesses and 
accounting firms do not have to take business for which they are 
not paid. The proposed law does not envisage changing this 
condition. Therefore when an estate is to be dissolved and it is 
clear that if after the payment of labour there is no money left for 
funeral expenses and accounting services, who will do this 
work?
<P>
	I see only one answer to this question. A government will 
have to undertake the task or at least pay for it out of general tax 
revenue. People have to be buried, accounts have to be settled to 
meet the requirements of property laws that have existed for 
centuries.
<P>
	Under either approach the public ends up paying for these 
services. Therefore, the proposed legislation will enrich 
workers of a bankrupt company at the expense of the general 
public. I do not see the fairness of this outcome, especially 
because the wages earned by workers in different occupations 
and industry tend to compensate them for all kinds of risks in the 
first place. I will return to a discussion of this proposition in a 
moment.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	Let me now turn to the not so obvious consequences of 
ranking secured loans below wages. This rule will increase the 
interest rates which lenders charge to businesses for loans for 
the purchase of tangible assets. This is not a malicious plot of 
capitalists. By doing so lenders will simply meet their fiduciary 
responsibility.
<P>
	I venture to guess that none of us in this House would be very 
happy if our savings in a bank or credit union were used to lend 
to risky borrowers without proper risk premium and collateral. 
We would be very unhappy if the fiduciary holders of our money 
did not pool risky investments and did not make sure that on 
average interest earned on the pool minus payments for 
bankruptcy losses is equal to what they could have earned by 
investing our money in secure government bonds.
<P>
	This is of course what lenders to business do. Therefore any 
government legislation like the one proposed which increases 
the rate of loss from loans requires an increase in the interest 
rate charged to all members in the pool of risky loans. One rather 
obvious consequence of this action is that borrowers' profits are 
reduced. They will try to raise the cost of their services and 
products to compensate for this reduction. This can be done only 
to a limited extent, otherwise they would  have already charged 
higher prices before the interest costs went up.
<P>
	To the extent that they succeed and get higher prices, the 
money which goes to workers first in line in a bankruptcy 
proceeding comes from the general consumer. I see no fairness 
in this. A less obvious effect of the higher loan rates to business 
is that some firms will not be started at all. As a result the 
demand for labour and the wage rate are lowered.
<P>
	In addition, the average amount of capital held by business 
will be smaller. Therefore, labour productivity and wages will 
be lower. In effect, the rest of labour is forced to pay for the 
income earned by the workers in a bankrupt firm indirectly 
through higher interest rates charged by lenders. I see no 
fairness in this.
<P>
	Finally, it should be noted that the probability of bankruptcy 
of firms can be predicted to some degree by the characteristics 
of an industry, a firm or the personality of the employer. 
Workers are smart and know how to look after their own 
interests. They enter employment contracts considering their 
pay in light of a wide range of conditions, including the risk of 
their employer going bankrupt. The idea of buyer beware is 
relevant to goods and services as well as the sale of one's labour.
<P>
	The vast majority of workers therefore will accept 
employment where the risk of bankruptcy exists only if their 
wages reflect properly this condition. Otherwise they will find 
employment elsewhere. They will continue to stay with a 
company only if they feel their wages properly reflect the risk 
they are taking.
<P>
	The motives for doing so are complex. I certainly would not 
hang around and work for a company about to go bankrupt and 
unable to pay me wages owed unless the prospective benefits are 
fully worth it.
<P>
	I would postulate that the wages of workers, everything else 
remaining the same, are higher the greater a firm's risk of 
bankruptcy. The proposed law would remove or significantly 
lower the risk of wage losses from such events. This would 
encourage such workers to accept employment in such 
industries at lower wages. They would therefore on average be 
no better off than they were under the present law, except that 
the efficiency of the economy would be reduced because there 
would be an over expansion of risky firms and industries and a 
job and output reducing tax on the rest of the workers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8780"> 8780 </A></B>
<P>
	There are always some people who do not obey the principle 
of buyer beware or who have poor judgment about the prospect 
of a company's bankruptcy and ability to pay owed wages. I 
think the number of these people is small. I have confidence in 
workers.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	Canadian workers are not dumb or unaware of the functioning 
of markets. Helping those few through the proposed legislation 
is very indirect and costly for reasons just discussed. Help for 
them should come through education and the publication of 
relevant information. Unions could play an important role in 
this process. They have the resources and are driven by the right 
humanitarian motives. Those who cannot be reached by these 
direct methods and who need help have to be taken care of by 
existing systems of private charity and public aid.
<P>
	In sum, the present law regulating the order in which 
obligations of estates are settled in the case of a bankruptcy or 
death have existed for centuries. Institutions which have 
survived for so long should never be changed without very good 
cause.
<P>
	They may appear to create injustices for some, but closer 
examination of their effects typically will reveal that serious 
unforeseen consequences are likely to arise if they are changed. 
The long survival of such institutions strongly implies that past 
efforts to improve them have failed.
<P>
	I believe that my analysis of the indirect effects of the 
proposed change in the bankruptcy law support this view of the 
sociobiological evolution of institutions. I urge members of this 
Parliament to vote against these proposed changes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the purpose of the bill before us today is to move 
employees from fourth to first place in the legal order of 
precedence when a bankruptcy occurs. If it was passed, this bill 
would provide that when the assets of a bankrupt person or 
corporation were divided, the first people to receive payment 
would be employees instead of other people like funeral 
directors, lawyers and administrators, and secured claimants.
<P>
	Funeral expenses, legal and administrative fees are not the 
main obstacle presented by this bill. Those who currently have 
the first right of payment are secured creditors, which is a 
broader and more significant category involving mortgage 
holders. These secured creditors are the ones who would suffer 
most from the enormous changes the bill would bring about in 
our financial system.
<P>
	What are we really talking about when we speak of the order 
of precedence in the Bankruptcy Act? We are describing levels 
of risk. The one in first place on the order of precedence is taking 
the least risk in the case of bankruptcy, because the first one will 
be the first one paid out.
<P>
	We know that all business ventures do not succeed. Some 
make it but some do not. When an employee or a lender enters 
into a contract with a business person, the risk of business 
failure is always there. The place one takes on the order of 
precedence will determine just how much risk one is willing to 
undergo.
<P>
	Employees are now fourth on the list, so employees bear more 
risk than some others. This means they should carefully 
consider whether they want to give their time to a business they 
suspect might fail. The hon. member who spoke previous to me 
already pointed out that they are smart enough to make that 
decision already. It goes without saying that if lenders were 
moved lower in the order of precedence, they would have to 
consider more carefully than they do already whether or not to 
lend money to a business.
<P>
	If we change the order of precedence on a broad, nationwide 
basis, we are making a determination about risk and who should 
bear it. We are also making a statement about what is most 
necessary in society for the efficient functioning of business. 
Given that we all want private enterprise to flourish, we must 
make the rules in such a way as to facilitate the most efficient 
way for all Canadians and the marketplace to prosper.
<P>
	Government could put up all sorts of artificial and 
unnecessary barriers to the free functioning of the marketplace 
for one political reason or another at the expense of the 
efficiency in the marketplace.
<P>
	For instance, the environment is important so the government 
could pass a zero emissions law for the auto industry, stating 
that automobiles could not pollute at all. In this impossible 
example it is obvious that the auto industry would immediately 
grind to a screeching halt. I merely want to demonstrate that in 
considering what laws to pass, governments must strike a 
balance between the efficiency of the market and the kind of 
business it wants to foster.
<P>
	From that example let us move back to the matter at hand. If 
an employee was first on the order of precedence, the employee 
would be taking the least risk in the case of bankruptcy and the 
lender would have to incur more risk than before. This 
consideration of greater risk would have inevitable efficiency 
results in the marketplace. I want to describe what they might 
be.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	Certainly there would be one positive result, namely that of 
paying back employees who were not paid full wages or 
severance pay if a person or corporation went bankrupt. This 
would be nice for the employees. Employees are important and 
necessary actors in our financial system and deserve due 
consideration. But this is the only positive effect I have been 
able to think of in this bill.
<P>
	This scenario is directly analogous to the auto industry I was 
just talking about. I maintain that the passage of Bill C-237 
would have a harmful effect on employment in general in the 
country. It would make small business  less efficient and slow 
the pace of economic activity across the nation. Just like a zero 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8781"> 8781 </A></B>
<P>
emissions policy in the automobile sector would do more harm 
than good, I am convinced that the sum total of harm caused to 
employees would be vastly greater than the losses they now 
suffer as a result of being in fourth place on the order of 
precedence.
<P>
	The first harmful effect a change in the order of precedence 
would cause would be a reduction I believe in the overall 
employment in Canada. A company which needed, for example, 
$1 million and wanted to employ 25 people would not be able to 
compete for funding with a company that also wanted a $1 
million loan but was only going to employ 10 people.
<P>
	The risk would be much reduced if there were fewer 
employees to pay out before the lender received his or her share. 
This would cause businesses to shy away from labour intensive 
enterprises and move toward enterprises involving technology 
even more than labour. People would become less important 
players in our financial markets as a result of this change and 
machines would become more important.
<P>
	The second effect we would feel at a national level would be 
more important. It would have a direct impact on foreign 
investment. Capital is very mobile on a global basis and 
foreigners invest in our economy all the time. If another country 
had laws that would guarantee them less risk than Canada could, 
then their money would tend to flow out of Canada and into 
other safer business enterprises around the world.
<P>
	Canada depends a lot on foreign capital. We cannot afford to 
send foreigners a message that they are not welcome here. The 
loss of their financing would mean less investment and fewer 
businesses. Again this would have a direct, more serious 
negative employment effect across the country.
<P>
	The final effect would be the most serious of all. If lenders 
had to undergo more risk than they do now in lending they would 
be forced to think twice before lending at all. This would mean 
that more marginal business ventures would have a harder time 
raising capital. When they wanted to borrow money they would 
have to pay a risk premium, in other words, a higher interest rate 
for that money. This would mean that many businesses simply 
would never get off the ground because they would not be able to 
afford the interest payments on their loans.
<P>
	Government currently plays a role, unfortunately, by lending 
to marginal, more risky businesses through agencies like the 
Western Diversification Fund and the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency. But the capacity of governments to do so 
in the future is being vastly reduced by government debt. 
Therefore government in this case would not be able to take up 
the slack in this area of the market.
<P>
	We all know that many innovations never succeed but a few 
pay off handsomely. Innovative entrepreneurs are  important in 
our economy and Bill C-237 might discourage them from taking 
risks. Their ideas would never see the light of day if access to 
risk capital were reduced.
<P>
	It is obvious that fewer people would be employed as a result 
of this restriction on lending capital. What employees gained in 
wage security they would lose in job security. The old adage that 
you cannot get something for nothing is truly relevant here. 
What little you might have gained in one sector of the economy 
you would lose far more in another. Bill C-237 would have a 
detrimental effect on employees.
<P>
	As usual, government meddling with the marketplace would 
have the most detrimental effect on small businesses. I would 
remind members that over 97 per cent of all firms in Canada 
have less than 50 employees. Small business is the engine of 
economic growth and we want to keep fueling that engine, not 
choke off its fuel by unnecessary government restrictions such 
as the one we contemplate here today.
<P>
	The argument is that we need to be kinder to employees. 
Somehow we need to make them more secure. But is it really a 
kindness to give them that kind of security and then throw them 
on the dole? What kind of effective security is that? It is security 
for some but it is unemployment for others.
<P>
	As I said a few moments ago we will all be more prosperous if 
private enterprise flourishes in Canada. That is a given. All we 
need to do is discover what rules to set in place that will make 
this happen. I would remind members that the rules in the 
Bankruptcy Act are not arbitrary. They represent the interests of 
people acting in the marketplace over generations of litigation 
and thousands of cases of business relationships.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	I have stated adequately my clear opposition to this motion. It 
is not because I appreciate workers less than the member for 
Portneuf. The rules of business should maintain the overall 
efficiency of private enterprise because the security of private 
enterprise ensures job security for Canadian workers.
<P>
	In my opinion, the order of precedence assigns risk in a way 
that benefits business efficiency. In that way it serves the public 
interest. It should, therefore, remain intact.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Before recognizing the 
hon. member for Portneuf, I would like to say that pursuant to 
Standing Order 44, no member, unless otherwise provided by 
Standing or Special Order, may speak twice to a question. It 
says:

but not to the mover of an amendment, the previous question or an instruction to a

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8782"> 8782 </A></B>
<P>
	Therefore, the hon. member for Portneuf has the right to 
reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Thank you, Madam 
Speaker.
<P>
	Debate on Bill C-237 that I have had the pleasure of 
introducing is drawing to a close. My Liberal and Reform 
colleagues showed no real willingness to redress the obvious 
injustice towards unpaid workers who assume part of the burden 
of their employer's bankruptcy.
<P>
	Here is what the Liberals and Reformers argued. First, banks 
would be reluctant to lend money to companies.
<P>
	Second, these same banks would lose patience more quickly 
when a company was experiencing difficulties.
<P>
	Third and final argument, such a super priority for wage 
claims would be unfair to other creditors, including the Crown.
<P>
	I will start by disproving the first argument. You know as well 
as I that generally speaking employees have no say in the way 
their employer runs his business. An employer can mortgage the 
company using his employees' salaries and wages as collateral. 
All creditors give legal consent for the money they loan to a 
company, but not employees. They have no say in the matter. 
Yet, their salaries, the fruit of their labour, is put up as collateral 
for other creditors. This is clearly unfair.
<P>
	Moreover, the government does not get a penny out of unpaid 
wages. If salaries were to become a super priority, they would be 
paid to employees and the Department of Revenue would get its 
share. This disproves argument number 3.
<P>
	The second point, that banks would be less patient with 
businesses in difficulty, is an interesting argument since banks 
are responsible for ensuring that the business to which they lend 
money is solvent. Banks are well placed to see if a business is 
able to pay its employees' salaries. If a bank lends to a business 
that is not able to pay its employees, it means that this institution 
agrees to let the workers bear the risk of the loan. Such an 
attitude would be both unjust and unacceptable.
<P>
	Bill C-237 would force banks to be more responsible in this 
regard, which is highly desirable, you will agree.
<P>
	This brings me to the first point. Is it true that this bill will 
affect the financing of businesses? I remind you that suppliers 
retain a right of ownership on unpaid supplies. The granting of 
that right in the past did not affect companies' access to funds.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	We should also note that the industry committee recently 
tabled a report on the Small Businesses Loans Act. Here we have 
a good opportunity to illustrate the interdependence and 
complementarity of two measures: Bill C-237 corrects a 
problem for workers and the committee report enhances 
business financing. Consequently, the argument that business 
credit could be restricted does not hold any more. That did not 
happen in the case of a similar measure concerning suppliers and 
besides, the Small Businesses Loans Act could provide for that.
<P>
	May I remind you that the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Industry said in the second part of the debate on this 
bill, on October 25, that ``until we have the banks acting more 
progressively and until their attitudes change toward small 
business, this bill should be defeated''.
<P>
	That is the main repugnant reason why some Liberals 
objected to this bill. That is also the main reason why all bills 
advocating the super priority of wage claims have failed for 
more than 20 years. Not for practical or economic reasons, but 
simply because we should wait for the banks to change their 
attitudes.
<P>
	Well, I say no. Our workers have been subjected for too long 
already to the financial institution lobby. Over the past 20 years 
or so, in parliamentary committees, advisory committees and a 
stunning amount of legislation, banks have been used as an 
excuse to reject any piece of legislation on the priority status of 
wage claims, and every government has given in to the powerful 
banks.
<P>
	In closing, let me repeat the arguments for this bill. First of 
all, this measure is intended to protect the driving force behind 
our economy, the workers. Next, the principle of priority for 
wage claims is one that makes up for the injustice done to 
workers by giving them the rank to which their work give them 
an indisputable right.
<P>
	Moreover, this proposal will ensure that salaried employees 
will have better chances to be paid and paid more quickly. Let 
me add that the superpriority will allow them to be paid without 
any cost to the taxpayers. In fact, the government will get its 
share.
<P>
	Besides, it is obvious that the risk that this superpriority 
would restrict credit for businesses has been deliberately 
exaggerated. That will not be the case. Finally, need we point out 
that it is not up to the workers to guarantee, with their wages, 
and without their consent, financial decisions made by their 
employers.
<P>
	In its red book, the Liberal Party claims that it is committed to 
the principle of social solidarity, and I quote from page 73. It is 
stated that many of the laws and policies that previous Liberal 
governments enacted remain the basis of our system of social 
support, ``through which we pool our resources to create 
programs that benefit all Canadians and help to sustain people 
through difficult times''.
<P>
	Therefore I ask the government members to fulfil that 
commitment in supporting Bill C-237 so that it can be referred 
to a 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8783"> 8783 </A></B>
<P>
committee where it will be improved before coming back to this 
House, so that the public can be better served.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANWHEATBOARD">CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, in 
this post-adjournment period I wish to reopen a question that I 
put to the minister of agriculture on Monday. I asked him 
whether there would be any changes in the government's policy 
toward the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	I asked this because during the election the Prime Minister 
was quite clear that the policy of the Liberals was to support the 
board. In the election that was quite important. There was a 
small group of farmers demanding a dual marketing system 
which would have had the effect of breaking the ability of the 
board to put prices on grain for western farmers.
<P>
	Since that time the elections for the advisory committee have 
occurred. That election was openly fought between people who 
supported a strengthened board and those who wanted the board 
to either disappear or have very limited powers. As it turned out, 
10 of the 11 positions on that advisory board were filled by 
people who supported a strengthened board. This is actually the 
strongest electoral situation the advisory committee has been in 
since it was first brought into being back in the mid-seventies 
when I happened to be a member of it.
<P>
	The turnout was one of the heaviest that there has been. We 
have to remember this is a mail out ballot. A lot of the ballots 
never get opened. They get lost in the pile of mail that comes 
home. On average just over 46 per cent voted. This was one of 
the higher turnouts. In the two eastern provinces the turnout was 
considerably higher than in Alberta where it was just over a third 
of the farmers who actually voted.
<P>
	I note that some of the board's detractors are saying that this 
does not tell anything because the turnout was not very high. I 
want to point out that even in Alberta where the return was only 
about 36 or 37 per cent, that is higher than the U.S. 
congressional elections which just changed the whole outlook of 
that Congress. It is higher than the normal presidential elections 
in the United States. Forty-six to 48 per cent which is what most 
of the provinces had for a turnout was much higher than we see 
in most municipal elections and occasionally in provincial 
elections. I do not think we can argue that this was not a 
legitimately elected group.
<P>
	There are some special problems that face the board at the 
moment and I think this newly elected group should be utilized 
by the minister to look at some of those problems. New grains 
are something rye producers in particular have shown they are 
willing and ready to have included in the board's jurisdiction. 
The advisory committee should be given that as a question to 
look at.
<P>
	It could also be asked to provide opinions on how to integrate 
organically produced grain and perhaps the question of grains 
milled on farm or by the owner of the grain, which is something 
organic producers particularly want to have looked at. This is a 
special niche market. The board has been occupied in 
developing these special situations.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	I wanted to raise these in the post-adjournment debate 
because I think the minister is aware that there are many more 
things that the wheat board could be doing and I wanted to know 
whether the Prime Minister's assurances during the election 
campaign that he supports the board meant a stronger board, an 
expanding board, or simply a status quo kind of board. I hope the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8784"> 8784 </A></B>
<P>
result of the elections would give the minister the assurance that 
farmers are behind an expanded and growing wheat board.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member's interest 
in and concern for the Canadian Wheat Board is noted and 
appreciated. I am pleased to have this opportunity to respond to 
his remarks in greater detail than I would be able to do during the 
course of Question Period.
<P>
	The member makes reference to the most recent election of 
the Canadian Wheat Board's producer advisory committee and 
the proper interpretation to be placed upon the results of that 
election. The committee consists of 11 members. In the most 
recent election results 10 of those 11 members were identified 
very much as pro-board candidates who opposed any weakening 
of the Canadian Wheat Board, opposed the concept of dual 
marketing.
<P>
	While this election was not a direct plebiscite about 
marketing systems, and while the overall producer participation 
in the voting was only about 40 per cent, I think it is fair to say 
that the vote results show an important level of producer support 
for the Canadian Wheat Board. I do not think it would be fair to 
say that the vote is the be all and end all. I do not think it would 
be fair to say it is the absolute last and ultimate word. It is one 
very important piece of evidence which is clearly supportive of 
the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	Over the course of the last year or so a controversy has been 
brewing among western Canadian farmers about the Canadian 
Wheat Board and this notion of alternative marketing systems. 
It is a subject upon which different groups of farmers hold 
profoundly different opinions. So far there has not been a 
rational, full, frank, objective opportunity for farmers to discuss 
all of those alternatives and to have a face to face analysis of the 
situation in a frank and logical way.
<P>
	That is why I plan to carry through on a commitment that I 
have made to provide farmers and all interested stakeholders 
with that full, objective, logical, rational forum and mechanism 
within which to examine the alternatives, have all of those 
alternatives subjected to examination and cross-examination so 
there can be that full analysis with the full participation of the 
farmers. I am confident that in that process the Canadian Wheat 
Board will do very well.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="REFUGEES">REFUGEES</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to elaborate on a question I put to the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration on November 24, 
1994. I asked what action the Canadian government is taking to 
ensure the human rights of Vietnamese refugees in southeast 
Asia.
<P>
	On December 12, 1948, the year in which I was born so it is 
close to my heart, the United Nations Assembly passed the 
universal declaration of human rights. On Friday of this week 
the world celebrates International Human Rights Day.
<P>
	I have a number of constituents from the wider area of 
southeast Asia and the concern has been raised with me and 
other members in southwestern Ontario that constituents of ours 
are very concerned about the safety of some of their family 
members in their original homelands.
<P>
	Since 1988 Hong Kong has granted refugee status to 
Vietnamese who proved justified fear of persecution at home 
and I understand that since 1991 refugees have voluntarily been 
returning to Vietnam. The Hong Kong government is now 
operating a program of forcible repatriation to encourage the 
24,000 refugees remaining in camps there to leave by 1996. That 
is the cause of the very real concern a number of Vietnamese 
Canadians share about the safety of their loved ones back home.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	There is no question there have been incidents of violence and 
assault against these refugees. In September of this year the 
Government of Hong Kong admitted quite candidly that 142 
Vietnamese refugees were injured in a forced repatriation 
operation. There have been serious allegations and questions 
about police brutality since the repatriation program began 
earlier this year.
<P>
	This deplorable situation has been brought to my attention by 
leaders of the Vietnamese community both in my own city and in 
southwestern Ontario, and indeed by certain segments of the 
media in southwestern Ontario. I share their concern. Quite 
frankly Canadians generally would share this concern. We do 
not want to see human rights violations such as these going 
unanswered.
<P>
	I certainly applaud the actions of our own new government 
and of previous governments of various political stripes in being 
a leader in the world in accepting refugees from virtually every 
part of the world. We know that is true and we are all as 
Canadians rightly proud of that record. However there is a 
situation here which needs to be addressed.
<P>
	I am pleased to follow up my question to the minister this 
evening with this statement and to explore a little further the 
answer the minister gave to me in the House.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8785"> 8785 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to put a question to the parliamentary secretary. 
What other initiatives can Canada take besides accepting 
refugees? What other initiatives, either publicly or through 
appropriate diplomatic channels, does the government foresee 
might be taken to stop violence against Vietnamese citizens 
forcibly repatriated against their will?
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to thank the hon. member for his question and for the 
concern he has shown for the situation of Indo-Chinese boat 
people throughout southeast Asia.
<P>
	As the minister has already stated, Canada has also played an 
important role in the development of the comprehensive plan of 
action in 1989. Under this international agreement 
Indo-Chinese asylum seekers are screened under U.S. auspices.
<P>
	Persons who are determined to become convention refugees 
are eligible for resettlement in a third country such as Canada. 
Persons who are found not to be refugees are expected to return 
to their country of origin. Most of the people who remain in the 
camps in Hong Kong have been determined not to be refugees 
and are expected to repatriate to Vietnam.
<P>
	The non-refugees have been offered voluntary repatriation to 
Vietnam under United Nations supervision with an additional 
inducement of reintegration assistance paid by the international 
community.
<P>
	Since the inception of the CPA in 1989 Canada has 
contributed $9 million for maintaining the camps and for 
returnee programs; 60,000 have returned voluntarily. 
Unfortunately approximately 50,000 Indo-Chinese remain in 
the camps in southeast Asia, the vast majority of whom have 
been found not to be convention refugees after examination 
under the CPA.
<P>
	The international community and Canadians expect that 
humane methods are used to ensure the safe return of these 
people to their own countries. However in a removal situation, 
particularly when the individual being returned is not 
co-operative, some force unfortunately has been employed.
<P>
	Canada's response to the Vietnamese refugee crisis has been 
exemplary. During the first 10 years of the Indo-Chinese 
movement from 1979 to 1988 over 79,000 Vietnamese were 
resettled by Canada from the camps of southeast Asia. Since the 
implementation of the CPA in 1989, Canada has resettled over 
19,000 Vietnamese refugees from the camps of southeast Asia. 
In addition, under regular immigration programs directly from 
Vietnam, Canada has resettled nearly 50,000 Vietnamese.
<P>
	I congratulate the hon. member for London-Middlesex for 
raising this important question and for his concern.

Madam Speaker, before asking my question this evening, I will 
briefly review the situation to show what led the Official 
Opposition to raise this issue.
<P>
	The whole thing started when we learned that the director of 
the Health Canada Bureau of Veterinary Drugs, who had been on 
leave without pay for about a year, was lobbying on the Hill to 
convince some government members of the merits of the 
hormone called somatotropin. You will remember this hormone 
stimulates milk production in cows. This issue raises many 
questions.
<P>
	The main question is: How can the minister allow the director 
of the bureau currently examining the possibility of releasing 
this hormone for market to ``pressure'' his colleagues or at least 
try to convince them of the merits of this hormone while on 
leave without pay?
<P>
	He is still the director even though he is on leave without pay. 
Let us be clear on the principle of leave without pay. The person 
on leave whithout pay does not lose his or her seniority, and 
continues to be entitled to his or her insurance plan, pension, 
disability insurance and everything else.
<P>
	Even if this individual is on leave without pay, he knows the 
staff of this bureau. We find the minister's inaction on this rather 
deplorable.
<P>
	This week, I wanted the minister to tell us why she did not 
respond before and what she intends to do about this director 
who, in my opinion, is unduly lobbying certain members of 
Parliament, in view of his previous functions.
<P>
	I would like the minister or her parliamentary secretary to tell 
us whether her departmental staff feels that this is normal and 
what action they will take immediately to stop this activity, so 
that the health department can have some credibility with the 
public. This department has extremely serious responsibilities, 
and I do not think that we should play around with such things.
<P>
	I would like the parliamentary secretary to tell us what the 
Department of Health intends to do about that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member has raised a 
couple of statements with regard to the presentation of the 
person involved to a parliamentary committee, it is my 
understanding, at the request of the committee.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8786"> 8786 </A></B>
<P>
	It is also my understanding from what we know of the issue 
right now that the person spoke only of issues that were public 
information. There was nothing spoken at the parliamentary 
committee level that was private information.
<P>
	Second, the person did not have anything to do with the BST 
file within the Department of Health. Third, as the hon. member 
well knows, the person was also not working and was on leave of 
absence from the Department of Health at the time.
<P>
	More important, the issue is being investigated. We cannot go 
on hearsay or on misunderstanding of issues. The issue is being 
investigated by Health Canada at the moment. As soon as the 
investigations have been finished and thoroughly looked at, the 
minister will be reporting to the House of Commons.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly the House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.24 p.m.)
<P>
