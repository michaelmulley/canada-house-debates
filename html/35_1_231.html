	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the 
honour this morning, pursuant to Standing Order 32(2), to table in 
both official languages a report entitled <I>Towards a Rapid Reaction 
Capability for the United Nations</I>.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-349, an act to amend the Criminal Code (peeping 
Toms).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to present this 
private member's bill, seconded by my colleague from Fraser 
Valley East.
<P>
	It is very short and very simple. It has been brought to my 
attention by police officers and other law enforcement individuals 
that in the Criminal Code peeping Toms apply only at night. It is 
my understanding this has caused a lot of concern because it seems 
like the criminals are getting braver in this day and age and a lot of 
this is happening during daylight hours. This amendment would 
enable the police to lay charges against those individuals doing this 
activity during the day, an activity for which they are normally 
arrested at night.

	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.)</B> moved for leave to

<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I received a phone call from a constituent 
asking why he and his family were forced from their rented house 
when their rent payments were all paid on time and the full amount 
was remitted.
<P>
	When I investigated his complaint it was discovered that no 
warning was given to the constituent that the owner of the building 
was facing foreclosure and that current legislation requires vacant 
possession of the building before the lending institution can be 
paid.
<P>
	This bill will amend the National Housing Act to allow a lending 
institution full redress without having to evict current tenants and 
the tenants will receive notice from the lending institution that it is 
proceeding with foreclosure on the building owner.
<P>
	I trust the House will support this measure. It may allow 
Canadians the opportunity to remain in their homes and at least 
give them ample time to relocate.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MANGANESEBASEDFUELADDITIVESACT">MANGANESE BASED FUEL ADDITIVES ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from September 25 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-94, an act to regulate interprovincial trade in and 
the importation for commercial purposes of certain manganese 
based substances, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to rise today to speak on Bill C-94, the 
manganese based fuel act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14851"> 14851 </A></B>
<P>
	I will explain the bill and why we are taking action against 
MMT. MMT is a manganese based fuel additive  used to increase 
the octane rating of gasoline. It has been used in Canada since 1977 
as a replacement for lead in unleaded gasoline.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	Lead was phased out of virtually all Canadian gasolines by 1990. 
Who uses MMT? Just about every Canadian motorist does, and that 
is because Canadian refiners use it. The exact amount of MMT 
used may vary, depending on the batch of gasoline. However, 
premium grade gasoline generally contains a higher dosage than 
regular grade gasoline. Canada is the only country that uses it. The 
United States, for example, banned it from unleaded gasoline in 
1978.
<P>
	The automobile industry is convinced that gasoline containing 
MMT adversely impacts the operation of sophisticated onboard 
diagnostic systems. These OBD systems are important because 
they monitor the performance of emission control components in 
vehicles. The auto industry has made the decision that it will not 
accept the risk of increased warranty repair costs caused by damage 
related to MMT. Some companies have even indicated that they 
will disconnect the OBD systems in whole or in part and may 
reduce Canadian vehicle warranty coverage starting with the 1996 
model year if MMT continues to be used in Canadian gasoline. 
That means that the cost of maintaining these systems will be 
passed on directly to Canadian consumers.
<P>
	This is where the federal government comes in. Last October the 
Minister of the Environment urged both industries to voluntarily 
resolve the issue of MMT by the end of 1994 or the government 
would take action. This deadline was subsequently extended until 
February of this year to review automobile and petroleum industry 
proposals. The matter was not resolved, so the federal government 
has had to step in. This has resulted in Bill C-94.
<P>
	The MMT issue is no longer an industry dispute. Its outcome can 
affect the vehicle emission program we are putting into place and 
in the long term could negatively impact the automobile sector.
<P>
	Successful solution of the MMT issue will ensure that 
environmental benefits are realized through the use of the most 
advanced emission control technologies. It will ensure that 
Canadians are offered the same warranty coverage as in the United 
States. It will also ensure that the Canadian motor vehicle 
emissions control programs do not diverge from those of the 
United States. This means that Canadians will continue to benefit 
from the cost and technological advantages of a North American 
harmonized fleet. It also means good news for Canadian jobs and 
the Canadian automotive sector. That of course is because 
diverging emissions standards and different anti-pollution 
equipment on Canadian cars will negatively affect the marketplace 
and decrease the competitiveness of the automotive sector.
<P>
	We could also be faced with a situation where cars built in 
Canada to go south of the border could have more advanced 
equipment than those sold in Canada. That is clearly not 
acceptable.
<P>
	We should be clear about the economic impact of removing 
MMT. It will be small for the entire petroleum industry. Estimates 
for the cost of MMT removal provided by the industry range from 
$50 million to $83 million per year. That means an additional 
increase of 0.1 to 0.24 cents per litre at the gas pump.
<P>
	I would now like to take a few moments to explain some of the 
key highlights of the bill.
<P>
	Bill C-94 will prohibit the import or interprovincial trade for a 
commercial purpose of MMT or anything containing MMT. It will 
also give the minister the power to authorize exceptions for MMT 
that will not be used in unleaded gasoline subject to monitoring 
requirements. Coverage of the act can be expanded by order in 
council to cover other manganese based substances.
<P>
	The act is binding on all persons and entities, including the 
provincial and federal governments. The enforcement tools are 
similar to those that are in the Canadian Environmental Protection 
Act, and the penalties are strict.
<P>
<B>(1020 )</B>
<P>
	For the unauthorized import or interprovincial trade of MMT, 
the maximum penalty on summary conviction is a $300,000 fine 
and/or six months in jail. On indictment, the maximum fine is $1 
million and/or three years in jail. For knowingly providing false or 
misleading information on the importation or interprovincial trade 
of MMT, the penalties are the same, but with a maximum of five 
years in jail instead of three on indictment. On conviction, as in 
CEPA, the court can also order an additional fine equal to the 
monetary benefits resulting from the offence, prohibit conduct that 
may lead to a repeat offence, and direct the offender to notify third 
parties about the conviction.
<P>
	I believe this gives the members of the House some idea of what 
the government is proposing under Bill C-94.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as members of the House will recall, during the June 
session we heard the government's reasoning behind the proposed 
ban on MMT. According to the hon. member for Davenport, the 
government is proposing Bill C-94 to ban the interprovincial trade 
of the fuel additive MMT in order to protect human health, protect 
car warranties, and to take advantage of technological change.
<P>
	This may sound on the surface to be reasonable. However, a 
closer examination of the stated reasons is certainly merited. It is 
my objective today to seek clarification on the purpose of Bill 
C-94, a trade sanction bill introduced by the Minister of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14852"> 14852 </A></B>
<P>
Environment, allegedly to protect the warranties offered customers 
purchasing new cars.
<P>
	First, looking at the health issue, allow me to refer to the Canada 
health study published in late 1994. I quote: ``Airborne manganese 
resulting from the combustion of MMT in gasoline powered 
vehicles is not entering the Canadian environment in quantities or 
under conditions that may constitute a health risk. All the analyses 
indicate that the combustion products of MMT in gasoline do not 
represent an added health risk for the Canadian population.''
<P>
	During our last discussions on this bill, the government 
produced facts from the U.S. EPA that indicated the EPA suggests 
tests be conducted on the potential health effects of MMT. The 
interesting thing is that the government appears to be predicting 
that the results of this testing will support its position to ban MMT, 
certainly a very premature action on its part. It seems ironic that the 
government chooses to discount scientific findings of the EPA 
testing programs on the impact of MMT on vehicle emission 
systems, the results of which clearly indicate that MMT has no 
adverse effect on the emission systems of cars, while speculating 
that the studies to be conducted on health will support its position.
<P>
	One may also ask why the government wants to see EPA testing 
results on health impacts of MMT when its own agency, Health 
Canada, has clearly demonstrated that Canadians experience no 
adverse effects from the level of airborne manganese that results 
from tailpipe emissions. It appears the government is prepared to 
discount scientific findings in favour of speculation that the results 
of the EPA's proposed testing on health effects of MMT will prove 
to be negative.
<P>
	The second reason the government offers for a ban on MMT is to 
protect car warranties. For those of you unfamiliar with the 
motivation for this legislation, let me remind you of the carmakers' 
claim that MMT in gasoline causes problems for onboard 
diagnostic systems in new model cars made in the U.S. According 
to the industry minister, the federal government has said it wishes 
to ban MMT so that ``Canadian consumers will be protected by 
ensuring that they are afforded the same warranty coverage as 
automobile owners in the United States''. Another reason is 
because the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association states that it 
has research that indicates MMT causes failure of onboard 
diagnostic systems. The MVMA has elected not to make that 
research public, however, after a recent review of scientific 
evidence collected as part of the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency evaluation of the auto industry's claims.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	The U.S. court of appeals stated in its judgment of April 14, 
1995, that MMT would not cause or contribute  to the failure of any 
emission control system or device. According to the U.S. EPA, and 
I quote: ``MMT does not cause or contribute to a failure of any 
emission control system or device''. The decision goes further to 
state: ``The administrators' analysis of data submitted by Ethyl was 
careful and searching. The American Automobile Manufacturers 
Association did not come close to proving that the administration's 
analysis of data was arbitrary or capricious.''
<P>
	We should also note that automobile makers have experienced 
significant technical difficulties complying with the onboard 
diagnostic requirements in the United States as well as in Canada, 
despite the fact that MMT is not currently used as an octane 
enhancer in American gasoline. In fact, difficulties with 
certification of onboard diagnostic systems in the United States 
have prompted the U.S. EPA to state in the <I>Federal Register</I> that 
automobile manufacturers have expressed and demonstrated 
difficulty in complying with every aspect of onboard diagnostic 
requirements and difficulty appears likely to continue in the 1996 
and 1997 model years.
<P>
	Despite these facts, the Canadian government appears not to 
have noted that vehicle manufacturers have failed to achieve 
onboard diagnostic certification in the U.S. for most new model 
cars and then chooses to conclude that those same problems in 
Canada are somehow attributed to MMT.
<P>
	The government's third reason for the proposed ban of MMT is a 
desire to take advantage of technological change and to enable 
Canadian consumers to reap the benefits offered by onboard 
diagnostic systems, which the hon. member for Davenport 
describes as contributing to pollution prevention. Unfortunately the 
member for Davenport does not appear to realize that onboard 
diagnostic systems merely notify the driver when there is a 
pollution emission problem. They do not control or reduce 
emissions. The onboard diagnostic is in fact a light on the 
dashboard of the car, which when illuminated suggests difficulty 
has been sensed.
<P>
	The problem the automakers are experiencing with the onboard 
diagnostic system, both here and in the United States, is that the 
OBD has been malfunctioning and lighting up when in fact there is 
no emission problem. This is causing vehicle owners to take their 
cars in for service when none is required. Since most of these visits 
are covered under warranty, the result is that the automakers must 
pay for the service visit.
<P>
	The government's confusion on the role of MMT is further 
exemplified by the notion that removing MMT from gasoline will 
contribute to pollution reduction. The member for Davenport tells 
us that scientists in his community have informed him that MMT in 
gasoline is contributing to greater pollution in the form of smog, 
carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons. Again, the facts prove him 
wrong. All scientific studies on nitrous oxide reductions 
attributable to MMT in gasoline conclude the  same thing: MMT in 
gasoline reduces emissions of nitrous oxide, a leading contributor 
to the formation of urban smog. In addition, the use of MMT in the 
refining process reduces emissions of carbon monoxide and of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14853"> 14853 </A></B>
<P>
hydrocarbons, not to mention emissions of benzene, which is a 
no-tolerance carcinogen.
<P>
	We should also note that MMT is compatible for use with 
alternative fuels. In fact the use of MMT enhances emission 
benefits of oxygenates such as ethanol and MTBE. For example, 
EPA test results indicate that MMT with a 10 per cent ethanol blend 
lowers nitrous oxide emissions by slightly more than 30 per cent 
and lowers ozone potential by 29 per cent. When MMT was added 
to an 11 per cent MTBE blend, nitrous oxide emissions were 
reduced by 25 per cent and ozone potential was reduced by 18 per 
cent. Not only does MMT contribute significantly to lower 
Canadian nitrous oxide emissions, but use of MMT enhances 
emission benefits of oxygenates.
<P>
	As part of this discussion, we must consider the fact that nitrous 
oxide increases resulting from the elimination of MMT from 
Canadian gasoline are projected to add 41,000 tonnes per year of 
nitrous oxide to the Canadian environment. That is a 16 per cent 
increase over current levels.
<P>
<B>(1030 )</B>
<P>
	In conclusion, the government's rationale for this bill is 
inconsistent. It blatantly disagrees with scientific findings 
regarding MMT effects on health, vehicle pollution control 
equipment and the environment. It therefore seems to be in the best 
interests of all constituents that we move to disregard the proposed 
bill. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``that'' 
and substituting the following therefor:</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion of the hon. member for 
Kootenay West-Revelstoke will be considered as to its 
acceptability and the Chair will pronounce on that matter after the

<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the privilege to speak in this 
Chamber on Bill C-94, the manganese based fuel additives act. 
Before speaking about the specific elements of Bill C-94 I would 
like to say a few words about some issues which affect the 
environment and concern me, on which the government has acted 
and more important what the government is intending to do.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Allow me to point out a few facts underlying my concerns. 
World population is increasing at the rate of about 90 million 
people every year. In the past 150 years,  it has climbed from 1 
billion to 6 billion. According to projections, it will reach between 
10 billion to 14 billion in the years 2000 to 2050.
<P>
	Between 1960 and 1990, economic activity grew at a compound 
annual rate of 3.8 per cent. The growth rate in any given year 
exceeded in absolute terms the total economic activity in Europe in
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Over the past 30 years the manufacturing activities around the 
globe have increased by 500 per cent, electrical production by 400 
per cent and the production of automobiles by 300 per cent. Clearly 
at the heart of our environmental concerns lies a historic trend of 
unprecedented expansion and acceleration of human activity. 
These now threaten vital components of the earth's ecology. The 
major consequences include the fact that forests are vanishing at 
the rate of 17 million hectares per year; six million hectares of 
productive dry land are turning into desert every year; 140 plant 
and animal species become extinct every day; and air and water 
quality on a global scale is declining at an equally alarming rate.
<P>
	The problem of inadequate distribution systems or ecometric 
considerations such as the need to maintain price of excess 
commodities exacerbates our environmental problems in a global 
context.
<P>
	The bottom line of all of this is that the combined impacts of 
pollution and these other pressures I have mentioned cause 
environmental capacity limits to be exceeded locally, regionally 
and globally. It is now clear that without some major shift in 
policies and practices a continuation of these trends is simply 
ecologically unsustainable.
<P>
	That is why in the red book the Prime Minister supported the 
development of renewable energy and initiatives which limit 
pollution.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To this end, the government has launched a variety of programs, 
including the national bio-ethanol program. Announced last 
December, this program will support the development of ethanol 
production through a refundable line of credit to qualified 
candidates who want to establish bio-ethanol fuel production plants 
in Canada. Managed by the Farm Credit Corporation, the program 
will guarantee up to $70 million in loans between 1999 and 2005.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In other words the government will only assist renewable energy 
companies which first invest their own capital and their own 
strength. There will be no subsidies, no megaprojects. The 
government will only provide assistance once the private sector has 
invested its own capital for a period of five years. This is a fiscally  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14854"> 14854 </A></B>
<P>
responsible way to help turn wood chips, straw, grain and other 
biomass derived waste into energy which can be used to fuel our 
vehicles.
<P>
	Properly blended ethanol gasoline can reduce carbon monoxide 
emissions which degrade urban air quality. It can reduce carbon 
dioxide emissions which are a primary source of greenhouse gases. 
It can reduce benzene emissions, a substance declared toxic under 
CEPA, into the atmosphere.
<P>
	The program is targeted to encourage ethanol production in 
every region of the country. This is a sound example of the concept 
of sustainable development. We can deal with an environmental 
problem and create jobs at the same time.
<P>
	Our standards for the exhaust coming out of the tailpipes of our 
cars and trucks are among the most stringent in the world. These 
standards set strict limits for nitrogen oxides which contribute to 
acid rain and are key components in the formation of smog. The 
government has also set limits on the amounts of hydrocarbons, 
another major contributor to smog, that cars can emit as well as 
limits on carbon monoxide.
<P>
	Although pollution from cars and trucks has diminished-they 
do pollute much less than in the past-the number of vehicles has 
increased significantly. As a consequence they represent an 
important source of air pollution in Canada: 60 per cent of carbon 
monoxide emissions; 35 per cent of other oxide emissions; 25 per 
cent of hydrocarbon emissions; and 20 per cent of carbon dioxide 
emissions. These are all attributable to automobile tailpipes.
<P>
	As a result the federal government is following a strategy for the 
control of motor vehicle emissions. It includes the adoption of 
more severe depollution standards for vehicles and requires 
advanced emission control technologies such as improved 
integrated diagnostic systems.
<P>
	There remains an obstacle to the introduction in Canada of the 
next generation of emission control technologies which is the 
continued presence of MMT, an octane enhancer that is presently 
used in unleaded gasoline. Bill C-94 very clearly calls for a ban on 
the import and interprovincial trade of MMT which is not 
manufactured in Canada but imported from the United States. In 
Canada the use of MMT as an octane enhancer is allowed in 
unleaded gasoline up to a maximum of 18 milligrams of 
manganese per litre. In the United States the use of MMT in 
unleaded gasoline has not been allowed since 1978.
<P>
	The automobile industry is convinced that MMT adversely 
affects the operation of these advanced emissions control 
technologies. All the domestic manufacturers and automobile 
importers agree that MMT adversely affects their sophisticated 
onboard diagnostic systems.
<P>
	It is clear that reducing automobile pollution demands combined 
action on two fronts: on the one hand improving technology to 
control automobile emissions such as integrated diagnostic 
systems and on the other hand improvements in the composition 
and the properties of the fuels which motors use.
<P>
	This bill is about the health of the environment. It is about the 
health of Canadians. It is also about the sound management of 
government. Canadians, whether they live in Quebec, British 
Columbia, the Yukon or New Brunswick deserve a federal 
government that projects their common interests, a government 
that can rapidly act for the benefit of all.
<P>
	To echo what the Deputy Prime Minister said, we can wait no 
longer; we must act now. Any further delay will pose a serious 
threat to federal emissions control programs.
<P>
<B>(1040 )</B>
<P>
	In conclusion, this bill works for consumers, it works for 
business and it works for the environment. For those reasons I ask 
all colleagues to join me in supporting it.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, the amendment proposed is 
receivable. The debate is now on the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak in support of the amendment to hoist the bill for a six-month 
period simply because there is pending in the U.S. a ruling by the 
appeal court whether or not to allow the use of MMT in the United 
States after an 18-year absence.
<P>
	A member opposite this morning and the Minister of Industry 
some time ago spoke about the urgency of uniformity in gasoline 
blends in the North American market. The member this morning 
spoke of how unacceptable it would be to have one standard in the 
U.S. and a different standard in Canada for automobile emissions, 
gasolines, warranties and so on. I agree with that.
<P>
	In the interests of achieving uniformity in the North American 
market we should wait until the ruling comes down in the United 
States. Industry analysts tell me that the likelihood of a positive 
ruling which would allow MMT to return to the United States is in 
the neighbourhood of 70 per cent. It seems unacceptable to me that 
Canada would move to ban MMT two months before it is again 
accepted for use in the United States.
<P>
	We have heard a lot of rhetoric on both sides of the argument. 
The previous speaker said that the bill is about the environment and 
air quality in Canada. He also said that the bill is about the health of 
Canadians. That is rubbish. The bill is about whether MMT affects 
the onboard diagnostic systems in new vehicles in Canada and the 
United States. The claims that it affects the environment and the 
health of Canadians have been proven not to be true without

<P>
question both here and in the U.S. Those issues are simply red 
herrings.
<P>
	The matter of the onboard diagnostic computer systems is 
another issue. It is a fact that in the U.S. onboard diagnostic 
systems have been failing and are unreliable. The technology has 
not been developed to the point where it is reliable. In fact the EPA 
in the United States had to lower the standards for certification of 
automobile diagnostic systems simply because the technology 
could not meet the required standards. That is the problem. It is not 
MMT.
<P>
	In the United States the issue has been studied to death and it has 
been proven that MMT is not the villain. The technology simply is 
not developed to the point where it can be reliable. We have to 
focus on the issue rather than going off on tangents on the side.
<P>
	Ethanol is another example. We hear time and time again that it 
is a product which is available to replace MMT and that it will 
produce cleaner air. Again it is hogwash. People from the refineries 
tell me that ethanol is not a substitute for MMT. It will not replace 
MMT when MMT is banned. Gasolines will simply be further 
refined to reach the octane rating that can now be obtained with 
MMT. Further refining will cause higher pollution and higher costs 
both for the consumer and for the refining industry.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	Let us keep the debate where it belongs. What is taking place 
here, as far as I can see at least, is a payback for those who 
supported the Liberal Party's return to power after nine years in 
purgatory.
<P>
	The facts that have been brought out in the debate on the MMT 
issue simply do not support the action the government is taking. 
The only reliable reason I can see for the government to push this 
matter, in spite of all the evidence before it, is simply that it is 
responding to the masters who supported that political party and its 
subsequent election to the Government of Canada.
<P>
	Let us keep it in perspective but let us also, for once in the 
House, make a decision based on reasonable evidence and on what 
is good for the Canadian taxpayer and the Canadian consumer. Let 
us look at the facts, judge the facts and make a decision based on 
them instead of make a decision based on what is politically good.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to stand to speak at second reading of Bill C-94, the 
Manganese based Fuel Additives Act, the legislation designed to 
take MMT out of unleaded fuels.
<P>
	If the federal government is given an opportunity to protect jobs, 
protect the environment, protect consumers and keep Canada on 
the leading edge of automotive technology all at the same time, 
should it take that  opportunity? I would say that it should. The 
government will seize a chance to support technology which will 
help us improve fuel economy and meet our climate change 
objectives. We will do what we can to reduce air pollution and 
smog.
<P>
	That is why we are taking action to remove MMT from Canadian 
unleaded gasoline. That is why I am proud to speak on the 
legislation today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This bill will prohibit interprovincial trade in and importation of 
MMT, a manganese based fuel additive made in the U.S. The 
proposed bill will come into effect 60 days after receiving royal 
assent. Canada is the only country in the world where MMT is used 
in unleaded gas. The U.S. banned it from their unleaded fuels in 
1978. Bulgaria and Argentina are the only two other countries still 
showing some interest in its use.
<P>
	Why is MMT not used by more countries? Because it hinders the 
operation of anti-pollution devices found in today's cars and trucks.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Environment Canada has received and reviewed study after 
study after study of the effects of MMT on onboard automobile 
equipment. I agree with the Minister of the Environment and with 
Ford, Chrysler, General Motors, Toyota, Honda, Subaru, Nissan, 
Mazda, Mercedes, BMW, Volkswagen and Volvo.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I believe 
we are debating a Reform motion to hoist the bill until we get a 
ruling from the U.S. court of appeal. The member opposite seems 
to be debating the bill on second reading. It is our motion that is 
being debated here.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is very little restriction on what one 
might say in reply to the question of hoisting the bill for six 
months. I do not believe that is a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand the point of the member 
opposite. In fact to show that the legislation is worth while is to 
debate the amendment Reform members have put.
<P>
	I was just saying that these various corporations support the 
legislation and the evidence we are putting forward. Then there is 
Lada, Jaguar, Land Rover and Hyundai. They all say that MMT 
adversely affects the sophisticated onboard diagnostic systems 
where the pollution control equipment of automobiles is found.
<P>
	These systems are extremely important for the environment. 
They are responsible for monitoring the vehicle's emission controls 
and for alerting the driver to malfunctions. They ensure the cleaner 
burning of the engines of today and tomorrow. They ensure that  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14856"> 14856 </A></B>
<P>
automobiles are properly maintained, resulting in decreased 
tailpipe emissions and improved fuel economy.
<P>
	In short, these important onboard systems are the basis of 
anti-pollution control measures across the continent and of reduced 
fuel consumption in our vehicles. Therefore this onboard 
technology is very important technology. It is extremely important 
once it is installed that it works, that it does its job. The legislation 
is designed to make sure that technology works effectively.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, this government will not allow MMT to prevent the 
Canadian automotive industry from designing vehicles that do not 
pollute nearly as much. Canada's environment and Canadian 
consumers have the right to enjoy the best anti-pollution devices.
<P>
	The federal government has been waiting since 1985 for the 
automotive and oil industries to address this situation on their own. 
Last October, it urged the two industries to resolve this issue 
between themselves before the end of 1994; otherwise, the 
government would be forced to intervene. The two industries, 
however, did not succeed in solving the problem.
<P>
	We then pushed back the deadline to February 1995. Again, the 
problem was not solved. Well, we have been waiting long enough. 
The time has come for the government to take action.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If we do not act now, the federal government's vehicle emission 
reduction programs will be in jeopardy. We will risk missing out on 
major reductions in smog, carbon monoxide and hydro carbons.
<P>
	If we do not act now, Canadian consumers will be prevented 
from taking advantage of state of the art emission reduction 
technologies simply because they do not have access to MMT-free 
gasoline.
<P>
	If we do not act now, we could face the situation where 
automakers will be forced to turn off the onboard diagnostic 
systems scheduled for 1996 models because of the damage MMT 
causes. General Motors is already bringing models off the 
assembly line with some of the onboard diagnostic functions 
disconnected. General Motors, like the others, is no longer 
prepared to assume the increased warranty risks for damage caused 
to anti-pollution equipment. As we have said, MMT damages this 
delicate, expensive and very important onboard equipment.
<P>
	In the end it is the Canadian motorist who will have to pay more 
to have his or her car maintained because of this kind of industry 
action. We will not let this happen. We will not allow the buck to be 
passed to the Canadian consumer. We will not allow anti-pollution 
equipment in Canada to be less effective than anti-pollution 
equipment in the United States.
<P>
	We will not allow the competitiveness of our auto industry to be 
threatened. We will not allow investment and the thousands of 
Canadian jobs which depend on that investment to be put in 
jeopardy.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Resolving the MMT problem will have positive environmental 
effects through the use of the most sophisticated emission control 
technologies. This will also give Canadians the same guarantee as 
that enjoyed by U.S. car owners and ensure that Canadian vehicle 
emission control programs are in line with U.S. programs.
<P>
	This means that Canadians will continue to enjoy the economic 
and technological benefits of an harmonized North American car 
pool. It also means that the Canadian automotive industry will 
remain competitive.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let us be clear. The job of reducing motor vehicle pollution can 
no longer be addressed by just the auto industry or by just the 
petroleum industry or the government. Progress at reducing vehicle 
pollution demands action by all.
<P>
	The petroleum industry needs to keep making improvements in 
the composition and properties of the fuels the engines burn. The 
auto industry needs to keep making improvements in vehicle 
emission control technologies such as those offered through 
onboard diagnostic systems.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As for the government, it must act to reduce automobile air 
pollution. This is what we are doing with Bill C-94. We are taking 
action by putting in place a global vehicle emission control strategy 
including the adoption of tougher standards for exhaust systems.
<P>
	To meet these standards, we are relying on state of the art 
emission control technologies and on the types of fuel they require. 
We need new anti-emission technologies such as onboard 
diagnostic systems to help us reduce smog as well as carbon 
monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions. We must reduce this kind of 
emissions, which have a major effect on urban air quality and 
contribute to the greenhouse effect.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Preventive action means producing goods more cleanly. It means 
using less energy and conserving our natural resources. It means 
developing and using the latest green technologies like the 
emission reduction technologies in today's cars and trucks.
<P>
	The bill before the House is one important measure of 
prevention. The bill is pro-environment, pro-consumer and 
pro-business. Eighteen of Canada's automobile companies think 
that what we are doing is right.  Canadians think that what we are 
doing is right. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14857"> 14857 </A></B>
<P>
MMT can no longer stand in the way of the progress we continue to 
make in emission controls.
<P>
	Let us protect jobs. Let us protect the environment. Let us vote 
for the legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
interesting to enter the debate about what is called a six-month 
hoist. The motion reads: ``That this bill not be read a second time 
but that it be read a second time this day six months hence''. The 
reason that our party would propose a motion like that is that we 
have serious questions about the suitability or the legitimacy of the 
government's argument for banning MMT.
<P>
	There is some requirement to go through briefly some of the 
arguments or non-arguments on the government side about why 
MMT should be banned. Its first argument is that MMT is a health 
risk and that is why the environment minister is dealing with it. Or, 
should it have been the health minister? Regardless, the 
environment minister brought it in because of the so-called 
tremendous health risk.
<P>
<B>(1100 )</B>
<P>
	When I look through the documents I see a study performed by 
Health Canada, not the minister's own department. It carried out 
the risk assessment for the combustion products of MMT in 
gasoline. This study showed MMT poses no health risk to 
Canadians. The report stated: ``All analyses indicate that the 
combustion products of MMT in gasoline do not represent an 
added health risk to the Canadian population''.
<P>
	We are not talking about health. Health has nothing to do with 
this ban, which is why the health minister cannot ban it legally. The 
environment minister cannot ban it. All she can do is prevent the 
importation and interprovincial trade of MMT. If the people who 
make MMT wanted to set up a separate plant in each province we 
could continue to have MMT and there would be virtually nothing 
the minister could do about it. There is no scientific or medical 
reason MMT should not be allowed.
<P>
	They say MMT is bad for the onboard diagnostic systems of 
1996 automobiles. It is interesting the minister has not 
commissioned a study to prove that. The studies she quotes at 
length are by different automobile manufacturers. Interestingly 
enough, when she was speaking the other day she quoted at length 
study after study that claim MMT is harmful to onboard 
diagnostics.
<P>
	We asked her to table those reports in the House. Many of us 
would be interested to see how those tests were conducted, whether 
they were done scientifically and objectively, whether they started 
off with a premise and tried to prove it or what the case was. The 
environment minister would not table one of those reports in the 
House.
<P>
	Time and again members of the government side say all these 
tests prove the case for MMT being bad for onboard diagnostics but 
they will not table any of the proof. They are corporate secrets and 
the government cannot do it. I guess they would be corporate 
secrets to people who are part of the automobile association. 
Naturally they are out to prove their case and naturally they do not 
want that information in the public domain. At least the 
government has yet to table that information for us.
<P>
	The other report we have access to is from the Environmental 
Protection Agency in the United States, hardly a lapdog of any 
particular industry. It decided from its own studies that MMT does 
not harm onboard diagnostic systems. An independent study 
indicates there appears to be no harm done to the computers. That 
is the only one we have access to because the minister will not table 
anything else.
<P>
	To summarize, there is no health risk and there is no proof, at 
least none tabled, that the onboard diagnostics are harmed. The 
first two reasons are debunked.
<P>
	The third thing the government is prone to talk about is that it is 
necessary in order to improve the environment. I heard more 
nonsense in the last debate on this. As if it is restating the obvious, 
``I love the environment. I love clean air. Clean water is great. 
Green space is lovely. Biodiversity is good. Apples pie is 
wonderful and motherhood is okay''. Where do we stop? Those are 
all obvious statements.
<P>
	Removing MMT from gasoline will increase noxious emissions 
from automobiles. That is one of the reasons MMT is in unleaded 
fuel now. Removing it will have the effect of increasing the auto 
emissions that create ground level ozone by up to 20 per cent, 
which is not insignificant. As far as using ethanol as a substitute for 
MMT, if it can be produced and sold without subsidy as Mohawk 
already does, that is good. However, if we cannot prove 
scientifically what is wrong with MMT then the decision to ban it 
is wrong.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	The other day I mentioned another title for the Minister of the 
Environment should perhaps be the minister of gas because of the 
gas fumes and the increase in those fumes because of the banning 
of MMT.
<P>
	I read an article entitled: ``Sheila Copps: Minister of Smog'' in 
the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, not exactly a fly by night outfit. The author, 
Terence Corcoran, goes through the argument about what is 
happening. He asks why the minister is pushing this now. Why can 
she not wait the six months that we have asked which would give us 
time to do either an independent study by the National Research 
Council, more studies and rulings by the United States for this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14858"> 14858 </A></B>
<P>
common market in gasoline and more time to study it in committee 
if require? A six-month hoist is not the end of the world.
<P>
	The author states: ``The sole purpose of the legislation, which is 
being forced through the Liberal legislative sausage machine, is to 
remove a gasoline additive''. He wonders why when the main 
benefit will be to increase ground level ozone by up to 20 per cent. 
Why would the minister do this?
<P>
	This article says what I have already said, that there is no 
scientific independent study that shows why. There is no health 
risk. Whey would they do that? It further states: ``Enter the auto 
giants. For reasons of their own, they have mounted a campaign 
against MMT because they cannot meet the emissions control 
standards set out for the 1996 model year''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> They cannot make it in the United States either.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> My hon. colleague mentions they cannot make it in 
the United States where MMT is already banned. However, still 
they enter into the fray and say MMT must be banned.
<P>
	The article continues: ``Not much else is happening within the 
environment department apart from downsizing, leaving the MMT 
ban as the high point of Ms. Copps' reign as minister''. This is it. 
We are seeing the high point of the environmental agenda for 1995. 
This is as good as it gets. We cannot do the <I>Irving Whale</I>. We 
cannot do anything of substance so we will get on the MMT 
bandwagon.
<P>
	The conclusion of the article states MMT might be approved in 
the United States later this year. My hon. colleague from Athabasca 
mentioned it is now 70 per cent likely that this will occur. The 
article reads: ``Ms. Copps' ban could become a major 
embarrassment. It will be even more of an embarrassment if she 
goes down in history as the environment minister who introduced 
legislation that increased ground level ozone layers''.
<P>
	What is happening here? What is the motivation here? I walked 
to work this morning with a member from the government side. I 
mentioned that in opposition certain members seem to rise to a 
level of rhetorical flights of fancy, kind of a high octane, wild 
spree. However when they get on the government side they become 
a tremendous disappointment. They do not seem to have a handle 
on their portfolio. They do not seem to take initiatives. They do not 
seem to have the gumption to step forward and be bold in their 
initiatives. Near as I can tell that is what has happened.
<P>
	We have had nothing of substance from the environment 
minister. The few things she has ventured into she has blundered 
into rather than gone through them on a scientific basis. She seems 
to be intent on somehow raising her profile, which has been 
pitifully low. If we waited six months our arguments would be 
proved out. If not, she could reintroduce it at that time.
<P>
	I certainly concur with this motion and ask that the government 
wait six months so we can have a proper scientific study.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleague from Kootenay West-Revelstoke 
for moving the motion to suspend this legislation for six months.
<P>
	It would be a rather smart move on the government's part to put 
this bill on the side and allow an independent tester to see if MMT 
is really hazardous to these onboard diagnostic systems in 1996 
automobiles. So far there is no conclusive evidence or data that 
MMT ruins the idiot lights on the dashboards of cars.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	We have debated the bill for some time now. I think the bill was 
first debated on June 19, 1995. I have heard all the discussion from 
both sides of the House and we still come to the same conclusion. It 
is not clear that MMT is hazardous to our health, our air or 
automobiles.
<P>
	In the debate last week the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell stated: ``The product in question 
has been known to have effects which are offensive to the health of 
people''. The member presents the broken ideology of the entire 
Liberal Party: make a statement, substantiated or not, so long as it 
scares people into thinking it is right. In this case the member was 
making an inaccurate statement. I guess he has not read his own 
government's reports and is simply shooting from the hip.
<P>
	Canadians have a right to hear the truth and have government 
pronouncements backed up by real data. In the December 6, 1994 
Health Canada report ``Risk Assessment for the Combustive 
Products of MMT'', all analysis indicate the combustive products 
of MMT in gasoline do not represent an added health risk to the 
Canadian population.
<P>
	The member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell cannot dispute a 
study of his own government. What the member does not realize is 
that if MMT were so hazardous to the health of Canadians his 
colleague, the Minister of the Environment, could have easily 
added it to the schedule under the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act. She cannot and so she has gone through the back 
door only to find a few snags along the way. These snags are raising 
questions from some within her own party and yet she refuses to 
listen.
<P>
	The Minister of Natural Resources has strong reservations which 
the environment minister is ignoring. Why? The Minister of the 
Environment is being pressured by auto manufacturers who have 
told her that if the product is not banned maybe they will close 
some plants and maybe lay off some workers. Instead of listening 
to reason, the minister went ahead and proceeded with the bill 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14859"> 14859 </A></B>
<P>
banning the trade of this  substance so it would not be 
uneconomical to use in Canada.
<P>
	There seems to be considerable concern about what type of 
replacement for MMT will adequately address the increase in NOx 
emissions. We know ethanol will not reduce NOx very much. We 
know MTBE is a very expensive alternative, especially for the 
refineries.
<P>
	Another major concern I have heard from those who have an 
interest in the legislation concerns the main rationale for the bill. 
What is it? The minister has told us the MVMA has evidence to 
prove MMT causes failures in its onboard diagnostic systems. 
However, it has not elected to make that research public in order for 
third party independent groups to evaluate it.
<P>
	The minister has stood in the House on several occasions and 
listed every car manufacturer under the sun and said they have all 
done studies which prove without a doubt that MMT is hazardous 
to OBDs. Several members of the Reform Party have asked her for 
those studies but she refuses to table them in the House.
<P>
	The minister knows these studies do not exist and she carries on 
as if they do. What a shame the country has an environment 
minister who is perhaps full of steam or vapour.
<P>
	I understand General Motors is currently conducting a testing 
program to evaluate the effects of MMT on OBD systems. Why is 
GM initiating a test again when the minister claims it has already 
done a conclusive test? Clearly there are some inconsistencies. It is 
time the minister set the record straight.
<P>
	On several occasions the Minister of the Environment has gone 
on that the United States has banned MMT since 1978 and that 
Canada is simply following suit. In 1978 the Environmental 
Protection Agency did not approve MMT because of its view that it 
might affect the health of Americans. However, the EPA's research 
was reviewed by the U.S. court of appeals and based on the 
findings the EPA was instructed to grant the manufacturers of 
MMT a waiver which will allow the reintroduction of MMT into 
the American market.
<P>
	The minister might have egg on her face if she goes through with 
the bill at this time while a reversal is being made in the United 
States. At that time will the minister want to conduct further 
studies in Canada? She may even ask for an independent test to be 
done. We have been asking for that. This would not be the first time 
the minister has completed a 180 degree turnabout.
<P>
	This past summer off the coast of P.E.I. the government had 
plans to raise the <I>Irving Whale</I> oil barge, sunk for over two 
decades. Despite the presence of the PCBs on board the vessel the 
minister went ahead. I questioned the minister in the House on that 
one and she reassured Canadians that all appropriate testing had 
been done and that the Canadian Coast Guard was more than 
prepared to make it a safe lift. The lift did not occur  due to bad 
weather and was therefore scratched for this year. As a result there 
was a court that was convinced there had been inadequate study of 
the considerations of the PCB factor. The result was an injunction 
against the action of raising the barge. We have now discovered 
that the minister wants to undergo further testing on the presence of 
PCBs on board the <I>Irving Whale</I>.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	I am discussing a pattern of the minister, ministerial 
responsibility, accountability. First she tells Canadians that 
everything is a go and there is no hazard at all. Then she says they 
must do more testing. The minister does not seem to be able to 
make up her mind. The same is going to happen if the United States 
lifts the ban on MMT later this year. Will the minister organize 
independent testing then? Perhaps she will be forced to.
<P>
	The minister has a chance to save face and vote in favour of the 
motion that was moved. If she waits for six months she will have 
the opportunity to see what the U.S. courts will instruct. However, 
if Bill C-94 passes and the U.S. courts reverse the decision 
forbidding MMT to be sold again, the minister will have to bring 
forward another bill that would reverse Bill C-94. This would not 
only be an added cost to the taxpayer but it would also be a travesty 
of our parliamentary system.
<P>
	Does the Minister of the Environment want to really make the 
taxpayers dig into their pocketbooks just because she is pressured 
by her political supporters? What about this pressure? The MVMA 
threatened that if the government does not ban MMT it will void 
the warranties. In a copy of the fuel section of the owner's manual 
of for example the 1996 Buick Regal, it bears no mention of a lack 
of warranty coverage.
<P>
	General Motors certainly knows how to disclaim warranty 
responsibility since the 1996 owner's manual contains a disclaimer 
regarding the use of methanol in the vehicle. The manual goes on to 
state that the service light on the instrument panel may turn on with 
the use of certain fuels, not in Canada and the United States, but 
elsewhere because of a lack of grade of refining. If this occurs the 
owner should simply contact the retailer for service. What it means 
is they would want to clean the sensor. This certainly does not 
disclaim warranty responsibility so those threats that were 
mentioned in this House do not bear fruit.
<P>
	If the auto industry has not carried through on its threat to void 
warranties in instances where MMT is used in gasoline, then why is 
the government trying to rush this legislation through the House? 
This bill has been political from the outset. It is the responsibility 
of the Ministry of the Environment to do what is best for the 
country and our environment and not what is best politically. The 
minister is becoming Canada's best non-environmental minister 
and this in itself is hazardous to the health of Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14860"> 14860 </A></B>
<P>
	We should reflect on the gamesmanship and the deal making 
related to this bill. It is becoming another instance where the 
government's political concerns in its own mistaken view have 
taken precedence over what is good for the country. This bill has 
nothing to do with helping the environment. In fact, it is said that 
the result is equivalent to adding thousands of cars immediately 
to the exhaust load of the air if this bill is passed. It is not good 
for Canada that we rush into banning trade in a commodity which 
could very shortly be used in the United States.
<P>
	I was sitting here listening to the member for Peterborough who 
claims that the banning of MMT will save jobs. The MVMA 
threatened the environment minister to ban MMT or else workers 
would be laid off. The minister has denied that the MVMA 
threatened her with this. Now the member across the way has 
admitted that jobs might be lost, or at least that was the threat 
anyway and he is peddling this as an argument. We now have an 
admission that contradicts the minister.
<P>
	I say this is all scare tactics and puffery in the absence of 
scientific evidence. What seems the most appropriate course in this 
instance is to use our motion, the six month hoist, so that we will 
have sufficient time to review all the scientific evidence and make 
a fair and considered evaluation of the rationale for Bill C-94.

	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-98, an act respecting the oceans of Canada, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to lead off the second reading 
debate of the oceans act. We on this side of the House believe that 
with the introduction of this legislation today we are coming to the 
successful conclusion of a long and at times dramatic chapter in 
Canada's maritime history. With this legislation we are at the 
beginning of a new and even more vital chapter in that history.
<P>
	The oceans act will define for Canada-and for many Canadians 
this will come as a surprise-for the first time in legislation, an 
exclusive economic zone covering almost five million square 
kilometres of the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic oceans. With the 
passage of the oceans act, Canada will effectively increase the area 
over which we in Parliament have jurisdiction by nearly one-half, 
as the area covered by Canadian law will increase quite 
dramatically.
<P>
	Today Canada has the world's largest coastline measuring nearly 
244,000 kilometres. Much of it of course is formed by islands in 
the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic oceans, as I have said. The Great 
Lakes coastlines add another 9,500 kilometres.
<P>
	With the passage of this bill we should think of Canada and the 
area over which it has jurisdiction as not just encompassing the 
prairies, not just encompassing the coastline of the great province 
of British Columbia, our north and northern territories, east and 
west, the great provinces of Ontario and Quebec, and of course 
Atlantic Canada including Newfoundland. We need to think as well 
about that tremendous area covered by Canada's three oceans and 
notwithstanding recent problems, the tremendous wealth 
represented by both the living and non-living resources of the 
oceans.
<P>
	As Canadians we have worked diligently over many years to 
stake our claim and to establish our rights to control our ocean 
areas. With this bill that struggle which has been undertaken by 
successive generations of Canadians and by successive 
governments of every political stripe is finally coming to an end.
<P>
	The oceans act expands our notion of Canada as a country. The 
oceans management strategy increases the priority that we place as 
a society upon the wise development of our ocean waters. The bill 
before Parliament will put in place the means for the government to 
exercise Canada's new ocean responsibilities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14861"> 14861 </A></B>
<P>
	The oceans act will give our country the framework for building 
a new oceans management strategy. Canadians will have to work 
very hard together to ensure that we achieve the economic 
opportunities while at the same time sustaining the environment 
and the living resources of our oceans. Over the years but in 
particular in the last two years since the election of this 
government, we have successfully asserted our rights. Now we 
have to assume our obligations.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	Canada's ocean heritage stretches back to the very opening up of 
our nation. The oceans enabled our ancestors, explorers and 
pioneers to establish the basis of modern Canada. The roots of 
Canada lie in aboriginal peoples finding their sustenance in the 
Arctic ice and waters and the waters off both coasts and the 
courageous crossings over the Atlantic Ocean by John Cabot in 
1497, nearly 500 years ago.
<P>
	Coming first to the teeming waters off the new found land Cabot 
encountered not silver, gold, oil, minerals or other kinds of 
resources that captured his imagination. Rather he encountered 
teeming waters full of groundfish, a multiplicity of species, all of 
which gave rise to the drive to colonize, to capture the new found 
land, the new continent.
<P>
	Of course Cabot was followed by Cartier in 1534 and Champlain 
in 1603, together building the new land. For generation upon 
generation immigrants came to Canada, wave literally upon wave, 
building this country. With the oceans act today we salute the 
historic voyages of Cabot, Cartier and Champlain. We continue 
with confidence their work and their vision when they founded this 
new land.
<P>
	Canada's commerce was founded on ocean trading. Ocean 
transport, communications, fishing, tourism and recreation have 
helped forge our national identity. The oceans are as much a part of 
Canada's soul, how we see ourselves, how we define ourselves, as 
are the Rockies, the prairies and the Canadian shield.
<P>
	Canadians have always cared deeply and passionately about our 
oceans. For the past few decades that passion has been directed 
toward securing international recognition of Canada's jurisdiction 
over those waters and their resources. Canadians have been of one 
voice in pushing for strong international binding agreement on 
ocean management rules. We have been of one mind as a nation 
when we have had to be in taking direct measures and yes, 
sometimes bold measures, sometimes unprecedented and unilateral 
measures to assert jurisdiction to protect our ocean resources and 
the marine environment upon which they depend.
<P>
	In 1958 Canada took a leadership position at the first United 
Nations conference on the oceans. Since 1967, our centennial year, 
Canadians have spearheaded  discussions which led after many 
years to a UN convention on the law of the sea.
<P>
	Of course Canada again was in the forefront over the last several 
years at the UN convention on highly migratory species and 
straddling stocks which concluded last August 4 in New York with 
a new binding convention. Members of this House from all parties 
participated in that process. Members of this House from all parties 
worked together united in building and protecting those ocean 
resources, not only for this generation, not only for Canadians but 
for citizens of the world.
<P>
	The kind of influence that we in Canada, a middle power, 
exercised was only possible because we were able to go to the 
United Nations and speak with one united voice. We were able to 
speak with a vision that was greater than the concerns as measured 
or identified by our own backyards.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	That is why we were successful. That is why Canadians in every 
province today, without exception, can take pride in the work 
successive governments have done and in the successes we have 
achieved by working together.
<P>
	Over the years we have sometimes been confronted with 
challenges to our jurisdiction and challenges to our determination. 
Members may recall that in 1969 the U.S. owned <I>Manhattan</I> sailed 
through Canada's Northwest Passage without prior approval from 
Canada. There was a tremendous public response. That is the polite 
way of putting it. That response led to speedy passage of the Arctic 
Waters Pollution Prevention Act.
<P>
	I recall the minister of the day who had the responsibility of 
shepherding that act, the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act, 
was none other than the current Prime Minister of Canada. It was 
an act by which Canada extended out to 100 miles its jurisdiction, 
its responsibility, and made clear its authority to manage the 
important and fragile Arctic waters. It was the present Prime 
Minister who presented that bill to Parliament. It was a bill that was 
supported by members on every side of the House.
<P>
	In 1970 Canada declared a 12-mile nautical territorial sea. On 
January 1, 1977 we declared a 200-nautical mile fishing zone. I am 
pleased to note that it was the minister of foreign affairs of the day 
who had a very large hand in seeing Canada make progress in this 
regard, the hon. Don Jamieson, member of Parliament for then 
Burin-St. George's in Newfoundland. He was, I will not say 
assisted, in full partnership with the current Governor General of 
Canada, the Hon. Romeo Leblanc, who was then Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans. These two gentlemen stood side by side and 
with the co-operation of all the members of the House and 
Canadians everywhere claimed Canada's 200-mile fishing zone.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14862"> 14862 </A></B>
<P>
	I should note that it was only last year that members of this 
place in every party of Parliament-the Conservative Party, the 
New Democratic Party, the Reform Party, the Bloc Quebecois 
together with the Liberal Party-gave unprecedented and speedy 
full passage within two sitting days in both Chambers to Bill C-29, 
an act to amend the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act.
<P>
	It was that legislation which enabled Canada to take action to 
protect important fish stocks on the high seas that straddle 
Canada's 200-mile limit. It was clear that the national interest was 
at stake. When the needs and the interests of those who live in 
coastal Canada beyond the reaches of most of us, beyond the 
experience of most of us, beyond the direct knowledge of most of 
us, are confronted with the notion that straddling stocks which 
sustained hundreds of communities for 500 years were being 
decimated, and we were concerned with flag of convenience 
vessels, Parliament was able to respond. It was able to rise to the 
challenge and Canada, because its focus was clear, because its 
cause was just and because its sense of nationhood was strong, was 
able to respond. We passed Bill C-29 and we literally moved the 
flag of convenience vessels off our continental shelf. We protected 
those resources for Canadians and for the world.
<P>
	The oceans act is the final major piece of legislation to make All 
these efforts over so many years by Canada and by Canadians 
complete and worth while. The act will formally establish Canada's 
jurisdiction as a coastal state over its ocean areas and over our 
resources.
<P>
	The legislation before Parliament is completely compatible with 
the law of the sea convention and with new global rules on the 
management of ocean resources and the marine environment.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	This bill defines our national maritime zones as consisting of 
Canada's internal waters, the territorial sea, the contiguous zone, 
the exclusive economic zone and Canada's continental shelf.
<P>
	The legislation incorporates all relevant existing law that Canada 
has, covering our full rights and jurisdiction over internal waters; 
our fishing zones off the Atlantic, the Pacific and the Arctic, 
including the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Bay of Fundy, Queen 
Charlotte Sound and Dixon Entrance; and our rights with respect to 
the continental shelf. Canada has rights to living organisms 
belonging to sedentary species in or on the shelf and jurisdiction 
over the exploration and exploitation of minerals and non-living 
resources of the seabed and subsoil.
<P>
	Last summer, under the provisions of the law of the sea, Canada 
claimed jurisdiction to manage Icelandic scallops that reside 
beyond the 200-mile zone and not within it. Some American 
fishing vessels decided to fish those scallops. Canada asserted 
clearly, strongly and  unequivocally our right under the appropriate 
sections of the law of the sea to manage those species. Under the 
appropriate provisions of the law of the sea sedentary species 
which extend on the continental shelf are to be managed by the 
coastal state.
<P>
	Such a claim has never been made anywhere else in the world 
before. We made it last summer. It led to a period of disagreement 
with our good neighbour and friend, the United States. At one point 
some direct action was taken to stop fishing activity. However 
some months later there was a recognition by the United States of 
Canada's jurisdiction over Icelandic scallop, even those scallop 
residing in waters beyond our own 200-mile limit but on our 
continental shelf. That was last summer.
<P>
	This summer we staked a claim to control distant water snow 
crab on the high seas, beyond our 200-mile limit. No country 
challenged that claim this year.
<P>
	For all these questions, the oceans act is a consolidation of 
current Canadian law. What is so crucial in the bill is the 
declaration of Canadian jurisdiction over the contiguous zone and 
the exclusive economic zone. Most Canadians will not be familiar 
with these technical terms, but many Canadians will have heard the 
phrases 12-mile zone and 200-mile zone.
<P>
	Canada's territorial sea extends from our coastline out to 12 
nautical miles. In the territorial sea Canada has full jurisdiction to 
ocean waters, to the seabed beneath those water and to the airspace 
above. This is existing law.
<P>
	The contiguous zone will extend an additional 12 nautical miles 
from the outer edge of the territorial sea. In this zone Canada will 
have the power to enforce our fiscal immigration, sanitary and 
customs laws. The exclusive economic zone, which we are 
declaring and prescribing for the first time in legislation today, will 
absorb the 200-mile fishing zone and cover all economic activity in 
the ocean area out to 200 nautical miles from the coastal baseline. 
In this zone Canada will have jurisdiction for exploring, exploiting, 
conserving and managing all the living and non-living resources of 
the waters, seabed and subsoil.
<P>
	Canada's jurisdiction in this zone will cover economic activity 
and will cover marine scientific research, protection and 
preservation of the marine environment and artificial islands, 
installations and all structures. The act will grant Canada powers 
that go well beyond the powers our country has asserted in the past. 
It puts in place a clear definition of jurisdiction fully supported by 
existing global agreements.
<P>
	Canadians should rightfully feel proud and satisfied this day has 
come. Canadians from every corner of the country and, as I have 
said, from every political persuasion, from every party and every 
walk of life, have at one time or another stood together for decade 
after decade to make this declaration of Canada's oceans 
jurisdiction a reality.
<P>
<B></B>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="14863"> 14863 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	For all the excellent co-operation that went into establishing 
oceans jurisdiction, the truth is that Canada's policies for actual 
management of our ocean areas over the years have been 
piecemeal, fragmented and scattered on occasion. The same spirit 
of partnership, co-ordination, co-operation and innovation that 
enabled Canada to gain authority over ocean resources must now 
be used to manage the same resources.
<P>
	The oceans act sets out a basic legislative framework to support 
a new Canadian oceans management strategy. The act provides the 
building blocks for integrated management and sustainable 
development of Canada's ocean resources. The act outlines a new 
ecosystems based approach to marine resource management. It 
provides a common focus for federal responsibilities and 
consolidates federal programs and authorities from as many as 14 
different departments under the jurisdiction and administration of 
one department. It endows Canadians with legislative tools to start 
working on oceans management holistically rather than sectorally.
<P>
	The need for sustainable development of resources was made 
crystal clear in the 1987 report of the World Commission on 
Environment and Development chaired by Norway's current prime 
minister, Prime Minister Brundtland.
<P>
	That same year, in 1987, the previous government, the 
Conservative government of the day, committed itself to the 
introduction of an oceans act. Unfortunately that commitment was 
not translated into action and no legislation was introduced.
<P>
	The government is acting. Last year the National Advisory 
Board on Science and Technology in Canada called for an oceans 
act equipped to address the needs of ocean frontier development for 
the present and, more important, for the future. The advisory board 
called Canada's ocean management policies ad hoc and at times 
haphazard. The board called for Canada to develop a proactive 
oceans policy that plans for the future rather than responds to the 
crisis of the day.
<P>
	As the present Prime Minister said at that time, ``far-sighted, 
prudent management of our oceans will provide us with a powerful 
tool for long term regional development from coast to coast in 
Canada''.
<P>
	In November 1994 I released a document setting out the 
potential elements of an ocean management strategy for Canada. 
The government then sought advice all across the country, from St. 
John's to Vancouver, from Inuvik to Quebec City. Certain things 
emerged early and were clear. The federal government does have a 
leadership role to play in oceans policy. There should be one 
federal department taking the lead in developing new strategy. 
People want to be involved locally in providing solutions to 
regional priorities. There is a need to sustain resources and to 
diversify ocean industries.
<P>
	All the advice from provinces, municipalities, coastal residents, 
fishermen, business, labour, environmentalists and scientists was 
heard loud and clear. The bill now sets out the elements of an 
oceans policy. However all Canadians must be involved in 
developing specific mechanisms, planning and management 
structures, and the guidelines and standards required to bring about 
sustainable use of oceans and their resources.
<P>
	In recognition of the need for an integrated approach to oceans 
management, the government announced the merger of the 
Canadian Coast Guard with the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans, which came into effect on April 1, 1995. The new 
organization will provide for a more co-ordinated approach to 
policy development and a strengthened operational focus. The new 
organization will comprise the principal civilian marine 
operational component of the Government of Canada. It is now 
constructed and consolidated into one of the largest marine fleets 
anywhere in the world today. As a consequence, we are able to be 
more cost effective, more cost efficient, we are able to ensure high 
national standards from coast to coast and be efficient in the 
provision of services.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	There are new and increasing challenges for boating safety, 
navigation, infrastructure, and under sea exploration. The Canadian 
Coast Guard provides, in conjunction with the Department of 
National Defence, the marine component of the federal search and 
rescue program, marine aids to navigation, icebreaking services, 
vessel traffic services, safety communications and the 
dissemination of information regarding marine weather, ice, and 
changes to navigational aids.
<P>
	The coast guard brings much in the addition of programs to the 
department of fisheries, programs that ensure the safety of human 
life at sea, the safe and economical movement of ships, and the 
protection of our marine environment. It makes sense to include 
these programs with the federal minister responsible for oceans and 
the protection of the fishery.
<P>
	Bringing together these two fleets and bringing together these 
two teams, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the coast 
guard, also gives us the ability to multi-task ships from both fleets 
and consolidate them and cross train them to ensure that people 
who heretofore were doing primarily coast guard duties are also 
available for enforcement duties on the fisheries side, and vice 
versa. It also ensures that the helicopters that were flying resupply 
missions to coast guard stations, to navigational aids, and to coast 
guard lights are also available for carrying out enforcement activity 
on behalf of the enforcement branch of DFO.
<P>
	We will consolidate regional offices, regional directors general, 
regional strategic locations into one combined, enlarged, and 
improved location to find efficiency but at the same time sustain a 
high level of services, which were  heretofore divided between two 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14864"> 14864 </A></B>
<P>
marine based departments. It is a common sense approach to 
dealing with the problem of the deficit that the government wants 
to undertake, not the hack and slash and burn advocated by some 
others, who believe that deficit reduction in itself, with no regard to 
the importance of providing basic services to Canadians, ought to 
be the goal of governing in the 1990s.
<P>
	The Canada oceans act will give the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans the legal authority to draw together all of Canada's ocean 
stakeholders to develop a strategy, as I said, based on sustainable 
development and integrated management. The act provides the 
authority to develop the actual mechanisms to implement new 
strategies. It gives the minister the ability to enter into new 
partnership arrangements in order to ensure that the oceans 
management strategy meets real regional needs and fulfils real 
regional aspirations.
<P>
	Every Canadian, I suspect without exception, is well aware of 
the extraordinary environmental stress placed upon our oceans. We 
all know too well and some of us too painfully about resource 
depletion, habitat degradation, and marine pollution. We know that 
if we destroy the ocean environment we cannot meet the social and 
economic goals of coastal Canadians.
<P>
	This act therefore provides the authority to create for the first 
time protected marine areas in order to safeguard ocean 
biodiversity and to safeguard endangered species. For the first time 
we have set out a legislative framework to declare certain of our 
ocean areas protected marine areas.
<P>
	While it is too early to say that the government has made a 
decision or I as Minister of Fisheries and Oceans have made a 
decision with respect to protected marine areas, I am much 
interested in the possibility of declaring protected zones as a means 
of ensuring conservation of endangered species. In other words, it 
is a management tool. If we want to take the precautionary 
approach in fisheries management, one way to do that is to set aside 
certain nursery zones, spawning areas, and to hold the areas to be 
off limits to any fishing activity to ensure that even as we conduct 
fisheries and even as we harvest what appear to be healthy stocks 
we give ourselves a measure of insurance by setting aside certain 
zones. The government will explore that and will seek advice from 
the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans in the weeks and 
months ahead.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	The act gives the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans the ability to 
carry out scientific marine research in support of the new strategy. I 
cannot overemphasize that this act is about building new 
partnerships among Canadians. That is what we will be seeking 
with all of the stakeholders in the oceans community and the 
scientific community in the weeks and months ahead. Indeed, that 
is what we are seeking in referring this bill now to the standing 
committee: advice, comment, questions, and yes, criticism where 
appropriate. We want the strongest possible bill that can be 
provided.
<P>
	I am counting on the members of the Standing Committee on 
Fisheries and Oceans, who have a long and distinguished record, 
both the current committee and its predecessors, for being the 
conscience and the voice of the oceans and of the living resources 
of the oceans, to bring forward a bill that is stronger than the one I 
put before the House today. I am confident that Chairman 
MacDonald will do just that.
<P>
	The bill signals renewed federal leadership by consolidating 
under one authority the lead responsibility for management of 
oceans. It signals the federal government's commitment to a 
comprehensive and co-operative approach to oceans policy. It 
signals the need for shared information, shared planning, shared 
management. It signals that Canada and Canadians are prepared to 
act in making the most of our assets.
<P>
	The act is the last step toward formal jurisdiction over Canada's 
oceans territory, but it is the first step-
<P>
	I will conclude momentarily, Mr. Speaker. I can see you are 
edging up on your feet with excitement.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> You have approximately eight minutes to 
speak. I would ask that when you refer to members of the House 
you refer to them by their riding name rather than by their 
surnames.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tobin:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, I am fully aware of that rule. It 
was my desire to reflect the full responsibility and authority of the 
hon. member for Dartmouth in <I>Hansard</I> when it is recorded for 
purposes of householder mailing to refer to him by name. The 
Speaker of course would be unfamiliar with such considerations.
<P>
	We all know that the model of Canada is from sea to sea. The 
Canada oceans act recognizes that Canadians from one end of the 
country to the other, in every region and in every province, are 
owners of our seas. Together Canadians from every part of the 
country have unbelievable opportunities to gain and to keep 
sustenance and wealth and pleasure from our oceans. Together 
Canadians from every part of Canada, from sea to sea to sea, hold 
those oceans in trust for the future. The Canada oceans act is one 
key move to exercise that trust that has been bestowed upon us with 
pride and with care.
<P>
	In coastal Canada for the last number of years we have suffered 
tremendously from economic loss, economic dislocation, real 
human suffering. We can find it in every part of coastal Canada. We 
can certainly find it along the coastline of Newfoundland, where 
300 communities have been displaced from the traditional way of 
life because of the groundfish failure, where 30,000 people find 
themselves not hauling up their boats and repairing their gear but 
are contemplating the end of another year when they have been 
absent from the sea.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14865"> 14865 </A></B>
<P>
	We can find it in Nova Scotia, in particular the groundfish 
failure in northern Nova Scotia but also along the south shore as 
well. We can find it in P.E.I., less so in New Brunswick, certainly 
in the province of Quebec along the north shore, in the Gaspé and 
the Îles-de-la-Madeleine, where people have suffered real 
hardship.
<P>
	We can find a sense of fear and concern on the coast of British 
Columbia, a concern that the groundfish failures of the Atlantic not 
be repeated in the west. There are conflicts between stakeholders 
about who has access to resources, who ought to have access to 
resources, and what gear types are most resource friendly. These 
are ongoing discussions and difficult ones between stakeholders.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	Whatever our backgrounds, whatever our political stripe, 
whatever our ideology, the one thing we all must know in this 
place-and notwithstanding the public perception that we never 
agree, we have demonstrated it in the past in this place-is that we 
understand the tremendous importance and value of the oceans 
heritage. We can and we must. I call on colleagues again to work 
together to expand and protect and ensure that oceans heritage.
<P>
	As I am fond of frequently saying, as I think it is a wonderful 
piece of advice for all of us, may we be guided by the words of the 
Haida people, who say that we do not inherit the land or the sea 
from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Admittedly, it has been a 
while, Mr. Speaker, since we had the opportunity to debate a 
fisheries bill in this House. I can remember the House having to 
debate such legislation very soon after Parliament reconvened in 
1993, even though we started in 1994 and had been elected in 1993. 
This morning, I would like to say from the outset that this is a sad 
day for myself, as a parliamentarian, for two reasons.
<P>
	First, contrary to what had been the case with the two previous 
bills presented by the Liberal government, this time, we did not 
have the chance to familiarize ourselves with the legislation and 
prepare to provide proper explanations to our constituents. Let me 
explain.
<P>
	This bill was introduced for first reading approximately three 
months ago, on June 14. During all that time, I tried to know more 
about the bill. I also spoke with the chairman of the fisheries 
committee, the hon. member for Dartmouth. I hope he can be 
recognized later, but the fact of the matter is that we do not have all 
the information. We asked senior officials of the department for 
information. We made all kinds of inquiries, had several briefing 
sessions, but never got the answers we were looking for. These 
could have been included in a precis, the purpose of which, and I 
will  refer to my notes so that I do not mislead anyone, is to identify 
the scope of each clause of a bill. My point is that the fisheries 
department, and hopefully not the minister himself, did not make 
the task any easier for us parliamentarians.
<P>
	Bill C-98 covers many other existing acts of Parliament. This is 
why I wanted to know the origin of each of these acts and see how 
they complement each other. I also wanted to be able to measure 
the scope of each of the clauses. I that sense, it is a sad day for me.
<P>
	The other reason why it is a sad day has to do with the fact that 
we often ask questions in this House but seldom get answers. This 
is the first time, since the last meeting of fisheries ministers in 
Victoria last fall, that the department has given us an indication of 
where it is headed. From what I understand, since the department's 
officials did not provide us with a precis, this new bill provides that 
the provinces will be consulted like any other legal person 
interested in the issue. Already, this is something that I have 
trouble with. Quebec attended that conference on fisheries 
management, but so did British Columbia, Newfoundland, Prince 
Edward Island and New Brunswick.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	Some of these provinces had stated their needs, as well as their 
willingness to share with Ottawa the responsibility for fisheries 
management.
<P>
	However, this morning, which is the first opportunity for the 
provinces to give an idea of where they are headed, the whole issue 
is downplayed. I do not oppose regional meetings and 
decentralization, but the importance of the provinces should not be 
overlooked. Moreover, there is no indication of any hierarchy in 
terms of the consultations and that also makes me sad.
<P>
	The House is a place where we can express our views. I want to 
take this opportunity to say that even though some provinces may 
be prepared to give more power to Ottawa-and I cannot keep 
these provinces from doing so-we should take into consideration 
those provinces which are willing to play an active role in the 
management of fisheries. However, the bill does not appear to do 
that.
<P>
	This was my introduction. I will now discuss the content of the 
legislation for the benefit of the members who did not have time to 
read it, as well as for your benefit, Mr. Speaker, and that of the 
public watching us on television. The bill contains three parts, as 
the minister pointed out, but I will summarize them a little faster.
<P>
	The first part seeks to recognize, in the law of the land, Canada's 
jurisdiction over its ocean areas. There is a reference to Canada's 
role in the drafting of the Convention on the law of the sea, which 
came into effect in 1982. It is now 1995. They have taken 13 years. 
Now they are asking us to take less than three months to  
understand it all, to assimilate it all, while refusing to give us the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14866"> 14866 </A></B>
<P>
texts setting out the scope of the bill. This concerns Part I of the 
bill.
<P>
	Part II deals with defining the legislative framework necessary 
for establishing a national oceans management strategy. I will say 
no more about defining the legislative framework just now, but will 
come back to it later. Part III addresses clarification of federal 
responsibilities with respect to oceans management.
<P>
	I would like to touch upon these three points briefly. I have 
attempted to take notes of what the minister said, thinking this 
would help me in constructing my own address as well. But let me 
start by commenting on how the minister has been able to use this 
bill to do a great deal of flag waving. He is entitled to do so, except 
that in my opinion Part I of the bill which gave him such a chance 
to wax patriotic could, according to what I hear from some public 
servants, have been handled by the governor in council alone, in 
other words the cabinet, with ratification of the Convention on the 
Law of the Sea. Or, to put it more clearly, there was no need to 
bother the House, no need of a statute for it to be adopted.
<P>
	And that from my understanding of his words is where he has 
placed the most emphasis in his speech. So you will understand my 
amazement.
<P>
	Part II concerns the legislative framework. What is the 
framework he presents? My initial conclusion is that what is being 
addressed here is facilitating implementation of this integrated 
oceans management.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	Reference is made to facilitating contacts between federal 
ministers and other concerned parties. Does it take a statute of the 
Parliament in Ottawa to encourage federal ministers to talk to each 
other? Perhaps encouraging ministers to communicate with each 
other ought to have been put into the Constitution right at the start. 
An act to encourage communication. Again, Mr. Speaker, pardon 
my amazement.
<P>
	A little further on I do see how this legislative framework 
operates, but it still strikes me as poorly defined. Poorly defined in 
that the federal responsibilities with respect to oceans management 
as they are set out still strike me as fuzzy, but the relationships 
between the ministers also strike me as fuzzy, very very fuzzy.
<P>
	At the briefing sessions I was told that as many as 14 
departments could be involved. Upon reading the bill, we see four 
or five departments referred to by name. The Department of 
Foreign Affairs will be responsible for approving the zones. Oddly 
enough, when the bill refers to sustainable management and the 
quality of the environment, we see that the minister will be able to 
set standards. However, unlike certain cases when the Attorney 
General of Canada is asked to issue a certificate, the minister 
would not be required to seek the  permission of the Deputy Prime 
Minister who is also the Minister of the Environment. However, 
that is a matter on which the hon. member for Laurentides will 
expand later on.
<P>
	As far as I am concerned, I find it rather confusing, and I have 
the impression it will take more than one bill. The Prime Minister 
will have to attend quite a few of these meetings to be sure that all 
ministers are present and are willing to take part in the sessions the 
fisheries minister will have to set up to implement his management 
strategy.
<P>
	Imagine how the bureaucrats and the ministers will react when 
they have to do it all over again together. I think the sequence is all 
wrong. I said earlier there were three parts to this bill. They could 
have set up the first part with cabinet. As for part two, the 
management strategy, they could have provided a better 
framework. As well, before second reading they could have asked 
us to work on the bill in the fisheries committee. It is really too bad 
that such a poor job was done, according to some bureaucrats and 
some members opposite, Liberal members. We will not name them 
because solidarity bids me to respect their silence. They will speak 
for themselves. However, the confusion this morning could have 
been avoided.
<P>
	We could have avoided the sniping that went on earlier, and we 
could have avoided the partisan remarks. In any case, I will try to 
be objective to the very end, but I have a feeling that some 
members have already been given notes for their speeches and will 
have to read what the party asks them to say, not what they feel like 
saying or have already said. In clear terms, from what I understand, 
the minister is not proposing a specific strategy, but merely a 
duplication of powers.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	The minister could have tabled a specific strategy that 
recognized the respective roles of other federal ministers and the 
provinces. Once approved, the strategy could have been supported 
by a bill. There was nothing to prevent the minister, at that point, 
from calling a meeting with his federal and provincial colleagues to 
define the strategy. But no, the minister preferred to give himself 
new powers and, as I said earlier, to put his colleague, the 
environment minister, before a <I>fait accompli</I> and leave the 
provinces out of the debate altogether.
<P>
	As I said earlier, the Bloc Quebecois co-operated with the 
government at the beginning of its mandate on Bill C-29, the 
legislation to protect straddling stocks. I think that in this case we 
showed our good faith, we showed we were not influenced by 
partisan considerations nor by our cherished goal.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Separation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Some call it that, but I have always said 
sovereignty. When you say in Bill C-98 that its purpose is to 
strengthen-
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14867"> 14867 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I may remind 
the House that comments should be made through the Chair, not 
directly from member to member across the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, minor disturbances occur 
from time to time, but as I was saying-I have lost the gist- I was 
saying that one of Canada's prime objectives in connection with 
Bill C-98 is to reaffirm its sovereignty over its coastal waters.
<P>
	One of my colleagues whispered to me that one project dear to 
my heart was separation. How is it that, when Canadians are talking 
about affirming their identity, they talk about sovereignty and, 
when Quebecers talk about wanting to be sovereign, Canadians call 
it separation?
<P>
	Nowhere have I seen reference by international journalists or in 
the international press to Canada's wanting to separate from the 
rest of the world with the announcement of Bill C-98. It just wants 
to assert its sovereignty.
<P>
	I hope my little digression will help some people to understand 
and to use the proper terminology in the future.
<P>
	I would also like to add, before getting into this small digression, 
that the Bloc Quebecois took part in Bill C-29. We knew it would 
be difficult. We knew that our plan to protect fish stocks in 
overlapping zones outside our territorial waters had no basis 
whatsoever in international law. However, I should add that no 
point of law prevented us from taking the action we unanimously 
authorized the Canadian government to take, here in this House.
<P>
	What I want to say is that common sense prevails, always. When 
we appeal to people's common sense, when we take the time to 
explain things to them, they understand. When we do not take the 
time, we keep going round in circles. This is what has been 
happening in the constitutional context for the past thirty years; we 
have not taken the time to properly explain to people, and we are 
going round in circles.
<P>
	In terms of the bill before us this morning, we could have 
avoided going round in circles, but we did not take the time to 
properly explain. Had that been done, we in the opposition would 
have worked with the government members opposite and talked 
about our suggestions for part I and whether fundamental 
principles could be respected and an order of consultation 
established in connection with part II-that sort of thing. We would 
have saved a lot of time and a lot of taxpayers' money, and the 
problem would be solved. At least we would have a timetable that 
would allow us to say we would progress.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	At this point, we do not have anything. I am saying right off the 
bat that if the government ever uses its  majority without taking 
into account the comments made by members who disagree with it, 
we will always have problems with this bill. If I understand 
correctly, the minister of fisheries sees this bill as the way to 
correct the management errors we made in the past. We should, 
however, ensure that everybody understands and that the solution is 
appropriate to the problem. We must first agree on the definition of 
the problem before trying to define solutions.
<P>
	All this to say-I am not such a bad guy after all-that I agree 
with the minister of fisheries that many things in Canada are 
scattered. I, too, recognize that this management is a little chaotic. I 
may not be using the same words as the minister but I think the 
same thing.
<P>
	In this regard, I could agree to go back and sit with the people on 
the fisheries committee and work on what could be called an 
integrated ocean management system. For the people listening to 
us, integrated management system does not necessarily mean that 
everything should be centralized. We should first of all ensure that 
the right hand knows what the left hand will be doing.
<P>
	At this time, when we are still at the starting gate, I am not sure 
that the other members of the cabinet are aware of the full import of 
this bill, but there is one thing I would like to know. If it is 
supposed to make things easier, I would like the minister of 
fisheries to show us that he is on top of this by inviting the 14 other 
ministers concerned by this bill to come and tell us how they see 
their participation in this proposed management committee, how 
all this will come together, so that we can see and feel it in front in 
us. But I have yet to hear the other ministers.
<P>
	This sums up my position this morning. I could perhaps close 
with a brief summary of what I said and I will then have a motion to 
table. In short, this is the position of the Bloc Quebecois. Part I of 
the bill defines in the laws of this country Canada's jurisdiction 
over its ocean areas. It is certainly important to recognize one's 
sovereignty. However, I am not sure that we needed a federal act to 
do that. Indeed, we were once told by the ambassador representing 
Canada during the negotiations on the convention that such 
recognition could be made by cabinet.
<P>
	As far as I am concerned, Part II is only window dressing. The 
bill does not meet its objectives. The required legislative 
framework for the implementation of a national strategy is 
ill-defined and federal responsibilities regarding the management 
of oceans are vague. What is even worse is that the bill disregards 
the provinces' jurisdiction, including in the environment 
sector-as the hon. member for Laurentides will explain later 
on-and defines provincial ministers as mere associates on the 
same level as any other person, whether in the private or the public 
sector, interested in the issue.
<P>
	This bill could therefore generate disputes. This is unacceptable, 
in our view. Consequently, we oppose the  legislation. We feel it is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14868"> 14868 </A></B>
<P>
necessary to clearly define a strategy for the management of 
oceans, but that strategy must be efficient and not lead to conflicts.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	In that regard, the minister must go back to the drawing board 
and come up with a strategy that will clearly define the 
responsibilities of each one involved in the process, without 
creating any new overlap between federal and provincial 
departments.
<P>
	On that note, I would like to table a motion-although I do not 
know if I can do so at this stage-which could read as follows. I 
move, seconded by the hon. member for Laurentides, that the 
motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``That'' 
and substituting the following therefor:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``Bill C-98, an Act respecting the oceans of Canada, be not now read a second 
time, but that the order be revoked, the bill withdrawn and the subject matter 
referred to the standing committee on fisheries and oceans''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In so doing, we would create a climate which would ensure the 
implementation of an ocean management strategy much more 
quickly, efficiently and constructively, with the participation of 
parliamentarians. That would also result in significant savings.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I therefore table my motion.
<P>
	I note that there is still some time left but as I have already stated 
I would not wish to drag things out in my concern to save the 
taxpayers' money, and to launch into patriotic speeches as well, a 
move which I expect would offend some of those present in the 
House this morning because any flag waving I would do would not 
necessarily involve the flag of Canada.
<P>
	Not that I have anything against Canadians, but my objections 
are instead against the federal system as it exists at present and as it 
is administered at present. The bill tabled this morning is to my 
mind a perfect illustration of the fact that no effort is being made to 
seek agreement among ourselves. The minister makes a decision. 
Perhaps an ill-advised one. I am, after all, prepared to attribute 
good intentions to him from time to time. But the minister heads in 
a certain direction, deliberately closing his eyes and ears to 
everything around him, probably even within his own caucus.
<P>
	On these grounds therefore I invite the minister to withdraw the 
bill, to provide an opportunity for us to develop a strategy at last, 
but a strategy that must be created in an atmosphere of mutual trust. 
If we cannot manage to do so I feel Quebecers will understand that 
if, every time we take the floor to try to get our point of view across 
to the others, theirs is the one that wins out it would not be 
surprising if at some point when nothing can be changed from 
within it becomes necessary for us to break out of this federal 
morass.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> My colleagues, the 
amendment by the hon. member for Gaspé is in order.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to speak to Bill C-98 today. Some of the things in the bill 
bring back a lot of memories from watching politics over the years 
as to whether the bill will be a success or failure in future years. 
One never knows but I trust the minister is going in the right 
direction on the issue. We will speak to a few things on that in a 
moment. I want to talk about the minister's introductory comments 
on the bill in general. I want to spend some time on the fees issue 
which he seemed to disregard in this comments.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	First there is something amiss about planning in the department 
of fisheries over the last two decades particularly. I can recall about 
a year and a half ago talking to the previous deputy minister of that 
department. It took me so long to get out of this fellow exactly how 
many years the department of fisheries undertakes its strategic 
planning activities. He really did not want to answer but I badgered 
him until he did. The answer was three years of strategic planning 
within that department.
<P>
	The reason I was asking that question was that if there is a 
three-year planning cycle in the department of fisheries why then 
did the previous Conservative government come out with a 
five-year moratorium plan in fisheries and this current government 
came out with the five-year TAGS plan?
<P>
	First of all if there is a three-year strategic planning session, it is 
beyond me how the department can come out with a five-year plan 
not really knowing what the end results will be. It seems to me the 
reason the five-year plan came out was it had a lot to do with when 
the next election was and a lot less to do with the planning, the 
conservation value and qualities of fish. That is truly unfortunate.
<P>
	This government, as was the previous government, is intent on 
passing money out to unemployed fishermen. That is a subject of 
discussion in itself, whether it is good or bad or how indeed it is 
going to deal with the conservation of fish. One thing in Bill C-98 
that I heard here this morning is the area set aside for conservation. 
I think it is good but there is a non-commitment in that aspect of it 
which I shall address very shortly.
<P>
	We have a department with three-year plans. The minister would 
be well advised to have that department look at longer term plans 
as they do in certain forest industries. The business cycle in some 
forest industries is as long as the life of a tree, from start to 
productive cutting. Perhaps the length of planning in the 
department of fisheries should relate to the cycle of the fish. It 
would not be a bad idea.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14869"> 14869 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to mention some of the comments from the separatist 
member who talked about some convoluted exercise. He mixed 
it in somehow with the fact that the minister wants to create a 
certain amount of sovereignty over our waters. He has it mixed 
up a bit as to what is right and what is wrong about sovereignty 
in this country.
<P>
	The very fact that the government is trying to make the waters 
surrounding our country a part of our sovereign nation is certainly 
not only for Newfoundland, British Columbia or P.E.I.; it is for all 
provinces, including Quebec. Why the member would have a 
disagreement with that just baffles me.
<P>
	As much as the government may complain about comments 
from the separatists, as a member of the parliamentary committee 
on fisheries I find it hard to understand how government members 
can unanimously endorse that committee's vice-chairman from the 
Bloc. On the one hand they complain about the comments about 
sovereignty and so on but on the other hand they allow that to 
happen. Do the Bloc members actually represent interests of 
Newfoundlanders, people in P.E.I., people in British Columbia? I 
have not heard it in this House if that is the case. What is the mind 
set for that kind of move? I suspect it is appeasement, once again, 
and that is unfortunate.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	The minister talked about the pride we have in our forefathers, 
the founders of the nation, people like John Cabot who at times had 
difficulty steering through the waters off the Grand Banks because 
of the amount of cod. I wonder what John Cabot would say today 
after 20 to 30 years of government bungling. He would have 
probably said: ``It is a darn good thing we do not have government 
or an overbureaucratic organization. At least I was allowed over 
here. There are lots of fish, but what have you people done?'' The 
question on the minds of most Canadians today is: What have 
politicians done to the fishery?
<P>
	I am aware that something like 14 formal reports have gone 
through the House of Commons on the east coast fishery, most of 
which were ignored. What do we have today? I have family 
members on TAGS and they are not proud of it. Their boats are 
sitting on the slip, never to go back in the water again. They are 
wishing for work. They are hoping some day that there may be 
work in the fishery. However it does not look good.
<P>
	Canadians are wondering what we allow government to present 
in the House of Commons. How bad will this hurt them? There are 
so many unknowns and so many people out there saying they have 
been hurt time and time again and asking if this will help that one 
never knows.
<P>
	The minister talked about several happenings in the recent 
affairs of fisheries. In 1958, 1967 and 1993 there were UN 
conventions. There was a new binding  convention to protect ocean 
resources. I wish just for once the government would stop talking 
and start doing. I cannot blame the minister. He has to try to 
improve operations and bring in organizations, but there is no 
confidence left that good will come of the legislation.
<P>
	The bill will formally assert Canada's jurisdiction over its 
coastal waters. However there was no mention about the nose and 
the tail of the Grand Banks with respect to fish.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tobin:</B> It is called the continental shelf.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> The minister tells me now 
that it is in there. From what we can determine those two areas are 
not included. The area specified is the 200-mile nautical limit. If 
they are in there they should be very carefully specified because 
those two areas, as he knows, are outside the nautical limit. If the 
committee purports to amend things in favour of government 
legislation it should carefully take note and carefully include the 
nose and the tail of the Grand Banks. Let us not make it as nebulous 
as these things usually are.
<P>
	Apparently there is a consolidation of 14 programs as a result of 
the bill, but a bureaucracy still exists in the department and the 
minister well knows it. For a department to lose so many clients, if 
fishermen can be considered clients of the department, I am at a 
loss why there is not a proportionate decrease in staff directly 
related to that loss. That is not the case. We lose the fishermen from 
the system but we do not lose the bureaucrats.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	By the way, I talked with the deputy minister at one point. He is 
no longer the deputy minister and that is not a bad thing either, but 
the results of the discussion are still the same. I asked how many 
people in Ottawa, for instance, had been directly related to the 
fishing industries on the east or west coasts. I had difficulty getting 
that answer too but finally the answer, if we check the record of that 
committee meeting, was negligible.
<P>
	If that were the case, the minister would be well advised to look 
at the potential. If he wants gainful employment for those who have 
been put out of work and gainful retraining, he should start 
replacing the employees of DFO with those directly affected by the 
mismanagement of the department in the first place. It would go a 
long way to responding to some of their needs rather than sitting at 
home in their chairs waiting for the fish to come back.
<P>
	The minister stated that the act planned for the future rather than 
responded to the crisis of the day. This may be the first time in 
recent history that any government actually planned for the future 
rather than responded to the crisis of the day. I only have to refer 
the House to the moratorium in TAGS, an absolutely disastrous 
program. If the government wants to plan for the future, it should 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14870"> 14870 </A></B>
<P>
start listening to the people who are involved. That we  know, from 
British Columbia's point of view, is really not the case.
<P>
	It is not a bad idea to merge the coast guard with the DFO. That 
was done in April. However, I caught the comments of the minister 
that are not bound in legislation. The minister said that we would 
cross train and consolidate the coast guard, that we would 
consolidate offices, duties and so on.
<P>
	I do not know if the coast guard knows about it yet, but I am sure 
those offices are now wondering what the government is up to. It 
talks about planning. It should not make announcements in the 
House that it is to start a consolidation program, that it will move 
them here and there. There are people involved in the exercise. The 
minister would be well advised to get some advice first and plan 
the exercise rather than make a people kind of announcement in the 
House.
<P>
	The minister commented on the operation of the parliamentary 
committee on fisheries and the job of the chairman. Thus far the 
government's committee has basically done a tremendous job. It 
met and put a separatist as vice-chairman who does not really 
represent any of the exercise. Perhaps it is part of the Quebec 
border. That is the exercise of the government thus far. The 
chairman of the committee has a bigger job. He should go back to 
the minister and ask: ``Why don't you plan this exercise a bit 
better?''
<P>
	No mention has been made of fees. I am sure the minister knows 
how contentious this exercise is. Sections 49, 50, 51 and 52 
indicate that the minister may fix fees for service. I have trouble 
with government fee for service exercises when Canadian 
taxpayers are paying for government service as it is. They will end 
up paying for a service that is supposed to be provided twice: once 
through taxes and once through a fee for service. It is typical of 
governments at all levels today to say that they are providing us 
with a service but if they provide it they will charge a fee. That is 
what taxes were supposed to be for.
<P>
	For the information of the minister, a fee, a licence or a permit is 
a tax. The people involved in the fishing industry do not see a fee, a 
licence and a permit as just more dollars out of their pockets. They 
see it as more taxation and more costs. They wonder what it will be 
spent on. It goes into general revenue. Do we get it back? For the 
minister's information I have some quotes from fishing 
organizations that he would be interested in.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	It gets back to the philosophy of the government. It does not 
understand that we have a spending problem and not a revenue 
problem. Successive governments over the last 20 years have been 
overspending, overspending and overspending. What is their 
answer? Rather than find ways to cut back they go back to people 
like fishermen  and say they need more money off their backs. That 
is the Liberal way.
<P>
	What kind of fees are involved? They say the overall average 
increase in the fees across the board is approximately 400 per cent. 
I would like to see how the chairman of the committee will get 
around that when we talk about it. Congratulations to the Liberals; 
they will ding fishermen across the board 400 per cent in fees. They 
say the $30 lobster licence will be $310. That ought to please the 
fellows who are trying to eke out a living.
<P>
	The government currently gets approximately $13 million from 
licence fees, and that is going to $63 million. Is there not a way to 
look at some efficiencies within DFO to get $50 million rather than 
license or tax fishermen? Is there not a way? Have they looked at 
that? It is another job for the chairman of the committee that we 
will be asking about.
<P>
	When will it happen? The minister says the government will 
decide on that by the end of September. That is pretty soon. 
Fishermen can take note that they will get notice of when fees, 
licences and permits, these taxes, will be increased.
<P>
	I am surprised on such a big issue that the minister stood for 40 
minutes and told us about John Cabot. That was interesting but the 
people out there are really asking who is getting taxed, how much 
and when.
<P>
	What is it for? The minister says they are progressive fees, 
progressive taxes; that is the larger the catch, the larger the 
percentage increase. They are based on the ability to pay. That is 
fair ball, I suppose. They apply to commercial fisheries on both 
coasts. The government presumes once again that if there is any 
possible way to tax them it will do it. It does not look at perhaps not 
spending money here or there.
<P>
	We only have to look at the minister's own example that he set 
for his office furnishings, which we complained about in the 
House. We only have to look at some of his expenditures, like 
advertising in New York City when he was promoting himself. I 
wonder where these folks are coming from.
<P>
	Why do they want to increase fees? Let us see what they say. The 
Liberals want an additional $50 million on top of the $200 million 
in current cuts. They say they can get away with cutting $200 
million and then go back to the people they will tax and say: 
``Look, we cut $200 million; you can pay $50 million''. Why can 
they not look for $250 million in cuts? It is there. Starting from the 
top it is there.
<P>
	DFO's budget will apparently be decreased to $500 million from 
$700 million.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	I wonder if there is not more. Where is it? We only have to ask 
the fishermen. They had all kinds of  suggestions about where to 
cut when I sat down with them. The one thing common with the 
east and west coast fishermen is they are not asked. They get the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14871"> 14871 </A></B>
<P>
fees, the licences, the permit costs and the taxes but they are not 
asked where the cuts can come from. Does this sound like the 
Liberal government? You bet it does.
<P>
	I talked to employees of DFO who said there are two reasons 
behind these fee increases. They want more money and they want 
to reduce the number of fishermen. I said: ``If those are your 
reasons do you have any other alternatives? Is there something you 
can do other than increase taxes to the fishermen?'' I suggested two 
things which I will suggest here. The answer was they did not think 
of that. There is a priceless answer. That is a pun to the minister.
<P>
	What is the impact of these fees? The fees must be paid up front 
with no instalments. There will be a graduated fee structure. If we 
have landings of $25,000 worth of catch, the fee is approximately 3 
per cent. If we have landings of over $100,000 the fee is 
approximately 5 per cent, and on it goes. It sounds like the tax 
structure we are working on today. It is similar to the tax structure 
we are working on today, so it is a tax.
<P>
	What does the P.E.I. fishermen's association say about it? The 
money is simply a form of hidden taxation. That is felt right across 
the country: ``It will not even be funnelled back into the fishery but 
will go into a consolidated revenue fund or general pot that they 
will blow away''. That is the feeling out there.
<P>
	Can we take money as was done in the case of British 
Columbia's forestry? Part of the fees from licences and permits 
goes toward silviculture. If the government has to take money 
could it not possibly think to put it back into rejuvenating fishing 
stock?
<P>
	The government is looking at more fees for service from coast 
guard services which now comes under DFO, and for scientific 
investigations. One has to wonder what the methodology is here. 
This will be another cash cow like most things the government is 
involved with. It cannot deal with the fact that it is overspending. 
All it can deal with is it does not have enough revenue, and that is 
wrong.
<P>
	There are some alternatives we could provide. DFO should be 
managed by fishermen and their dependents, the people in the 
indirect fisheries. Start moving them in, start training them. Get 
them involved in DFO in Ottawa, on inland waters, on both coasts.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	If they get a piece of that administrative action maybe they will 
influence ministers to help the industry. Right now there is not that 
interlocking or interfacing. There is the DFO and a number of 
fishermen, a resource, a tax resource, which is the way they look at 
it. Therefore why not have the fishermen manage the resource by 
getting them involved?
<P>
	If there are problems within the industry many come from UI 
regulations. Fishermen will tell us that. They understand that. Let 
us look at UI regulations. We do not have to license the fishing 
industry again.
<P>
	There has been much talk about what happens to Newfoundland 
fishermen and what they do for a future. Many of them suggest the 
minister might want to look at inshore fishing again on handlining 
and getting perhaps some of the people in the villages along the 
shores active again in handlining and reduce the number of larger 
ships. They talk about that a lot. Whether it can be done, I do not 
know. Really all they want is to get out, get their lines in and get at 
it.
<P>
	If we look at the number of people who could possibly be 
employed around the villages as opposed to the number of people 
employed on the larger ships there is a drastic difference. Since fish 
plants have been shut down on the coast perhaps there could be 
regional plants. Perhaps the fish caught by handlining could go to 
regional plants and then to larger plants. That is a possibility but I 
do not know if it has been looked at.
<P>
	We are looking at a flat tax system but the tax system has to take 
into account that there have to be fewer exemptions. Perhaps if the 
government looked at the tax system and UI system it could come 
up with better alternatives than to strike larger fees and licences.
<P>
	The government has to look again at reducing costs. We know 
the costs are high there and the government knows it. I do not think 
its mandarins are willing to let it have much more money. I guess 
the government has to learn to be a little tougher in dealing with the 
bureaucracy. As the Liberals are listening and whining about what I 
am saying, there are a lot of senior bureaucrats in that department. 
There are a lot of expenses. We do get letters outlining where 
things should be cut. The fishermen tell us and so the minister 
should look at it.
<P>
	In the final analysis we have to look at where the Liberals are 
coming from on bills such as this. Although I compliment the 
minister on some of the issues within the bill, particularly the 
conservation areas, I continue to worry about traditional 
governments. We have thrown out that other party and the country 
brought in this party. They are traditional parties intent on looking 
at balancing books by way of taxing more as opposed to cost 
cutting. They are intent on perpetuating programs like the 
Conservative program on the moratorium and the TAGS program 
which was Liberal.
<P>
	We are looking at a government truly looking backwards to a 
future. If anything I sincerely wish this committee well because we 
will be spending a lot of time on this committee. We will be asking 
a lot of questions of this minister. We sincerely hope he keeps the 
interests of the fishermen in mind, not the interests of the 
bureaucrats in Ottawa.

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We now enter the next stage 
of debate on second reading of Bill C-98. Members will have up to 
20 minutes for their interventions, subject to 10 minutes of 
questions and comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State (Agriculture 
and Agri-Food, Fisheries and Oceans), Lib.):</B> It goes without 
saying, Mr. Speaker, that I am delighted to have the opportunity to 
take part in this debate on the Canada Oceans Act. To address 
immediately the remarks made by my colleague from the Reform 
Party, I can assure you that both the minister and the department 
have the best interests of fishermen and the fisheries community at 
heart. They have always had and will always do.
<P>
	This legislation is divided in three very straighforward parts. The 
first part definess Canada's maritime zones. The second part 
provides legislative authority to foster a new, wider, 
forward-looking and more inclusive strategy for Canada's oceans 
and their resources.
<P>
	Part III of the bill authorizes a modern departmental 
mandate-including the merger of the Canadians Coast Guard with 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans-as a vital means of 
carrying through on the Government of Canada's ocean 
responsibilities.
<P>
	Each of the three parts of the bill contains three key structural 
elements. In each part, there are regulatory measures, enforcement 
measures and operational measures.
<P>
	And, the legislation has three key objectives. First, the Canada 
Oceans Act will stake out Canada's clear legal jurisdiction over our 
oceans. Second, the Canada Oceans Act will put in place the legal 
framework required to support a new oceans management strategy 
based on the principles of sustainable development and integrated 
management. Finally, this act will consolidate and clarify federal 
responsabilities for managing Canada's oceans.
<P>
	There are three very simple themes that run throughout the 
legislation: cooperation, coordination and, of course, broad-based 
community input. And at the very centre of this bill is the 
determination of the federal government to lead in a positive, 
throughtful direction in promoting the economic and 
environmental potential of the waters in our three great ocean 
areas-the Atlantic, the Pacific and the Arctic.
<P>
	Quite simply, this bill seeks to seize the present in order to build 
upon the achievements of yesterday so that we are prepared for the 
possibilities of tomorrow.
<P>
	This summer, the National Advisory Board on Science and 
Technology issued its major report on Canada's future entitled 
``Healthy, Wealthy and Wise''. The  Board wrote that 
``Sustainability and stewardship must become that watchwords for 
economic development.''
<P>
	The Board called for integrated strategies that ``encourage the 
environmentally responsible exploitation of resources, consistent 
with long-term sustainability''. That is the very point made by the 
World Commission on Environment and Development in its United 
Nations Report eight years ago. That is the very point made at the 
famous Rio Summit. That is the point made by Canada in our 
fisheries disputes and negotiations.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	That is also the point made in the election Red Book, when we 
stated that ``Integrating economic with environmental goals fits in 
the Liberal tradition of social investment as sound economic 
policy''.
<P>
	Of course, Canada's oceans belong to all Canadians and it is up 
to all Canadians to pull as one to integrate the economic and 
environmental viability of our oceans. For many, many years, we 
have come to see the need for a comprehensive and integrated 
oceans policy. With the introduction of new ocean jurisdiction for 
Canada, that need becomes greater than ever. And the bill before us 
will indeed dramatically extend Canada's ocean jurisdiction and 
rights.
<P>
	This bill expands Canadian control over nearly five million 
square kilometres of ocean under Canadian jurisdiction. That's an 
incredible amount of ocean offering Canadians fantastic potential 
for new economic development. It is also an incredible amount of 
responsibility requiring us to get our act together on ocean policy.
<P>
	The bill clearly defines Canada's maritime zones and Canada's 
rights and jurisdiction in each of those zones. It incorporates 
Canada's full jurisdiction over our internal waters and over the 
territorial sea stretching twelve nautical miles out from our Arctic, 
Pacific and Atlantic coasts. The bill incorporates Canada's 
jurisdiction over the continental shelf. I would like to point out that 
the hon. member of the Reform Party who spoke earlier indicated 
that, as far as he could see, the nose and tail of the Grand Banks did 
not seem to be included. This is where Canada's jurisdiction over 
this zone is asserted by affirming our jurisdiction over the 
continental shelf.
<P>
	The bill states the right of Canadians to control exploration and 
exploitation of minerals and resources of the continental shelf's 
seabed and in its subsoil. It also confirms full rights for Canada 
over the shelf's living organisms belonging to sedentary species. 
This legislation also incorporates Canada's jurisdiction over its 
fishing zones in the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic including the Bay 
of Fundy, near my riding, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, also near my 
riding, and Queen Charlotte Sound. We first declared those zones 
to be ours 18 years ago-and they will always be part of Canada's 
ocean rights.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14873"> 14873 </A></B>
<P>
	The Canada Oceans Act will also give Canada a new contiguous 
zone. In this zone, Canadian immigration laws, customs laws, 
sanitary laws and fiscal laws will apply. Most importantly of all, 
the Canada Oceans Act will declare an exclusive economic zone 
for Canada stretching our 200 nautical miles from our coastline. 
To understand how significant that is, members of Parliament need 
only remember that Canada has the world's longest coastline.
<P>
	In this new exclusive economic zone, Canada will have full 
rights over the exploration, exploitation, conservation and 
management of the resources of the ocean waters, the ocean floor 
and the ocean subsoil. Canadians will have jurisdiction over marine 
research and the preservation and protection of the marine 
environment.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Once this bill becomes law, as I fully hope it will, we will have 
established in Canadian law that Canada has grown in size and 
jurisdiction. Canadians will become responsible for more than the 
care of our ten provinces and two territories. We will become the 
custodians of a large part of the world's ocean treasures.
<P>
	Canadians have fought with diligence to establish the principle 
of global fisheries conservation. We have taken some licks along 
the way but, thanks to the leadership of the Minister of Fisheries 
and Oceans, we have come out a winner. We now have the duty to 
turn our same principles into action over all the oceans resources 
that are coming into Canadian jurisdiction.
<P>
	Naturally, we will need strong leadership by the federal 
government. We will need strong leadership from coastal provinces 
and municipalities. We will need complete involvement of all 
sectors of ocean stakeholders.
<P>
	The problem and the possibilities are complex, so much so that 
Canadians must work together to solve them. The 
interrelationships of ocean species is so complex that we need to 
pull together to understand them. The current and potential uses of 
our oceans are so numerous that we need to guarantee that we work 
together to make the most of them.
<P>
	Our individual and collective actions as human beings have 
important impacts upon the well-being and potential prosperity of 
the ocean environment. That is why the Canada Oceans Act calls 
for an ocean strategy founded on the twin principles of sustainable 
development and integrated management.
<P>
	The concept of sustainable development is a not a new one but it 
meets a need Canadians understand very well. Canadians know that 
we need an oceans policy that embraces sustainable development 
as one of its guiding principles. The concept of integrated 
management of ocean resources is a new one but it too meets a 
need that Canadians understand well.
<P>
	We know what it means when government polices are confusing 
or contradictory. We know the opportunities that are lost when the 
private sector and governments and labour and local communities 
fail to pursue shared goals. Canadians know that we need an oceans 
policy that embraces integrated management as one of its guiding 
principles.
<P>
	It is time to start coordinating, consolidating and harmonizing 
our oceans strategy. It is time to develop a common focus and plan 
of action to promote the quality, abundance and diversity of ocean 
resources. It is time to set some goals for ourselves and to set some 
limits on ourselves.
<P>
	Global environmental concerns should lead us to act. The 
oceans' economic potential obliges us to act. Canada's new ocean 
jurisdiction compels us to act. The bill before Parliament gives us 
the legislative tools to act.
<P>
	The Canada Oceans Act will establish a clearly identifiable lead 
federal department accountable for oceans management. The 
legislation extends Canada's environmental laws to our new ocean 
areas. The bill will permit the establishment of marine protected 
areas and the development of marine environmental quality 
guidelines. These are essential tools if we are to adopt the 
principles of integrated management and sustainable development 
in our stewardship of Canada's ocean waters.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	The Canada Oceans Act will give the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans formal authority to enter into new partnership agreements 
in order to pursue Canada's oceans management strategy. That is an 
essential tool if we are to face the problems and find the solutions 
together. That is an essential tool if we are to set a national strategy 
with full local input from coastal provinces and citizens. That is an 
essential tool if we are to respect the specific priorities of those 
who live along the coasts of our three vastly different oceans.
<P>
	This legislation follows through on the government's budgetary 
promise to ``strengthen Canada's capabilities and effectiveness in 
oceans policy-making''. This legislation will set the stage for 
developing an oceans management strategy that conserves and 
protects the ocean environment and the ecosystems and resources 
that our oceans contain.
<P>
	The Bill demonstrates that the federal government will play its 
full role in managing ocean resources on an economically viable 
and technologically sustainable basis.
<P>
	And the legislation demonstrates that the federal government 
wants more than a one person show. The bill permits an upsurge in 
the sharing of scientific, environmental and management 
information relating to our oceans. The bill before Parliament 
emphasizes the need for an integrated federal approach to ocean 
management, a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14874"> 14874 </A></B>
<P>
need recognized in part through the  merger of the Canadian Coast 
Guard and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans in April.
<P>
	The new structure will provide stronger coordination of policy 
development and stronger, streamlined operations. The coast guard 
will form the primary civilian marine component of the federal 
government.
<P>
	By the way, on the subject of oceans management, on all of the 
important matters required to build a comprehensive oceans 
management strategy, the federal government is determined to 
show a spirit of partnership. Marine safety. Oceans understanding 
and knowledge. Marine Resources Management. Environmental 
Management. Economic Development. International Leadership. 
They are all components of an ocean strategy based on an 
integrated management approach. They are all components of a 
strategy based on a sustainable development approach. They are all 
part of the strategy that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
invites all Canadians to help create.
<P>
	The first action required to build a future of maritime greatness 
for Canada is to declare jurisdiction over our ocean areas. Through 
this legislation, that is what Parliament will do.
<P>
	The second action required to buil a future of maritime greatness 
for Canada is to show strong federal leadership in establishing the 
framework for a new oceans management strategy. Through this 
legislation, that is what Parliament will do.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	The third action required to build a future of maritime greatness 
for Canada is for all of us, from every sector and every corner of 
the country, to create a new oceans management strategy together. 
Through this legislation, that is what Canadians will be in a 
position to do.
<P>
	I urge all members of the house of Commons to join in speedy 
passage of the Canada Oceans Act so that Canadians may join in 
the urgent task of making Canada an even greater ocean nation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the speech by the secretary of state and hon. member 
for Beauséjour. I have several questions but I do not know where to 
start. I will ask two at the same time and, time permitting, I will ask 
another one later on.
<P>
	Now for his first comment, and I must say I find it hard to follow 
the federal government's thinking today. They say they needed this 
legislation to make the Coast Guard part of the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans, although this was already done last spring in 
the finance minister's February budget. What is going on? Is the 
department trying to rectify an illegal situation? What was or was 
not illegal before? I think we could draw quite a few conclusions in 
that case.
<P>
	I remember saying in a speech to the Minister of Fisheries at the 
time that he should consolidate the fleets  owned by the 
Government of Canada. I mentioned the Coast Guard. Their ships 
could have been included in the same fleet with the Fisheries and 
Oceans vessels. But there are other fleets as well, so why the 
piecemeal approach?
<P>
	Once again, the left hand does not know what the right hand is 
doing. As far as the ships of the Department of the Environment are 
concerned, why did they not look at the kind of work involved, 
since in this bill, for all practical purposes, the minister will have 
the authority to set environmental standards for oceans?
<P>
	What does the Department of the Environment intend to do? I 
was told there were a number of ships, so what are they going to do 
with them? Why did they not consider integrating all this?
<P>
	My point is there is still room for improving the bill. The 
Department of National Defence has ships as well. Why did the 
government not consider some kind of plan or strategy in which 
these ships could be used, and I am thinking of the quite 
spectacular operations we saw last spring?
<P>
	In any case, I am glad that was done. However, why does the 
government not take advantage of this experience to consider a 
system for integrating these ships?
<P>
	That is one point I wanted to make. As for part III of the bill, I 
already mentioned two departments that were not consulted. What 
is going on? I wish the secretary of state would tell us. Where are 
they headed and do they really intend to merge? Good, I see some 
messages coming. Do they really intend to merge or is this just a lot 
of smoke and mirrors?
<P>
	I repeat, the Coast Guard fleet has been under the jurisdiction of 
the Minister of Fisheries since the spring budget. I would like to 
put a question to the secretary of state, who may be able to remove 
this perception I have that the bill is improvised, that the 
government is going a little too fast and has not finished its 
consultations, starting with the parliamentarians in their own party.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	I would like to draw the secretary of state's attention back to 
clause 54. In formulating this bill, they are already including 
conditional amendments in clause 54, which provides: ``If Bill 
C-84, introduced during-the thirty-fifth Parliament-is assented 
to, then-''. Should I read the whole thing? We are told that this 
bill will have consequences, and given that, attention will have to 
be paid to this and to that.
<P>
	Bill C-98 involves regulations, and must be able to 
accommodate other existing regulations and legislation. But we 
already have C-84, which is in the process of changing it. They 
could not even agree among themselves to wait for C-84 to be 
drafted.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14875"> 14875 </A></B>
<P>
	In connection with this, I would like to mention another doubt. 
I will read you subclause 54(3): ``Any fee fixed under this Act 
shall stand permanently referred to a committee described in 
section 25 of the Regulations Act to be scrutinized as if it were 
a regulation''.
<P>
	I would like to direct a question to the secretary of state to at 
least start getting rid of our perception that the thing is improvised. 
Can he tell us who will form the committee? Does he already have 
the answers this morning? There are a whole bunch of 
amendments, but I would at least like to know whether he has had 
time to read the bill to the end and ask these questions and whether 
he got an answer from an official somewhere. We did not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Gaspé for all these questions he would like to see answered like any 
self-respecting opposition member or critic. I think that the 
minister answered some of his questions in his speech, but he also 
urged members, especially those on the standing committee on 
fisheries, to which this bill will be referred, to feel free to ask 
questions and search for answers.
<P>
	I am happy to see that the hon. member sees the advisability of 
merging the Fisheries and Oceans fleet with that of the coast guard. 
He also asked why the Canadian forces fleet was not included and 
he referred to last spring's turbot war. The hon. member must know 
that the three fleets he mentioned were all called upon at the time 
and worked together in a joint operation to make foreign fleets, and 
one in particular, realize that Canada is serious about conservation.
<P>
	I think the hon. member will agree with me that, by pooling our 
resources, we succeeded in getting our message across and 
convincing the rest of the world, and all fishing nations, that 
Canada is serious about conserving ocean resources and focusing 
attention on the problem.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	In this regard, I must say that if we succeeded in conveying to 
the world that the minister acted decisively, it is because the 
minister represented in an effective way the aspirations of those 
who want Canada to focus on conservation. All the political parties 
in this House and across Canada gave us the support we needed to 
do so.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to thank all those who supported this 
effort. If we are talking about this bill respecting the oceans of 
Canada, it is to give the minister of fisheries the authority he needs 
to watch over ocean resources by putting in place policies and 
programs aimed at protecting these resources for all of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to address Bill C-98. This morning, the hon. member for 
Gaspé explained at length why we will oppose this legislation. I 
want to elaborate on the  environmental aspects of the bill, that is 
the environment minister's responsibilities under the proposed 
legislation.
<P>
	This legislation gives exceptional powers to Fisheries and 
Oceans, but these powers already belong to the Department of the 
Environment. This is yet another example of overlap between two 
departments and it is a real concern to see how there is no true 
agreement or harmonization at the federal level. I cannot help but 
wonder why the minister did not tell environment critics about this 
bill? Why is it that we were not informed of that legislation? How 
come we did not even hear about it in committee?
<P>
	When a bill has such an impact on a department like the 
environment department, we have to be able to look at it and make 
sure that it does not create more overlap. Let us not forget that the 
Department of the Environment lost one third of its personnel and 
one third of its budget following the government's drastic cuts. 
Consequently, this whole situation is a real source of concern.
<P>
	The bill seems to establish a sectoral environment department: 
the department of coastal environment. If each department did that, 
we would end up with an environment transport department, an 
environment industry department, and all the government's 
ministers would have powers regarding environmental protection 
and preservation.
<P>
	If this is the way this government wants to go, then we should 
abolish the environment department, because it will become 
useless in Parliament.
<P>
	We hear a lot of nice rhetoric, speeches and commitments about 
the environment, but not much is actually done to protect it. There 
is still a lot of work to do. This is a vital issue; our future and that of 
our children is at stake. When I see how the government treats this 
issue so lightly, seemingly attaching little importance to it, I 
become very concerned about the future of Canada, Quebec and in 
fact the whole world.
<P>
	When it comes to the environment, the government's tendency is 
to centralize powers in Ottawa for the sake of national interest. 
This is also a real concern, considering that environmental 
problems are of a global nature.
<P>
	Let me read you two clauses which are rather preoccupying. 
Clauses 28 to 36 of the bill deal with the implementation of a 
strategy for the management of estuarine, coastal and marine 
ecosystems.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	This part does not apply to the lakes and rivers. In large part, 
management of those ecosystems is a provincial responsibility.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14876"> 14876 </A></B>
<P>
	We on this side of the House have one other concern, that this act 
could allow the department to again interfere in provincial 
jurisdictions, particularly with respect to the environment. It puts 
provincial ministers on an equal  footing with any other interested 
persons or bodies. It is very important for us to know what an 
interested person or body is.
<P>
	This means that an individual might come to express his 
personal views. Will importance really be attached to that 
individual? God only knows. The environmental groups will be 
able to have their say and provincial ministers of the environment 
will be considered on the same footing as any individual coming to 
make a representation. This makes absolutely no sense. There is 
constant talk of partnership, harmonization, sustainable 
development, protecting our ecosystem, but I do not consider that 
to be a partnership. I would call it a source of conflict.
<P>
	A situation of conflict will be created with the provinces, 
perhaps even with the municipalities. With this bill the interference 
could reach as far as the municipal level. In other words, if the 
minister decides he is not satisfied with a municipality's waste 
water treatment system whose effluents go into a river or a lake, 
which in turn release their waters into the ocean, he can say: 
``Change all your waste water treatment systems, because they are 
not up to our standards and affect the fish in our oceans.''
<P>
	I think the government is getting into jurisdictions that are 
already very much protected and work very well. I fail to see why 
the minister should have additional authority over areas we have 
been managing for years and that have been managed by the 
municipalities which are already supervised by the provinces. We 
do not need federal supervision on top of that. It is very disturbing 
that this bill gives no indication that the municipalities will be 
consulted as well. The government says it has the right to assume 
that authority.
<P>
	We believe it is necessary to clearly identify an oceans 
management strategy-this is extremely important-but this 
strategy should be effective and not a source of conflict. The 
provinces should be made part of the decision-making process 
leading up to the formulation of the strategy. The minister should 
go back to the drawing board and table a strategy that specifies the 
responsibilities of all partners involved, without creating further 
overlap between federal and provincial departments. We have said 
this repeatedly here in the House, and I do not know whether 
anyone is listening, but it tends to be forgotten. Not only forgotten 
but ignored.
<P>
	I would like to say a few words about something that concerns 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Department of the 
Environment and the conflict situation we had this summer. If they 
cannot avoid a conflict between departments at the federal level, 
imagine what it will be like when we get to the provinces and the 
municipalities. This makes no sense at all. The government could 
never enforce a decent piece of legislation. There is no way.
<P>
	This summer we had the experience with the <I>Irving Whale</I>. The 
environment minister made a decision that we did not support, 
which was extremely risky and kept the people of the Magdalen 
Islands on edge all summer, and I must say I felt like that myself. 
The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is now in charge of the case. 
Is it because the minister did not do her job? I wonder.
<P>
	And now we have a similar situation. In the case of the <I>Irving 
Whale</I> last summer, work was suspended because the courts made 
that decision. The minister had announced publicly and to the 
media that she would decide Monday morning whether she would 
stop the work or not.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	The same day, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans was also 
telling the media that, definitely, no decision would be made; that 
the decision would be made on Friday and the ship would be raised 
on Friday. Is this not departmental conflict? Who is not doing their 
job?
<P>
	We do not need situations like this, and, moreover, when they 
involve danger, as in the case of the <I>Irving Whale</I>, we cannot make 
decisions just so we can be in the limelight or in the news or so we 
look good. We have to make logical decisions. We have to make 
environmental decisions, even if the cost is greater, because the 
risks of environmental dangers are high. We know very well that 
PCBs are getting into the ocean and that they will be around for 
hundreds and hundreds of years to come. We are destroying our 
marine ecosystem. We have to stop this sort of thing in areas that 
are as important as the environment.
<P>
	Throughout the entire process, the minister is under no legal 
obligation to agree with other federal or provincial departments. In 
most cases, he may, if he wishes, ask for help from other 
authorities. It is both unacceptable and inconceivable that the 
minister does not have to work with the officials of the Department 
of the Environment, in particular, and with other departments, in 
general. There must not be any dictatorship. You cannot arrive in a 
department and declare that you are going to run the whole show. 
This sort of thing has to be done with harmony, but up to now I 
have seen no sign of harmonization in this House. I have never seen 
any. So imagine what it will be like when we run into conflict.
<P>
	With positions being cut and some restraint to be exercised in 
public spending, the minister is creating duplication right within 
the federal government. What is more, the new powers of the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans are not exclusive, because they 
are not taking away from powers already in the hands of other 
ministers and stakeholders. So we may well see competition and 
overlap in connection with the standards and fines to be applied, 
priorities and the approaches taken.

<P>
	Last year, on the Standing Committee on the Environment and 
Sustainable Development, we worked for a year revising the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act, CEPA. While reviewing 
this law, we realized on several occasions that there were many 
problems and that it overlapped a lot with the Fisheries Act.
<P>
	How come the minister, who I think is not yet aware of this fact 
otherwise she would have answered us or she would have told us in 
committee what she knew about this report, has not read the report 
and made a decision yet? How do you explain the fact that the 
minister of fisheries has now come up with a bill after the Standing 
Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development 
worked on this issue for a year and gave the minister constructive 
suggestions regarding the environment? Why is the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans doing her job? I do not understand; this is not 
clear at all in my head.
<P>
	I am asking the Minister of the Environment to keep party 
politics out of this department, which is, in my opinion, the most 
important department here in this Parliament. This department 
should not be partisan. It should always focus on the ecosystem, on 
sustainable development. It should always make decisions for the 
future of our children, of Canada, of Quebec, and not partisan 
decisions.
<P>
	I would like to conclude my remarks by mentioning that a 
sovereign Quebec would give priority to the environment. If you 
ask Quebecers what importance they give the environment, they 
will give it top priority after health because they are aware that, if 
the environment is not protected, we will have no future. We will 
have no drinking water.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	Sure, we will always have problems but we must give priority to 
environmental issues. In this regard, the minister simply did not do 
her homework. She should go back and do her homework. I would 
like to see Bill C-98 referred to the environment committee. You 
would see that there would be many proposed amendments to this 
bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canada's motto is <I>a mari usque ad mare</I>, from sea to sea. It may be 
that Bloc members are upset because the title of the bill before us is 
an Act respecting ``the'' oceans of Canada. Had we used the 
singular, Bloc members might be happier today.
<P>
	Canada is bordered by the Pacific ocean, which gives us access 
to all sorts of foreign markets. It is important that Parliament pass 
the act respecting ``the'' oceans as quickly as possible. No, that 
legislation should certainly not be postponed to a later date.
<P>
	As you know, some people always want to postpone everything. 
In the last few days, we even heard some say  that the referendum 
should be postponed. The fact is that the referendum date must not 
be postponed, and nor should the review of the Oceans Act. We 
must put an end to uncertainty and we must do so in the best 
interests of Canada. As the hon. member for Laurentides just 
mentioned, we must make the best possible decisions for the future 
of both Canada and Quebec. This is why we are here.
<P>
	Federal-provincial considerations are a major component of this 
bill. Earlier, the member for Laurentides said that the proposed 
partnership agreements could be a source of conflict. It goes 
without saying that if you want to separate, partnership agreements 
are indeed very difficult to implement and can lead to conflict. 
However, if we want to get along, co-operate and reach 
agreements, anything is possible and partnership is definitely the 
best option for Canada today.
<P>
	I want to ask a question to the member for Laurentides, 
regarding federal-provincial relations. Does the hon. member know 
that the act allows for the implementation of guidelines on the 
quality of the marine environment, as well as-and I want to 
overlook her comments on the sources of conflict-the reaching of 
partnership agreements with other interested persons or groups? Is 
the hon. member for Laurentides aware of the importance of 
federal-provincial relations in that regard?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, once again I have a flagrant example 
of the member for Brome-Missisquoi's using environmental 
issues for reasons of petty partisan politics. Nothing surprising 
about that; that is his usual way of doing things.
<P>
	Yes, there will be a referendum in Quebec, and it has nothing at 
all to do with this bill. We are talking about a statute. Here in this 
House today the Minister also has made a highly patriotic speech, 
and when such questions are asked, do not try to tell me that the 
problem of an unworkable bill will be solved. Not in the least.
<P>
	I have not spoken of the referendum, I have spoken of a bill that 
we feel is unworkable. It will not work between departments and it 
will cause conflicts between federal departments. Imagine what 
will happen when it gets down to the provincial level. What we 
have here is a bill that needs to be redone. It has been badly drafted.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has given himself all sorts 
of powers not even within his jurisdiction. This should be handled 
by Environment.
<P>
	I strongly believe that the member for Brome-Missisquoi 
should study the environment a little more. It could not do any 
harm. Second, this is not a matter for partisan politics but truly a 
matter in which there are problems, one that is unclear, that has 
been dumped on the House and is unfamiliar to us, this Bill C-98. I 
reiterate my demand that it be studied in the  Department of the 
Environment, so that we can find out where it is headed. Let the 
Minister of the Environment do her homework for once and let her 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14878"> 14878 </A></B>
<P>
ensure that decisions affecting the Department of the Environment 
are made in conjunction with her department. When true 
environmental decisions are involved, let it be the Minister of the 
Environment who makes those decisions, and not the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans. It is Environment that possesses the 
environmental expertise, not Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	This is totally senseless. Why dump one's duties onto someone 
else? This is totally senseless. We are prepared, our consciousness 
is raised, very much so I believe, we are prepared to address this 
matter, to look at what can be done to ensure that it heads in the 
right direction, but not this way.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to address some of the concerns of the hon. member.
<P>
	Some of the points she has made about the environment are very 
important. I have made these points in the past about how 
important the environment is, how important it is for our future 
generations.
<P>
	I know she is concerned about the environment. I know that 
when she has an opportunity to really have a close look at this bill 
she will understand that it is very important for the environment. I 
know she is concerned about the duties of the Minister of the 
Environment. I can assure her that the Minister of the Environment 
would be willing to bring forward new ideas if she thought this in 
any way would impede upon her work as the Minister of the 
Environment.
<P>
	This bill will in fact create more opportunities for our coastal 
communities. Contrary to what the hon. member says, this will 
have no effect on provincial rights. In fact this approach is an 
integrated approach. The National Advisory Board on Science and 
Technology recommended this. It looked at it. We have to heed 
some of those recommendations. As we are often told by members 
on the opposite side, we as the government have to listen to some 
of the advisory boards we have. Should we reject what the National 
Advisory Board on Science and Technology said when it said we 
need an integrated approach, we need a better approach? I know 
she will want to support the idea of putting in protected marine 
areas.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I wonder if I might ask the 
parliamentary secretary for clarification. Following the 
intervention of the hon. member for Laurentides we were on 
questions and comments and not on debate. I wonder if he could 
clarify if he is engaging in debate or question and comment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> I am going to proceed to my question, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	The hon. member has noted how important the environment is. I 
agree with her that the fundamentals of the bill talk about 
sustainable environment, about protected marine areas and about 
managing our ecosystem. Are they not important for the 
environment, as she has said?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I realize that my time is running out. 
The secretary of state for fisheries and oceans said there was no 
likelihood of interference with provincial jurisdictions. But I have 
here a short text that says that the main source of contamination in 
coastal areas is not disposal at sea but urban waste water, urban and 
agricultural run-off, industrial waste, urban waste, uncontrolled 
dumping and erosion.
<P>
	This bill will open the door wide to interference in jurisdictions 
that are provincial and municipal as well.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	If the government starts creating conflict situations-and I refer 
not only to Quebec, but to provinces like New Brunswick and 
British Columbia that are already concerned, want to protect their 
coastal areas and their fisheries and say they want more powers in 
this area-if the government starts interfering again, the result will 
be chaos. The environment does not need that.
<P>
	I think anyone who, like the parliamentary secretary, is 
concerned about the environment should realize that we do not 
need further concentration of powers in Ottawa but more powers 
for the provinces which are closer to their ecosystems than the 
federal government and could play a far more important role than 
they do at the present time by assuming all authority over this area.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to support Bill C-98, the Canadian Oceans Act. The 
provisions contained in the legislation will be of tremendous 
benefit to all Canadians. Most especially, they will bring new 
opportunity to those Canadians who live and work in our coastal 
regions. It is this economic opportunity I wish to focus on today.
<P>
	Canada is such a large country that it is easy to overlook the fact 
that Canada is one of the world's great maritime nations. Our 
shores are bordered by three oceans: the Arctic, the Atlantic, and 
the Pacific. Our coastline is the longest in the world. We have the 
world's largest archipelago, the world's longest inland waterway, 
and the world's second-largest continental shelf.
<P>
	All this is about to get bigger in terms of doing a lot more out to 
the 200-mile limit. Under the terms of the 1992 United Nations 
convention on the law of the sea, which came into force in 
November last year, Canada can  turn its 200-mile fishing zone into 
a 200-mile exclusive economic zone. This gives us the right to 
extend Canadian economic environmental jurisdiction over almost 
<P>

<B><A NAME="14879"> 14879 </A></B>
<P>
five million square kilometres of coastal and ocean territory. The 
result is oceans of opportunity: opportunity to better protect our 
oceans' fragile resources, opportunity to strengthen our historic 
fisheries, and opportunity to channel creative energy towards a new 
ocean industry that can enhance the economic potential of our 
coastal communities.
<P>
	This is an opportunity our government recognized as essential 
for our future, and it is an opportunity our government intends to 
act upon to secure jobs and economic growth for all Canadians.
<P>
	For centuries the wealth of our oceans has sustained hundreds of 
communities, large and small, all along our Pacific, Atlantic, and 
Arctic coasts. In each region an entire culture and identity has been 
built around the exploitation of our ocean resources and maritime 
economy, especially around the three pillars of fishing, 
transportation, and tourism. However, in recent years these 
traditional activities have been supplemented by an increasing 
variety of new ocean-related industries, each with its own success 
story.
<P>
	For instance, with our world demand for protein from fish on the 
rise, aquaculture has become one of the fastest growing industries 
in Canada. With successful operations on both our east and west 
coasts, aquaculture revenues reached $280 million in 1993.
<P>
	At the same time, firms such as Geo-Resources, International 
Submarine Engineering, and others are leading the way in 
developing and applying high technology to oceans management 
and exploration. In Atlantic, Pacific, and central Canada, firms 
specializing in remote sensing, computerized geographic imaging, 
cold water technology, offshore and coastal engineering, and new 
sectors are creating thriving new enterprises capable of competing 
in the changing global marketplace.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	Furthermore, we are now realizing the promise of ocean energy 
exploration and development. After years of patience and 
investment, the Cohasset oil field to the southeast of Nova Scotia 
came onstream in June 1992. The giant Hibernia oil field off the 
coast of Newfoundland is scheduled to go into commercial 
production in 1997. Just this year, there have been new discoveries 
in Newfoundland itself.
<P>
	These are all positive developments. What is more, they come 
not a moment too soon. Canadians cannot escape the fact that our 
oceans are under increasing stress from such factors as overfishing, 
marine and land based sources of pollution, and longer term 
phenomena such as global warming.
<P>
	The collapse of our Atlantic groundfish industry has left some 
40,000 Canadians out of work. While lobster,  crab, and scallop 
fisheries are prospering, the Pacific salmon fishery is requiring 
closer and more careful management than ever.
<P>
	Clearly it is time to protect our marine environment and further 
diversify our marine economies. Our government has recognized 
both of these needs and we are taking action. We have acted in the 
international arena to strengthen the protection of straddling and 
highly migratory stocks. We have taken strong international action 
against overfishing and we are strictly enforcing fishing 
moratoriums on commercial fish stocks to give these resources a 
chance to rebuild.
<P>
	These are just first steps. We need to back these up with an 
integrated and comprehensive approach to ocean management that 
emphasizes environmental conservation as its first priority. We 
need to accelerate and develop our ocean industry strategies so that 
our coastal economies will be able to diversify and prosper in the 
new global economy.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, it goes without saying that you will 
have the floor immediately following question period.
<P>
	It being 2 p.m., we will go to statements by members.

	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke,

on having three levels of government: federal, provincial and 
territorial, and municipal. In my opinion, and I am sure in the 
opinion of many members of the House, municipal governments 
have not been given the national recognition they deserve. In 
Canada we are very fortunate to live in a nation where municipal 
governments work toward providing decent standards of every day 
life.
<P>
	Today we welcome the 36 reeves and the staff of Renfrew county 
council. They held the first ever county council meeting on 
Parliament Hill. I invited them here to hold one of their regular 
sessions as a gesture of appreciation for their work and to remind 
all Canadian citizens of the importance of their individual 
municipal governments.

dedication by all levels of government.

arrangements in many areas''. What kind of arrangements is he 
referring to? What miraculous offer would the federal government, 
which stubbornly refused to go along with the unanimous 
consensus among Quebec stakeholders on the manpower training 
issue, extend to us? Why did this government so abruptly shut 
down the military college in Saint-Jean last year, if Ottawa is 
prepared to offer a compromise solution after October 30?
<P>
	Is the ax that will fall on the unemployed after October 30 
included in these arrangements? The people of Quebec want to 
know why the Prime Minister of Canada wants to ``clobber them''

	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, equality, democracy and peace were the themes of the 
fourth UN conference on women recently held in Beijing. Just what 
was advanced by our Canadian delegation? Not equality but gender 
equality that put feminist issues above all other considerations in 
government policy and direction and called for a social revolution 
based on a new definition of gender, affirmative action and sexual 
and reproductive rights.
<P>
	Not equality, but a blatant refusal to speak against the most basic 
human rights abuses. That our minister would declare no problem 
after counting an equal number of heads in a preschool is an insult 
to the sensibilities of Canadians.
<P>
	Not democracy, as our delegation put forward a token 
representation of MPs, senators and academics. Instead Canadians 
were represented by bureaucrats with no accountability for policies 
that had no public input. Not peace, but division with over 500 
actions to be taken by the government. This agenda will drive a 
wedge between women and men, families, religion and custom.

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Canadian 
van line owners are very distressed about a new tendering process 
that has been put forward by the  Department of National Defence 
which will radically change how government contracts out moving 
services in Canada.
<P>
	The present tendering system ensures each local or regional 
moving company shares in the winning contracts by matching the 
lowest bid, thus everyone gets a piece of the pie. The new proposed 
tendering process will allow one bidder to take all, with tenders 
open to anyone in any country, thus creating a monopoly.
<P>
	If allowed to proceed, this new moving tendering process could 
destroy much of Canada's moving industry. Atlantic Canada will 
lose approximately 2,500 jobs.
<P>
	Atlantic Canada cannot afford to lose any more. I ask the 
government to stop this proposed new tendering process before 
jobs are lost and an industry is destroyed.

	Recently a woman from a Toronto women's centre wrote to an

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="REFERENDUMCAMPAIGN">REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, these 
past few days, Quebecers have had a foretaste of the arrogant and 
contemptuous tone the federalist side intends to use throughout the 
referendum campaign. When federalist spokespersons are not 
calling politicians elected by the people of Quebec traitors, they 
believe they have been vested with the mission of crushing once 
and for all any resistance from Quebec.
<P>
	The No side uses a mean and arrogant tone that reveals their 
desire to crush and clobber their opponents. They think that, if they 
are defeated, the claims, ideas and hopes they represent will 
disappear with them.
<P>
	As Lise Bissonnette wrote this morning in <I>Le Devoir</I>, the real 
strategist of the No side, the Prime Minister, has always wanted to 
put an end to Quebec's claims, hence the War Measures Act, the 
fight against Bill 101, the 1982 Constitution, the opposition to even 
the slightest demands of Quebec in the Meech Lake Accord and, 
now, the refusal to make any offer to Quebec. For the Prime 
Minister, even moderate nationalism, as practised by Robert 
Bourassa, Claude Ryan and even Daniel Johnson, is to be knocked

	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on August 24 the Saskatchewan Chiefs of Police 
Association reported that 100 per cent of the chiefs of police in that 
province are opposed to the planned gun registry. On August 22, I 
released the results of a survey showing that 91 per cent of RCMP 
officers in Saskatchewan are also opposed to the registration 
system. Last week a similar survey in Alberta showed that 85 per 
cent of RCMP officers opposed it.
<P>
	With such overwhelming opposition from police chiefs and 
police on the street how can the justice minister still claim he is 
bringing in the firearm registration system because police are 
requesting it?
<P>
	Between December 1994 and July 1995 Environics reported that 
support for a law requiring all firearms to be registered had 
dropped from 90 per cent to just 60 per cent. Public opinion polls 
show support for Bill C-68 dropping like a spent bullet. By the time 
the Senate is done reviewing it support will be below 50 per cent. 
How far does support for his bogus bill have to drop before the 
justice-

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
appears from a presentation made to the program review 
committee on the human resources investment fund by the Minister 
of Human Resources Development that the government strategy is 
to prepare Canadians for the transition to a low wage economy.
<P>
	The government is now talking about making targeted earnings 
supplements of a few thousand dollars for a year or so to encourage 
or coerce, as the case may be, unemployed high wage earners into 
accepting lower paid jobs.
<P>
	The Liberals say they want to help workers adjust financially and 
psychologically to the new situation. What the Liberals are really 
saying to a lot of Canadians is: ``Welcome to the post-NAFTA low 
wage economy where your children, no matter how much 
education they receive, should not expect to have the same standard 
of living as you''.
<P>
	Canadian wages are being driven to the bottom as part of the 
multinational corporate agenda which the Liberals are capitulating 
to at the same time as they attack the social wage of these same 
Canadians. This is not what the Liberals promised in 1993. They 
lied about free trade and now they are preparing Canadians to 
adjust to the way free trade-

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCE">UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Minister of Human Resources Development 
tried to play down the existence and importance of a document 
from his office dealing with his proposals for unemployment 
insurance reform.
<P>
	This morning, the official opposition released a letter from the 
Canadian Labour Congress which shows that Canada's labour 
unions are taking very seriously the threat to the unemployment 
insurance system represented by the minister's reform. The CLC 
sent its members an analysis of the devastating repercussions of the 
new cuts in unemployment insurance being prepared by the 
minister.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Instead of putting 
his tape on replay, would he admit that the new cuts his government 
has decided to postpone after the referendum will have the effect of 
denying two out of every three unemployed workers access to 
unemployment insurance?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the statement made by the Leader of the Opposition is not 
true. We do not intend to do as he claims.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think the Prime Minister and the government are playing 
down the apprehensions and concerns we are seeing in labour 
circles across Canada, not just in Quebec. This time, the alarm was 
sounded by the Canadian Labour Congress which represents all 
unions in Canada.
<P>
	I want to ask him whether he would confirm an analysis by the 
CLC which says that the new cuts in unemployment insurance will 
come down hard on seasonal and part time workers who will have 
to work twice as many hours for twice as many weeks to be eligible 
for reduced benefits. Does the government want to crush them as 
well?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I said to the Leader of the Opposition yesterday, we 
have had a chance to discuss this for months. A green paper on the 
subject was tabled a year ago. We have consulted with the 
committees of the House of Commons, the public, the Canadian 
Labour Congress and many other institutions. Representations are 
being made, and ultimately we will have a bill that will be tabled in 
Parliament. As in the case of every other bill, there will probably be 
amendments, and these will be either supported or rejected by hon. 
members. And we will know the result at that time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14884"> 14884 </A></B>
<P>
	What we are trying to do? We are trying to make sure that the 
reforms we need in Canada will give workers access to jobs. 
Everyone wants us to make changes in the unemployment 
insurance system. We clearly identified these in the budget, we 
have been discussing them for a year and a half here in the House, 
and in time reforms will be introduced. The minister is still 
working on his bill, and in November or December the Leader of 
the Opposition, provided he is still in the House, will have an 
opportunity to raise any questions he wants and make any 
appropriate suggestions, and the government will consider these 
before the final vote on the bill.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, whether or not the Leader of the Opposition 
will still be in the House is not up to him.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> Second, the reason we have these never ending 
debates on unemployment insurance reform is that the government 
does not have the courage to table its reform proposals, and people 
are concerned because of these documents from the minister's 
office-and he did not deny that; he admitted it was 
true-announcing horrendous cuts.
<P>
	Would the Prime Minister have the courage to tell us today that 
he will table the reform before the Quebec referendum?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we will table what should be tabled in Parliament when 
the reform is ready. The Leader of the Opposition is trying to scare 
everyone. Unemployment insurance reform will apply to all 
Canadians, not just to Quebecers.
<P>
	Now the opposition is trying to scare people. This morning they 
said senior citizens were in trouble. They are trying to scare 
Quebecers on the language issue. The opposition's scaremongering 
continues. We are getting one scare a day. We have 34 days left, so 
we can expect 34 more during that time.
<P>
	I simply want to say that we will keep doing what we have 
decided to do, which is to act responsibly as the government of this 
country, provide for good government, put the country on a sound 
financial footing and create jobs to restore the dignity of workers in 
our society. It is by providing good government for the people of 
Quebec that we will make them very happy to vote for Canada on 
October 30, by voting No to separation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, listening 
to the Prime Minister talk of a campaign of terror is a bit like 
hearing the bogey man accusing someone else of being scary, or the 
pot calling the kettle black.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Something he knows all about.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier: </B>To the man who has made the threats of the 
bogey man his stock in trade, the Canadian Labour Congress 
analysis-not the analysis by the Bloc, although it does reach the 
same conclusions-says that ``the main tools are training vouchers, 
training loans, wage subsidies, income supplements and daycare 
vouchers. These new approaches to program delivery will enable 
the federal government to bypass the provinces and deal with 
individuals directly''.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Does he acknowledge that 
the Canadian Labour Congress analysis confirms his government's 
intentions, the federal government's intentions, to interfere even 
more in the areas over which the government of Quebec has 
exclusive jurisdiction, in total disregard of the consensus that exists 
throughout Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have to begin by asking 
the hon. member to stop for a moment and ask himself about what 
he has been saying. He has taken a piece of paper prepared by the 
Canadian Labour Congress speculating on what it thinks might be 
some time in the future the proposals of the federal government and 
now declares that to be the reform.
<P>
	I deny totally the kind of conclusions the Canadian Labour 
Congress has put forward because frankly it does not know what it 
is talking about.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it will be 
noted that the Minister has referred to the analysis of a document 
originating with his office which he refuses to table before this 
House. He ought perhaps to remember that. This report also states 
that the objectives of the human resources development fund are 
fairly clear, namely to establish a program structure and a system 
of implementation which eliminate any need for provincial consent 
or participation.
<P>
	Will he acknowledge that, if he is deliberately putting off tabling 
his human resources reform, his unemployment insurance reform, 
the reason is that it comes down so terribly hard upon the 
unemployed, because it invades as never before the areas over 
which the government of Quebec has jurisdiction, and because this 
would be the price Quebecers would have to pay for a no in the 
referendum, if ever they should vote no and allow the minister to 
do as he pleases?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in listening to the  hon. 
member, there must be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14885"> 14885 </A></B>
<P>
a new slogan for the Bloc Quebecois which is, separation by words 
of desperation.
<P>
	The reality is that once again the hon. member is making a 
fundamental fallacy. He is taking conclusions from the Canadian 
Labour Congress. It may be that the Canadian Labour Congress 
wants to deny co-operation with the provinces. It may be that the 
Canadian Labour Congress wants to cut these kinds of programs. It 
may be its analysis that this is what should be done with the UI 
system but it is not ours.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	We have worked very hard over this past year. We have met 
consistently with the provinces and local communities. The whole 
thrust of the reform is to decentralize, to get real programs at the 
local level so people can tailor and design employment programs to 
fit the needs of those communities. That is what we are trying to 
do. That is the real meaning. It is not to turn power over to other 
bureaucracies but to give the power back to the people to choose 
how they want to get back to work.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for two years the provinces and Ottawa through the 
Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment have been 
discussing ways to harmonize environmental management in 
Canada. These talks have been progressing toward a framework 
agreement to rationalize responsibilities and eliminate costly 
overlap and duplication. But recently the federal Minister of the 
Environment pulled the plug on this process, refusing to proceed on 
an agreement that would have been a significant victory for the 
environment and for federal-provincial relations.
<P>
	Will the Minister of the Environment table the draft 
environmental management framework agreement negotiated with 
the provinces and let the House and the people of Canada decide 
whether or not it should proceed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the leader of the third party 
exhibits his ignorance on environmental issues when he says that. 
There were 11 annexes-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, the reason I took a few seconds is my 
own fault. I was distracted and apologize to the House for that. 
After having what was said explained to me, I will go on to the 
second question of the member for Calgary Southwest. Once again 
colleagues, I would urge you to be very judicious in the use of your 
language.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, of course we did not get an answer to the first question but 
we could see where it was headed.
<P>
	There are two sides to this story and it is particularly important 
that the side of the provinces be known in the House. The Alberta 
government believes the minister deliberately scuttled the 
agreement because of an unfounded fear that somehow the federal 
government's role in the environment might be weakened, a fear of 
decentralization. This was despite the fact that every province was 
prepared to recognize in writing the need for a strong federal 
presence.
<P>
	Why does the government consistently reject every provincial 
attempt to streamline government services, harmonize regulation 
and eliminate costly red tape if those attempts include any 
significant element of decentralization?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there were 11 annexes in the 
environmental management framework agreement. The federal 
government is prepared to proceed with 10 of those annexes. The 
reason the annexes were not put forward to the public was that the 
provincial governments led by the province of Alberta refused to 
publish those 10 annexes.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	I will quote what the minister of the environment said about the 
role of the federal government under his vision for Alberta. He 
said: ``You can have the national parks and the Indians. We want to 
look after all the rest''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the environmental management fiasco is a symptom of a 
deeper problem with the government. There are too many old style 
ministers who cling to the obsolete notion that any change in 
federal-provincial relations is to be resisted if it includes any 
element of decentralization.
<P>
	The Minister of Health resisted when we talked about 
decentralizing the financing of health care. The Minister of Human 
Resources Development resisted in his department and now the 
Minister of the Environment resists an agreement unless it makes 
Ottawa the centre of the universe.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Why does he not send a 
clear signal to all Canadians and all provinces that Ottawa is 
prepared to accept the principle of decentralization? Why does he 
not send it by removing those ministers who consistently obstruct 
the implementation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, since I became the Minister 
of the Environment I have signed environmental agreements with 
every province including the province of Alberta.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14886"> 14886 </A></B>
<P>
	I would ask whether the public believes there is a national role 
to play for a national government. When we are talking, for 
example about automobiles, does it make sense to have 10 
standards for 10 provinces? Or would it make much more sense 
to the Canadian consumer to have one national standard for 
vehicle emissions? There is a way of doing things logically, not 
through the knee-jerk decentralization being proposed by the 
leader of the third party.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCE">UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE</A></H3>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister. While the budget announced 
additional cuts of over $1.5 billion on the backs of the unemployed, 
the unemployment insurance account was heading toward a surplus 
of nearly $5 billion for 1995 alone. We must not forget that the 
government has not put a penny in the unemployment insurance 
fund since 1991. Worse yet, Ottawa is using the account surplus to 
fund new intrusions into training.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister acknowledge that increasing the 
unemployment insurance fund surplus by cutting benefits to the 
unemployed and using this surplus to fund new federal intrusions 
into manpower training is totally disgusting?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raises an 
important question about the application of the UI surplus.
<P>
	The UI fund is set up over the period of the business cycle to be 
self-financing. In those periods when there is a recession or a heavy 
draw on the UI fund, the government finances the UI system, as we 
had to do during the late eighties and early nineties in the previous 
government when the fund went into a deficit of close to $11 
billion.
<P>
	We are now simply paying off that deficit, but the government 
had to finance it through its own borrowing during that period of 
time. When the economy improves, as it is now doing under this 
administration, we begin to build up a surplus-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Did I hear a loud 
voice in support of that notion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> It is clear that over 
the life of the business cycle it is important to make sure there is a 
reserve in the UI fund so that we will not run into a position as the 
previous government did, of which the Leader of the Opposition 
was a  member, where all of a sudden it dropped premium rates and 
then had to jack them way up. As a result, it made the recession 
even worse.
<P>
	I remind the hon. member that she was a member of a committee 
of the House of Commons that looked at the whole UI question and 
recommended: ``The UI account be permitted to accumulate a 
surplus to accommodate changes in premium rates over the 
business cycle''. That was a recommendation of a committee in 
which the hon. member was a full participant.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister should have read the minority report. While there has been 
no net job creation in the past eight months, the government has 
insisted on repayment of $6 billion in less than two years creating a 
surplus this year of $5 billion, which is being used to impose 
decisions and guidelines on the provinces that they do not want.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister use the money from cuts made to 
the unemployed to get round the provinces, going over their heads, 
in order to impose its views directly on organizations and 
individuals? If he says this is not true, let him table his reform.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member puts in her 
question the idea that there has been no major change in 
employment or unemployment rates in the country.
<P>
	I point out that since the government came into office the 
unemployment rate in the constituency of Mercier, which the hon. 
member represents, has dropped by 4.5 per cent. What will put in 
danger the thousands of jobs we created in the hon. member's 
riding is if Quebec decides to separate, which it will not do. The 
threat and uncertainty of the separation movement endangers job 
creation for Canada and Quebec. If the hon. member really wants to 
protect jobs in her riding, she would vote no in the coming

	My question is for the Prime Minister. Is the government now 
prepared to be clear to Quebecers that this referendum is a yes 
or a no to separation and that the no side must win for Quebecers 
to enjoy the benefits of Confederation?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think the Minister of Finance was clear in the very good 
speech he made today explaining the consequences of a no vote for 
the economy of Quebec.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary is also for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Did the government explain that its statements regarding a 
political and economic union are not a threat but represent the best 
interests of the rest of Canada; that Canada will never allow a 
foreign country to become involved in this Parliament, in its 
monetary policy, in its equalization payments; and that, if Quebec 
votes No, it will become a foreign country like any other?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is what we have always maintained. What the Bloc 
Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois are proposing is Quebec's 
separation, except that they are trying to hide this behind all kinds 
of words designed to obscure the truth.
<P>
	They tried to come up with what they said was a winning 
question, but look at the confusion they have created. A third of the 
people who say they will vote Yes think Quebec will remain a 
Canadian province after separation. That is what poll takers are 
reporting today.
<P>
	They should be completely honest and tell Quebecers that they 
are separatists. They know full well that Quebecers will vote to stay 
in Canada. I know that, and the Leader of the Opposition knows it 
too because, as recently as last March, he was saying: ``We must 
change the question because if we tell the truth, we cannot win; we 
need a winning question''. Quebecers can now see through the 
opposition leader's game.

	Yesterday in the House the minister stated that he was going to 
follow the recommendations of the task force on seasonal work.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	Now, the key recommendation by that task force is to not create 
two classes of unemployed persons through penalty clauses for 
seasonal workers such as those in the minister's document which 
were made public this past weekend.
<P>
	Does the minister confirm the Canadian Labour Congress 
analysis that he will be coming down heavily on seasonal and part 
time workers by requiring ``twice as many weeks and hours of 
work before they are eligible for benefits''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic

months ago, following publication of the report and looking at the

pursuing the notion of a two-tier system.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr.

pong balls by the federal government.
<P>
	Is the minister aware that all the proposals for reform originating 
within his department include direct attacks on seasonal workers in 
Quebec and on what awaits them if they vote no in the referendum? 
If you want to clear away this doubt once and for all, well then just 
table your reform now.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

in touch with various groups representing seasonal workers, he 
would know that we have been consistently and constantly working 
with them. We have had meetings with construction workers. We 
have been taking a number of recommendations they have been 
putting forward. We have worked on the sector councils which 
represent agricultural workers. We have been working consistently 
with them to get their recommendations.
<P>
	The difference is that the hon. member takes a piece of paper put 
forward by the CSN in Quebec and tries to treat it as the gospel 
truth. Whereas our view is to sit down with the people who really 
know what is going on, talk with them and get their 
recommendations.

Development.
<P>
	By once again limiting the access of the thousands of 
unemployed to unemployment insurance, the minister's proposals 
will result in more unemployed being pushed toward welfare. The 
cuts he has made to unemployment insurance since 1994 have 
forced 5,000 Quebec families to seek social assistance.
<P>
	Will the minister acknowledge that the new proposals for cuts to 
unemployment insurance analyzed by the Canadian Labour 
Congress will heighten the move of thousands of unemployed from 
unemployment insurance to welfare? Is that what awaits Quebec 
workers the day after a no vote?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think it has already been 
made clear that I do not think very much of this document of the 
Canadian Labour Congress. It is simply not based on any proper or 
realistic analysis.
<P>
	We have not decided yet exactly what the elements of our 
proposal will be, so how they can go about speculating on what the 
impacts will be is beyond me. I guess you need to be an economist 
for the CLC to figure that out.
<P>
	I want to make one point very clear to the hon. member about the 
impacts. In the month of August, for which we have the most recent 
statistics, we know that the welfare caseload in Quebec dropped by 
13,000. One of the reasons is because we are making real headway 
in getting people back to work. There were over 110,000 new jobs 
created in Quebec during that period of time.
<P>
	We still say that the best way to deal with poverty and the best 
way to deal with unemployment is to help people get a job.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let us set the record straight about the number of people on 
welfare in Quebec. Statistics provided by the Quebec department of 
income security reveal that, in July 1995, there were 799,900 
people on welfare; in August 1995, the figure was 799,400, 500 
fewer; and, in September 1995, there were 800,100 people on 
welfare in Quebec. So either the minister does not know how to 
count or he spends his time inventing figures.
<P>
	The Prime Minister, who always has the word honesty on the tip 
of his tongue, should ask his minister to make use of this virtue in 
tabling his famous document. What is preventing the minister from 
acting honestly and openly?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> I know this might be a little delicate for the 
hon. member, but if he is asking about the source of the figures I 
would simply like to confirm that on April 27 the prime minister of 
Quebec, the Hon. Jacques Parizeau, said that between April of 1994 
and April 1995 the number of social assistance recipients in the 
province of Quebec declined by 60,000.
<P>
	If he wants to call into question the figures put forward by the 
prime minister of Quebec, certainly he is simply following in the 
footsteps of his leader, who seems to be always second guessing the

also said that easy parole requirements provide violent offenders a

to ensure that the pension system is sustainable in the long term''. 
Yesterday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs clearly contradicted his 
colleague by saying that Ottawa would definitely not touch old age 
pensions.
<P>
	In view of this flagrant contradiction by two senior ministers in 
his cabinet, would the Prime Minister confirm clearly that the old 
age pension reform is ready but will be put off until after the 
referendum so seniors will not know the scope of the cuts that await 
them?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

budget statement that the government will do nothing to jeopardize 
the security of our seniors who are on public pension plans.
<P>
	What we did say was that in order to maintain the sustainability 
of the Canada pension plan there has to be a review. As the hon. 
member knows, there are substantial changes going on in the 
demographics of this country. The CPP does not apply to Quebec, 
but it has a relationship because the two pension plans have a 
certain compatibility. We do want to have a public review before 
the Minister of Finance meets with his provincial colleagues by the 
end of the year. That is one reason it is very important that we be 
able to get out for public view  how the Canada pension plan itself

meaningful way for the restitution of victims of crime through the 
criminal justice system in ways that are innovative and will be 
effective. That is the response of the government toward victims of

	This minister is willing to spend hundreds of millions of tax 
dollars on a registry that frontline police officers and 
criminologists say will have little or no impact to reduce crime, but 
he is not willing to make criminals pay for their actions by 
financial compensation.

that you push the preamble so far that you seem to want the 
Speaker to intervene earlier than he ordinarily would.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

hon. member cited are the most important and dramatic reflections 
of what is taking place in Canada overall and the changing society 
we are in.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member to look very carefully at the cause 
of that circumstance. It is because single parent  mothers have 
substantially fallen out of the labour market. There has been almost 
a 15 per cent decline of single parents in the labour market. 
Therefore, the answer to their problem is not more transfer 
payments. The answer is helping them get back to jobs, get back 
into the labour market, get back to being employed. That is the 
most effective way of putting additional income in the hands of our 
single parents across Canada.

act.
<P>
	What we need is a coherent oceans policy that embodies a full 
range of economic environmental issues that pertain to the 
management of our oceans and coastal territories. Our government 
realizes this is the time for action in this area.
<P>
	Ocean stakeholders have been calling for a coherent vision for 
some time now which is why soon after coming to office the Prime 
Minister called on the National Advisory Board on Science and 
Technology to study, consult and report on Canada's oceans policy. 
It did not give the federal government high marks.
<P>
	The NABST report criticized the federal government for the 
neglect of its ocean responsibilities. It then suggested steps to set 
up our oceans policy on a more favourable course. These steps 
included an oceans management strategy and new legislation in the 
form of an oceans act.
<P>
	I am proud to say that my colleague the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans did not waste any time in responding to these suggestions. 
Since the NABST report and the minister's 1994 release of the 
vision for oceans management, the minister and his officials have 
consulted widely with many stakeholders in the oceans sector. 
They have spoken with fishermen, business representatives, 
government officials, aboriginal groups, environmental interests 
and others. The result is a set of proposals for an ocean 
management 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14892"> 14892 </A></B>
<P>
strategy to be developed by the federal government in partnership 
with other key oceans interests.
<P>
	The plan as outlined by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is 
to create an integrated oceans management  strategy that would 
have as its primary goal the sustainable use of our ocean resources. 
A second goal would be to help each coastal region bring together 
and co-ordinate the elements needed to build a flourishing and 
diverse ocean based economy.
<P>
	The concept has received widespread support throughout the 
oceans sector. However, before the government and its partners can 
proceed any further with this initiative, we must establish the 
legislative framework within which an integrated strategy can 
operate. This is what we are doing now by introducing the oceans 
act.
<P>
	It is fundamental that the oceans act is enabling legislation. It 
removes barriers and sets the stage for Canadians to begin a new 
era in their relationship with the sea.
<P>
	The oceans act has three main components. There is the 
declaration of Canada's jurisdiction over both its exclusive 
economic zone of 200 nautical miles and a contiguous zone of 24 
nautical miles. Another component is the provision for the 
development and implementation of a national oceans management 
strategy based on sustainable development and integrated 
management of oceans coastal activities and resources and the 
consolidation and clarification of federal responsibilities for 
managing Canada's oceans. These are all essential steps if 
Canadians are going to work together to develop a new, integrated 
approach to oceans management.
<P>
	First, it is absolutely vital that the Canadian government expand 
its jurisdiction over the ocean areas within our 200-mile limit, 
implementing the sovereign rights to which we know are under the 
law of the sea. This is essential both to protect the environmental 
integrity of these areas and to ensure that the oceans' precious 
resources are available for use by future generations of Canadians.
<P>
	Second, an integrated approach to oceans management will help 
ocean stakeholders to consider a wide range of ocean activities all 
in one big picture. This includes everything from shipping, 
offshore oil and gas exploration, fisheries management and coastal 
development to the creation of special marine protected areas for 
fragile ecosystems. An integrated ocean strategy will help decision 
makers to consider environmental and developmental issues in 
relation to each other rather than in isolation. As was the case in the 
past, in this way it will enable Canadians to achieve a better 
balance between environmental protection and human activity than 
we have ever had before.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	Third, it is essential that the federal government and its partners 
in the oceans sector work together to bring an end to the current ad 
hoc fragmented approach to ocean management that has worked for 
so long to the  detriment of both the environment and many of our 
ocean industries.
<P>
	Ocean and coastal issues cross many jurisdictions. They can be 
international, national, regional, provincial and local all at the 
same time. In the past, this has given rise to a host of problems, 
including conflicts over jurisdiction, duplication and inaction. Yet 
marine ecosystems know no artificial boundaries and neither do 
trade and business. It is time to work together in a new spirit of 
co-operation and to learn to harmonize our efforts.
<P>
	All of these steps will strengthen our ability to protect the ocean 
environment. They will also enhance the potential of the many 
ocean based industries that are so important to our coastal 
communities. Allow me to take a few minutes to outline some of 
the benefits of both the oceans act and the planned oceans 
management strategy to industry.
<P>
	First, extending our economic and environmental jurisdiction 
out to 200 nautical miles will provide greater stability to all of our 
ocean industries. It will build upon the exclusive fishing zone 
which we already have and will expand to include other 
opportunities for development. It will further cement our right to 
protect the environment.
<P>
	Second, the clarification of federal roles and ocean 
responsibilities will help to simplify the relations between 
government and other stakeholders. Business will especially 
appreciate both this move and the consolidation of regulations.
<P>
	Third, the commitment to build partnerships will allow other 
levels of government, industry and non-governmental 
organizations and other interested stakeholders to develop shared 
goals in oceans management. This approach should lead to better 
communication, greater co-operation and increasing 
harmonization. All these are welcome spinoffs for industry that 
should reduce the cost of doing business and stimulate growth.
<P>
	Fourth, an increased emphasis on the co-ordination and 
dissemination of scientific, environmental and management 
information should place our ocean policies and practices on a 
much firmer scientific footing. In addition, improved 
communications between the private sector and federal scientists 
should stimulate innovation and technology transfer.
<P>
	As a package, these benefits will help to generate new 
opportunities and improve the business environment for our ocean 
industries. An integrated oceans management strategy will place 
Canadians at the forefront of ocean management and the 
development of related technologies.
<P>
	Canadians already have many of the needed tools to fill this 
ocean vision and to move ahead in the world economy. Both our 
west and east coasts have world class  research facilities that make 
important contributions to an international climate and oceans 
research. Both of these regions have clusters of thriving private 
sector enterprise that have the know-how to design, apply and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14893"> 14893 </A></B>
<P>
market specialized ocean based technology to clients around the 
world.
<P>
	Allow me to provide a few examples of how the Canadian 
oceans industry is selling its products and expertise to clients 
around the world.
<P>
	A good example is New East Technologies of Newfoundland. 
New East started out as a ship to shore radio business but a few 
years ago started to design and build an improved switch system 
that routes radio signals to specific destinations by satellite. Now a 
cluster of satellite communication firms, New East companies 
track the progress of ocean going ships and provide radio links for 
some 40 airlines. In addition, it is exploring the telephone 
switching equipment markets of Hong Kong and China.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	Another example is AGI, Ariel Geomatics of Nova Scotia. 
Formed in 1993, this growing company undertakes airborne 
environmental mapping and monitoring surveys using a compact 
airborne spectrographic imager, CASI for short. AGI is one of the 
few private sector owners of this advanced technology.
<P>
	AGI has used CASI technology for ocean mapping but is also 
marketing its potential application in other areas such as land use 
and vegetation studies, urban mapping, agriculture, forestry and 
geological work. Already its services have been used by clients in 
Italy, Chile and the United Kingdom.
<P>
	The future of this new industry looks bright and with the oceans 
act and the oceans management strategy it will look even brighter. 
Countries ratifying the United Nations convention on the law of the 
sea will have to map the 200 mile offshore exclusive economic 
zones. With Canada's demonstrated leadership in this field, many 
of these nations will turn to Canadian companies to assist them in 
fulfilling these and other requirements.
<P>
	The oceans act and the oceans management strategy will help 
Canadians to make the most of our ocean expertise and resources. 
The benefits will be many and varied. The extension of Canadian 
jurisdiction and the adoption of an integrated approach of fisheries 
management will better enable our Pacific and Atlantic fisheries to 
achieve sustainable harvest levels. The more effective protection of 
our marine and coastal environment will make Canada a prime 
destination for ecotourism. The application of new technologies 
will make Canada a world leader in aquaculture, marine safety in 
shipping, resource assessment and offshore petroleum production.
<P>
	I am very proud of our government's leadership in working with 
Canadians to draw up the oceans act and  oceans management 
strategy. Together they are proof of the government's commitment 
to create prosperity and a better quality of life for all Canadians. An 
ocean of opportunity lies before us. With careful consultation, 
management and sensitivity to the environment all of our ocean 
industries can be encouraged to flourish and grow.
<P>
	I encourage all my colleagues to join me in voting in favour of 
this long term oceans vision for Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his intervention. I would like 
to set him straight on some very important issues in western 
Canada, on the coast. The member mentioned we do not have a 
problem with shellfish. That is simply untrue.
<P>
	Shellfish stocks on the west coast are being pillaged. They have 
been pillaged for years. Even with abalone, which was banned in 
1989, there has been widespread poaching of abalone all over the 
coast, in Nanaimo, in Victoria, in Sooke. Stocks of mussels and 
various other subspecies of shellfish, geoducks, abalone, are being 
pillaged all over the west coast.
<P>
	DFO officers have been told to look the other way when this is 
happening. This is a problem of low level management. They have 
been told not to enforce the laws in fisheries.
<P>
	The ministry cannot even handle two miles out of the country, let 
alone 200 miles. I suggest it get its act together now, otherwise we 
will not have any fishery left on the west coast.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member what he and his ministry will do to help 
the decimated subspecies of groundfish, of salmon and of shellfish 
on the west coast so we can avert an east coast disaster, because we 
are close to that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question.
<P>
	All hon. members know the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
has taken a lead role in conservation in the international 
community. When I was at the recent convention in St. Petersburg, 
many people came up to me and said they were glad we have a 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans willing to take a lead role. He has 
put conservation on the front lines. He has put sustainability of 
fisheries on the front lines. He has made people all over the world 
aware of how important our fisheries are and how important it is to 
have a sustainable fishery and how important conservations is. The 
minister has taken a lead role in terms of assuring we as Canadians 
take a lead role.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	If the hon. member would look at what happened in the United 
Nations on the convention on straddling stocks and migratory 
stocks, it was Canada that took the lead role. It was the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans who took the lead role to ensure that even 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14894"> 14894 </A></B>
<P>
beyond the  200 mile zone we have a dispute mechanism system so 
the international community will respect our marine resources.
<P>
	The minister has admitted we can do a better job. We can 
improve the way we are doing things. I talked about the 40,000 
Canadians who are not working because of the collapse of the 
groundfish. We have to work harder. We have to ensure we do have 
a sustainable fishery. The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has put 
that as his number one priority. He has taken the lead not only in 
Canada but he is known as someone who has taken the lead in the 
international community in ensuring we preserve our marine 
resources and that we have a sustainable fishery for future 
generations and that we preserve our coastal communities and their 
economies.
<P>
	The bill will ensure that we look at our oceans on an ecosystem 
basis, not manage on a species basis. It ensures we take into 
consideration coastal communities and the economy. We have to 
treat our oceans as an asset. We have to ensure exploitation of those 
resources are done in a way that we have a sustainable fishery to 
protect our coastal communities and to ensure they have an 
ongoing fishery for the long term.
<P>
	I assure the member the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans will 
take a lead. I hope the hon. member will take the opportunity to 
study this bill. I know he will support it because of his concern that 
we have an ongoing sustainable fishery.
<P>
	I assure the hon. member we will have strong enforcement. As 
he knows, we have increased the enforcement budget on the west 
coast to make sure all people comply with the Fisheries Act and we 
will make sure we take action when someone does not abide by the 
Fisheries Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try to use 
the few minutes that are left to make a comment and put a question 
to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans.
<P>
	First of all, in his answer, he often referred to ``our good minister 
of fisheries who did this and that''. I would like him to focus on 
Bill C-98, which will become an act of Parliament.
<P>
	This means that the law will still be in place even after the 
current minister of fisheries leaves his post. So he should not cite 
the current minister's popularity as the reason why things will stay 
the same in the future. He should be aware of that. I know that the 
hon. member comes from the west coast while I come from the east 
coast. He probably attended the meeting of fisheries ministers in 
Victoria last year. Since the parliamentary secretary has invited us 
to read the bill carefully, I would like to hear his comments on 
clauses 30 and 31, which provide that the provinces will be 
consulted only on the  same basis as all other parties interested in 
ocean management that the department wants to consult with.
<P>
	I am getting to my question. I understand that, at last year's 
meeting of fisheries ministers in Victoria, British Columbia was 
ready to take on part of the responsibilities for fisheries 
management, as were Newfoundland and Quebec. This is the 
department's first opportunity to answer publicly, and from what I 
understand, there is no link, no consultation hierarchy.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	Is this the future of Canada, all interested parties on an equal 
footing while the provinces must fend for themselves? Is the 
parliamentary secretary endorsing this kind of attitude? I would 
like him to comment on this.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. I also thank him for his contribution to the Standing 
Committee on Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	I was at that meeting and just as in any other government 
department if there are areas in which we can improve the way 
fisheries and oceans works, if we can eliminate areas of duplication 
and if there are areas in which we can create more efficiencies, we 
are open to that. The minister is very open to that. He has stated we 
always want to look at how we can improve things.
<P>
	One of the things which was done, of which the hon. member is 
aware, was the merger with the coast guard. That was part of a 
process to create a synergy in which we can operate more 
efficiently and in which there is greater flexibility.
<P>
	The hon. member should support the bill because it takes a much 
broader view of our oceans. The bill does not in any way take away 
from provincial rights. It will enable us to work with the provinces. 
It will encourage us to all work together. For those reasons I hope 
the hon. member will support the bill.
<P>
	Part of the reason the bill came about was the National Advisory 
Board on Science and Technology said as a federal government we 
have to do a better job in managing our oceans, that we are not 
doing a very good job. We accepted its advice.
<P>
	We will have to manage in an ecosystem and in broader terms. 
We have the longest shoreline in the world and we have to look at it 
differently. We have to look at our oceans in terms of an asset we 
have to treat with respect. When we exploit that asset we have to 
look at what the interdependence is. The bill finally brings together 
a strategy on how to deal with our oceans.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with a 
great deal of interest to the words of my friend across the way. I am 
a little surprised at some of the conclusions he is drawing with 
respect to Bill C-98.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14895"> 14895 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-98 at first blush looks like a pretty innocuous bill. It is 
a good bill in some respects. It recognizes Canada's jurisdiction 
over an exclusive economic zone and a contiguous zone in 
accordance with the United Nations convention on the law of the 
sea. That is a positive move.
<P>
	It is also supposed to allow the management of all oceans and 
coastal activities to be co-ordinated under the oceans management 
strategy and it tries to clarify federal responsibilities in the 
management of our oceans. I say it is supposed to and tries because 
the bill is an attempt to address the concerns of the oceans and the 
fisheries, but it is a failure.
<P>
	The bill manages to impose a new tax on fishermen. It manages 
to retain the duplication in the bureaucracy which exists now. It 
also manages to introduce new levels of bureaucracy.
<P>
	This is not what fishermen want. It is not what Canadians want 
or deserve. Canadians want less government, not more. The 
minister and members of the Liberal government seem to be the 
only people who do not understand that.
<P>
	The bill represents the Liberal government's complete lack of 
understanding of what life is like in Canada as a taxpayer. What 
will it take for the government to understand it is impossible for 
Canadians to shoulder any more of an already unbearable tax 
burden?
<P>
	What will it take to make the government understand the 
fishermen of Canada, already victims of a fisheries crisis on both 
coasts, can barely make ends meet right now? It is either a 
complete and utter misunderstanding on the part of the minister, 
although not surprising since he just awarded himself a generous 
pension out of all proportion to what most Canadians could ever 
expect, or it is a complete disdain for the plight of the fishermen. 
As long as his pockets are full and he does not have to make serious 
cuts in his department, he simply does not care. Look at the attitude 
he had toward the Canadian taxpayers when he refurbished his 
office last year at the cost of a couple hundred thousand dollars.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	As I said, times are tough for most people involved in the fishery 
in Canada, but the fisheries minister proposes a new tax on them 
anyway. Clause 49, page 21 of the bill, explains that the fees are for 
the service provided by DFO. Would that be the privilege to fish? 
This is not a service. It also states that fees may not exceed the cost 
of providing the service. Would that be the cost of DFO, TAGS, 
unemployment insurance, and other social programs or what? 
Where does it end?
<P>
	A tax would only serve to hurt an industry that is already in 
trouble. DFO already collects $13 million in fees from fishermen, 
and it wants to increase that to $50 million. That is a 400 per cent 
increase paid in one lump sum. The fees are based on the landed 
value of the catch  but are paid in one lump sum at the beginning of 
the season. They will be incremental, not fixed.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary said last week in response to 
questions that were asked in the House that there had not been an 
increase since 1985 and therefore he was condoning the decision. A 
400 per cent increase paid in one lump sum is not reasonable. 
Imagine if you will your hydro bill going up 400 per cent in one 
lump sum, or your phone bill or your mortgage payment. If this 
were happening to me I would push my MP to oppose such 
attempts. But alas, Atlantic fishermen have no one to turn to. 
Reform is the only party here to hear their voice.
<P>
	This tax is a way for the Liberals to get the fishermen out of the 
industry. The minister wants to tax them out of the water. The 
minister calls this a user fee, but he is wrong. User fees are in return 
for services rendered. There are no services rendered here.
<P>
	There are 31 Atlantic Canadian Liberal MPs and one from an 
extinct party. Where do the fishermen have to go? Reform is their 
only voice. We were in Atlantic Canada a couple of weeks ago and 
this is what we heard consistently. I feel rather bad for the Liberal 
MPs who come from Atlantic Canada who are going to be required 
to support the bill, because the people in Atlantic Canada are going 
to remember them for it.
<P>
	The minister enjoys trying to impress the international 
community, but what about Canadians? Is the tax supposed to 
impress them?
<P>
	Let us talk about another aspect of the bill; it is called 
partnershipping. This means that the minister under the bill will 
have the discretion to enter into partnership agreements on the 
management of the fishery resource in Canada-at his discretion.
<P>
	I would like to read an excerpt from a letter I received from 
people in Atlantic Canada who are concerned about where this is 
going to lead. I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In general, our concerns arise out of a potential that the Bill will permit 
delegation of actual resource management authority to anyone whom the 
Minister may see fit to nominate for this purpose. This regime has potential to be 
even more unpredictable and unchallengeable than the present ``absolute 
discretion'' of the Minister for which Section 7 of the Fisheries Act provides. 
``Management'' of fisheries resources (including such decisions as access to 
and allocation of the resource) are critically important to individual fishermen. 
The delegation of such decisions to committees, who are not subject to even the 
dubious control of political accountability, would create opportunities for 
management by special-interest groups.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Fisheries management in Atlantic Canada has had a dismal history of 
inability to ensure that the greatest good accrues to the greatest number of 
participants in the industry. See, for example, the third report of the Standing 
Senate Committee on Fisheries, dated June 23, 1993. Strong leadership, a fair 
and reviewable decision-making process, and clear legislative mandates as to 
exactly whom benefits from the fishery are to principally accrue to, are required 
to address and to correct the fundamental problems in the industry.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14896"> 14896 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	The special provision in Bill C-98 which raises the concern 
expressed above is in Section 32(c):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>32. For the purpose of the implementation of integrated management plans, 
the Minister may</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) on his own or her own or jointly with another person or body or with 
another minister, board or agency of the Government of Canada,</BLOCKQUOTE>
(i) establish advisory or management bodies and appoint or designate, as 
appropriate, members of those bodies, and (ii) recognize established 
advisory or management bodies;
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The scope to which this provision would permit delegation of unfettered and 
unreviewable authority to unidentified and unaccountable persons is of great 
concern to the independent fishermen whom it is my privilege to represent.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Speaker, you can see there is a great deal of concern in 
Atlantic Canada over these partnership provisions in Bill C-98.
<P>
	Let us talk for a minute about the bureaucracy. Will the size of 
the bureaucracy be affected in any way by Bill C-98? Is this 
consolidation of legislation under one umbrella called the Canada 
oceans act going to in any way affect the bureaucracy? On paper 
the shuffle looks good, but the reality is it is not going to affect the 
bureaucracy in any tangible way.
<P>
	The DFO is already a bloated department and is extremely top 
heavy. With the cutbacks we see the minister is talking about 
destaffing lighthouses while the offices in Ottawa on Kent Street 
remain fully staffed. Nobody has made any concerted effort to 
rationalize DFO's bureaucracy from the top down. They are 
starting from the bottom up. We see conservation officers being 
taken off the beat, we see enforcement officers being taken off the 
beat, but we do not see the bureaucracy addressed in any tangible 
way.
<P>
	This bill was obviously drafted by bureaucrats, not 
parliamentarians. I guess we cannot expect them to address the 
need for cuts by cutting their own department, can we? It is really 
unfortunate that with this opportunity the minister and the 
government did not seize it and seriously address the size of DFO's 
bureaucracy.
<P>
	Let us talk about ocean protection. Yes, this will be a step toward 
ratifying the United Nations convention on the law of the sea, but 
what else? What about the extension of the 200-mile limit? The 
minister crusaded so proudly against the Spanish fleet off our 
Grand Banks, and he was supported by a great number of 
Canadians for doing so, but what of the protection he so strongly 
hinted was on its way? This bill does absolutely nothing to address 
the extension of the 200-mile limit to cover the nose and the tail of 
the Grand Banks. I understand the minister made such indications 
here in the House earlier today. I am here to say that it does nothing 
to extend Canada's jurisdiction in those areas. This bill does not  
give the governing body any real authority. It has no teeth. 
Governing is only possible with authority.
<P>
	As with gun control, cabinet will iron out the details of this bill 
later. We are talking about order in council decisions. 
Understandably, the fishermen in the industry do not trust it. After 
all, it was the government's mismanagement that got us into this 
whole mess in the first place. Why trust them? They have only 
shown that their own interests are at heart and not those of their 
constituents.
<P>
	This bill does not invoke thoughts of government accountability 
in the minds of Canadians and in particular in the minds of 
fishermen. Instead it promotes fears of trickery and backroom 
dealings. The Liberal cabinet needs to make the decisions by order 
in council because even some of their own members are upset 
about this bill. We all know what the Prime Minister does with 
members who represent their constituents.
<P>
	Cabinet could hike fees again next year without parliamentary 
scrutiny and without public debate. It is no holds barred for the 
Liberals. These are legitimate concerns. If the Liberals were 
implementing legislation they knew would better the fishery, why 
hide behind cabinet? Why would they be afraid of a public debate 
on the matter?
<P>
	I am concerned that this will mean the special interest groups 
will be allowed to control the agenda. The conservation of the 
fishery should be in the interest of all Canadians, not just a select 
few.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	The Reform Party cannot support a bill that would increase taxes 
and increase the size of government. Do the minister and this 
government not understand that Canadians want less government 
and taxes, not more? This bill is nothing more than a cowardly tax 
grab to ensure the job security of bloated DFO offices in Ottawa. 
The minister could not really have thought that fishermen and 
Parliament would ever condone such an act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
very closely to my colleague from the Reform Party.
<P>
	I know my colleague from the Reform Party has just been to 
Atlantic Canada, but there is an old saying that a little bit of 
knowledge can be very dangerous. I know they feel they know 
Atlantic Canada, but I can assure this House that we have members 
who know it very well, are well informed and can advise us on the 
issue.
<P>
	Let me first make a few statements. The member should go back 
to the budget, which outlined the cost initiatives. Obviously his 
party did not look at the budget very closely, because some of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14897"> 14897 </A></B>
<P>
issues in terms of cost recovery were already indicated in the 1995 
budget. They  should go back to that. Obviously they did not read 
that part.
<P>
	In the second part, in terms of the headquarters, that is where the 
biggest cuts are coming. Once again they should go back to the 
budget, because the headquarters are going to be cut by 26 per cent 
when the average cuts in the department are only 16 per cent.
<P>
	Let me also ask the member a question in terms of his position 
on the licensing fee. Our main resources are a public resource. As a 
public resource, certain people have beneficial privileges to that 
resource. Should the fisherperson who catches or lands $10,000 
worth of fish and pays $30 for a licence pay the same fee as those 
individuals who have a landing value of $1 million? Should they 
pay the same licence fee of $30 when they are taking out of a public 
resource that belongs to all Canadians? This government has said 
that those who take the most out of the public resource should pay a 
little more. This is only common sense.
<P>
	The Reform Party always talks about user pay. They want to 
have user pay for all those people who go to the doctor. All this is 
saying is that if you are taking a huge amount of a public resource 
then you should pay based on how much you benefit from that 
public resource. I think all Canadians and all members from 
Atlantic Canada would support that view.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, I hear the hon. member for 
Halifax saying she invites me there. She may be aware that I just 
came back from there. I talked to a number of fishermen in the 
Halifax area, the Dartmouth area and Central Nova. I went down to 
the wharfs and talked to the small guys with the small boats, not the 
big guys. I heard what they had to say about this fee increase.
<P>
	It is interesting to see the parliamentary secretary over there 
defending what the government is doing when it flies in the face of 
what I heard back in Atlantic Canada. I would suggest to the hon. 
member for Halifax that maybe she wants to go and spend a little 
bit of time talking to some of the fishermen in her riding, because 
she might get a different point of view from what she is getting 
from the parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	I ran into one old fellow and asked him how he was making out 
in the fishery this year. He said: ``Well, it is pretty tough. My 
fingernails are all wore out trying to hang on.'' This is the kind of 
attitude the parliamentary secretary displays to these fishermen 
who are having a very difficult time surviving from year to year.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary defends the increased fees and says 
it is a public resource and the fishermen ought to be paying a 
suitable fee for access to that resource. I do not think anybody in 
Canada would disagree with that, but is a 400 per cent increase in 
one lump sum reasonable? Regardless of one's income for the year, 
the person pays it up front in one lump sum. Is that  reasonable? I 
do not think most Canadians would find that reasonable.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to what the hon. colleague from the 
Reform Party had to say. This prompted me to take another look at 
my history of Quebec fisheries, and I would like to share with you 
these facts that bear a direct relation to the bill.
<P>
	Between 1922 and 1980, in Quebec, fisheries were managed 
under an administrative delegation agreement whereby the federal 
government had transferred fisheries management to the 
Government of Quebec.
<P>
	Therefore, during this time frame, we were able to develop a 
network now referred to as a sustainable development network, 
because small processing plants and refrigerating plants that pretty 
well met the needs of shore fishermen sprung up along the coast.
<P>
	About 1980, following a fight-another one-between the 
federal minister, who has now become a senator, and his Quebec 
counterpart, this delegation of power was cancelled. After that-a 
coincidence perhaps-fish grew scarce and can no longer be found 
in our oceans.
<P>
	I would draw a parallel between this and the remarks made by 
the hon. member because we are often told that big is beautiful. 
The larger the structure created, the larger the number of people 
involved and the better the chances it will work and be successful.
<P>
	I tend to say that maybe the word is ``small is beautiful'' in this 
instance. Perhaps, if we had structures better suited to the people's 
needs, we would have a better chance of getting by. Take for 
example the fishermen of Rivière-au-Renard, Newport or the 
Lower North Shore. They keep running into problems with respect 
to fisheries management in Canada.
<P>
	While fishing is a major economic activity in the Gaspé 
Peninsula, the Lower North Shore and the Magdalen Islands, 
Quebec fisheries are a very small part of the whole Canadian 
picture and we have always sought ways for our fishermen to have 
a greater weight in the balance by providing expertise, supporting 
them through the work of biologists, so that they can adequately 
argue their points.
<P>
	The cod stocks were depleted in part because the politicians in 
charge had frequently given in to pressure. We now find ourselves 
with many endangered species because the policies did not reflect 
the reality in terms of the market and the fishing of the species. 
Some fishermen are forced to stay home because they cannot get 
the required service.
<P>
	I will conclude by asking the Reform member if there is a way to 
ensure that fisheries management stays close to the people, in a 
concrete and daily fashion, while also  taking into account the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14898"> 14898 </A></B>
<P>
opinion of fishermen, instead of having huge structures where the 
power ultimately rests with whoever has the largest number of 
biologists or provides the biggest report. Such a structure is of no 
help to users, namely the fishermen, who do not have enough of a 
say in the process.
<P>
	Does the Reform member feel that this bill is headed the wrong 
way since it promotes a ``Big is beautiful'' instead of considering 
also a ``Small is beautiful'' approach?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
intervention. He made a couple of observations and I think he is 
right on.
<P>
	I was not aware that there was a withdrawal of delegated 
authority in his province in 1980, but it does not surprise me 
because that is the way the federal government has acted over the 
last 25 or 30 years. It has tried to consolidate more power for itself 
all the time: Ottawa is always bigger, better and more beautiful. 
Obviously that is not what Canadians think. Canadians would like 
to see decentralization of power such as the member is alluding to. 
It certainly is a philosophy and a vision of the party I am 
representing in the House today. Our leader was trying to make that 
point with the Prime Minister during question period.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	We believe the federal government ought to look at devolving 
powers to provinces, municipalities and communities wherever 
possible and get away from the notion that only Ottawa has the 
brains and the ability to run the country.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
vice-chairperson of the Standing Committee on Fisheries and 
Oceans I am pleased today to have the opportunity to take part in 
the debate on the oceans act.
<P>
	Further, I make note of the fact that contrary to statements made 
earlier today by the member for Fraser Valley West this 
vice-chairperson is not a separatist. He neglected to mention that 
there were two vice-chairs of the committee, myself and the 
member for Gaspé.
<P>
	Parliament is called upon today to formalize Canadian 
jurisdiction over vast new areas of ocean waters and numerous 
resources off our coasts. The bill before us challenges all 
Canadians to unite in the development of a strategy which will 
incorporate the harnessing of the oceans' economic potential and 
command respect for the oceans' environmental necessities.
<P>
	In the red book we stated that Canadians increasingly understand 
that the national environmental agenda can no longer be separated 
from the national economic agenda. It is long past the time for the 
federal government to act on this understanding by adapting 
economic and environmental agendas that converge. As a  
government we will stand behind our agenda and devote attention 
to this important piece of legislation.
<P>
	The oceans act encompasses the fundamentals which ensure that 
Canada's economic and environmental agendas for our oceans are a 
priority. It is a pivotal turning point in providing a foundation 
which will ensure that ocean resource management is properly 
administered. Painfully we have come to discover that the ocean 
resources are finite and that human activity can and in fact has 
jeopardized fragile ocean ecosystems.
<P>
	Just as everything that lives exhibits interdependency, we have 
seen the environmental health of our oceans connected to the 
economic health of our country. As children we were told not to kill 
the goose that lays the golden egg. As teenagers we learned the 
basic laws of physics which state that for every action there is an 
equal and opposite reaction. These laws and proverbs are 
represented in the oceans act. It is based on implementing a few 
simple lessons. If we destroy the oceans they will not provide us 
with the sustenance we enjoy on a daily basis. If we abuse them we 
will pay a grave price.
<P>
	The oceans act provides direction for the Canadian jurisdiction 
of over nearly five million square kilometres of ocean. Through the 
act we create a 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone for 
Canada in the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic oceans. We will have the 
right to explore and exploit resources within the 200-mile 
exclusive economic zone and at the same time be given the right 
and responsibility to conserve and protect the same resources.
<P>
	It is our duty as Canadians to preserve and to protect the marine 
environment not only for ourselves but for generations to come. We 
cannot continue to shortchange generations of the future. That is 
why the bill before Parliament today goes beyond the simplistics of 
one statement of jurisdiction. The bill is a cornerstone, a building 
block and a framework for a new ocean management strategy 
which consolidates and clarifies federal responsibilities for 
implementation of the new strategy.
<P>
	The key to the future is sustainable development of Canada's 
oceans and an integrated approach to management of ocean 
resources. Only through this approach will Canadians be able to 
make our economic and environmental agenda complete.
<P>
	It has been 12 years since the United Nations General Assembly 
established the World Commission on Environment and 
Development, more commonly recognized as the Brundtland 
commission. The commission urged the world to embrace the 
concept of sustainable development. The Brundtland report was the 
cornerstone of all forthcoming legislation. It embraced the concept 
of sustainable development where the environment is fully 
incorpo-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14899"> 14899 </A></B>
<P>
rated into the economic  decision making process as an 
aforethought and not as an afterthought.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	The oceans act is based on that wisdom. The philosophy of the 
bill is strengthened in its foundations of sustainable development. 
Unfortunately a philosophy is not a plan of action.
<P>
	The new bill breathes light into the principle of sustainable 
development by putting in place the framework necessary for a 
Canadian action plan for our oceans. In developing an oceans 
management strategy the federal government must show 
leadership, and the bill exemplifies leadership.
<P>
	The oceans act will extend Canadian environmental legislation 
to include the new exclusive economic zone. The act will make the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans the focal point for the 
co-ordination of federal oceans activities. It will authorize the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to develop marine environmental 
quality guidelines and establish marine protected areas.
<P>
	The act will also give the minister responsibility for conducting 
marine research, preparing scientific reports, and operating and 
maintaining the necessary federal research facilities. Most 
important, the minister will have the authority to lead in the 
co-ordination of activities to promote the development of a shared 
Canada oceans strategy, in turn uniting all Canadians and 
promoting international unity.
<P>
	The minister will be able to enter into new partnership 
agreements, to share ocean information, to share ocean research, to 
share ocean planning and to share ocean management. Through the 
basic principles of sharing we can reduce duplication and conflict. 
Only by working together can we adopt a comprehensive 
ecosystem based approach to comprehensive ecosystem problems.
<P>
	This unified approach to ocean management provides the criteria 
necessary for the creation of a legal framework which will enable 
provinces and territories, businesses and environmentalists, fisher 
people and ocean industries to pull together and to strive toward a 
common goal.
<P>
	We have a common goal. We all want Canada's oceans to be 
productive, safe and healthy for all generations. We can only 
achieve that goal by making Canada a world leader in oceans and 
marine resource management.
<P>
	On Canada's coasts there are hundreds of fishing communities. 
My riding is made up of many such communities, one of which I 
was raised in.
<P>
	The minister has already mentioned that when John Cabot 
reached the shores of Newfoundland in 1497 he found the sea: 
``swarming with fish which can be taken not only with a net but 
with baskets let down with a stone''. This illustration of the former 
abundance of fish  is now in contrast with the shortage of northern 
cod off Canada's east coast.
<P>
	The oceans act is our management strategy to ensure that the 
devastation which has occurred on the coasts off Newfoundland 
never happens again. Many fish stocks on the coast of 
Newfoundland were severely depleted prior to Canada's 
declaration of a 200-mile fishing zone in 1977. Although some 
Atlantic codfish stocks have begun to recover somewhat since that 
time, many stocks continue to be subject to high fishing pressure, 
particularly the stocks that straddle the 200-mile limit where 
foreign fleets have ignored internationally negotiated catch limits.
<P>
	Our fishers on the Atlantic coast and throughout Canada have 
suffered. They have lost their livelihood, their pride and their 
sustenance. It is not too late to provide legislation countenance. We 
must amend the marine conservation policies in the country and 
prevent future tragedies from occurring. The oceans act will do just 
that.
<P>
	Canada's fisheries will continue to face a variety of pressures 
imposed by an increasing world population. This will produce 
more wastes which will impair the natural productivity of oceans 
and inland waters. Managing the fisheries in the face of these 
pressures will require co-operation on national and international 
levels.
<P>
	The oceans act will ensure that proper management of the ocean 
resources both living and non-living will be sustained. Each one of 
these communities houses a wealth of accumulated knowledge 
about currents, salinity, water depth, temperatures, tides and 
navigational routes. We must link this knowledge to a shared ocean 
management strategy. We must understand how each of these 
regions is unique and independent.
<P>
	The bill before us today confirms the merger of the Canadian 
Coast Guard and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. It 
ensures boating safety is placed in the highest priority.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	The legislation makes it possible to form new domestic 
agreements to increase prosperity in trade and commerce. Through 
basic principles of sustainable development, the transfer of 
technology from government and academic researchers to the 
private sector will be facilitated. Together we must work to 
improve resource assessment and inspection. Harmonized 
regulations will guarantee services provided by different levels of 
government effectively meet the needs of our sea coast 
communities and ports.
<P>
	The oceans act makes it possible for Canadians to work together 
to shape the best national answers and the best local answers for 
ocean sustainable development. Better understanding of oceans, 
better resource management, better environmental management,  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14900"> 14900 </A></B>
<P>
increased safety and increased trade and commerce are all 
components of an integrated ocean strategy.
<P>
	By providing the legislative tools to enable Canadians to get our 
act together on these issues the oceans act will help to ensure 
Canada is a forceful and effective voice on global ocean issues. By 
demonstrating our own responsible attitude to ocean sustainable 
development we will be in a strong position to push forward for 
greater global responsibility. In effect, Canadians must seek the 
same force for good on all ocean issues that we have for our 
fisheries conservation.
<P>
	The Brundtland commission called its report ``Our Common 
Future''. That is what this bill is about and that is what we are 
really debating. Canada has a special responsibility as a country 
which borders the Arctic, the Pacific and the Atlantic oceans. Our 
common future depends on whether we use those oceans wisely, 
whether we actively seek to promote sustainable development and 
whether we actively seek to pursue both our environmental 
responsibilities and our economic opportunities.
<P>
	I am happy and proud to support the bill and urge all members to 
join me in allowing this legislation to move forward quickly for 
study by the standing committee. The oceans act charts a wise 
course for the future of ocean policy. It is a course which would 
bind our country with a common future, a course we must all sail 
together.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, for two years now the Liberal government has presented 
legislation it says will make government more streamlined, more 
responsive and more responsible to Canadians. Its comments have 
been merely smoke and mirrors. I am sad to say Bill C-98, an act 
respecting the oceans of Canada, is another example of the 
government's saying one thing and doing another.
<P>
	The government told Canadians its changes to the Young 
Offenders Act would raise ultra-violent youth to adult court and 
that this action would give 16 and 17-year old cold blooded 
murderers sentences equal to their heinous crimes. The 
government's statements were not equal to the realities of the bill.
<P>
	The government has made numerous statements that Bill C-98 
will end duplication, bring control of Canada's traditional fishing 
grounds on the open sea into Parliament and ensure the success of 
fisheries. Again we have statements which do not match the 
realities of the legislation.
<P>
	How can the fisheries be successful when the government 
intends to tax them to death? The government tells Canadians we 
on this side of the House do not understand the problems of the east 
coast. We understand all problems facing Canadians better than the 
government.
<P>
	The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans bored himself a place at 
the trough by accepting his gold plated,  self-imposed pension. 
Now the minister wants to pay for his pension on the backs of the 
fisheries, an area where it is impossible for those Canadians to bear 
the brunt of an already unbearable tax burden.
<P>
	The Liberal government claims the bill will end duplication and 
provide efficient operation through the oceans management 
strategy. Again we have a catch phrase for media consumption 
which has no bearing on the realities of the bill.
<P>
	Bill C-98 suggests all government bodies co-ordinate their 
activities relating to the oceans surrounding Canada. Nowhere in 
the bill does it state that all government bodies dealing with oceans 
must co-ordinate their functions. There are no penalties, 
consequences or even government scrutiny for any departments 
which refuse to end duplication.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	In effect, the bill will create even more bureaucracy. How does 
the government intend to pay for this new bureaucratic nightmare? 
The government will raise licensing fees for fishermen. That is the 
tax I have been talking about. Not only that, it will increase the fees 
to such an extent that family oriented fishing boats or small fishing 
groups will be put out of business.
<P>
	It is either absolute and utter ignorance of the reality on the east 
coast that the minister does not understand or it is total disregard 
for the east coast fishery, large and small.
<P>
	To the minister it seems as long as his pockets are full and his 
future is assured he does not care about those he is supposed to be 
helping. The government gives itself all the power to set fees 
through orders in council.
<P>
	Parliament is bypassed once more as the body that decides issues 
for Canadians. This proposed new tax will punish those who have 
finally achieved a harvest worthy of their effects.
<P>
	Just as a previous Liberal government crippled the western 
Canadian economy by placing punitive taxes in place for the oil 
industry, this government now intends to place punitive taxes on 
fishermen who do not manage to get a decent catch.
<P>
	If fishermen obtain a catch large enough to cover their bills, 
large enough to give them a decent living once again from the 
ocean, those members opposite intend to raise their fees to the 
point at which fishermen will be simply taxed out of business.
<P>
	The east coast fishery has had enough hard luck and has had 
enough businesses driven to extinction through failed government 
management of the fisheries without having government finally 
drive the last nail in the coffin by higher and higher taxes. Of some 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14901"> 14901 </A></B>
<P>
of these smaller and medium fishermen the government will 
demand tax increases as high as 400 per cent over current levels.
<P>
	We from the west understand the social disintegration and 
punitive taxation imposed by an uncaring federal government and 
what that can create. We from the west know how punitive taxation 
can cause breakdowns of marriages, losses of homes and an 
increase in alcoholism, suicide, bankruptcies and affect many other 
social programs. If the bill is passed the east coast will experience 
the same.
<P>
	U-Hauls behind cars driven by grim faced drivers will proceed 
like caravans down east coast highways as those forced from their 
homes seek employment in other areas of the country.
<P>
	As Canadians trying desperately to keep their families and 
homes together on the east coast know, times are hard enough 
without the government making it worse.
<P>
	I oppose the bill not because of what the government says it does 
but because it does not do what it says it will. The bill will give 
cabinet dictatorial powers and remove the elected representatives 
chosen by the people of Canada from that decision making process. 
The bill will continue a policy adopted by the Prime Minister that 
elected representatives must not be responsible for their 
constituents.
<P>
	The Prime Minister stated that members of his party who support 
their constituents and not decrees from the top will not get their 
nomination papers signed or will be punished in other ways.
<P>
	We have already seen these threats in practice when some 
members who followed constituent wishes were removed from 
their committee posts. The bill will give the cabinet even more 
power to punish the east coast representatives of its party who vote 
the wishes of their constituents and not the wishes of the ministers' 
inner circle.
<P>
	The bill will not consolidate the operations of various 
government departments related to the fisheries or oceans but 
instead will allow another level of bureaucracy to be formed.
<P>
	It is very clear the government has no desire to reduce the 
taxation load on all Canadians by bringing in efficiencies in any 
department. The minister is probably the worst offender.
<P>
	Canadians are tired of larger and larger government taking more 
and more money from their pockets. The justice minister recently 
appointed 11 supporters, failed candidates and fundraisers to 
taxpayer funded posts within his department.
<P>
	Liberals love larger bureaucracy because that gives them places 
to appoint people at taxpayers' expense, while this bill will create 
another bureaucracy for the government to fill patronage 
appointment positions.
<P>
	We agree fisheries and oceans should have jurisdiction over the 
coast guard and marine science but only if it will save money by 
ending duplication. The bill simply will not do that.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	We agree that small and medium size fisheries are the lifeblood 
of many east coast families. The bill will create punitive taxation 
that will destroy their very livelihood which the government states 
it will defend.
<P>
	Under those circumstances the members opposite elected to 
represent constituents dependant on the fishery to survive 
absolutely must vote no. All decisions on future actions, be they fee 
increases or regulation, will be enacted by special interest 
participation with cabinet and not Parliament.
<P>
	Special interests will dominate environment discussions relating 
to fisheries or oceans and paralyse realistic growth or use of fishery 
or development of ocean related industry. Just as they have with 
issues relating to realistic and safe development within Canada's 
borders, special interests will again have the ear of the minister.
<P>
	Here is an example of how special interests have held up needed 
expansion in the country. I am thinking of the TransCanada 
highway through Banff that had been planned and put off for years 
even though study after study said the twinning of the highway 
could be done with more than adequate concern for large animals 
ranging throughout Banff. Thankfully this type of process has 
come to an end and that twinning will commence. However, many 
serious injuries and possibly needless deaths of motorists have 
occurred because government would not listen to the voice of 
reason and preferred to hear the voices of special interest groups.
<P>
	Even a study by Parks Canada officials said the improvements 
could be done on this stretch of road without harm to the 
environment. However, it was not until the government lost two 
frivolous court cases that were only instituted to appeal the special 
interests having the government's ear did the harassment stop.
<P>
	How long will needed projects, realistic economic development 
and opportunities to enhance the lives of those living near the 
oceans be delayed? The bill would impose a duty on the minister to 
collaborate with all interested persons.
<P>
	I cannot support the bill. With all honesty I do not see how any 
member whose constituents depend on the ocean for their 
livelihood can support the bill. I am certain those members 
opposite will be told they must vote according to the decree of the 
few and not according to the wishes of many. That is the saddest 
point of all.
<P>

<B><A NAME="14902"> 14902 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for his speech. I listened very closely.
<P>
	His speech is very similar to the speech made by the member for 
Skeena. I do not want to repeat some of the remarks I have already 
made. I once again remind him he should read the budget. He has 
put forward concerns about the licensing fees which were budget 
items in February 1995. For every $5 in cuts there is only $1 in cost 
recovery. This is part of the cost recovery. The hon. member should 
also keep in mind there was public consultation right across the 
province.
<P>
	More to the point, hon. members often mention special interest 
groups. When special interest groups represent the ideology of 
these people they work hand in hand. They are holding hands with 
special interest groups. Look at the gun lobby. They are joining 
hands with the gun lobby so they should not tell us about special 
interest groups. When they represent their view, they are happy to 
work with them.
<P>
	The licence fee was $30. For those who use the resource, it does 
not matter if they have a landing value $12,000 or a landing value 
of $1 million. The fee was an insignificant amount of $30. Now 
those people who take the most from the resource will pay a higher 
amount. It is a public resource. They have a beneficial access to 
that resource that not everybody has only because they have to pay 
that licensing fee. Should we charge the same amount?
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	Should we not charge those people who take more out of the 
resource? The figure of 400 per cent was used. Some fisherpersons 
make $1 million in a six to eight-week fishing season. Their fee is 
only going to be 1.6 per cent of their landed value. Do you think 
that is a huge burden on those people? Obviously, this amount is 
going to be rated depending on how much the landing value is. If 
there is a higher landing value then more will be paid. I do not think 
1.6 per cent is very much. I am wondering if the member thinks 
that is too high.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> Madam Speaker, this government always amazes 
me. I remember very well right after the 1993 election one of the 
highlights mentioned throughout the media was that this 
government would be more open to consulting people involved in 
any particular industry when it was building policy.
<P>
	There is case after case. For example when agriculture policy is 
made no farmers are consulted. When justice policy is made no 
policemen are consulted. The Minister of Justice talks well and 
long about how he consulted with the chiefs of police. That is a 
very small group. I am wondering why this government which 
talked a good game at the beginning of 1994 has suddenly gone 
back on those initial words.
<P>
	I see the very same thing in this department. The parliamentary 
secretary talks about consulting the people. I have just come back 
from a trip to St. John's, Newfoundland. I had the opportunity to 
speak to some fisher people, as the politically correct term would 
be. I asked them exactly those questions. I found during my visit 
that the two biggest concerns the fish industry has are that there is 
far too much government, far too much bureaucracy, far too much 
red tape and that the ordinary common every day fisherperson is 
not consulted on policy making.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member talks about not 
consulting. In fact, if we look at every one of our policies whether 
it is human resources or the gun control bill, there has been more 
consultation done by this government than by any other 
government. There has been more consultation done by this 
government on this issue itself.
<P>
	First, the government consulted the National Advisory Board on 
Science and Technology. Should we ignore its advice? Should we 
say it does not know what it is talking about? Then the members 
across would say we are not listening to these advisory boards. 
They are the ones who started it.
<P>
	The minister continued with a vision for oceans management. In 
November 1994, 600 people and 200 responses were received. 
Consultation was done. In April 1995 the coastal provinces, the 
Northwest Territories and Ottawa were consulted. There were 
meetings in November and December 1994. The list goes on. The 
people consulted were academics, scientists and others in the 
fishery, people in the oceans industry, environmentalists, First 
Nations people and people involved in community development. 
How much more consultation do Reformers want?
<P>
	We have heard one of the Reform members say many times that 
we were consulting too much. He has told the Minister of Justice to 
stop consulting and get to it. Members of the Reform Party should 
make up their minds.
<P>
	One thing is for sure: this government takes its responsibilities 
seriously. We do the consulting and then we make the decisions. 
The problem is that Reform members do not always like the 
decisions and then they complain and say we did not consult. There 
has been ample consultation on this bill. The Reform Party member 
who is a member of the standing committee will have an 
opportunity to work further and put forward recommendations as 
they come before the committee before this bill goes to third 
reading.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the member opposite 
and his remarks. The question I would have for him if I were 
allowed to give one would be: What about the issue of MPs 
pensions? Were the people consulted on that?

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14903"> 14903 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	When I look at things such as this bill we are talking about today 
and the gun registration bill which was mentioned earlier today, I 
would ask the member opposite if he really, truly and sincerely 
believes that full consultation went on throughout all departments 
with this government. Perhaps he should go out on the street-and 
I would be happy to accompany him-and ask the people if they 
have been consulted on Bill C-98, on Bill C-68 and on Bill C-85. I 
rest my case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Wells (South Shore, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I will 
begin by commenting on some of the statements made earlier by 
the opposition parties, particularly the third party.
<P>
	We on this side of the House are concerned with the issue of 
access fees and the future of the inshore fishery. We are concerned 
with coastal communities and the effect that changes in the fishery 
will have on our coastal communities.
<P>
	My province is the largest fishing province in the country in 
terms of landed value in tonnes. My riding of South Shore is the 
largest individual fishing riding in Canada. Therefore, we are 
concerned about these issues and I am particularly concerned.
<P>
	The third party talks about the concerns of Atlantic fishermen 
and fisherwomen. This is the same party whose policy it is to 
relocate Atlantic Canadians out of the area. This is the party that 
would cancel the TAGS program which so many Atlantic fishers 
rely on. This is the party whose leader told Atlantic Canadians, 
particularly Atlantic fishers, last weekend to take 15 seconds and 
tell themselves the fisheries are dead. This is the party that purports 
to speak for Atlantic fishermen. Reform members go to Atlantic 
Canada for a weekend and become instant experts.
<P>
	I want to tell members opposite that I have been meeting with 
these fishers all of my life. I have lived in coastal communities in 
different parts of Atlantic Canada all of my life.
<P>
	I also ask the members opposite to read the bill because what 
they are speaking of is not what this bill is about. This bill is not 
about access fees. This bill is not needed to increase, if that is the 
government's wish, access fees. Some of the information being 
circulated is incorrect because those decisions have not been 
completely made. They are issues to be debated at another time.
<P>
	I invite members opposite to come to the Standing Committee on 
Fisheries and Oceans when it takes this bill after second reading 
and begins reviewing it. At that point, after they get an 
understanding of what the legislation is about, then they can raise 
some of these issues.
<P>
	I am pleased to take the opportunity to express my support for 
Bill C-98, the oceans act. This legislation takes an important first 
step toward the creation of a comprehensive, integrated oceans 
management strategy based on the principles of sustainable 
development. It provides the legal framework by which the various 
players in the ocean sector will be able to work together under the 
leadership of the federal government to protect the marine 
environment.
<P>
	For the first time the bill gives statutory recognition to the 
tremendous importance of Canada's ocean territories. For this 
reason the oceans act is pioneering legislation. It is a bold step 
toward a new era in oceans management. It turns good intentions 
into concrete deeds and actions. It places Canada at the forefront of 
nations striving to implement the commitments of agenda 21 made 
at the United Nations Conference on the Environment and 
Development in 1992.
<P>
	Canada's ocean regions are vast. The richness and variety of the 
resources almost defy the imagination. Imagine them and 
comprehend them we must. The future of many of our coastal 
communities and indeed of humanity itself depends on all of us 
building a deeper understanding of the incredible magnitude and 
fragility of this great ecosystem. It is for this reason that I want to 
take the time today to remind my colleagues of just how important 
the oceans are to the lives of all Canadians and why the passage of 
the oceans act will be of such benefit to us all.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	I said that Canada's ocean territories are vast. This hardly does 
justice to the facts. Canada's coastline stretches from the Pacific 
through the icy waters of the Arctic to the Atlantic Ocean. At 
almost 250,000 kilometres it is the longest coastline in the world. 
This is just the beginning. Our continental shelf spans more than 
6.5 million square kilometres making it the second largest in the 
world.
<P>
	Together these great bodies of water have been pivotal to our 
country's evolution. Rich in biodiversity, the oceans have helped 
forge our sense of identity and have provided the means for 
transport, trading, communications and sustenance for many 
generations.
<P>
	On our east coast especially, an entire culture has been built 
around shipping and the fishery. For 400 years or more the daily 
rhythms of communities up and down this rugged coast have 
centred on the ways of the sea. Nowhere is this more obvious than 
in my riding of South Shore where communities such as Shelburne, 
Lunenburg, Clark's Harbour and many others line the coast.
<P>
	Today Canada's ocean industries no longer dominate our 
economic profile like they once did. However their importance to 
our national accounts and to the economies of our coastal areas 
should not be underestimated. Together the ocean sectors of 
fishing,  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14904"> 14904 </A></B>
<P>
shipping, oil and ocean manufacturing and services account for 
almost 3 per cent of Canada's gross national product.
<P>
	Last year despite troubles in the groundfish industry, Canadian 
seafood exports totalled $2.8 billion. Of this total, more than half 
came from Atlantic Canada with the crab, shrimp and lobster 
fisheries putting in an outstanding performance. Canada's 
aquaculture industry continues to grow despite stiff international 
competition. This is happening on both the east and west coasts.
<P>
	Canada's oceans manufacturing and service sector is also 
growing, now comprising more than 300 high technology firms. 
This sector generates millions of dollars in revenue each year.
<P>
	In addition Atlantic offshore oil and gas have finally come on 
stream. The Cohasset field off Nova Scotia began production in 
1992. The giant Hibernia development off the east coast of 
Newfoundland is promising to employ some 20,000 workers once 
it begins production in 1997.
<P>
	With growth like this it is easy to see why the oceans sector plays 
such an important role in the economies of our coastal regions. 
Together these industries have the potential to generate 
considerable wealth and prosperity.
<P>
	The oceans also have a more indirect impact on the lives of 
Canadians. The world's oceans are a key part of the ecosphere, 
acting as a major environmental sink of carbon dioxide. In 
particular the world's oceans play a critical role in determining the 
rate of climate change and its regional variations. Globally this has 
many implications as it does here at home.
<P>
	Scientists working with global climate models forecast that with 
global warming the oceans will change. According to these 
predictions there will be less upswelling which in turn will affect 
productivity. Already we have seen some evidence of this with the 
frequent reoccurrence of the El Nino effect in the Pacific in recent 
years. In fact some scientists believe that the El Nino may be a 
common factor contributing to changes in the fish population in 
both the Atlantic and the Pacific.
<P>
	What does all this mean for Canadians? Disruption in the 
fishery? Drought on the prairies? Melting sea and land ice in the 
Arctic? We do not really know. Our understanding of both the 
ocean and the earth's atmosphere is not yet well enough developed. 
We can only assume that widespread climate change is likely to 
have a dramatic impact on ocean ecosystems around the world as 
well as to alter the entire range of human activity.
<P>
	Clearly the oceans are of tremendous importance to Canada as a 
nation. They impact on our environment, our economy, our social 
structures and culture as well as on our sovereignty and defence. 
Even from this very brief sketch it is obvious that managing our 
oceans and their resources is a complex and challenging task. At no  
time has this been more true than at the moment. Each region and 
each activity within the ocean sector presents its own pressing 
challenges to policymakers at all levels of government and 
industry.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	Let me give a few examples. On the east coast several issues 
stand out. First, there is an urgent need for scientists and fishermen 
to work side by side to improve methods of resource assessment 
and to achieve a better understanding of the dynamics which 
caused the collapse of the groundfish stocks.
<P>
	Second, industry and government must continue to work 
together to revitalize the fishing industry.
<P>
	Third, we must continue to build on the potential of the ocean 
manufacturing and service sector to act as a catalyst for the 
innovative diversified economy in the region.
<P>
	In the Arctic, as in other parts of Canada, environmental issues 
take priority. Northern communities are deeply concerned with 
issues of climate change and the contamination of Arctic waters 
and resources. These are the issues the bill speaks to.
<P>
	On the west coast international relations, climate studies and 
resource assessment are key. Strong measures are needed to assure 
the future of the Pacific salmon fishery. What is more, with the 
region's increasing population density, environmental issues are of 
growing importance. Issues related to the coastal zone 
management, marine environmental quality, ship standards and 
pollution prevention demand attention. That is what the bill is 
about.
<P>
	These are not isolated issues. Rather they are interlocking pieces 
of one large puzzle. It is time to respond to them in a coherent and 
integrated fashion. That is what the legislation does.
<P>
	The oceans act sets the stage for the development of a long range 
comprehensive vision for the management of Canada's ocean 
territories and marine resources. Our approach has two phases.
<P>
	First is the introduction of enabling legislation. This is the 
oceans act that we are now considering. With the oceans act we are 
extending economic and environmental jurisdiction out to the 200 
nautical mile limit permitted by the United Nations Convention on 
the Law of the Sea. We are consolidating legislation and clarifying 
the federal government's responsibilities for oceans. We are 
creating the legal framework for an oceans management strategy 
based on both the sustainable development and integrated 
management of our oceans and coastal waters. Contrary to what a 
Bloc member stated earlier, there is zero impact on powers between 
the federal and provincial governments.
<P>
	The second phase is the development of the ocean management 
strategy. The oceans management strategy is  currently at the 
developmental stage. We are consulting extensively with stake-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14905"> 14905 </A></B>
<P>
holders about what should go into the strategy and we will continue 
to do so. So far our proposals have received strong support from 
almost everyone involved: fishermen, aboriginal groups, 
businesses, provincial and territorial leaders, academics and 
non-governmental organizations. Everyone sees the necessity for a 
new approach to decision making.
<P>
	Canada can no longer afford to manage its oceans with partial ad 
hoc, short term measures. We can no longer afford to divide our 
decision making like so many pieces of the pie, with decisions on 
resource management made in isolation from decisions about 
shipping or environmental protection. We can no longer afford to 
have our experts, whether they be in government labs, universities, 
industries or on fishing boats, working in isolation of each other. It 
is time to bring all the elements together so that we can make the 
best decisions possible.
<P>
	We must start to look at oceans issues through a wide angle lens 
so we can make choices based on the best interests of the entire 
ecosystem. Sustainable development is all about integrating 
economic, environmental and social considerations together into 
one policy framework.
<P>
	What do we need to make it work? To start with, we need 
decision making that is open, transparent and based on sound 
science. We need a commitment to change from all parties 
involved and we need a new relationship among ocean 
stakeholders. I will elaborate.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	First, we need a more open and more integrated approach to 
policy making. The oceans management strategy would see our 
approach to marine resource management change. Traditionally the 
federal government has carried out its responsibilities for oceans 
management on the basis of narrow sectoral approaches, in 
consultation with stakeholders but not in partnership with them. 
We recognize this must change, so we have begun a new 
relationship with other ocean stakeholders.
<P>
	Second, ecological sustainability and economic viability depend 
on good science. To support these goals science needs to be 
multi-disciplinary, not limited by organizational structure, and 
responsive to changing needs and priorities. The oceans 
management strategy will foster partnerships involving 
government, academia, the private sector and environmental 
groups, ensuring that Canada's oceans science is once again at the 
leading edge of world knowledge.
<P>
	Third, effective management requires a functioning ecosystems 
approach. Because ecosystems involve many interdependent 
physical and biological elements which cross lines of jurisdiction, 
scientific discipline and economic interest, an effectively 
functioning management system will have to take these factors into 
account.
<P>
	These suggestions give an idea of the scope of the oceans 
management strategy. They also indicate how fundamentally an 
integrated management strategy would change oceans management 
in Canada.
<P>
	Work on the oceans management strategy is just beginning. All 
the details have yet to be worked out. However I can assure all 
members that as the action plan for the oceans management 
strategy is put in place it will be developed in full collaboration 
among the federal government and ocean stakeholders. The 
government is committed to forging a new relationship with our 
partners in the ocean sector.
<P>
	Stewardship of our ocean and coastal resources is a shared 
responsibility. Unless all those with an interest in the oceans agree 
to collaborate, to share information and to manage these resources 
in a careful and conservative manner, we will do irreparable harm 
to the environment. Canadians must work together if we are to 
protect the integrity and quality of the oceans environment and its 
resources for future generations.
<P>
	The world's oceans have been described as the world's great 
heart, beating eternally. Canadians with their long relationship with 
the sea recognize this to be true. They understand also that it is time 
to make a commitment to their oceans. The oceans act is that 
commitment. It is the beginning of a new era of environmental 
stewardship and prosperity.
<P>
	I look forward to reviewing the bill in committee. I invite other 
members to join with us in committee when we review the bill. Let 
us look at possible amendments that might improve the bill and 
bring it back for third reading. At that point it is my hope that we 
will have all-party consent. Once a thorough understanding is 
achieved by all members of what the bill is meant to do, we will 
have all-party consent, and I look forward to that time.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, by 
tabling Bill C-98, the oceans act, the government has taken a step 
toward the recognition of offshore areas of the sea and protection of 
the resources in those areas. I feel this is a very good initiative.
<P>
	As I see it the bill has three objectives: to recognize in domestic 
law Canada's jurisdiction over its maritime zones, to establish the 
legislation framework to support Canada's new oceans 
management regime, and to consolidate federal responsibilities for 
managing Canada's oceans. However there appears to be a great 
deal of overlap and duplication.
<P>
	Can the government member explain to me where the 
duplication overlap are being eliminated in the bill? What 
measures in the bill reduce the level of bureaucracy? Why are the 
departments of environment and natural resources still in charge of 
oceans environmental and geological research? Why does the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans still have to receive  authority 
from the foreign affairs minister for regulations under clause 25? 
Why does 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14906"> 14906 </A></B>
<P>
the minister have to seek authority from the Minister of Justice to 
make regulations under section 26(1)?
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	I feel very strongly that having 14 different ministers overseeing 
this matter makes it difficult. We should have one department and 
one minister, that is the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	Could the hon. member tell us exactly how we could make these 
changes and eliminate all the duplication?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wells:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for her 
question. I would note that the member for Saint John who asked 
the question is an associate member of the Standing Committee on 
Fisheries and Oceans. These are issues that have been raised at the 
committee level, and they are good questions.
<P>
	Concerns have been expressed by various members-she being 
one and others on this side of the House-that perhaps there should 
be more power consolidated in the hands of the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	When I invite the member-and I know she will be there-and 
other members to talk about the consolidation of power, we will 
have to look at the various areas about which she speaks including 
the environmental area. We will have to see if some of the areas 
should perhaps be moved to the minister of fisheries. We can find 
out the rationale from the officials. Why is certain power still being 
left with the minister of heritage as far as marine parks, for 
example, are concerned? Why is the Ministry of the Environment 
retaining certain authority in certain areas? They are very valid 
questions.
<P>
	As we get into a study of the matter at committee level we will 
ask those questions of various officials. It is my hope that at the end 
of the day there could perhaps be more consolidation of some of 
these powers. I think the committee process has to work. We have 
to seek answers and reasons from the various departments on why 
some of the consolidation has not taken place.
<P>
	Without prejudging the process I personally feel that the minister 
of fisheries who is given certain authority under the bill should 
have more. The hon. member should agree that as a committee we 
need to look at that as a possibility.
<P>
	I thank her for her question. I look forward to working with her 
in committee.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to put a question to the hon. member, who also sits on the standing 
committee on fisheries and oceans.
<P>
	Allow me to disagree with the hon. member. Since I believe he is 
a lawyer by training, he is used to reading laws. I also know that he 
was rather nit-picking on that issue during the last few meetings of 
our committee. As regards Part II of Bill C-98, why do we have to 
put in law a plan that will be developed for management purposes?
<P>
	I would appreciate it if the member, who seems to have a lot of 
experience in that field, would tell us why we must pass an act 
merely to introduce or announce a strategy. That could have been 
done in a press release. The issue would have been well presented. 
People would have understood. Instead, the government is sending 
invitations all over the place. It wants to consult just about 
everybody.
<P>
	I also ask the member to recognize the fact that there is no 
hierarchy in terms of the consultation process. Indeed, the 
provinces are put on the same footing as any other group when it 
comes to consultations. We, in Quebec, do not think that this is the 
way to manage. How does the member, who is from Nova Scotia, 
think that this strategy should be managed in his province, which 
borders the ocean? Will the provincial minister want to have a say, 
at some point in time, regarding this process? This is the sort of 
thing we have to look at.
<P>
	Right now, the government is merely presenting a strategy and 
saying that it is willing to consult everyone. I would appreciate it if 
the member could tell us which new real powers are included in 
this bill.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wells:</B> I think it is fair to say that the hon. member and I see 
the legislation differently. As he made clear in his previous 
presentation to the House, he sees this as taking away authority 
from the provinces and giving it to the federal government. That is 
simply not the case. I have seen nothing and he has pointed out 
nothing in this legislation which would indicate this is what is 
happening.
<P>
	This is a consolidation. It is not something that just happened 
over the last number of weeks or months. This discussion has been 
going on for years. As the minister indicated this morning, there 
has been an evolution here. We are going back to the 1970s or 
maybe before that when various powers and various consolidations 
were being discussed. A lot of things have happened internationally 
that we have to establish in our own legislation. There is a 
recognition in the act of the merger of the coast guard and DFO 
which is relatively new.
<P>
	To suggest there is something in this legislation that is affecting 
the powers of the provinces could not be further from the truth. 
This legislation does not state that. The hon. member has not been 
able to point out to me either here in the House or during any 
discussion that this is what the legislation does. That is clearly not 
what is in the legislation and it is not the intent of the  legislation. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14907"> 14907 </A></B>
<P>
would suggest his motive is something other than trying to create a 
good piece of oceans legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened with 
interest to the hon. member's intervention.
<P>
	The member talked about the TAGS program and how wonderful 
it was for Atlantic Canada. When Reform Party members were 
there talking to people in the constituencies in Nova Scotia, Prince 
Edward Island and New Brunswick we did not hear people giving 
large accolades for the TAGS program. As a matter of fact, what we 
heard was talk about corruption and talk about the way the TAGS 
program had distorted the marketplace, particularly the job market. 
No one I encountered had anything good to say about it.
<P>
	The member is defending the government's move on licence 
fees. I wonder if he would tell the House whether he is going to poll 
his constituents because the story we heard in Atlantic Canada is 
that Atlantic Canadians are opposed to this. Will he poll his 
constituents and if they are found to be in opposition to Bill C-98 
will he vote against the bill when it comes up for third reading in 
the House?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wells:</B> Madam Speaker, my only comment is that I would 
suggest the member shows a total lack of understanding of Bill 
C-98. Bill C-98 does not deal with access fees. He should read it 
and determine what it states. Talking about fishermen, I convene 
my own round tables in my riding to speak to fishermen's 
organizations on a regular basis. I know what the fishermen's 
position is on access fees. This bill is not about access fees.
<P>
	I invite the member to read and understand the legislation before 
he asks questions that are totally irrelevant because that is not the 
issue. The question of access fees is certainly relevant but not as 
part of this legislation. There is going to be a new fisheries act and 
other things that we are going to discuss on this issue. It is a very 
real, important and serious issue which I have dealt with not just as 
of last weekend, like the hon. member, but is one I have been 
dealing with for years.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
for Canadians watching this debate I would like to preface my 
remarks by saying that what we are debating is Bill C-98, an act 
respecting the oceans of Canada.
<P>
	The bill essentially deals with two issues relating to oceans. 
First, it deals with part of the oceans we designate as the oceans of 
Canada. Second, it deals with something called an oceans 
management strategy. I would like to direct my remarks on the 
oceans management strategy and some of the aspects that are of 
concern particularly to fishermen.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	I listened with great interest to my hon. colleague opposite who 
just spoke. It was very interesting to hear  the poetry and the talk 
about ocean ecology and all those good things. I would like to be 
more practical in this debate and talk about how we make sure that 
we have fish resources to harvest.
<P>
	Other speakers have mentioned the enormous value to the 
Canadian economy of fisheries both on the east and west coasts and 
our inland fisheries. This is not a resource to toy with. It is not a 
part of our Canadian workforce that should be treated lightly 
because this has really a lot of impact for a great many Canadians.
<P>
	I would suggest that there has been a bit of a misnomer about our 
oceans management strategy to date; it has been more oceans 
mismanagement. We see an oceans resource in complete disaster. 
So far there has been an unprecedented groundfish crisis on the east 
coast and we are minutes from disaster on the west coast 
particularly in the Fraser River fisheries.
<P>
	We also have a population dependent on a resource that can no 
longer sustain a very large number of Canadian workers. There is a 
real pressure of numbers in the fisheries that is not going to go 
away and cannot be supported artificially forever.
<P>
	We also have a minister who I suggest is not really dealing with 
these domestic issues. He is busy playing Captain Canada, talking 
about building his media image internationally. Even when his 
parliamentary secretary enters this debate it is to talk about the 
wonderful international image of the minister. That does not put 
food on the table of the fishermen of this country.
<P>
	I think everyone would welcome a positive change in the way we 
are managing the fish resources and our oceans resources because 
we have a track record in this area that is not very inspiring to say 
the least. We look at the management strategy that is being put into 
place as a result of Bill C-98. We are looking for positive change. 
We are looking for changes to address some of the mismanagement 
of the past.
<P>
	What do we see in this bill? We see two things that have not 
brought any relief, any hope or any positive response from the 
fishermen of this country. First, we have a government department 
that will become even more bloated but there are no precise lines of 
authority or management plan to help this increased government 
department do a better job of the mandate it has been given to 
manage the fisheries.
<P>
	Second, the doors are being opened in this bill for increased fees 
on fishermen which the fishermen can hardly bear to shoulder. I 
quote from clause 50 of this Bill C-98 which states: ``The minister 
may, subject to any regulations that the Treasury Board may make 
for the purposes of this section, fix fees in respect of products, 
rights and privileges provided under this act''. That is the section 
which has a lot of fishermen quaking in their boots.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14908"> 14908 </A></B>
<P>
	The nice name of the oceans management strategy really hides 
an increased bureaucracy. The stated purpose of this increased 
bureaucracy is to get all government bodies to co-ordinate the 
related activities with respect to management and harvesting of 
the oceans. That is a good objective. It is an objective I think 
everyone in Canada would support. We certainly have a lot of 
cases in this country-and my friends from the Bloc often like 
to talk about this-of where the right hand does not know what 
the left hand is doing. There is duplication and interference 
between different levels of government and different government 
bodies. That of course leads to a great deal of inefficiency and 
an enormous unnecessary cost. Pruning that back, streamlining 
and making it more efficient, downsizing, is what needs to be 
done. It is of course also what is being done across the board in 
the private sector. Organizations are flattening, downsizing, 
becoming more efficient and we have been calling for a long time 
for government to do the same.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	We fail to see how this is going to happen by adding more layers 
of bureaucracy and more complexity to the workings of the 
department. There is no process identified in this bill to ensure 
more effective co-ordination. It is simply stated as a nice goal. A 
lot of roads are paved with good intentions but we need to see some 
real specifics in the way we set out our legislation if we hope to 
accomplish the stated aims.
<P>
	In fact, there are no penalties or even any other consequences to 
any of these bodies that are supposedly being co-ordinated for 
failing to work in concert. We have more bureaucrats, more 
activity, more process being added, but no power to initiate 
activities that would get the objectives met or to ensure compliance 
by all of the bodies that are to be co-ordinated. There is no concrete 
planned agenda at all.
<P>
	If this government is serious about the management of oceans, 
we believe it would give real power to the managing body. 
Management is only possible when there is some real authority and 
that is simply not happening. In fact, if government would stop 
thinking of ways to tinker with the system creating bloated 
government departments and instead get on with the job of 
protecting a valuable resource, everyone would be a lot better off.
<P>
	The Department of Fisheries and Oceans is already a top heavy 
organization. Fishermen on both coasts will tell of their frustration 
in dealing with a department based in Ottawa which does not 
understand what their needs really are. Passing this bill would not 
send a positive message to these people who are already very 
frustrated.
<P>
	It is now abundantly clear that the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans is not committed to downsizing his bloated department. He 
would rather try and slip a new level of bureaucracy into his 
department under the guise  of broad consultation rather than deal 
with the harsh realities of downsizing.
<P>
	Canadians want less government and that is a message which 
must be sent over and over. Government members must get that 
message: Canadians want less government. They are tired of 
supporting and wrestling with and trying to deal with a huge and 
inefficient bureaucracy when they are trying to make a living and 
trying to live their lives and build their futures.
<P>
	In Canada there are over 6,000 fisheries officials and they 
manage 65,000 licences. We have 6,000 officials and 65,000 
licences. The department operates with a budget that exceeds 
three-quarters of a billion dollars and that is just for administrative 
costs. Clearly, there is room here for a little cost cutting to be taken 
at the top of this department, a department with over 6,000 officials 
and a budget of three-quarters of a billion dollars.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I am sure everyone will be waiting with bated 
breath to hear the end of this story after the vote.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I advise the hon. member

	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should move to streamline 
administrative and regulatory processes in the energy sector with the objective

	He said: Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to speak in 
favour of Motion No. 434 which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of the House, the government should move to streamline 
administrative and regulatory processes in the energy sector with the objective 
to minimize unnecessary regulatory burden.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	For an entrepreneur in the energy industry, negotiating the maze 
of government regulations is almost as great a challenge as 
overcoming the technical and physical problems of a program. 
Satisfying the demands of a multiplicity of regulatory boards and 
agencies, often at three levels of government, is like walking on fly 
paper; no sooner is one bureaucratic condition satisfied than the 
applicant's feet become glued to another sticky spot.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14910"> 14910 </A></B>
<P>
	This is not unique to the energy sector. All phases of Canadian 
activity are mired in regulations and each successive government 
seems determined to pass more laws and make more rules. The 
old adage that the best government is the one that governs least 
has been all but forgotten. We are well on our way to terminal 
social and economic constipation.
<P>
	The passion for filling out forms requiring the approval of 
platoons of bureaucrats is not new. This destructive waste of time 
and resources contributed mightily to the downfall of the 
Hapsburg, Ottoman and Soviet empires and was the leading cause 
of the collapse of the Manchu dynasty in which generations of 
China's brightest and best wasted away in an atmosphere of useless 
paper shuffling; thus the French word chinoiserie.
<P>
	The curious aspect of energy sector over regulation is that almost 
everyone, including senior politicians, recognizes the problem. In 
April 1993 the Conservative government commissioned a review 
of federal regulations to ``identify those that significantly reduce 
the competitiveness of Canadian industry'' or impose needless 
costs on the consumers.
<P>
	A report was released in October 1993 just in time for the 
election and some of the panel's recommendations have actually 
been acted on. Several sets of redundant regulations have been or 
are in the process of being revoked. These, however, were purely 
Natural Resources Canada regulations. It does not address the 
problem of the overlap of federal and provincial regulations, and 
regulatory conflict between various government departments is a 
much more serious matter.
<P>
	Only the federal Minister of the Environment seems to be 
oblivious to the problem; witness her unseemly remarks and 
confrontational attitude during question period earlier this 
afternoon. This overlap, believe it or not, is most pervasive in her 
bailiwick in situations in which environmental protection is at 
stake. There is also overlap in matters affecting worker health and 
safety and the transportation of dangerous goods.
<P>
	The multi-tiered environmental permit problem has been 
recognized by the Minister of Natural Resources. She has stated in 
an open letter to the Northern Miner that the government is 
committed to addressing this issue: ``The goal is a single window 
approach''.
<P>
	Those words are music to every Canadian petroleum and natural 
gas producer and marketer and also to people in the mining, 
forestry, agricultural and transportation industries.
<P>
	The Liberals, through their minister, have expressed a policy. 
Now I would truly like to see them act on it. Then we could stand 
back and watch the revitalization of our resource based industries.
<P>
	For a classic example of regulatory overkill, I suggest we look at 
the Atomic Energy Control Board. Actually, I would rather not 
look at it since it is one of the few  federal entities that continue to 
grow like a giant fungus in spite of the fact that its workload has 
been decreasing for a decade. Be that as it may, it is the major 
player in the regulation of the nuclear industry, all the way from 
mining to waste disposal.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately the AECB is overlapped both provincially and 
federally. At the extractive level the provincial mining departments 
make regulations. The provincial environment departments make 
regulations. The federal environment department makes 
regulations and throughout the entire nuclear cycle various 
provincial occupational health and safety divisions make 
regulations.
<P>
	When all other hurdles have been cleared there are still 
municipal zoning laws to contend with. I am aware of one instance 
in which a proposed uranium refinery facility in Saskatchewan was 
killed by the local government not on technical grounds but for 
purely political reasons.
<P>
	Then we have review panels. They have no authority, no legal 
standing but they can delay projects for months simply by being in 
session.
<P>
	In 1993 a joint federal-provincial environment assessment 
review board spent several months studying proposals for three 
uranium mining developments in Saskatchewan. It made three 
recommendations and the Saskatchewan government cheerfully 
ignored one of them with the blessing of the federal government. 
Why did it spend all that time doing the studies? Who knows.
<P>
	It is time for the various provincial and federal departments to sit 
down together and develop a single window permitting system for 
uranium mines. Developers are entitled to know before the first 
shovel full of dirt is dug if in terms of economic benefits versus the 
social and environmental costs it makes sense to proceed with a 
project.
<P>
	The second major national player in the regulation of the energy 
industry is the National Energy Board which controls all 
interprovincial movement of oil, gas and electricity. It also controls 
international trade in those commodities. Conflict exists to the 
extent that provincial interests are often contrary to what the 
National Energy Board considers to be the national interest. Who 
can ever forget the national energy program?
<P>
	On the other hand, there is a good example of federal provincial 
co-operation in the offshore boards which regulate what goes on 
under the sea. These boards could serve as a pattern and a model for 
eliminating the problems caused by competing federal and 
provincial environmental agencies.
<P>
	To get back to the environmental agencies, they are not energy 
regulators per se but they have a tremendous impact on the 
industry. There are instances of projects  being environmentally 
approved at the provincial level only to have further studies and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14911"> 14911 </A></B>
<P>
interminable delays demanded by a federal department. I am sure 
other hon. members will have something to say about that.
<P>
	The energy industry needs relief, not so much from taxes as from 
the ocean of paper it is required to swim through. An industry that 
accounts for 7 per cent of our gross domestic product and which 
directly or indirectly provides employment for 620,000 people is 
entitled to reasonable consideration and rational treatment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise to address the 
motion put forward by the hon. member for Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia.
<P>
	My colleague has informed the House about steps the 
government is taking to reduce regulatory overlap and duplication 
in the Canadian nuclear sector.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to give the House an 
overview of the initiative undertaken by the government in other 
sectors of the energy industry in order to meet these objectives.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Before I do, however, I remind hon. members that the very basis 
for these efforts is the government's commitment to a market 
oriented energy policy. We believe the energy industry must have 
the flexibility to adapt to changing market circumstances if it is to 
continue to contribute to Canada's economic prosperity. That 
means keeping government intervention in the marketplace to a 
minimum.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	Nevertheless, there is a need for regulation in the energy industry 
just as there is a need for regulation in other sectors of the 
economy. As my colleague noted, the challenge is to achieve a 
regulatory framework which protects the public good but does not 
unnecessarily inhibit the industry. Achieving this balance requires 
the government to be constantly mindful of the impact of its 
regulatory activities on the industry.
<P>
	The agency primarily responsible for regulating Canada's oil, 
gas and electricity sectors in the areas of federal jurisdiction is the 
National Energy Board, the NEB. The board was established in 
1959 under the authority of the National Energy Board Act, and for 
the past three and half decades it has done an excellent job in 
meeting the needs of both government and industry in 
administering a reasonable and balanced regulatory regime.
<P>
	Under the act the NEB sets tolls and tariffs for oil and gas 
pipelines and also approves the construction of pipelines and 
designated power lines under federal jurisdiction. The board also 
authorizes the export of oil, gas and electricity and the import of 
gas.
<P>
	The National Energy Board is an independent quasi-judicial 
body which reports to Parliament through the Minister of Natural 
Resources. It is comprised of nine members, all of whom are 
appointed by governor in council.
<P>
	Matters relating to tolls and tariffs, minor construction and short 
term import/export orders are the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
board. However, decisions requiring certificates of public 
convenience and necessity and export and import licences must be 
approved by the governor in council.
<P>
	The NEB has proven to be an extremely effective regulatory 
body. In my view the board will be even better positioned to meet 
industry needs in the future as the result of recent initiatives it has 
taken to modernize, streamline and simplify its regulatory 
processes and requirements. These initiatives are in direct response 
to 13 recommendations the board received in October 1993 from 
the Minister of Natural Resources advisory panel on regulatory 
review.
<P>
	I am pleased to inform the House the board has moved swiftly 
and effectively to address each of these recommendations. For 
example, the NEB has revised many of the processes and 
requirements for filing information with the board with the overall 
objective of easing the administrative burden on industry. Among 
other things, the board is implementing an electronic regulatory 
filing system for all regulatory filings. As well, it has taken 
industry views into account in revising its guidelines for the filing 
of information by companies applying for certificates of public 
convenience and necessity.
<P>
	The board's guidelines for preparing a social economic impact 
assessment for pipeline projects have also been revised to reflect 
new legislative requirements and to avoid overlap and duplication 
with other statutory requirements.
<P>
	The National Energy Board has also demonstrated its ability to 
adapt to change in the natural gas market by revising its rules on 
how gas can be moved on pipelines. Earlier this year the board 
decided to end its ban on selling pipeline transportation rights at 
prices above the regulated toll, which will help ensure the available 
capacity is allocated in the most efficient manner.
<P>
	The board also decided against requiring that available pipeline 
capacity be posted on electronic bulletin boards since this 
secondary transportation market has been working well without 
any such regulation.
<P>
	In August 1994 the National Energy Board issued revised 
guidelines which will make it easier for pipeline companies, 
producers, shippers, consumers and governments to resolve tolls 
and tariff issues through negotiation rather than formal NEB 
hearings which are costly to all parties.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14912"> 14912 </A></B>
<P>
	In another cost saving measure for the industry, the board 
decided to set the cost of capital for group 1 pipeline companies 
for multi-year periods rather than on an annual basis. This will 
reduce the expense associated with annual hearings for each 
pipeline by reducing the length of the hearings.
<P>
	The National Energy Board is also endeavouring to reduce 
overlap and duplication by working more closely with provincial 
regulatory bodies.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	For example, the NEB and the Alberta Energy and Utilities 
Board have signed two memoranda of understanding, the first to 
implement a mutual aid agreement for pipeline incidents in Alberta 
and the second to establish a common reserve data base.
<P>
	Under the first MOU, when an incident occurs on an NEB 
regulated facility the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board will, at the 
request of the National Energy Board, provide emergency response 
assistance. If the incident involves a provincially regulated pipeline 
the NEB will be available to provide emergency response 
investigation assistance. The end result will be a faster, more 
effective response by both boards to pipeline incidents in Alberta.
<P>
	Under the second MOU the NEB and the AEUB will share 
geological and reservoir information for natural gas and crude oil 
pools. The sharing of information will result in a common reserve 
data base for Alberta. The beneficiaries of this most efficient 
method of maintaining estimates of reserves will be the oil and gas 
industry and the taxpaying public.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I could go on and on about the efforts made by the National 
Energy Board to reduce the overlap and duplication and to 
streamline the administrative requirements. However, my goal here 
is only to give the hon. members an overview of the recent 
measures taken by the Board to improve the regulatory framework 
for the oil, gas and electricity sector.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would urge the hon. member for Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia to seek a full accounting of the NEB's 
regulatory reform initiatives directly from the board. I believe he 
will be impressed with the progress that has been made to date. The 
record will clearly indicate that this government not only endorses 
the objective of reducing the regulatory burden on the energy 
industry, but it is actively pursuing that objective on a day-to-day 
basis.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to speak to the motion standing in the 
name of the hon. member for Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia: ``That, in the opinion of this House, the 
government should move to  streamline administrative and 
regulatory processes in the energy sector with the objective to 
minimize unnecessary regulatory burden''.
<P>
	I think the hon. member's motion is particularly relevant at a 
time when one of the items on the government's parliamentary 
agenda is Bill C-62, the Regulatory Efficiency Act, and in fact I 
hope members of all parties will work together to find an effective 
way to make regulations flexible and refrain from policies that are 
counterproductive.
<P>
	The motion of the hon. member for Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia deals indirectly with a set of regulations that 
are so rigid they often cause more harm than otherwise in the 
energy sector. The hon. member's motion could also apply to other 
areas as well and in fact to practically any area of human activity, 
since almost everything we do is regulated.
<P>
	This motion also leads us to question the advisability of having 
so many levels of government, each with their own regulations, 
federal, provincial and even municipal. All these levels of 
government have their various departments, each with the authority 
to veto the other's initiatives, which means that obtaining a single 
permit may be a very lengthy process. In this respect, the director 
of a new mining development, the Troilus project north of 
Chibougamau in Quebec, pointed out in an interview with 
Radio-Canada that he needed no less than 37 certified permits 
before he could start his project.
<P>
	On the basis of his own experience with the Troilus project, he 
also said in the interview that he realized why Canada now ranked 
only fifth in the world as a country that was attractive for mining 
exploration. It was mainly because of its undue regulatory burden. 
Although he made it clear that he was not in favour of more flexible 
environmental regulations, he did point out that competition 
between various levels of government and various departments 
made the work of developers unnecessarily complex and was not 
conducive to economic development.
<P>
	At the federal level, the number of regulations is impressive. It is 
enough just to flip through the 14,420 pages of the <I>Consolidated 
Regulations of Canada</I> of 1978 and the 4,277 pages of the <I>Canada 
Gazette</I>, part II, for 1994 alone.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	The regulatory process, which is intended among other things to 
lighten the legislative process of which it is a part, has had the 
opposite effect over the years, adding to the number of standards 
without necessarily improving quality.
<P>
	There are therefore a growing number of increasingly complex 
and technical regulations, and this has resulted in a considerably 
more complicated administrative burden for Canadian taxpayers. It 
would be appropriate to assess the impact of this situation upon the  

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14913"> 14913 </A></B>
<P>
competitiveness of Canadian businesses and even upon the 
Canadian economy as a whole.
<P>
	I would like to cite one example of a situation in which two 
legitimate objectives are at cross-purposes in responding to two 
different safety requirements, the example of an infant crib with a 
drop side to make it easier for disabled parents to use. Such a crib 
cannot meet crib safety standards, which require the sides to be 
fixed, when the side needs to be lowered to ensure safe access for 
disabled parents. This regulation runs counter to the needs of 
disabled parents and presents an enormous obstacle for them.
<P>
	One could readily imagine some mechanism to reconcile these 
two objectives, if a worthwhile instrument for doing so were 
created, instead of stupidly allowing the regulations to control the 
situation.
<P>
	As the member for the Abitibi region I have often had to 
intervene in order to help speed up the administrative process for 
projects held up by the application of outmoded regulations. For 
example, the Grevet mining project near Quévillon in the Abitibi 
region had to wait 15 months to obtain environmental approval.
<P>
	In order to get these approvals, authorizations from the 
Departments of Environment and Indian Affairs, among others, 
also had to be obtained, because the area is close to the James Bay 
reserve and the Cree territory. Here again, we can see that the 
federal government, by interfering in provincial jurisdictions, is 
creating overlap that only makes regulations more cumbersome, so 
that processes needed to administer them are more complex and 
more confusing.
<P>
	This is not new, at least for the official opposition, that has spent 
a lot of its energy trying to make the federal government 
understand that its policy of centralizing everything too often 
causes more harm than good.
<P>
	The oft-requested creation of a single window for permits or any 
other activity requiring the cooperation of several governments or 
departments has become more than essential and our economy's 
viability depends on it.
<P>
	In the energy sector, the situation is no different. At the national 
level, a number of major players are involved in the regulatory 
process and somehow competing with each other. The federal 
government, through the National Energy Board or Natural 
Resources Canada, also adopts regulations, thus adding to the 
competition between federal and provincial environmental 
agencies.
<P>
	This undue regulatory burden has a disastrous impact on the 
energy sector. My colleague from the Reform Party who showed an 
interest in the vitality of Canada's energy sector and the well-being 
of his fellow citizens is seeking with his motion to express his 
concern that regulations are strangling industry and, in turn, all 
Canadians.
<P>
	As I too am concerned about the mining industry, I can say that 
the decline of investments in mining exploration clearly illustrates 
the disastrous effects of a double, and even triple layer of 
administration, because the excessive number of regulations is 
only one of the important factors in the decline of mining 
investments.
<P>
	The mining industry is linked to the energy sector because it 
accounts for close to 13 per cent of the total energy demand of 
industry in Canada and Quebec, and it is suffering needlessly as a 
result of this situation. Why does the federal government let this 
situation, that impacts so negatively on our economy, go on?
<P>
	Any businessman will tell you that a bad organization makes you 
lose time and, as you know, time is money, which means that in the 
end it could have dire consequences for the company. We are not 
talking about a small business here, but about an industry that 
accounts for 7 per cent of Canada's and Quebec's GDP or $45 
billion each year.
<P>
	This is far from the single window concept which I talked about 
earlier and which would allow for the simplification of the 
administrative process. We know of projects that were approved by 
the provincial government but rejected by the federal government. 
Conflicts arise because each level considers itself to be the only 
one that has the power to regulate.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	To conclude on this motion, I would say that we obviously have 
to rationalize without delay the administrative process and its 
regulations in the energy sector. Too many agencies, companies 
and individuals are paying the price of this duplication and these 
useless conflicts.
<P>
	The federal government should, in the interest of everyone, 
simplify its regulations, leave to each level of government its own 
regulation-making, even if it has to resort to single windows to 
deliver permits when an act applies to a provincial area of 
responsibility.
<P>
	It is a good thing that the rest of Canada has begun to talk about 
rationalizing the role of each government. In Quebec, we have been 
asking for that for a long time.

<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today and speak on my colleague's motion.
<P>
	The streamlining of regulations has certainly for many years 
been a popular political topic in Canada. Governments have been 
talking for years and in spite of that relatively little has happened in 
streamlining and reducing overlap in regulations between federal 
and provincial governments.
<P>
	As far back as 1978, Prime Minister Trudeau entrusted the 
Economic Council of Canada with the task of reviewing 
government regulations in certain sectors.  Among other things, the 
study was to focus on the relevance and impact of regulations. The 
<P>

<B><A NAME="14914"> 14914 </A></B>
<P>
council proceeded to look at a number of sectors, notably 
telecommunications and occupational health and safety. This 
seems to show, as my colleague mentioned, that over-regulation is 
certainly a problem in many sectors other than the energy sector.
<P>
	The council generally recommended that routine regulations and 
agreements be codified and made public at all levels of 
government. The aim of this recommendation was to ensure a 
clearer grasp and understanding of the scope of regulations.
<P>
	In the second recommendation, pertaining to products and 
development projects, the council recommended that in instances 
when responsibility for a particular sector was shared between the 
federal government and the provinces, a single department should 
be assigned responsibility for co-ordinating the activities of 
participating departments. Of course that is the single-window 
approach that the previous speaker mentioned. Businesses would 
thus waste less time than they do when they have to deal with all 
the departments of government.
<P>
	In September 1984 Prime Minister Mulroney announced that he 
was setting up a ministerial task force to review all federal 
government programs with a view to making them simpler and 
more accessible. Nineteen study teams composed of public and 
private sector individuals were formed and mandated to review 989 
programs accounting for expenditures of $92 billion. One of the 
study teams focused on regulatory programs.
<P>
	Not specifically mentioned in the program review appended to 
the report is a list of federal programs considered problematic in 
terms of provincial relations. Problems identified had to do either 
with jurisdiction or overlap or with matters of information, policy, 
et cetera. Of the 134 registered programs identified, 86, or 66 per 
cent, were categorized as problematic in at least one province or 
territory, while 27, or 20 per cent, were found to overlap with 
provinces or territories. The task force observed the highest 
incidence of overlap in the case of environmental programs.
<P>
	The study team reviewing regulatory programs concluded 
among other things that there was evidence of ongoing significant 
overlap and duplication between the two levels of government. It 
recommended that initiatives be adopted to improve the regulatory 
process. Specifically, it recommended that a study of overlap in the 
environmental sector be conducted. Moreover, the task force called 
for an immediate review of the overall burden imposed by the 
various levels of government. It concluded that Canadians were 
over-regulated and that it was important to cut down the number of 
regulatory levels.
<P>
	So members can see that this is certainly not a new subject in 
Canada for political debate. It has been  ongoing for years and 
years. It is the general consensus, I think, with all parties in Canada 
that all sectors are over-regulated. As we mentioned, today the 
energy sector is certainly one sector that is over-regulated.
<P>
	In the spring of 1986 the government adopted a federal 
regulatory reform strategy. It called for all new regulations to be 
subjected to economic and social cost analysis. The public would 
henceforth be informed and involved in the regulatory process. For 
one thing, the process would not take so long. Furthermore, the 
current regulatory process would be streamlined to improve 
efficiency. These are very familiar terms, which we have heard 
many times.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	One of the 10 guidelines for reform deals directly with the issue 
that interests us here. In the view of existing regulatory burden and 
the need to eliminate needless duplication, co-operation with the 
provinces was deemed to be a government priority.
<P>
	To prove how serious it was, the government moved in the 
summer of 1986 to create the ministry of state for privatization and 
regulatory affairs. Although each department continued to be 
responsible for its own regulations, the office of privatization and 
regulatory affairs was put in charge of promoting the government's 
regulatory objectives.
<P>
	With respect to program efficiency, considerable progress has 
been made since the strategy's adoption. For example, the average 
timeframe for regulatory approval has dropped substantially since 
the development of this office. According to the office, better 
inspection and enforcement mechanisms have been developed and 
overlapping regulations have been eliminated, at least to some 
degree.
<P>
	Since 1987 the government has also released an annual federal 
regulatory plan. This publication gives an overview of forthcoming 
regulations. In each instance the purpose of the regulation is 
mentioned, along with the impact it will have.
<P>
	The federal regulatory plan also includes a regulatory evaluation 
plan. In 1988 the office published a paper listing all of the 
regulatory reviews and reforms undertaken by different 
departments. In all, 77 initiatives were identified. In 1991 the 
office was disbanded and responsibility for regulatory affairs was 
assigned to the Treasury Board.
<P>
	After this general history and overview, we are still left with the 
same problem in the energy sector as well as in many other sectors. 
The reality of the 1990s is that we do not want complex and 
bureaucratic solutions to the problem of over-regulation. We need 
to adopt a different philosophy. Our primary focus has to be to 
simplify and eliminate regulations wherever possible. For those 
that remain we need to share the administrative responsibility with 
other partners. While quality and service have to  remain a primary 
objective, we expect there will have to be a significant shift in the 
degree and type of interaction between the federal and provincial 
governments that create these regulations, regulatory boards that 
oversee them, and the industry that must comply with them and in 
some instances be burdened by them.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="14915"> 14915 </A></B>
<P>
	The best way to examine the effects regulations have on a 
company is to look at a specific example of what I have been 
talking about up to this point. The National Energy Board was 
faced this year with an application by Foothills Pipe Lines Limited 
to construct the Wild Horse pipeline, which is an interconnecting 
link within Alberta from the Nova System to the proposed 
Altamont pipeline at Wild Horse on the Montana border.
<P>
	The nature of the application and Foothills' approach to the 
National Energy Board raises fundamental questions with respect 
to the approval process for future pipeline facility expansion. 
Foothills' application stretched the limits of conventional National 
Energy Board facilities approval requirements in several important 
areas.
<P>
	Under established approval procedures, a pipeline applicant 
must demonstrate that the facilities are needed, that there is a 
reasonable expectation they will be used for a significant portion of 
their useful life, and that tolls will be paid. The requirements are 
manifested in the demonstration of five aspects of supporting 
evidence: adequate supply in Canada to maintain incremental 
deliveries over time; a market assessment of sustainable demand 
for incremental gas volume; firm shipper contractual commitments 
for the new capacity for an extended term; specific contract market 
commitments to purchase the incremental gas; and specific 
dedicated supply to service these market commitments. The last 
two have been subject to some relaxation in other recent 
applications as long as a binding, firm shipper contract for the new 
capacity was in place. Where the application represents an 
expansion to existing facilities, rolled in tolling treatment has 
almost universally applied.
<P>
	That is what Foothills was facing in the regulatory process in 
getting approval for this rather insignificant pipeline extension. 
What Foothills was seeking was pre-approval and certification to 
build facilities without demonstrable market support. As an 
alternative to outright approval, Foothills indicated that it would 
accept a conditional certificate that would require some further 
demonstration of shipper contractual commitments prior to 
construction.
<P>
	As time is short, I will not go into more detail on that specific 
proposal. The point is that when the gas market was hot and 
Foothills wanted to build the extension on the pipeline to service 
that market the regulatory procedure was so complex and 
cumbersome that the market in reality was dried up before the 
regulatory approval system could be put into effect.
<P>
	Therefore, in effect what we are talking about today is the 
streamlining of this regulatory process.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> There being no further 
members rising for debate and the motion not being designated as a 
votable item, the time provided for the consideration of Private 
Members' Business has now expired and the order is dropped from 
the Order Paper pursuant to Standing Order 96(1).
<P>
	It being 6.06 p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
