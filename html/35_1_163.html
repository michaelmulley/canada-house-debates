<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">GOVERNMENT ORDERS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BORROWINGAUTHORITYACT,1995-96">BORROWING AUTHORITY ACT, 1995-96</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved 
that Bill C-73, an act to provide borrowing authority for the 
fiscal year beginning on April 1, 1995, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to take part in this 
historic budget debate, specifically Bill C-73, which will give 
borrowing authority and put into effect the measures announced 
by the government and the Minister of Finance on Monday 
evening.
<P>
	I start by paying tribute to my colleague and friend, the 
Minister of Finance, whose budget is cradled in that wellspring 
of traditional Canadian thought and liberalism, compassion and 
integrity. His statement reflects both those important values and 
principles. It is a clear example of the difference between 
management and leadership. A manager only imitates, while a 
leader initiates.
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	Everyone in this country has a part to play in this economic 
plan, in this blueprint. We are all making sacrifices. Those who 
work in the public service across our country; the farmers who 
work the land; those who fish the seas; business people who run 
our shops and factories; and Canadian families every day of the 
week across this country, all of them are making sacrifices. That 
is an important principle of the fairness and equity which 
provides a sturdy foundation to the budget put before this 
Chamber by the Liberal government.
<P>
	Newcomers to the Canadian family will also contribute their 
share to this process of nation building in the form of a landing 
fee, not a head tax. The landing fee will be put toward the 
services that help them integrate into Canadian society.
<P>
	This fee is not a barrier at our borders but simply a fee that is 
fair and just. It is not meant to control or regulate those who 
come to Canada. Rather it is an effort to secure the value and 
tradition of settlement integration programs in Canada. It is 
uniquely Canadian and very much different from how things are 
done in the United States for instance where there is no 
settlement, no integration and no language training.
<P>
	I ask what cost a society pays for not having a system up front 
that not only welcomes newcomers but integrates them into the 
Canadian family and then sees them flourish and move upward. 
Newcomers can be business people, business leaders, members 
of Parliament, social workers, professors, Canadians like all of 
us. That is the difference and it is unique to this country. This 
government feels it is worth the price of preserving a system that 
not only works for the newcomers but works for this country.
<P>
	How we deliver those services will be the subject of ongoing 
discussions with our partners in the provinces, the 
municipalities and the non-governmental organizations who 
help deliver those settlement services. And yes, there will be 
discussions with those who need and would make use of those 
services.
<P>
	It is within the context of fairness and the necessity for 
compassion, integrity and the need to do things better and still 
show fiscal responsibility that this government moves forward. 
Today, the government is announcing a plan to streamline 
Canada's process for identifying refugees who need this 
country's protection. In doing so, the refugee determination 
system will become fairer, faster and more cost effective. 
Canada needs these changes.
<P>
	The immigration and refugee discussion is one of the more 
controversial and difficult public policy issues faced in this 
Chamber and across the country. We all hear it. We discuss it in 
our riding offices, in the coffee shops or on the steps of our 
places of worship.
<P>
	This planet is awash with people on the move. Yes, I know that 
in the dry environment of statistics it is very easy to pluck 
numbers from tables, charts and graphs.  However, when the 
United Nations catalogues the movement of more than 125 
million people in one year and notes that of these, 23 million 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10232"> 10232 </A></B>
<P>
happen to be refugees, the human mind balks and stutters at the 
numbers. The more staggering the figure, the more difficulty we 
have in comprehending it.
<P>
	Let me put it into perspective. We are talking about five 
metropolitan Torontos, ten Vancouvers. Even more simply, 
more than three times the entire population of Canada is on the 
move worldwide every year. Of course, these are not just 
numbers; they are men, women and children. The vast majority 
of refugees indeed are women and young children.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	Refugees are the unfortunate but horribly logical 
consequence of a world wrestling with overpopulation, 
underdevelopment and politics coming from the end of a 
machete or out of the barrel of a gun.
<P>
	There are those within the sound of my voice who by 
utterance, deed or innuendo have tried to make refugee a dirty 
word. This government and I believe the Canadian people will 
have none of that. Why? Because it touches on our national soul, 
our very sense of ourselves as a nation and as a people. So we ask 
ourselves: Who is that refugee? Who is that stranger among us?
<P>
	Make no mistake. Canada has greeted refugees just two steps 
ahead of the death squads. They are people like the brave women 
who testified against war criminals and war atrocities in the 
Balkans. Otto Jelinek who served with honour in the cabinet of 
previous governments was a refugee. I look across the aisle at 
the critic from Her Majesty's loyal opposition, a refugee from 
Chile.
<P>
	Refugees seek Canada for protection, not for charity. Canada 
has a record in which we can all take pride. At the same time let 
us not sound too altruistic because there has been a major benefit 
to Canada as well. We should never forget that this is very much 
a win-win situation. Canada is good to immigrants and refugees 
seeking a home, but those newcomers and eventual Canadian 
citizens of all persuasions are equally loyal and fiercely defend 
this country from sea to sea.
<P>
	Yes, we want to continue to be humanitarian but we also 
refuse to be taken for granted. Our focus was, is and will be on 
resettlement. We reject outright the standards of some nations 
where ethnic backgrounds and ethnic backgrounds alone allow 
access to citizenship. That would never be the Canadian way.
<P>
	Today, if we take a breath and look at the world around us, 
there can be some cause for worry and concern. We are 
vulnerable to the pressures from outside our control which can 
overwhelm and swamp our immigration and refugee processing 
systems with very little advanced warning or notice.
<P>
	Canada is not alone. At this moment, western Europe is 
pulsating with people on the move. The figures are mind 
boggling. In 1993 for instance, Germany received  425,000 
refugees seeking a roof over their heads. Last year the 
Netherlands took in 55,000 refugees. The U.S. has millions of 
illegal residents and has a backlog of 425,000 refugee claimants.
<P>
	The world needs to work together. Quite frankly, it needs to 
work together in a better and more interconnected way so that 
we can come to grips with this massive migration, not 
exclusively to one country or a few countries, but all over the 
globe.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	That is one reason Canada is working diligently to reach an 
agreement with the United States and other nations. It would 
stop or discourage so-called asylum shopping while 
maintaining and ensuring protection for those in need.
<P>
	Just last week we moved closer to that reality. Our Prime 
Minister and the President of the United States announced an 
accord to improve border management. Within six months, we 
are to pursue negotiations on a memorandum of understanding 
between our two countries built on the integrity of our system 
and protection for those who deserve it.
<P>
	An integral part of our refugee policy and program is the 
Immigration and Refugee Board. Since its creation in 1989 the 
board has evolved and matured. Its goals are to identify those in 
need of Canada's protection as convention refugees and to 
adjudicate as well all immigration appeals and inquiries.
<P>
	The board's challenge has been to do that fairly and 
effectively in the face of changing world conditions. The IRB 
decision making process operates at arm's length from 
government. We intend to maintain it just that way.
<P>
	There has been criticism directed at the board. There is no 
attempt on my part here today to minimize or downplay the 
worries or concerns of our fellow citizens.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This government has made changes and adjustments to 
Canada's refugee policy. We recently improved the adjustment 
assistance program.
<P>
	You also probably know that at one time refugee claimants 
were not allowed to work while awaiting processing. Our 
government changed that last year in order to alleviate the 
burden on social services.
<P>
	In addition, we are working with a number of municipalities 
to prevent duplication of services and multiple claims. This 
House recently gave third reading to Bill C-44, which will 
provide us with the means to address the case of criminals who, 
while few in number, have the potential to undermine our 
Canadian system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians must have faith in their system. This government 
has listened to their concerns and we have moved quickly, but 
those changes are not enough.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10233"> 10233 </A></B>
<P>
	First, the report by Professor James Hathaway signalled a 
commitment to change, to improvements. In response a number 
of administrative and management changes will be announced 
tomorrow by the chairperson of the IRB as she is responsible 
and justifiably so, for the day to day management and 
operations of the IRB.
<P>
	Because of the importance of this entire issue it might be an 
opportune time for the Standing Committee on Citizenship and 
Immigration to invite the chair of the IRB to meet with them. 
They could not only explore and discuss some of the changes 
and adaptations that she and the IRB will be announcing 
tomorrow, but they could also look into the workings of the 
board in the fulsome of time and study.
<P>
	Second, there are a number of policy and legislative changes 
that the government will make to the Immigration and Refugee 
Board. This is a straightforward matter of getting government 
right. There has been agency and program review and the IRB is 
part of that. Part of my job is to detail the policy and legislative 
changes to the IRB which we believe are needed to make it run 
more effectively and make better use of the taxpayers' dollars, 
while maintaining the integrity of the Canadian borders.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	The government realized there was concern over methods of 
appointments to the board and to some extent over the quality 
and consistency of the decisions. We also knew that the in 
Canada refugee determination system had to be streamlined to 
keep pace with both fiscal restraint and world developments. It 
is our belief there is a remedy at hand which involves both 
policy and legislative changes.
<P>
	In this regard the government has decided to reduce the panel 
size for refugee hearings from two board members to one. The 
reduction in the refugee division members from 175 to 
approximately 112 will lead to an annual savings of almost $6 
million. Consistent with the strategic plan that I announced in 
November in the House, the savings will be targeted to helping 
refugees.
<P>
	The appointment process for panel members has been cause 
for some concern. Again the government recognizes this point 
and as a result we have decided to establish an independent 
advisory committee to examine the qualification of all 
candidates for the Immigration and Refugee Board. The 
advisory committee will ensure that only qualified candidates 
are recommended to the government for appointment. The 
committee will be responsible for ensuring that a balance is met 
between the board's objective standards and an increasing 
public demand for more political accountability.
<P>
	We want the top candidates for the job. It is mandatory that the 
best people are named to the board, because the reduction in 
panel size requires unquestioned and unflinching competence 
from every board member. This new process will be applicable 
to new appointments in the future.
<P>
	I am also pleased to announce that Gordon Fairweather has 
agreed to be the chairperson of the advisory committee. As a 
former Conservative member of Parliament, chair of the 
Immigration and Refugee Board and international human rights 
advocate, we believe he is ideally suited for the job.
<P>
	Today the government is also filling two vacant and key 
positions at the Immigration and Refugee Board, that of deputy 
chair and executive director. The new deputy chair will be Mr. 
John Frecker, while the duties of the executive director will be 
assumed by Mr. Jean-Guy Fleury.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, there are savings in the new 
procedure. Our target date for full implementation is January 
1996. We expect to realize annual savings of $5.7 million by 
1997. In the estimates before the House and its committees, the 
IRB has also put on the table savings of some $6 million in 
addition to the savings I have announced today.
<P>
	The board is not only part of the program and budget review 
process. It is also sensitive that it too must become a partner in 
putting the finances of the country first and the integrity of the 
system on the same level playing field. Most of the money will 
be utilized for settlement of refugees from abroad. We can see 
that this is not a project merely to camouflage cost savings so 
government can pocket the money.
<P>
	I have a real sense that although they mean well some would 
build walls and allow only hand-picked refugees into our 
country. It is our obligation under the Geneva convention not to 
send back legitimate refugees. This is a country and this is a 
government which live up to their obligations. We are good 
citizens of the world and world leaders. It is not me as minister 
bragging that we are world leaders; it is people around the globe 
and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees telling 
us.
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
	Three days ago I met with Mr. Chefeke, director of the 
UNHCR bureau for all the Americas, and apprised him of the 
government's plans. I am pleased to confirm that he is very 
supportive of the changes we are bringing forward this morning. 
Canada and the UNHCR have long been partners and friends. It 
has always been thus and it will continue to be that way.
<P>
	In closing, let me hearken back to the Governor General's 
installation message when he asked us to give good news a 
chance. His Excellency noted that we were all immigrants to this 
land; it was just that some came sooner than others. He paid 
special tribute to the refugees of recent years and special tribute 
to the communities that opened their arms and their hearts and 
adopted the refugees. He told us how they came with their hands 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10234"> 10234 </A></B>
<P>
empty, forlorn of everything except their hopes, and how 
through effort and hard work they flourished.
<P>
	More of these people will come. We have the will and we have 
the way.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> I rise on a point of order, Madam Speaker, 
because the minister used his speech- I did not interrupt out of 
politeness-on Bill C-73, an act to provide borrowing authority 
for the fiscal year beginning on April 1, 1995, to make 
announcements-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur: </B>Madam Speaker, at least let me finish.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order. I just want to 
advise the hon. member that, speaking on a bill dealing with 
such matters as borrowing authority, the government can raise 
just about any issue directly or indirectly related to public 
finances.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster has the 
floor.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Standing Orders have some descriptions of Statements by 
Ministers. What we have just heard more aptly fits the 
description of a ministerial statement under citations 348 and 
349.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> As I stated earlier, on a 
bill such as Bill C-73 respecting the borrowing authority, the 
government may discuss any of its dossier.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I wish to respond very briefly 
to the point of order.
<P>
	The Chair is quite correct. The government does not attempt 
by a point of order to censor opposition or any criticism toward a 
government borrowing bill either to increase or decrease 
expenditures, alter them, initiate a government program, cancel 
one and so on, or advocate any such change. Similarly when a 
government member, a member of the ministry or another 
member, speaks on the borrowing bill he or she has exactly the 
same latitude as an opposition member would have.
<P>
	You are quite correct, Madam Speaker, in the way you have 
assessed it. It is definitely the way such bills have been handled 
in the past.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Before giving the floor 
to the hon. member, I would remind the House that a bill 
respecting borrowing authority is indeed a continuation of our 
budget debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Unless the hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster is 
seeking the floor on another point of order I will continue with 
debate.
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Madam Speaker, I am agreeing with your 
position. What I am asking is for unanimous consent of the 
House to allow a 10-minute question and comment period in 
light of the fact that this was more along the lines of a 
ministerial statement where there is a chance for the opposition 
parties to respond.
<P>
	I believe the government would be open enough to allow a 
question and comment period. I am just asking for unanimous 
consent.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The House has heard the 
request by the hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster. Do 
we have unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> I am entitled to have the floor to ask questions.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order. The Chair has 
ruled on this point of order. Is the hon. Opposition Whip rising 
on a separate point of order?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Madam Speaker, just a comment. I think that 
you are quite right: the minister was in order. It is just that what 
he did lacks class. Thank you.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, but this is not 
a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
apologize for the frog in my throat this morning.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order. The hon. member 
for Joliette has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Madam Speaker, thank you for your support. My 
voice being as it is this morning, I will have to ask my hon. 
colleagues to please be as quiet as possible if they want to be 
able to hear me.
<P>
	When the budget is tabled at about this time every year, it 
always raises either fears or hopes in the population, some 
interest groups, the financial community and all walks of life 
depending on what is perceived as an improvement in our 
personal circumstances and whether individuals or 
organizations consider the latest budget will increase their tax 
burden or make their lives more difficult.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10235"> 10235 </A></B>
<P>
	And each year, since Parliament was established I guess, the 
opposition has raised numerous questions during this budget 
preparation period to try to provide guidance to the government 
and point out where we would not want the budget to hit our 
most disadvantaged taxpayers. So, representations have been 
made for as long as there has been governments.
<P>
	In the past 30 years however, this budget preparation period 
has become, in Canada and most provinces, but even more so in 
Quebec, a much greater source of anxiety because expectations 
are high. There is always a chance the federal government will 
use the budget to decentralize powers to the provinces and to 
give them the tax points that go with these powers, so that the 
provinces can better set their priorities, be it in education, 
occupational training, public health or social programs.
<P>
	Finally, this whole period lets us hope for a better future. 
Unfortunately, budgets rarely come up to everyone's 
expectations and this one is no exception. Indeed, while some 
members of our society, some groups were reportedly pleased 
with the budget measures, others felt short-changed.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	In any case, if I had to sum up the level of satisfaction derived 
from the budget, I, for one, would say first of all that the federal 
budget cuts in the wrong places. It launches a full-scale attack 
against the most disadvantaged and slashes social programs, 
unemployment insurance and the public service. It hardly 
touches the wealthiest, for example by sparing tax shelters and 
profits made by banks and large corporations. It does not cut 
deeply enough in places where fat remains, such as National 
Defence, business subsidies and duplication.
<P>
	Second, it is easy to see that there is nothing at all for 
employment development in this budget. There are no recovery 
measures or job training. On the contrary, they are using the 
infrastructure program put in place last year by the same Liberal 
government to backtrack and reduce municipal subsidies.
<P>
	In summary, it could be said that this budget is generally 
unfair, especially for Quebecers, in particular in the agricultural 
sector, in the area of national defence, and in terms of deficit 
decentralization and its impact on Quebec's economy.
<P>
	In the few minutes available to me, I will elaborate on each of 
these points to try to explain how we arrived at this conclusion.
<P>
	I said that the government picks on the most disadvantaged, as 
shown by its handling of social programs. The federal 
government contributes to social programs by transferring 
money to the provinces. Between 1994-95 and 1997-98, 
transfers for social assistance, health care and post-secondary 
education will go down from $17.3 billion to $10.3 billion. This 
40 per  cent cut will have a devastating impact on the most 
disadvantaged.
<P>
	Next year, Quebec will lose $350 million, and cuts in transfers 
for post-secondary education could raise tuition fees by over 60 
per cent and threaten free college education in Quebec, since the 
bill is always picked up by the taxpayer. In the short term, these 
increases would restrict access and lead to low education levels 
among the poorest, who cannot afford such exorbitant tuition 
fees.
<P>
	As far as unemployment insurance is concerned, again this 
year, the government is cutting UI by 10 per cent. New 
legislation in the fall will once again slash UI by tightening 
eligibility requirements and reducing insurable amounts.
<P>
	These drastic measures will hit those members of society who 
have trouble finding jobs and may well have to turn to 
provincially-funded social assistance if they no longer qualify 
for UI.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	This is another form of offloading, since the government 
takes a UI beneficiary and sends him to the welfare roll. Of 
course, this means that the person comes under another 
jurisdiction, since unemployment insurance is a federal 
program, while social assistance is a provincial one.
<P>
	Using a logic which I would call perverse, the Liberal 
government tells us that it considers the unemployed to be 
cheaters. However, Quebecers refuse to endorse such a view. 
Even more revolting is the fact that, while cuts are being made to 
the UI fund, that program shows a surplus of $2 billion and it is 
estimated that, by 1996, that surplus will exceed $5 billion. Yet, 
instead of taking that money to help the unemployed find jobs, 
the federal government uses that surplus to reduce its deficit. 
Again, this confirms that the government wants to reduce the 
deficit at the expense of the poor.
<P>
	As regards the public service, the government intends to 
abolish 45,000 positions over the next three years. These cuts 
should be made in a fair manner, based on a prorated distribution 
between the various groups and also according to the number of 
federal public servants in each province.
<P>
	The decision to go all out and cut 40,000 to 45,000 jobs is 
particularly illogical considering that the government continues 
to contract out work at an almost unacceptable level, to the tune 
of $7.7 billion annually, according to PSAC estimates.
<P>
	In other words, what the government saves by reducing the 
number of public servants, it spends by contracting out work. As 
you know, contracting out work is a good way to reward friends 
of the party, something which is called patronage.
<P>
	We agree that the government should cut the fat, but this 
streamlining exercise must not be done exclusively on the backs 
of public servants. There is fat in many areas, not just in the 
public service. I already mentioned  the transportation services 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10236"> 10236 </A></B>
<P>
used by members of this House and of the other place. Why have 
two services? Both houses could use the same service and save 
money in the process. I do not want to discuss every public 
account, but this is a striking example. I could mention many 
others.
<P>
	Managers should also be let go, not just members of their 
staff. The cuts should be spread fairly between management and 
the employees. This is essential if the Liberal government is 
going to ensure fairness, as it claims to want to do.
<P>
	According to the daily <I>Le Droit</I>, 114 managerial positions, out 
of 12,642, will be cut. This represents 0.9 per cent of all the cuts. 
By comparison, 2,508 clerical positions out of 40,145 will also 
be eliminated, which amounts to 6.2 per cent of the cuts. We can 
see clearly that the proposed cuts will affect seven times more 
clerical employees than managers, once again penalizing low 
income workers.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	Cuts affecting the wealthy are also by far too timid. First, tax 
shelters. Nothing has been done about thousands of businesses 
that do not pay taxes. About 60,000 businesses that have shown 
a profit for the past few years are not paying taxes on those 
profits. This is not a matter of tax evasion or trying to 
manipulate the tax people. Under the current provisions of the 
act, these companies can take advantage of certain tax loopholes 
and make a profit without having to pay taxes on those profits.
<P>
	The government has done nothing to change the 16 tax treaties 
signed with countries considered to be tax havens. The 
preferential treatment given by the Liberals to the wealthiest in 
this country is particularly obvious in the case of the notorious 
family trusts. The government has deferred taxing capital gains 
in family trusts until 1999. The Minister of Finance has refused 
to act on recommendations by the Bloc Quebecois to do 
something immediately about tax loopholes that deprive the 
federal government of hundreds of millions of dollars in tax 
revenue each year, mainly from Canada's wealthiest families.
<P>
	I think we should recall certain statements made by members 
of this House when they were in the opposition. In 1992-93, the 
hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell had the 
following to say about family trusts: ``The 21-year rule is the 
Robin Hood in reverse rule. It is designed specifically to give 
help to those who least need it. Why does one want to give an 
additional tax break to billionaires?'' This is still the hon. 
member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell: ``It is kind of like 
having two goalies in the net. In case the puck misses the first 
one the rich have this extra large hockey stick which can deflect 
anything right at the back of the first one- It is simply bad and 
we should not renew those provisions at all''. This was said on 
March 29, 1993. I am pleased to see the hon. member for  
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell is here to listen, and I hope he 
recognizes this quote.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, there is a member of this House who 
occasionally sits in your chair, the hon. member for Edmonton 
Southeast, for whom I have every respect and who had the 
following to say on the same topic: ``We should perhaps call it 
the comfort bill for family trust holders in Forest Hill Village, 
Rosedale, Upper Westmount, Park Lake Circle and perhaps 
parts of Shaughnessy in Vancouver. There is no reason why 
those very few Canadians who are fortunate enough to have 
family trusts should have preferential treatment. There is no 
reason to extend what was a more than generous deadline''. This 
was said the same day, on March 29, 1993.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	Another hon. member of the government, who, on May 4, 
1993 was a member of the opposition, the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood, whom I also greatly admire, said the 
following: ``When that kind of unfairness- is out there it 
affects people's spirits and it affects their attitudes in terms of 
the workplace. When one multiplies that right across the 
country, it has a devastating effect on productivity, profitability 
and everything else. The exemption period has been extended 
indefinitely, depriving us of billions of dollars in tax revenues. I 
find it really disgusting that we adopted this bill. I am just 
talking about fairness, not confiscation, about taxpayers who do 
their fair share''. This is what the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood said on May 10, 1993.
<P>
	I could go on, but there is another statement, which was made 
by the hon. member for Gatineau-La Lièvre. I do not want to 
leave him out, and I want to identify him as well. He said, on 
April 2, 1993, and I quote: ``This government is allowing them 
to keep accumulating wealth at the expense of the middle class 
and the poor of this country. What happened yesterday in the 
House is a disgrace, and the day will come when people will 
have to answer for certain social injustices''. I will quote one 
last member of this House, who today is a minister-the hon. 
member for Ottawa South. He said, on March 30, 1993, with 
regard to family trusts, and I quote: ``The answer that was 
proposed- is to say 21 years is a long enough trust and every 21 
years, whether the property is disposed of or not, it will be 
deemed to have been sold even if it has not and capital gains tax 
will have to be paid. I do not think we can have any idea how 
much tax this money could have generated under such an 
arrangement, but I would think it would be a tidy sum, to say the 
least''.
<P>
	These people are still around today. They sit in this House. I 
wonder how it is, only a year or two after making such 
statements, that they are unable to act on them and acknowledge 
what they said at the time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10237"> 10237 </A></B>
<P>
	Despite all these statements, the Minister of Finance is 
refusing to act on the recommendations of the Bloc Quebecois 
and take immediate action to close these loopholes, which are 
depriving the government of hundreds of millions of dollars in 
revenue every year primarily from the major wealthy Canadian 
families, and I believe I have identified them fairly clearly.
<P>
	However, to calm widespread taxpayer indignation at the 
huge bank profits, the Minister of Finance is going to levy a 
small token tax on banks, a small additional and temporary tax. 
Accordingly, while billions are cut each year in unemployment 
insurance-the figure mentioned earlier was something like $5 
billion next year-the banks are going to have to pay an 
additional $60 million this year and $40 million more in 
1996-97. Do you think it is going to hurt the banks to be taxed 
this amount? One hundred million dollars over two years: $60 
million the first year and $40 million the second.
<P>
	I would remind you that the six largest financial institutions in 
Canada made over $4.28 billion in profits in 1994. The Royal 
Bank alone made over $1.2 billion in profits.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	It is ridiculous to say that everyone is affected by this budget. 
The government is taking just $100 million from a potential tax 
source of $4 to 5$ billion and suggesting that this amount is 
equal to what is being asked of other elements in society. How 
utterly ridiculous. We could even say this increase is 
hypocritical, since it may well be passed on to consumers, which 
banks and large corporations usually do, because such increases 
are always reflected in the price of these companies' final 
product.
<P>
	So in the end, the consumer has to foot the bill. Large 
corporations are facing a 12.5 per cent tax increase under this 
budget, which will generate additional revenues of only $460 
million over the next three years. This is very small compared to 
the $1.5 billion to be gained from the increased tax on gasoline. 
In this case too, the government is trying to show people, 
through this measure taken by the finance minister, that 
everyone has to do his bit.
<P>
	Everyone doing his bit apparently means in this case that 
some have to make drastic sacrifices while only minimal ones 
are expected of others. If this is supposed to be a just society, I 
think we are on the wrong track. Compared to a 12.5 per cent tax 
hike for major corporations, a very slight tax on the price of 
gasoline will bring in three times as much or $1,5 billion.
<P>
	The government boasts that it is not increasing taxes. And yet 
only a third of new revenues or $900 million which the 
government intends to collect will come from corporations. The 
remaining amount of $2.8 billion will come out of taxpayers' 
pockets. Where is the fair budget we were promised? What 
happened to the minister's promises that he would above all tax 
the rich? That being  said, Madam Speaker, I would like to quote 
a few figures comparing personal taxes and corporate taxes.
<P>
	From 1980 to 1994, personal taxes increased by 70 per cent, a 
rate indexed for inflation. The source of this information should 
be reliable and I hope it will not be disputed; it comes from the 
Finance department. Only the governments in Scandinavian 
countries and Belgium draw a higher proportion of their 
revenues directly from their citizens. What has happened to 
corporate taxes during this period? Let us look at the period 
extending from 1955 to 1992. In 1955, 25 per cent of federal 
revenues were drawn from companies. In 1975, corporate taxes 
accounted for 17 per cent of federal revenues and in 1992, they 
made up 7 per cent of federal revenues.
<P>
	So we can see that corporate tax rates are in a free fall. In 
1980, the tax rate was 46 per cent for big corporations and 25 per 
cent for small business. From 1988 to 1995, corporations were 
taxed at a rate of 28 per cent and small businesses at 12 per cent. 
It is very clear that the trend has been reversed and that from 
now on individuals and not corporations will pay more tax to the 
government.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	The latest profits make the following corporations members 
of the billionaires' club: the Royal Bank, with $1.2 billion, Bell 
Canada, with almost the same amount-$1.178 billion, and 
General Motors of Canada, with $1.3 billion. How much tax did 
they pay? It would be very interesting to see their tax bill, if 
Taxation would only give it. It would reveal what the 
government is planning when it talks about a just society.
<P>
	To elaborate on what I said earlier, the federal government did 
not trim enough of the fat. I alluded to this earlier when I said 
that the public service is not the only place where fat could be 
trimmed-National Defence is another potential target. Its 
budget will be cut by $1.9 billion over three years. A cut of $4.8 
billion over the same time frame is what the Bloc Quebecois has 
been suggesting for two years now as an alternative to cutting 
social programs.
<P>
	Close more bases and cut defence spending more. The Auditor 
General mentioned that the number of bases could be reduced to 
12 without compromising the army's ability to function. In 
addition, it apparently costs over $125 million just to relocate 
members of the armed forces within Canada. This was said at the 
defence committee and echoed at the public accounts 
committee: between $125 and $130 million per year, not to 
transport troops to peacekeeping missions, but just to relocate 
transferred employees. Even with the army doing the 
transporting, it costs $125 million. That is fat if I ever saw it, 
Madam Speaker.
<P>
	Housing for families of members and officers of the armed 
forces is a losing venture, it loses $30 million per year. Since 
1978, the cumulative loss in this area is $2.3 billion. All the 
while, some officers pay only token amounts for rent, amounts 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10238"> 10238 </A></B>
<P>
that are considerably lower  than what renting a comparable 
house would cost on the market.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is happy to see that Minister Martin has 
cut business subsidies. He is on the right track in that regard. 
Congratulations! But the Bloc Quebecois believes his 60 per 
cent cut does not go nearly far enough.
<P>
	Even the Conseil du patronat agrees that these subsidies 
should be dropped altogether. Here is an additional $1.6 billion 
that could be cut over the next three years. Even business agrees 
with the Conseil du patronat that these subsidies should be cut, 
because more often than not, they amount to a means of giving 
friends of the government a competitive edge.
<P>
	The money such a move would save could be used to fund 
social housing, in order to avoid the planned cuts of $307 
million over the next three years.
<P>
	We also talked about the billions of dollars wasted by 
duplication between the federal and provincial governments. 
The Liberal government's budget does absolutely nothing to 
eliminate or even reduce this costly duplication. The federal 
government is not withdrawing from areas of provincial 
jurisdiction. It has not abolished the departments where 
duplication occurs: health, human resources development, 
natural resources, and we could name others.
<P>
	It is also not withdrawing from other areas of provincial 
jurisdiction, such as forestry, mining, tourism, housing, 
recreation and municipal affairs.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	The second point I made was that there is absolutely nothing 
in this budget for employment. In order to return to the 
pre-recession level of employment, more than 800,000 jobs 
would have to be created in Canada. During the last election 
campaign, the Liberal Party proclaimed loudly that job creation 
was their number one priority.
<P>
	And yet, the budget before us contains no measures, either 
general or specific, to encourage job creation. There is no sign 
of any overall plan being implemented or even proposed. Nor 
does the government seem to have any intention whatsoever of 
taking action in the medium term to help the unemployed find 
jobs. Even the unemployment insurance surpluses that are 
supposed to contribute towards job creation will be used to bring 
down the deficit.
<P>
	This budget is proof to us that the Minister of Finance has 
scrapped the red book and given up on doing anything about the 
present rate of unemployment. The budget forecasts 
unemployment rates of 9.5 per cent for 1995 and 9.4 per cent for 
1996. The Liberal government's vision is cruelly insensitive to 
the millions of unemployed Canadians. I hope that in this area 
the federal government's forecasts are more accurate than its 
forecasts in recent years with respect to the rate of growth, 
because if it has made the same mistakes, we will  be facing 
unemployment rates of 10.5, 11 or 12 per cent and not 9.5.
<P>
	As regards job training, this is an area of jurisdiction over 
which Quebec has been requesting exclusive control for a 
number of years now, even under a Liberal government. In the 
present budget, the federal government creates additional 
duplication, instead of reducing it. It has announced the creation 
of a human resources investment fund. For the time being we are 
told that this should encourage solid and sustainable job 
creation, but we do not have many details yet. It is essential, 
however, that a provincial job training plan be put in place.
<P>
	As long as the federal government continues to hang on to 
responsibility in this area, thus duplicating what is being done 
by the government of Quebec, many resources and precious time 
will be lost forever, with disastrous consequences for the job 
situation in Quebec.
<P>
	Through its failure to act and its stubborn refusal again in this 
budget to let Quebec look after its own job training, the federal 
government is adversely affecting Quebec's economic 
development.
<P>
	I would like to touch briefly on the infrastructure program. 
This $2 billion program, which was announced with great 
fanfare during the 1993 election, was supposed to create 45,000 
temporary jobs over three years. We can only assume the 
program has gone very well, because the government has 
decided to terminate it ahead of schedule. This was the only 
concrete measure that would have helped the government keep 
its job creation promise, and even that was not followed through 
on. In fact, the budget cuts the $200 million that remained in this 
program.
<P>
	The provincial and municipal governments have been told 
that they will not get the remaining $200 million federal subsidy 
that they were counting on, regardless of what they might have 
hoped and expected. So, $200 million for the federal 
government, $200 million for the provincial government, $200 
million for each of the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	This means a $600 million shortfall in Quebec's economy in 
terms of infrastructure projects. That is a pretty penny. This 
government apparently committed to creating jobs is actually 
pulling out of these projects, thus depriving several 
municipalities of funding they had been promised. The Minister 
of Finance would have easily won the lemon award for unkept 
election promises.
<P>
	I will comment briefly on this budget which is unfair for the 
people of Quebec in particular. With respect to agriculture, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10239"> 10239 </A></B>
<P>
Martin budget is plainly appalling, depriving farmers of $560 
million in Crow's Nest subsidies. In Quebec however-
<P>
	Madam Speaker, you are signalling that my time is up, while I 
thought I had five minutes remaining. I will therefore keep my 
other comments for another time.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to not only address the government's borrowing bill, 
C-73, but to also make a few comments about the budget.
<P>
	The single biggest problem facing Canada today is the 
national debt of over $550 billion and the interest costs to 
service that debt. It is all too easy to think of this debt as a 
government problem, but it is not. The debt does not cost 
governments, it costs Canadian taxpayers. We pay for the debt 
directly every day in interest payments paid from taxes.
<P>
	Whatever the party or Prime Minister or finance minister, the 
Government of Canada has not had a single balanced budget in 
25 years. As a result, every Parliament has to pass bills like 
C-73, borrowing bills, to give it the ability to borrow money to 
service this debt.
<P>
	For these two decades our governments have been living 
beyond their means, creating a delusion that we can live 
indefinitely on borrowed money.
<P>
	How do they get away with it? How do they get taxpayers to 
fall in line when the cornerstones of our society like health care 
are in jeopardy because we are forced to borrow $89 million 
every day and $625 million every week to finance the debt? The 
answer in a word is sophistry, using clever but misleading 
arguments to justify actions.
<P>
	One thing I noticed in my first year as MP was that an 
experienced cabinet minister could spin even the most unsound 
logic into what seemed to be publicly accepted government 
policy. The finance minister is no exception. He is an extremely 
clever man politically, and I often wonder what he is really 
doing with the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	As a businessman and a taxpayer, I finally realized that we are 
all being hoodwinked. By waxing eloquent about breaking the 
back of the deficit and floating frightening trial balloons of 
higher income taxes, the finance minister has finessed many 
Canadians into believing that it is okay to go into debt, but just 
not as much as we have been in the past.
<P>
	I would like to walk through the budget to demonstrate the art 
of sophistry at work, necessitating this borrowing bill we are 
debating today. Sophistry is defined as false reasoning or clever 
but misleading arguments. So much of what is served up in the 
1995-96 budget is both politically clever but economically 
misleading. Is this truly a sound budget as the finance minister 
claims, or an unsound budget based on false reasoning?
<P>
	If these walls could talk about the history of deficit fighting in 
this House, what would they say? They would tell of a former 
finance minister, now a Prime Minister, who in 1978 said 
significant reductions in the deficit can be expected. The deficit 
then was $13 billion. He is back at work now and the deficit is 
$39 billion. Seventeen years later he is saying the same thing, 
singing the same tune. When will he learn that times have 
changed?
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	These walls would also tell us about Liberal finance minister 
Allan MacEachen, who in 1982 said the government cannot 
responsibly add to the deficit. The deficit then was $28.7 billion. 
Today the Liberals continue to add to that deficit.
<P>
	These walls would also tell us of Michael Wilson, who in 1990 
said: ``We will reduce the deficit to $28.5 billion next year. We 
will cut it in half to $14 billion in three years. We will reduce it 
even further to $10 billion the year after that''. Does that sound 
like the current finance minister? Is that not what he sounded 
like the other day when he presented his budget? That deficit 
grew to $32 billion.
<P>
	Finally, if these walls could talk they would tell us of our 
current Minister of Finance, who one year ago promised to break 
the back of the deficit and attack it head on. He had a projected 
deficit of $42 billion and the actual deficit that he will announce 
will probably be around $38 billion.
<P>
	Deficit has been the focus since 1975. Meanwhile the real 
problems, the debt and the interest cost to service that debt, keep 
growing. Adding to the debt and therefore increasing interests 
costs, regardless of interest rates, regardless of the growth in the 
economy, will eventually erode program spending, reducing the 
amount of money for social programs and job creation 
initiatives.
<P>
	That is what is wrong with the current direction in which this 
government is going. Before a single dollar of income is 
redistributed, before a dime goes to social programs, before a 
penny is spent on any other government program $2,200 must be 
paid yearly in interest for each and every person in Canada. Each 
Canadian's share of direct federal and provincial debt has risen 
from $4,500 in 1981 to over $25,000 today.
<P>
	Here we have our clever finance minister talking about the 
deficit and the fact that he will spend less. He is misleading the 
Canadian taxpayer with the argument that by lowering the 
deficit through instalments he is solving our economic problem 
of the debt. He is not solving the problem. We have to get to a 
zero deficit. We have to stop adding to the debt. We should have 
a balanced budget as our immediate target, not somewhere down 
the road, that floating two-year revolving door.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10240"> 10240 </A></B>
<P>
	In their reaction to the clever minister's budget the chartered 
accountants of Canada have stated: ``The government has failed 
to set firm targets for the reduction of the deficit after 1997. 
Achieving a $25 billion deficit in 1997, which may well be the 
high point in the current economic cycle, is not sufficient. We 
must seize the opportunity now to break the deficit cycle and 
not risk facing unsustainable levels of deficit in the next 
economic downturn. We need a longer term plan to bring 
government spending under control''.
<P>
	Reformers have done this. We set out a clear spending 
reduction plan in our taxpayers' budget which would reduce the 
deficit to zero in three years. As our leader has pointed out, the 
biggest spending decision that the finance minister has made by 
not cutting program spending more quickly is to increase 
spending on interest charges from $39 billion when they first 
were elected to $51 billion when they are defeated in 1997 or 
1998.
<P>
	When the Liberals came into power in 1994 their total 
government spending was projected to be $158 billion. By 1997 
their total projected spending will be $158.6 billion, despite all 
these spending cuts. On the spending side they will be right back 
where they started. They have failed to take the necessary steps 
to deal with the severity of our fiscal crisis and are leading 
Canada on a track destined for bankruptcy. Where is the benefit 
for people who have been hit with public service cuts, program 
cuts and cuts to transfer payments? The only purpose of these 
cuts, it appears, is to service the ever increasing debt. It is all 
going to interest.
<P>
	The debt is the problem. The deficit is simply a contributing 
factor. It is politically clever but misleading to tell people that 
by slowing the digging we will fill the whole.
<P>
	Another clear example in the budget of the finance minister 
practising the art of sophistry or false reason or clever but 
misleading arguments is evident when he states that the Liberals 
are not raising personal income taxes. Of course not. That would 
have knocked him way down in the polls and the minister knows 
that. The challenge was therefore to squeeze more money out of 
the taxpayer without waking them up to that fact. The minister 
succeeded.
<P>
	I will give the House four examples. The tax rates of large 
corporations were raised by 12.5 per cent and corporate surtaxes 
increased by 1 per cent, from 3 per cent to 4 per cent. These 
increases will be passed on to consumers and will ultimately fall 
on the middle class, the very heart and soul of the support of the 
Liberal party, in the form of higher prices.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	The Liberals placed a temporary capital tax on large deposit 
taking institutions. A temporary tax, there is an oxymoron. It is 
like a prominent backbencher. In 1917 income tax was 
originally supposed to be temporary.
<P>
	Taxing banks means higher costs to Canadians for banking 
transactions. Watch how quickly service charges change in the 
next year.
<P>
	A third example is the Liberals have raised gasoline taxes by 
1.5 cents which will cost the average Canadian and so too will 
higher taxes on cigarettes which the minister sneaked in through 
a ways and means motion a few weeks ago.
<P>
	The Liberals have eliminated the public utilities income tax 
transfers to the provinces which means if your utilities are 
provided by a private company you will see your rates jump by 
as much as 25 per cent because they no longer get the same 
treatment as fat cat government owned utilities.
<P>
	This is another clever technique used by the finance minister 
to punish Alberta MPs. Let us punish the city of Calgary for 
voting six Reformers. Let us reward Edmonton for electing four 
Liberals. This blatant partisan political endeavour will only 
come back to haunt the Liberal Party. This was a selective tax 
grab against Alberta. The Minister of National Resources 
yesterday did not even have the courage to answer one of my 
colleague's questions about her support for the PUITTA 
transfers to the provinces. Eventually those provinces that are 
considering privatizing their utilities will not do it now because 
of the extra costs.
<P>
	Clearly this budget is nothing more than a tax on the 
consumer. It is a consumer budget. It raises about $1.5 billion 
that consumers are going to have to pay, not on their personal 
income tax which they are all happy with, but through hidden 
taxes, through consumer taxes. It is a form of a GST.
<P>
	Automobiles do not pay taxes. The people who buy them do. 
Once again the Minister of Finance is practising the art of 
sophistry by using a clever but misleading argument to make 
taxpayers think that he is doing them a favour by not raising 
their individual tax burden when he is by $1.5 billion.
<P>
	Another example of sophistry can be found in the finance 
minister's use of soft targets in his budget projections. The real 
test of spending cuts from one year to the next is if we spend less 
than the year before. This government for the second time in a 
row will be spending more that it did the year before. It is up to 
$163.9 billion from last year's projected $163.5.
<P>
	If the Liberals were truly going to spend less they would be 
below that $163 billion figure. Once again the minister does not 
sell it that way. He talks about spending cuts, lowering the 
deficit and that reaching his target of 3 per cent of GDP will 
solve all our problems. Meeting the 3 per cent target depends on 
the continuation for another three years of recovery in the 
business cycle. That is very unlikely to occur. That is why it is 
called a cycle.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10241"> 10241 </A></B>
<P>
	The Liberals continue to delude taxpayers that things will 
turn around. They believe strongly in overly optimistic 
economic growth projections. Their hopes for gradual 
improvement lead them to delay, to defer, to minimize the need 
for tough and immediate action.
<P>
	They think gradually they will work this through. It appears as 
though gradualism has become a Liberal policy. Change should 
not be introduced too suddenly. To avoid any shocks to the 
system reforms of any kind should be introduced gradually.
<P>
	In an article I was recently reading the writer suggested that 
we use a gradual approach to introduce new traffic laws from 
driving on the right side of the road to the left side. Do it 
gradually, buses and trucks this year, cars next year. Gradualism 
is not going to work.
<P>
	All that Liberal rhetoric about rolling two year targets does is 
side track us from the real problem of the debt. Once again 
gradualism sounds appealing but it is misleading. Interest costs 
continue to rise. At the end of the Liberal term they will have 
added another $10 billion to the interest costs of this nation. 
This is what they are doing. This is where their spending cuts are 
going. Everybody is sacrificing in this country just to pay the 
darn interest costs on the debt instead of getting the deficit to 
zero so that interest costs will not rise.
<P>
	Why is it on the question of fiscal common sense finance 
ministers continually react by saying they will balance the 
budget tomorrow, they will get at it first thing next year, they 
will aim for a balanced budget but in the meantime they have to 
tackle the deficit? How would members react to someone who 
had cancer and planned to wait to seek treatment until he felt 
better? This is yet another example of a clever but misleading 
argument by the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has said that small business is the 
engine of our economy. It creates 85 per cent of the jobs in 
Canada. Yet in his budget he tried to take credit for the 400,000 
jobs that have been created in this past year in Canada when all 
the government can take credit for are the 60,000 jobs it created 
through its infrastructure program which has simply added to 
the debt.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	It is absolutely amazing how many times we heard that the 
infrastructure program was a huge success, creating years of 
employment. It was not just short term. Now we see in the 
budget that funding for the program will be reduced.
<P>
	If the infrastructure program was such a success, then why has 
it been cut? Was it not living up to its potential? Through pork 
barrel programs like infrastructure, the Liberals are being 
politically clever but, as their budget demonstrates, 
economically misleading.
<P>
	Another example of sophistry at work can be found in the 
finance minister's criticisms of the Reform Party's policy on old 
age security. The finance minister said the Reform Party's 
taxpayer's budget would hammer seniors at the low end of the 
income scale, which simply is not the case.
<P>
	During the election campaign the Conservatives accused us 
that this would effect seniors who made $17,000 a year. Now the 
finance minister has the gall and the nerve and audacity to stand 
in this House and tell Canadians that we will hurt and harm 
seniors who make $11,000 a year. That is pathetic.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Where are the cuts 
coming from?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I will get to that. I will show exactly why the 
finance minister should retract what he said at some point in the 
future.
<P>
	These scare tactics are clever but they are misleading. In our 
taxpayer's budget Reformers propose that key changes to OAS 
would include basing the program on family income. Guess 
what?-that is what the Liberals are going to do as well. We say 
who it is going to effect. We say at what level it will effect but 
the Liberals do not have the courage to say what they are going 
to do on social programs.
<P>
	In the two-year projections, the money on social programs 
stays at the same level of $39 billion. The transfers to provinces 
go down by about $2 billion without any of the tax points going 
over there, but they do not come clean. That is the problem. It is 
a budget of broken promises and it is a budget of slight of hand.
<P>
	Our budget would protect those currently receiving 
guaranteed income supplements and not paying benefits to high 
income families. That is what our policy would be on the OAS. 
This is what the Liberals have suggested in their budget.
<P>
	Let me now give a definite example. Members have been 
waiting for me to get to this. I am sure this is the part that is very 
interesting. They want to know where we get our figures. We get 
our figures from the government's own numbers. It is a 
document it produced. It is a book. I think it is coloured. It 
means this government is good on colours. It has the red book, 
the grey book, the green book, the mauve book, the white.
<P>
	This is from ``Creating a Healthy Fiscal Climate'', page 70, 
annex table 26, distribution of net federal elderly benefits by 
household income, 1994.
<P>
	Eight hundred thousand households receive less than $15,000 
in income. The benefits they receive which include the OAS, the 
spousal portion and the GIS, are $7 billion. That would be 
untouched by our taxpayers' budget.
<P>
	Where does the finance minister get his $11,000 figure? The 
next level up is $15,000 to $20,000 for 390,000 households; $2.6 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10242"> 10242 </A></B>
<P>
billion goes there. That is  nobody who receives a household 
income of $20,000. Even if you divide that in two, you are at 11.
<P>
	Twenty thousand to twenty-five thousand dollars is the next 
level: 380,000 households, $3 billion goes there. Twenty-five 
thousand to thirty thousand dollars: 250,000 households; $1.7 
billion goes there. Thirty thousand to forty thousand dollars 
household income: 280,000 households; $1.8 billion goes there.
<P>
	Even if you took the $40,000 you would end up with $20,000. 
Where does the finance minister get his $11,000 number? He 
says if $11,000 is what we would do, I challenge the finance 
minister if he wants to restore and retain his credibility, because 
he has said this publicly, to confirm that his numbers are right in 
this.
<P>
	If these numbers are right then there is no way that taking $3 
billion out of OAS, a $20 billion envelope, and reducing it to $17 
billion we going to harm one single senior who makes less than 
$20,000 in income. Our target is about $40,000.
<P>
	I insist that if the finance minister catches wind of what I have 
said here today-I see that the parliamentary secretary to the 
finance minister is present-we deserve a correction on that. We 
deserve a clarification.
<P>
	We are playing with peoples' lives. We do not want to scare 
people. We want to get to a zero deficit. We want to cut more 
than the Liberal government. We would cut faster than the 
Liberal government and you can take all the credit you want 
about ours being slash and burn, but we know that our 
projections and the way we want to do it is the right way, it is the 
correct way, and is the way it should be done.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	For the government to accuse wrongly, neither party should 
do that. Both parties and all members of Parliament should try to 
be accurate. They have a responsibility to be accurate when they 
are talking about numbers and how they affect lives. We can 
disagree on philosophy but we should not disagree on numbers. I 
think I have said enough on that.
<P>
	Let us turn to income security for members of Parliament. Has 
the finance minister made any sacrifices there? The answer is 
no. Canadians have to sacrifice but not MPs. They are not paid 
enough so the MP pension makes up for that. The old time 
politicians will benefit from the original plan to the new two 
tiered plan that will make millionaires out of many of them 
while future politicians will be asked to accept the reformed 
plan.
<P>
	It is outstanding to sit in this House and listen to the Prime 
Minister compare his salary with professional hockey players' 
every time we ask him a question about pensions. Why does he 
compare his pension with the pension of a hockey player? Why 
does he not compare his pension to those pensions out there in 
the private sector?
<P>
	What we are saying is that the compensation package has an 
imbalance. The compensation package for MPs is out of whack. 
The compensation package has to be revisited and the whole 
thing has to be looked at. The MP gold plated pension plan is too 
generous. The $64,000 a year is too low. However, this 
government is too heartless and lacks the courage to address the 
problem head on. It wants to protect all the old cronies from the 
past and will not address what should be addressed in the proper 
fashion.
<P>
	There is no way that any member of this House should receive 
any more than matching contributions to what a member puts 
into a pension plan, one for one. I do not care if it is 5 per cent, 6 
per cent or 8 per cent, it should only be one for one.
<P>
	To boot, the Prime Minister has said he cannot reform the MP 
pension plan retroactively because there is a rule in democracy 
that we do not pass retroactive legislation.
<P>
	Considering the fact the Liberals applied retroactive 
legislation to the Pearson contract, the EH-101 helicopter 
contract, the public service contracts and to Canadian taxpayers 
working overseas, why is it that these same Liberal politicians 
are not subject to the same rules as those Canadians? How can 
the Prime Minister contradict himself this way? It is a clever 
thing to say but it is a misleading point to make when the facts 
betray what he is saying. It is a double standard. It might be 
sophistry.
<P>
	Once again the Liberals are leading the taxpayers to believe 
that they are actually reforming the system when all they are 
doing is making it less gold plated for the young MPs but still 
very generous. I cannot believe the number of rookie Liberal 
MPs who have been coerced and have just sat there. They are the 
strongest number in caucus and they sit there and let these 
veterans push them around. They sit there and are forced to go 
back to their constituents, most in Ontario, and say sorry, but 
they had to take this two tiered pension, they cannot sacrifice 
because the Prime Minister and cabinet will not let them. I 
cannot believe that.
<P>
	The rookie Liberal MPs have an opportunity to set an 
example. The rookies have an opportunity to crack the whip and 
to show them in caucus what it is all about to be an MP: real 
integrity, real honesty and real leadership, not the old style 
partisan, pork barrelled system that has been going on for the 
last 25 years.
<P>
	What has changed? We have a Prime Minister who is still 
going out to $1,000 parties that 99.999 per cent of Canadians are 
not even invited to. We still make blatant partisan appointments, 
not the Liberals who deserve to be there but blatant ones that 
should not be made. The Liberals are still spending $40 billion 
more a year than they bring in. They fail to recognize the real 
problem.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10243"> 10243 </A></B>
<P>
	The finance minister talks of downsizing and reducing the 
cost of government when the fact is that in Ottawa Canadians 
still have a big government and a high spending government. 
Reformers believe that government governs best that governs 
least and the best government is smaller government.
<P>
	Why is it that in the state of California 52 congressmen, 2 
senators, 1 governor and 1 president represent at a federal level 
29 million people?
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	Let us say that Canada is pretty close to 29 million people for 
the sake of argument. We have for the same 29 million people 
295 MPs, 104 senators and one Governor General representing 
the taxpayers. Are we not as competent as congressmen? They 
can represent 500,000 people while we can only represent 
100,000 people? Do we not have the intelligence? Do we not 
have the technology to have representation by population with a 
higher population base? I think we can.
<P>
	Talk about downsizing the public service by 45,000 people 
over three years. Why do we not downsize the House of 
Commons? What are we doing instead? We are not going to 
downsize the House of Commons. While the government lays 
off 45,000 civil servants it is going to bring in six more MPs. 
There will be six more MPs in the next federal election.
<P>
	Once again the Liberals want to increase the size of 
government. Make it big. Keep the backbenchers happy. Let a 
small cabinet control things. They refuse to consider more 
effective approaches to accommodate shifting, growing 
populations.
<P>
	Reformers believe the House should have 265 members. 
Taking into account the floating nature of the population we 
cannot cap it because of all of the deals that have been made 
since Confederation. We would then have a reasonable House. 
We would have members of Parliament that represent more 
people. We would have members of Parliament that would really 
have some value and some input into what is going on rather 
than this huge size. Except for the 20 people that sit around the 
Prime Minister, the rest of us are just here for window dressing.
<P>
	We believe the House should be reduced to a fixed number. If 
the size is continually expanded to match population increases, 
the House will reach unmanageable proportions with 
unsustainable overhead costs. The answer to population growth 
is not to increase the numbers of representatives but to 
periodically redraw constituency boundaries-redistricting; to 
redistribute seats according to population 
shifts-reapportionment; and introduce an elected, effective 
and equal Senate for regional control.
<P>
	The time has come to bring back financial responsibility to 
government, not to make government bigger. Politicians have to 
be accountable to the people of Canada, to be trusted to handle 
their money. More faces  will not improve the system. I heard a 
little comment about Alberta?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> How many seats do you have from Alberta?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> We have 27 seats from Alberta.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is 26.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> For instance, the city of Calgary has six MPs. I 
would cut two out of the city of Calgary. We only need four MPs 
from the city of Calgary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> Which two would the hon. member cut?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mine and-If you have a personal problem and 
have to go somewhere, I think it should be respected.
<P>
	The government is selling a lean, mean government but is 
increasing its size at a future cost to millions of taxpayers. It is 
sophistry, clever but misleading.
<P>
	Despite the hype, the Liberal budget is not a great budget. It 
does not go deep enough, fast enough or is it compassionate. 
Liberals have not come clean with the Canadian public. They are 
trying to retain their popularity and are playing games with 
numbers.
<P>
	The budget is merely acceptable compared to what we have 
seen in the past. It does not stop the digging fast enough. As 
Alberta treasurer Jim Dinning said the other day about the 
budget, it is like getting excited over a student that always 
comes home with Fs on his report card and one day brings home 
a C minus.
<P>
	Will we consider the budget as our soft targets? Number one, 
soft targets. The Liberals are headed in the right direction. They 
have to make some cuts. They have addressed some cuts, but 
they have not made enough cuts.
<P>
	No balanced budget is in sight. That is the target they have to 
set but will not set. This is why the leader of the Reform Party is 
going to be the next Prime Minister of Canada. Canadians are 
going to recognize that is where we should be and that is what 
will be in the best interest of saving the country.
<P>
	The Canada social transfer that the government sneaked in is 
another example of sophistry. It is going to confuse the 
provinces. The Bloc Quebecois, rightly so, is screaming loudly 
and justifiably about how it will affect Quebec. The Liberals 
cannot answer. They will not answer.
<P>
	The fourth problem is that the fiscal House is just not in order. 
The combined spending cuts in the budget and revenue increases 
will amount to $29 billion over the next two years. That sounds 
great. However, at the end of their term overall spending will 
have increased even higher than where they started. After four 
years of Liberal government overall spending will be up by 
about one-half billion to one billion dollars. Despite the cuts, it 
is not a balanced budget. Despite the cuts, the debt will grow. 
Despite the cuts we will be no further ahead as a nation. All that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10244"> 10244 </A></B>
<P>
pain just to pay the interest on the debt. Why can the Liberals not 
get it through their heads that we have to get to a zero deficit?
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	I propose that Parliament reject the budget for its failure to 
eliminate the deficit quickly and decisively within the life of 
this Parliament by asking further generations to bear the cost of 
our fiscal responsibilities.
<P>
	I propose that the finance minister reintroduce a new budget 
in the fall that reflects Reform's suggestions to balance the 
budget over a three-year period.
<P>
	We are continuing the cycle of treading water. Eventually our 
arms are going to get tired. We are going to sink, sink as fast as 
the <I>Titanic</I> when we hit the wall. Hit the wall we will if we do not 
eliminate the deficit. No country can allow its debt to continue 
to grow as we are in Canada and expect to survive.
<P>
	That is why we presented our taxpayers' budget, a budget that 
gives Canadians real hope. It gives the Liberal government a 
plan to adopt. It shows them the vision Liberals lack.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Have you been at a golf club?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I have a problem with the comment about the tan I 
have. My wife was rushed off to hospital in sunny California. It 
was an emergency. That is why I have a tan. I do not appreciate it 
when members keep referring to that when I am trying to give a 
serious address on the budget. If they just make jokes about the 
tan, that is fine. But once they know what it is about I would 
appreciate a little more respect.
<P>
	Our taxpayers' budget gives Canadians hope. It shows them a 
vision and defines a real problem, that of the debt and the 
interest costs to service that debt. It offers a solution of how to 
get to a zero deficit so that we can manage the country's 
finances. We have to get our fiscal house in order so we can start 
looking at the debt and at ways and means of reducing it. Our 
children and our grandchildren should not have to continue to 
carry this heavy, heavy load.
<P>
	I repeat one more time. Our taxpayer's budget gives the 
Liberal government an opportunity to adopt that approach, to 
get to zero within the life of its term. Because if it does not, we 
will get elected and we will do it.
<P>
	The debt and the rising interest costs to service that debt is the 
problem. I have tried to point it out. I have offered solutions. 
Our party has pointed it out. Our party has offered solutions. 
Despite all the wisecracks from the finance minister, despite all 
the rhetoric about how the Reform Party this and the Reform 
Party that, the Liberals are taking some of our agenda. Why not 
take all of it? Stop the digging.

	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to 
speak on second reading of Bill C-73, the borrowing authority 
bill.
<P>
	Before I speak directly to the provisions of the bill, I would 
like to put this legislation in its proper context. The amount of 
borrowing authority requested in the bill is directly connected to 
the financial requirements set out in the budget. The information 
required to deal with the financial aspects of the bill is set out in 
the budget.
<P>
	It is very important that this bill be passed as quickly as 
possible. If borrowing authority is not in place early in the new 
fiscal year, there will be severe constraints placed on the 
government's financing program. All remaining borrowing 
authority granted by the Borrowing Authority Act, 1994-95, 
will be cancelled at the end of this fiscal year except for a $3 
billion non-lapsing amount.
<P>
	Once this amount is depleted, the government would be 
limited to using section 47 of the Financial Administration Act 
which restricts borrowing to short-term funds.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	In such a situation, no bonds could be issued except to fund 
maturing issues, of which there are two in the first quarter of 
1995-96. Any delay in the passage of this important bill beyond 
the end of the current fiscal year, therefore, could be costly to 
the government and to Canadian taxpayers, and would expose 
the government to the additional interest rate risk implied by 
increased short-term funding.
<P>
	Given the government's large financing program, delaying 
bond financing will also be potentially disruptive of the capital 
markets which could result in higher debt servicing charges. 
Therefore, it is critical that borrowing authority be secured as 
soon as possible.
<P>
	The budget has been a topic of much discussion both in this 
House and elsewhere this week. And well it should be. As has 
been pointed out by my colleague the Minister of Finance, the 
budget he presented last Monday is an ``historic response'' to an 
``historic challenge''.
<P>
	The challenge is brought very much to our attention as we 
debate this bill. This country's economic future is put at risk by 
the $500 billion debt we have accumulated-a $500 billion debt 
that leaves us all too vulnerable to the harsh impact of interest 
rates.
<P>
	And yes, we recognize that this legislation seeks to borrow 
even more money, adding to that debt. But in asking hon. 
members to support this legislation, I draw their attention to the 
fundamental reform of government spending set out in the 
budget and the commitment of this government to meet its 
deficit targets.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10245"> 10245 </A></B>
<P>
	The ultimate goal of this government is a balanced budget. 
There should be no doubt that we will achieve it.
<P>
	But we are not going to achieve this goal through the magic of 
long range projections as was attempted in the past. Nor will we 
achieve our goals by projecting overly optimistic increases in 
economic growth and cheerful interest rate forecasts.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our approach has paid off in success in not just meeting the 
targets for 1994-95 but in fact doing better. Last year in our first 
budget we projected a deficit of $39.7 billion. We now estimate 
that the deficit will come in at about $37.9 billion, some $1.8 
billion under target.
<P>
	The underlying deficit, that is without the one time charges 
incurred in restructuring government, is $4.4 billion below 
target. Revenues of $1.2 billion are above the conservative 
estimates in program spending, a full $3 billion under our 
projections.
<P>
	These positive effects on the deficit were only partly offset by 
the $1 billion in higher than expected interest rates, so the $2.4 
billion contingency fund did not have to be touched.
<P>
	I would like to go directly to some of the aspects of this 
legislation because in my short time I want to make sure that my 
colleagues understand exactly what the nature of this borrowing 
bill is.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	With the measures we are taking in the budget announced on 
Monday there is no question we will achieve the target of $32.7 
billion in the upcoming fiscal year and $24.3 billion or 3 per cent 
of GDP in 1996-97.
<P>
	We are backing up our very prudent economic assumptions 
with a substantial contingency reserve, which next year will be 
$2.5 billion and the following year will be $3 billion. Looking 
ahead, our contingency reserve will do more than just protect 
our target. If it is not needed it will not be spent. It will go toward 
reducing the deficit even further.
<P>
	This underscores one of the basic strengths of our planning 
assumptions. If interest rates and growth do better than our 
forecast-and remember that we have taken a very conservative 
forecast-and if we simply compare it to the private sector 
average, in 1996-97 the deficit could drop below $19 billion. 
That is $5.5 billion less than what was projected in the budget.
<P>
	By that time our financial requirements, the new money we 
borrow from markets, will fall to $13.7 billion, a drop of more 
than $11 billion from the amount asked for in Bill C-73. That is 
substantial progress of which every Canadian should be proud. 
It will be just 1.7 per cent of GDP, down from 3.5 per cent of 
GDP in 1994-95 and a full 5 per cent in 1992-93. Based on the 
national budgets for 1996-97, Canada is projected to do better 
than the United States, Germany, Japan and every other major 
industrial nation.
<P>
	The details of Bill C-73 contain three basic elements: 
authority to cover financial requirements for 1995-96, 
exchange fund account profits, and a non-lapsing amount. In 
total we are requesting authority to borrow $28.9 billion for the 
1995-96 fiscal year.
<P>
	First, there is a provision for $24.9 billion of authority to 
cover anticipated borrowing requirements to meet the net 
financial requirements set out in the budget.
<P>
	Second, there is a provision to cover $1 billion of exchange 
fund account earnings, which gives rise to additional Canadian 
dollar borrowing requirements. These earnings, although 
reported as budgetary revenues, are retained in the exchange 
fund account. They are not available to finance ongoing 
operations of the government.
<P>
	Third, there is the usual $3 billion non-lapsing amount, the 
same amount requested in borrowing authority in the past seven 
years. The non-lapsing amount can either be used during the 
course of the year to manage contingencies such as unexpected 
foreign exchange requirements or it can be carried forward to 
the next fiscal year.
<P>
	There are some minor technical provisions in the bill that 
more clearly link fiscal year borrowing authority with fiscal 
year borrowing requirements. One provision provides that in 
1995-96 the borrowing authority may only be used after the new 
fiscal year begins. Another provision stipulates that for the 
purpose of calculating borrowing authority usage the effective 
date is April 1.
<P>
	Until the bill is passed the government may continue to use 
the $3 billion non-lapsing amount provided for in last year's 
Borrowing Authority Act. Any portion of the non-lapsing 
amount that is used will be deducted from the basic amount of 
borrowing authority being sought today. This prevents the 
non-lapsing amount from effectively adding to the borrowing 
authority next year. Also the bill will cancel all borrowing 
authority remaining from fiscal 1994-95 once it is passed.
<P>
	As background information I would like to review the 
government's debt operation for the current fiscal year up to the 
end of January. So far this fiscal year in the domestic debt 
program the government has issued about $21.4 billion in 
marketable bonds, $1.5 billion in Canada savings bonds, and 
$1.4 billion in real return bonds. There are also net redemptions 
of $7.8 billion of treasury bills. This provides a total of $16.5 
billion in net new market debt.
<P>
	I also report to the House on last fall's Canada savings bond 
campaign. The government introduced two innovations aimed at 
revitalizing the Canada savings bond program. First, a new 
three-year price feature was introduced, aimed at making CSBs 
more attractive to retail investors. Second, the government 
expanded the sales window making CSBs available over a 
longer period of time. They were priced competitively with 
other products in the market, cost effective relative to other 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10246"> 10246 </A></B>
<P>
sources of financing and produced sales of $7.5 billion or  a 40 
per cent increase over 1993. After accounting for redemptions 
during the year, the net increase in outstanding Canada savings 
bonds was $1.5 billion, as I indicated earlier.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Regarding foreign currency debt, outstanding Canada bills 
increased by U.S. $2.2 billion to $6.3 billion at the end of 
January. These are short term U.S. dollar denominated bills 
issued from time to time in the U.S. market to fund Canada's 
foreign exchange reserve.
<P>
	In July 1994 the government launched a $2 billion five-year 
Euro bond issue. The issue was used to increase reserves and 
diversify the sources of U.S. dollar funding of Canada's 
exchange reserve.
<P>
	In summary, the bill is straightforward and contains no 
unusual provisions. All the information needed to deal with it is 
before the House in the budget, the main estimates and related 
documents.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I therefore urge the House to proceed with this legislation as 
quickly as possible so that new borrowing authority will be in 
place at the beginning of the new fiscal year and the 
government's regular borrowing program can proceed as the 
fiscal year begins.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Borrowing authority is a normal part of the operations of 
government. I urge all members of the House to support the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to ask a question of the member for Winnipeg North 
Centre.
<P>
	When talking about the budget elements in his speech he used 
words like would, could and should. Those are not good enough 
in these time. He also pointed out that his government was on 
track to meet its deficit target of $25 billion at the end of two 
more years. It is my contention and our contention that this will 
add to the problem. Our proposal for a deficit target is zero, not 
$25 billion. We believe that solves the problem. It does not add 
to it.
<P>
	Would the member explain why a deficit target of $25 billion 
is better than a deficit target of zero?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question and for his speech. I was listening carefully to him. I 
know he is concerned about these issues. He brings a real 
passion to seeing our debt reduced.
<P>
	I assure him that every member on the government side is 
equally committed to balancing the budget and to making sure 
that future generations of Canadians are not saddled with the 
debt as we currently are.
<P>
	The major difference between the government and the third 
party is the quickness related to actually delivering the savings 
needed to produce a balanced budget.
<P>
	If the hon. member reviews his speech, I caution him not to 
deal with the total expenditures but to look at the amount of 
money spent on programs. From the beginning of the 
government we have been in the process of reducing it from 
$120 billion to $108 billion. That is significant progress.
<P>
	We would like to be optimistic and say that the economy will 
continue to perform as it did last year at 4.5 per cent growth, but 
we know that in the past many governments have disappointed 
Canadians by making high growth and revenue projections and 
in the end have come back to Canadians with increased debt. We 
refuse to do that.
<P>
	We also know that politicians are politicians. If we set 
objectives far down the line and say that in five or six years we 
will have a balanced budget, and a crisis comes up such as the 
Mexican peso crisis in January, people say not to worry about it 
too much because we can adjust further down the line. We can 
hold their collective feet to the fire and say our objective this 
year is <I>x</I> billions of dollars in debt and we are going to reach it. 
We are not going to compensate in two or three years; we are 
going to look after it right now.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister have been 
very effective in bringing a discipline to the government. 
Through the actions we are taking, we are setting an example for 
many other governments across the country. At the turn of the 
century we will see ourselves in a very fine position, one we can 
all be proud of.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the member from the third party who previously spoke gave a 
speech of almost catharsis.
<P>
	I was hoping the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Finance could comment on the very important issue of revenue. 
The member from the third party had characterized the 
government's budget as being overly optimistic on the revenue 
side.
<P>
	My recollection of the straw budget put together by the third 
party was that its revenue projections were $16 billion. They 
would reduce the deficit down to $25 billion, which is where the 
government is going. Basically that means all cuts the 
government is proposing would theoretically be on top of the 
third party's budget.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10247"> 10247 </A></B>
<P>
	Could the parliamentary secretary clarify the situation with 
regard to the allegation that the revenue projections are overly 
optimistic?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> If anything the revenue projections are very 
prudent. We are very cautious about 1996. The American 
economy has been growing very rapidly with increased interest 
rates. We are concerned that our export markets may be 
dampened somewhat because of a slowdown in the American 
economy. I know American economists and observers are very 
nervous about whether interest rates have gone up too high in the 
United States.
<P>
	Since so much of our revenue on the corporate side is based on 
our export industries, to say nothing of the jobs in markets such 
as the automobile industry and so on, if we do not make prudent 
projections on the revenue side we will be caught with increased 
costs in UI and reduced corporate profits and will find ourselves 
without the revenue.
<P>
	Therefore, as I said in response to an earlier question, the last 
thing we want to do collectively as parliamentarians-in this 
respect the whole House should be in agreement-is set up a 
situation where we disappoint Canadians again. I would much 
rather be in a position of surprising them with good news than 
coming back again with a budget that has to be redrawn based on 
faulty optimistic projections.
<P>
	The Department of Finance, through the minister's 
instructions, has been very cautious in the way it has drawn up 
the projections. We have insisted that the more optimistic 
projections in the private sector be scaled down. We have been 
very cautious in the way we have set out the amount of money 
available to us in two years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have a comment and a question for the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of Finance. They are both related to the 
referendum campaign in Quebec. Is it possible that the real 
federal budget will be tabled in 1996, after the referendum?
<P>
	The government's budget increased by $3 billion, in spite of 
cuts of $5 billion to programs. Moreover, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development intends to cut some $15 billion, over a 
five-year period, in social programs, a measure which has yet to 
be approved by this House. Again, the federal cuts in transfers to 
the provinces will result in higher provincial deficits.
<P>
	The provinces will have no choice but to transfer their 
responsibilities to the municipalities without providing them 
with the necessary financial support. Consequently, ordinary 
Canadians will once again have to foot the bill.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	Whether it is with the left or the right hand, low and middle 
income taxpayers end up having to pay. In the context of 
privatization, the federal government eliminated all subsidies to 
regional airports and ports or harbours. This has a major impact 
on every region in  Quebec, whether the local economy is based 
on services, tourism or industrial activities.
<P>
	I have a simple question for the parliamentary secretary. Is he 
prepared to admit in this House that the real budget will be 
tabled after the referendum campaign in Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Madam Speaker, the Minister of Finance tabled 
our budget for this year. There will not be another budget after 
the referendum. The message sent to the provinces is very clear. 
Many changes will occur, but we did inform provincial finance 
ministers, including the Quebec finance minister, of our 
strategy. We have an agreement with the provinces to postpone 
changes until next year-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
-to provide an opportunity for governments across this country 
to change and to adjust. The federal government is losing 45,000 
employees. It is with a great deal of sadness that we are making 
these changes and changing many of the programs. By 
definition, as we change programs it affects every single 
province equally. There is no doubt about that.
<P>
	We expect that as the provinces go about their work they will 
have to make individual decisions as to the best way to improve 
the situations in their own province. It is not for me to guess 
whether it would include changes in programs, cutbacks or 
whatever. We will have to wait for provincial ministers of 
finance with their respective cabinets to make their own 
decisions and explain it to their individual populations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, in the member's answer to his 
own colleague about the operating budget of the government, he 
asked that we not look at the interest costs but just look at the 
operating budget and how the cuts are there.
<P>
	I acknowledge the cuts in government operations. They are 
lower. There are some cuts there. However, the member is not 
recognizing that the interest cost to service the debt is going up 
faster or as fast as the cuts that are being made. That is why I will 
repeat the objective is to get to a zero deficit, not to one of $25 
billion.
<P>
	In the member's household budget, whether he has a mortgage 
now or if he ever had a mortgage, are the interest costs to service 
the mortgage on his home not a part of his expenses? Does he 
have a budget which includes his income and his expenses for 
food and clothing, but the expenses for shelter do not count? 
Does he keep that aside saying that he can borrow money 
indefinitely on that? No. A business cannot do it either. The debt 
servicing costs of a corporation are also included in its costs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10248"> 10248 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member should put the interest costs and the 
operating costs to government together as one. Do not make the 
same mistakes previous finance ministers have made. Separate 
the two and try to offer sophistic arguments. Get to the bottom of 
the overall spending and lower the overall spending so that we 
get to zero. Does that not make sense?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Madam Speaker, the member makes a lot of 
sense. If the member had included it in his original speech then 
my comments would not have come forward that way. I will say 
again that it is incumbent upon all of us to make sure the 
Canadian public understands that progress is being made on 
restructuring government.
<P>
	We are as chagrined as the next person about the high cost 
each Canadian faces with the debt. When I stand in the House to 
ask permission to borrow $28.9 billion, it is not done with a lot 
of glee. This is a tremendous burden we are adding. We 
understand that.
<P>
	Last year I believe we asked for $32.3 billion. It shows that we 
are making progress. Our demands on the international markets 
are becoming less each year. In this view, we are making real 
progress without causing widespread grief and harm.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	I do not know if members have had a chance to look at the 
newspaper today, but looking at the public opinion polls, 
Canadians have been willing to accept a tough budget. We 
presented a tough budget and their reaction is very supportive.
<P>
	The opposition parties should understand and appreciate the 
willingness of Canadians to participate in such an exercise, 
including the tax issues and so forth. I am very proud with the 
way the government is in sync with the Canadian population.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
you may have guessed that I am particularly interested in the 
budget's impact on agriculture.
<P>
	However, I would like to start by commenting briefly on the 
underhanded way the provinces are being treated, the lack of job 
creation measures, unfair tax measures and the inequity of 
certain cuts. If I were to give my impression of the budget 
brought down by the Minister of Finance in a single sentence, I 
would call it next year's budget.
<P>
	As usual, the budget we were supposed to set this year has 
apparently been postponed until next year, in other words, until 
after the referendum.
<P>
	This budget is like a time bomb, and it will be a couple of 
years before we feel its full impact. Take, for instance, transfer 
payments to the provinces. In the budget brought down on 
Monday, transfers for health care, education and social 
assistance will be cut by $2.5 billion in 1996-97 and $4.5 billion 
in 1997-98. This is a cut of 40 per cent over three years.
<P>
	This measure will very likely destabilize provincial budgets 
and force the provinces to make drastic cuts or even shift part of 
the burden to the municipalities, as Quebec Liberal Minister 
Claude Ryan did so neatly in 1992.
<P>
	And on top of that, there is the obligation to meet so-called 
national standards. Once again, the provinces are sitting under a 
federal sword of Damocles.
<P>
	In the last federal election, the Liberal government was 
elected on its promise to create jobs. However, after barely a 
year and a half in power, that same Liberal government decided 
to ignore its promise to create jobs. There is nothing in 
Monday's budget to create employment. Nothing but layoffs, as 
many as 45,000. There is nothing for 800,000 unemployed 
workers who are looking for work in Quebec. Nothing. The only 
program that has created some employment and so-called 
temporary jobs, the infrastructure program, will lose $200 
million from its initial budget announced last year.
<P>
	This is a three-way program, so that in the end, not $200 
million but $600 million will be cut.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	This budget is unfair because it maintains the preferential 
treatment of family trusts for another five years, which will give 
the parties concerned plenty of time to find other ways to evade 
taxes, and believe me, they will. It is unfair because it comes 
down relatively hard, but on the wrong people. In the short term, 
the public will feel the impact of tax hikes on tobacco and 
gasoline.
<P>
	Furthermore, the Unemployment Insurance Program will be 
cut by 10 per cent. The government is going to take money from 
the unemployed to pay off our debt. This is obscene!
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Meanwhile, the government has 
no plans for real tax reform. It will raise the corporate tax rate by 
12.5 per cent or 1/8, but I used to teach math, and 1/8 of what is 
not much in any case barely adds up. So what it really means for 
the big corporations is that there will be an increase from 0.2 to 
0.225 per cent of corporate capital in excess of $10 million. Let 
me tell you that a lot of people in my riding would be delighted 
to have that rate applied to their personal income tax.
<P>
	That being said, as the official opposition critic for 
agriculture and being a farmer myself, I was particularly 
surprised and, in fact, appalled at the inequity of the budgetary 
measures concerning agriculture. Last week, the Minister of 
Agriculture said to anyone who would listen that his government 
would treat all Canada's regions on the same footing, and he said 
quite seriously that no agricultural sectors would be more equal 
than 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10249"> 10249 </A></B>
<P>
others. Now we must face the fact that the government is saying 
one thing but doing another.
<P>
	In this budget, the finance minister cuts the agriculture 
department's budget by 19 per cent, or one fifth. During a time 
of cutbacks, it is accepted that everyone has to do his share, but 
what really hurts is the way the cuts are distributed. It is one 
thing for agriculture to be hard hit, but quite another if it is 
unfairly affected. The injustice from one region to the next is 
simply absurd.
<P>
	In short, to make up for eliminating the Crow's Nest rate for 
Western grain transportation, the government will give grain 
growers $2.9 billion. But dairy producers in Quebec will see 
their federal subsidies cut by 30 per cent over two years. That 
amounts to a $32 million cut without any compensation 
whatsoever.
<P>
	The message is clear but unacceptable: the deficit is being 
tackled on the backs of Quebec and Ontario dairy producers. It 
can even be said that if the target price for milk were increased 
because of these cuts, the increase would be borne by consumers 
and processing industries. It is tantamount to a consumption tax.
<P>
	Certain cuts are inevitable, I must agree. The agriculture 
minister was telling me last week that so much had been said 
about the Crow's Nest rate over the last 25 years. Even in the 
opinion of farmers and people involved in grain transportation 
and processing, there were serious shortcomings in the Western 
grain transportation system, such as the detour to Thunder Bay 
to be eligible for the subsidy.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	For ages people have seen the waste and inefficiency in grain 
transportation. And the saga has continued since the Liberal 
Party sitting opposite us took office. They have consulted, gone 
around in circles, did some fancy footwork in the House and 
tried to arrive at a consensus with the people in the community. 
Nothing has worked.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance finally decided to discontinue the 
transportation subsidy under the WGTA. To compensate 
Western grain producers for this loss, the finance minister 
announced a number of interim measures. For example, owners 
of agricultural land, in the Prairies only of course, will receive a 
single, non-taxable lump sum payment of $1.6 billion.
<P>
	Add to this the $300 million, 5 year program to help producers 
adapt to the WGTA. On top of this, export credit guarantees 
totalling one billion dollars are being offered to help producers 
sell their grain and other foodstuffs. The sum of these three 
programs is $2.9 billion. The federal government will invest 
close to $3 billion to compensate grain producers in the three 
western provinces.
<P>
	And just listen to how clear and praiseworthy the agriculture 
minister's goals are. First, to cut costs; second-listen up all of 
you producers in Quebec-to encourage farmers in the West to 
diversify; third, to encourage them to get involved in 
value-added activities. In contrast, dairy producers miss out. 
The Minister of Finance decided to reduce the subsidies for 
industrial milk producers by 30 per cent. How terrible.
<P>
	For all intents and purposes, Quebec accounts for close to 50 
per cent of Canada's industrial milk production, so do not kid 
yourselves or try to tell me that Quebec producers will not be 
harder hit than those elsewhere. In this case, the federal 
government is not offering any compensation. In Quebec alone, 
this cut will mean close to $32 million in losses. The Minister of 
Finance was off target when he reduced dairy subsidies by 30 per 
cent over the next two years.
<P>
	The more than 12,000 industrial milk producers in Quebec 
will see a 15 per cent drop in their current subsidy of $1.50 per 
kilogram of milk fat in 1995 and another 15 per cent drop in 
1996. For a farmer who produces 10,000 kilograms of fat, which 
is the average production in Quebec, that will translate into an 
income loss of $2,250 this year and of almost the same amount 
next year. That is over $4,000 in losses.
<P>
	The government will compensate these farmers by reviewing 
the future of subsidies in collaboration with the provinces and 
the industry. It is all well and good to talk about it, but that is not 
going to put bread and butter on the table. Contrary to the cuts in 
the West, the dairy sector cuts will not be implemented in 
tandem with any transitional measures. Talk about a double 
standard.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	If we examine this question more closely, we realize that, over 
the long term, this measure is even more disastrous for dairy 
producers than it appears. With the new international figures, all 
sectors are going to have to adjust. In the case of sectors with 
quotas, like dairy production, these changes are practically 
already in effect. This coming July, quotas will be replaced by 
tariffs.
<P>
	I would like to digress a moment on the subject of tariffs. You 
no doubt know that the United States decided it wanted to test 
the tariffs adopted last year, in December 1993 that is, by the 120 
members of the WTO at the Uruguay round of the GATT talks. 
Today, they are being contested. I am really looking forward to 
seeing how vigorously the government will protest, just how far 
it will go to defend the tariff structure for dairy products, eggs 
and poultry.
<P>
	The tariffs themselves will gradually disappear. Instead of 
anticipating costs and investing to provide support for dairy 
producers wanting to develop new niches in the market or 
become more competitive in order to face the music once tariff 
barriers relax, what do they do? They cut, they cut and they cut 
some more.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10250"> 10250 </A></B>
<P>
	A dairy producer friend of mine, whom I will identify, I am 
sure it would please him,-Laurent Saint-Laurent-told me, 
when he acquired his parents' farm in 1971, that subsidies 
represented 25 per cent of his income. Today, they represent 
barely 6 per cent.
<P>
	However, in the West, farmers are being compensated for the 
loss of subsidies by being allowed to diversify their economy so 
they can then compete with agriculture in Eastern Canada, 
which receives absolutely no financial assistance from the 
federal government.
<P>
	They are exaggerating by cutting a number of subsidies. 
Western producers wanting to get into beef or pork or wanting to 
compete with dairy producers will therefore be able to do so 
with federal money. If this is what fair treatment for everyone 
means, I would hate to see what unfair treatment means in this 
country.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Lies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Yes, lies, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	Other budget measures will also have a strong impact, for 
example the 30 per cent cut in the social safety net for farmers. 
The Minister of Finance opposite should listen more closely, as 
he is the one who will cut $250 million over three years. That, 
too, is a three-part program. If the federal government 
contributes 70 cents, will the $1.00 paid by the farmer and the 
province be increased to $1.15? I am asking the question.
<P>
	I am also concerned about the closing of two of the seven 
research facilities in Canada. In Quebec, two facilities will be 
closed, one in La Pocatière and one in L'Assomption. That is 
terrible.
<P>
	Of the $164 billion in this year's budget, $50 billion will be 
used only to pay interest costs. Let me give you an example of 
mismanagement.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	On April 1, 1997, after investing more than $7 million in La 
Pocatière in less than 10 years, Agriculture Canada will close 
the experimental farm in La Pocatière, the oldest one in Quebec, 
which opened in 1910. They are closing it now after investing $7 
million. Where is this government's vision?
<P>
	In closing, I urge Quebec farmers, whether they are dairy, 
beef or pork producers, farrow or finish operators, to open their 
eyes and look at the Liberal government opposite that is treating 
them so unfairly and inequitably.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rarely heard such grandstanding. The hon. 
member opposite would have us believe that we are not cutting 
deep enough and cutting too much at the same time, that we are 
cutting in the wrong places, and so on. Yet, the vast majority of 
the population told us again yesterday in a poll that the 
government's budget was just right, like just about everything 
else this government does.
<P>
	The hon. member told us that the budget was next year's 
budget, suggesting that we did not cut deep enough this year. He 
then said that we cut too much this year, right after he accused us 
of postponing the cuts until next year instead of cutting this year.
<P>
	He says that the government does not create jobs. Yet, 
432,000 jobs have been created since the beginning of last year. 
According to the news we heard this morning, where was the 
highest rate of economic growth among all G-7 countries? As 
you may have guessed, Madam Speaker, right here in Canada. 
That says a lot about the comments made by the hon. member 
opposite.
<P>
	As this is a question and comment period, I would ask the hon. 
member-I must say that I disagree with his comments and that 
I do not want to use unparliamentary language-if he knew what 
he was talking about when he alleged that Quebec dairy 
producers were being treated unfairly compared with Western 
grain farmers?
<P>
	Does he know that Western grain farmers will lose 100 per 
cent of their subsidies, which represent a large part of their 
income, while dairy producers-1,000 of whom live in my 
riding-will lose 15 per cent of their subsidies, which account 
for 9 per cent of their income? Fifteen per cent of 9 per cent, all 
of which can be recovered under the production cost formula 
within the Canadian dairy plan. Does he know this already? And 
if he does, why did he say the things he just said, when he knows 
better?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my 
colleague opposite, the Liberal Party whip and hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, for his question.
<P>
	It is true that he has many farmers in his riding. However, I 
read yesterday in a newspaper that one of his constituents, 
Réjean Pommainville of the FAO in the riding of Russell, said: 
``The withdrawal of the dairy subsidy represents 6 per cent of 
farm income for Ontario dairy producers''. He went on to say: 
``We can assess at $4,500-'' It is one of your constituents and 
not someone from Frontenac.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, but you must 
address the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, Réjean 
Pommainville is not from Saint-Laurent-Cartierville but from 
Russell, in the hon. member's riding. He said: ``We can assess at 
$4,500 the loss per dairy farm in Ontario''.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	How much will the dairy producers in his riding receive as 
compensation? Nothing! How much will Western producers 
receive? An amount of $2.9 billion. That is unfair. Since 
forty-seven per cent of industrial milk is produced in Quebec, 
Quebecers will be hit hardest by this budget. Dairy producers 
know it and I hope that they will understand some day.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10251"> 10251 </A></B>
<P>
	In August 1995, when the Canadian Dairy Commission is 
asked by producers to approve an increase in the price of milk, 
it will probably agree and pass on to all Canadians the increase 
that you did not have the courage to impose. It will be a 
consumption tax on butter, cheese, yogurt and ice cream.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Frontenac for his 
praise of a close personal friend of mine, Réjean Pommainville.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> A former friend of yours.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I do not think the hon. member opposite is in 
any position to decide who my friends are. Mr. Pommainville 
can decide for himself. He is a distinguished member of the 
community in Limoges. His father, Armand Pommainville, who 
is now in his 80s, was one of the presidents of the Russell County 
Liberal Association. I take this opportunity to thank him for his 
great work for the Liberal Party.
<P>
	The hon. member opposite always failed to admit what all 
Canadians know is true and he should know as well: we have a 
production cost formula for price adjustment. Also, he failed to 
respond to the following: why did he claim that dairy producers 
were in a situation similar to that of grain producers and that 
dairy producers were being dealt with unfairly when this is not 
the case?
<P>
	We know full well that there is a production cost formula in 
place, and that there is no comparison with Western grain 
producers, who are loosing 100 per cent of their subsidies, 
which is a much higher percentage. Finally, does the hon. 
member not know that corn producers in his region for example, 
as well as many other grain producers in Eastern Canada, were 
not all that crazy about the Crow's Nest agreement?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, there is no 
question in what the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell just said. The name of his riding 
is so long, it reads like a newspaper. My point is that the Western 
Grain Transportation Act has been in force for 98 years. It has 
always cost billions of dollars to operate. Yes, Transport Canada 
did reduce the amounts involved gradually, from year to year.
<P>
	If you look at the books, you will see a sum of $560 million 
mentioned in there. Did you know that grain was stored in 
hopper cars, shipped to Thunder Bay and then back to 
Vancouver? This system was administered by our governments, 
and the Liberals have been in power almost all the time since 
1960. The Liberals just watched hopper cars travel back and 
forth at taxpayers' expense. Let us pay.
<P>
	Now, they want to save $560 million in the future, while 
paying out nearly $3 billion. This is a disgrace.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	How much is there for Quebec farm and dairy producers in 
there? Nothing, as usual; in fact, they have to make further 
sacrifices. Madam Speaker, our colleague, Mr. Landry, would 
have a question, if you would recognize him.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Only 40 seconds 
remain. The hon. member for Lotbinière.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Thank you, Madam 
Speaker. I listened to what my hon. colleague said and I wonder 
if he could tell me how he would have divided up this $2,9 
billion from coast to coast. Would he have divided it fairly? I 
would like him to elaborate on this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Madam Speaker, you are right, I 
have very little time to answer a question that would require a 
good 15 minutes. At any rate, I can tell you that, as far as several 
of my constituents are concerned, and many Quebec voters, 
including farm producers, this budget is totally unfair and is an 
example of mismanagement.
<P>
	Let me remind you again, Madam Speaker, that the oldest 
research station, in La Pocatière, was closed after $7 million 
was sunk into it. It had not even been inaugurated yet.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I wish to advise the Chair that I will be sharing 
my time with the member for Prince Albert-Churchill River.
<P>
	It gives me great pleasure to rise today in support of this 
legislation and with it, to provide support for the budget 
presented to Canadians on February 27. I congratulate the 
Minister of Finance. His was not an easy task. He has worked in 
bringing together this country's varied interests and has 
delivered a budget that deserves the support of every single 
Canadian and every single member in this House.
<P>
	The premier of Ontario has called it the most reactionary 
budget the country has seen in his lifetime. We had a choice. We 
could whine or we could take action. This budget is not 
reactionary but it does react to the concerns expressed by my 
constituents, the people of Guelph-Wellington. The Minister 
of Finance and the government have heard their concerns 
regarding tax fairness, government spending and deficit 
reduction.
<P>
	The people of Guelph-Wellington made it clear to me they 
wanted action from this federal budget. They wanted a clear 
indication that we were to keep our promise to reduce the deficit 
to 3 per cent of the GDP. They wanted their money better spent. 
They wanted a reduction in federal expenditures. They wanted 
most of all tax fairness.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10252"> 10252 </A></B>
<P>
	Last December 1 I rose in this House and reminded hon. 
members that my constituents believed the only way to show 
the world that Canada was committed to real deficit reduction 
was to prove our commitment to fiscal discipline. On February 
27 the government presented its budget to Canadians and the 
world. The reaction has been very positive.
<P>
	Each generation has few opportunities, if any, to 
fundamentally change and better its public institutions. The 
people of Guelph-Wellington have asked me to offer them a 
better way of delivering public services.
<P>
	In the last election they rejected politics as usual and they 
rejected parties that offered only a negative view of their 
country. My children and the children of every one of my 
constituents have asked me to come to this place and restore 
opportunity for them and for their children. This budget gives 
them that opportunity and challenges all of us to create a new 
and better Canada.
<P>
	On the surface, Guelph-Wellington has fared well in this 
budget. We do not have a large population of civil servants, nor 
do we rely on a military base. My constituents welcome the 
news that there are no increases in personal taxes.
<P>
	A recent editorial in the Guelph <I>Tribune</I> described my 
community as populated by those ordinary Canadians who are 
fed up with high taxes, anxious to keep their social fabric and 
critical of government waste and spending. For my constituents' 
sake, the measures before us here today and the entire budget 
must be approved as soon as possible so that we can continue to 
improve their lives and the lives of all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	The people of Guelph-Wellington are anxious about the 
future. They are not wasteful in their spending. They support the 
government in its efforts to not only reduce spending but to 
spend more wisely and more efficiently. As the Minister of 
Finance said in his budget speech, they do not judge on the 
rhetoric of political parties. They judge on results.
<P>
	While Guelph-Wellington may have fared better than some 
Canadian regions, my constituents know the budget calls on 
them to share the burden. They know that when the Minister of 
Finance completed his speech, the country changed. They know 
that with this change they were challenged.
<P>
	The challenge they accepted is to expect less from 
government and to rely on resources other than government, and 
to work with government to redefine itself in order to make this 
country stronger than it has ever been. My constituents are 
aware that this new challenge will mean more sacrifice, and 
sacrifice necessary to ensure fairness, economic growth and job 
creation.
<P>
	They have asked me to spend their money on programs that 
build and assist. Guelph-Wellington is a proud community. 
Strong and independent, it is a community whose people want 
what is right.
<P>
	Throughout our history we have supported government that 
works. We have rejected the notion government should be the 
answer to everything that is wrong. They know government can 
create problems as well as solve them.
<P>
	They want their federal government to serve them, to act on 
their behalf and to concentrate on doing what it does well. They 
want action and renewal, and they want us to act now.
<P>
	In the last 15 months I have heard from constituents whose 
comments were addressed in this budget. They asked me to cut 
spending. Spending will be cut by $29 billion in the next three 
years and we have initiated the lowest program spending in 
relation to the economy since 1951. They wanted no taxes on 
RRSPs and group health and dental plans and we have for the 
second year in a row introduced no increases to personal taxes.
<P>
	They wanted tax fairness and were concerned about bank 
profits, family trusts and tax evasion. We have delivered, 
ensuring that every region and every Canadian will pay their fair 
share and contribute to ensure that we will succeed.
<P>
	Most of all, they wanted the deficit reduced. They were tired 
of governments offering unrealistic goals and giving targets that 
could never ever be reached.
<P>
	During the election I met cynicism and skepticism at the door. 
Guelph-Wellington people were tired. They were fed up with 
representation that did not deliver and governments that could 
not and would not face up to the challenge.
<P>
	This budget is for them. It offers them targets that can be met. 
It gives them goals that can be reached. It provides realistic 
strategies that can be measured. For the first time in years, they 
know government is serious about what it says and that it does 
what it promises.
<P>
	Faced with the other option of irresponsible slashing and 
uncaring principles, the people of Guelph-Wellington said yes 
to the Liberal Party and they say yes to this budget.
<P>
	It is not often that members of Parliament can debate a change 
so profound that future generations will look at them and thank 
them for making history and giving them a better country. We 
have this opportunity. We have the choice of criticising, of 
making desperate statements which support desperate policies, 
or we can rise above the negative and reach for the new and bold 
horizon.
<P>
	My constituents demand nothing less of me. They demand 
nothing less of this government. This is not an easy budget to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10253"> 10253 </A></B>
<P>
accept. Change is never easy. The measures announced on 
February 27 will be hard on Canadians.
<P>
	The Guelph <I>Mercury</I> stated in an editorial following the 
budget, and I quote for the Reform Party: ``The finance minister 
did not say it would be a painless budget. He said it would be a 
tough budget. And make no mistake, a tough budget is what he 
has delivered. Tough, but alas, necessary''.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	As difficult as these measures are, we can only imagine what 
failure to act would mean for us, our children and our 
grandchildren in the years to come.
<P>
	What we do in the next few months will be judged not by us 
but by the people we serve and by the generations that follow. 
We must act and these actions will mean hardship, adjustment 
and pain, meted out with compassion. This is the Liberal way of 
doing business.
<P>
	Our country, like the community of Guelph-Wellington, can 
survive. The people of Guelph-Wellington demand no less. It 
is for their sake that this bill and this budget are worthy of 
support. It can be done and it must be done. The best country in 
the world deserves no less.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate the member for Guelph-Wellington 
on her speech and ask her a question.
<P>
	The question relates to the interest costs to service the debt 
which the Reform Party believes to be the major problem facing 
the country, with the deficit a contributing factor. Last year's 
interest costs are going to be in excess of $40 billion. At the end 
of two years interest costs are going to rise to over $50 billion.
<P>
	How does the member for Guelph-Wellington propose to 
face her constituents and tell them that she will solve the rising 
interest cost problem by cutting program spending equal to the 
rise in interest costs? How she will resolve those two sides of the 
equation that have nothing to do with compassion but have a lot 
to do with responsible government?
<P>
	It is totally irresponsible to face your constituents, telling 
them the deficit is the only problem and by lowering the deficit 
the problem will be solved. How she will reconcile the rise in 
interest costs from $40 billion today to $51 billion tomorrow? 
All the sacrifices to come eventually in her riding will have to be 
to just service the debt.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Madam Speaker, I will face my 
constituents very well. Already in my riding the budget is being 
received well and the hon. member across the way knows it is.
<P>
	This has been a desperate attempt on the part of the Reform 
Party to try in some way to discredit a good budget. The budget 
will begin a process of honest reduction in all phases, at levels 
which our constituents have asked for. I am sure the hon. 
member's constituents have also asked for this.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member how he will face his constituents 
when they ask him why he would not support a budget that 
would support reductions in costs and reduce the deficit.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, my colleague's constituents may be receiving this 
budget very well, but the people I represent in the riding of 
Matapédia-Matane are not.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance told us in his speech, and he quoted 
his father, that it is necessary to plan ahead with courage and 
determination. I think that the Minister of Finance showed great 
courage and determination in looking to the least well off 
members of our society for money, and much timidity and 
hesitation in his treatment of the wealthy.
<P>
	Very often, the members opposite accuse us of being negative. 
My honourable colleague, I am going to ask you a question and 
make a suggestion. I would like you to respond, positively I 
hope, to this suggestion. I will read you a few lines: ``The 
Minister of Finance has deliberately avoided mentioning in this 
budget the large aquarium that is home to 104 elderly members 
of the same contented species, whose somnambulistic 
performance costs the government more than $42 million 
annually, not to mention the $349 million their former 
colleagues, also non-elected, draw in pensions''.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Nevertheless, starting next year the government will quite 
happily go after the elderly. How is it that this budget does not 
touch the senators, who are costing us, who are costing the 
public, $42 million, not to mention their retired colleagues, who 
are costing a fortune?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Madam Speaker, as I indicated in my 
speech, the budget touched everyone. The hon. member knows 
that.
<P>
	It is important to understand that we all share a pain and a 
burden. It is important that we all shoulder it together. It will 
make for a better country, as my comrade across the way said. It 
will make for a better country and a united Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Prince Albert-Churchill River, 
Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am deeply honoured to speak to Bill 
C-73, a bill to provide borrowing authority for the fiscal year 
beginning April 1, 1995. It will allow for the borrowing of funds 
by the finance minister, on approval of cabinet, to finance a 
shrinking annual deficit for the coming fiscal year.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10254"> 10254 </A></B>
<P>
	I begin by extending my sincere congratulations to the 
Minister of Finance for a budget which has won the confidence 
of not only the international markets but also, and more 
importantly, of all Canadians. The budget displays a firm 
commitment to Canadian values by promoting jobs and growth 
and by protecting the most vulnerable Canadians by looking to 
government first for action. The deficit is primarily being dealt 
with through spending cuts in a 7:1 ratio over the next three 
years. This means spending cuts will amount to $7 for every 
$1 in revenue increase.
<P>
	The budget, with its emphasis on fairness, has looked to 
spending cuts rather than personal income taxes to achieve its 
goals. We heard the Canadians who told us not to raise income 
tax and we have not. The budget is fair. The budget closes 
loopholes and tax breaks for the rich. It focuses on those who are 
able to contribute more and asks them to do so, like the banks. 
We all must contribute. It does not increase taxes for the middle 
class.
<P>
	The budget is fair to all regions of the country. The Minister of 
Finance has taken great care to ensure that cutbacks to the 
different regions are distributed fairly and equitably. Our fiscal 
problem is a national one. All regions need to contribute to the 
diminution of our fiscal problem. We must work together.
<P>
	Aspects of the budget such as the Canada social transfer will 
enhance the flexibility of the federal system by allowing 
provinces to determine to a greater degree how best they can 
meet their specific needs while retaining a role for the national 
government.
<P>
	I must commend the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
for working very hard on behalf of Canada's farmers through a 
very difficult budgetary process. We all recognize that every 
Canadian must share in the reduction of the deficit. Canadian 
farmers are not excluded from this effort. They have shown a 
willingness to participate before, they have shown resilience 
before, and I am certain they realize the necessity of the changes 
before us.
<P>
	Spending has been reduced. However, farmers have always 
said that given good opportunities they would prefer not to be 
subsidized. Farmers are ready to adapt and succeed and they will 
again. These changes outlined in the budget affecting grain 
transport, income support and stabilization, trade, marketing, 
research, adaptation and rural development will reduce the cost 
to government but they will also improve efficiency and 
competitiveness to encourage economic diversification, value 
added production and processing. This will give farmers the 
opportunities they have always wanted.
<P>
	In Saskatchewan the transportation subsidy known as the 
Crow rate provided cheap transportation of raw agricultural 
products but it also created an economy of dependence and 
inefficiency and in some cases was detrimental to the 
environment.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	We needed to change the way we think about subsidies and 
transportation, not least because of the realities of the World 
Trade Organization which limits trade distorting subsidies. 
Farmers need to take a leading role in adhering to the principles 
of the World Trade Organization. I know that European and 
American subsidies will also decline. It is my view that Canada 
has much more to gain than lose when dealing on a level playing 
field because Canadian farmers have the highest quality 
products and are already the most efficient in the world.
<P>
	Our priorities are cost efficiency and effectiveness in 
growing, moving and selling grain. Farmers will benefit from 
this and they will become more and more able to determine their 
own financially secure futures. Their reduced reliance on 
subsidies means that governments will be able to focus in an 
efficient and effective way on the things that government does 
best, providing assistance for people to adjust to the changing 
times and providing information on new markets and new 
production opportunities.
<P>
	We will not leave the farmers to adjust to this change alone. 
They will receive a one time payment of $1.6 billion to assist 
them in the transition.
<P>
	Our fiscal realities must be addressed. The government has 
faced these challenges fairly and in every area. Reduced 
spending is the golden opportunity for economic growth. 
Reduced spending helps to be more acutely aware of local 
economic opportunities and less enamoured with regulation and 
control where it is not necessary.
<P>
	Let me share two examples from my riding of Prince 
Albert-Churchill River where relaxation of government 
regulations will allow and promote economic growth and jobs.
<P>
	First, at the federal level the Freshwater Fish Marketing 
Corporation has a monopoly at present over the marketing and 
processing of freshwater fish. In the past this served the 
fishermen well, but it has outlived its usefulness. The 
government must break inefficient monopolies like this one. In 
doing so a local fish processing plant within the riding will bring 
jobs and growth to the area and give greater support to northern 
fishermen with better prices for raw product.
<P>
	Second, at the provincial level SaskPower has a monopoly 
over the generation of electrical energy in Saskatchewan. If this 
monopoly is allowed to be opened up in a sensible way, local 
initiatives could react more quickly and efficiently, and provide 
electrical energy at reduced rates. Weyerhauser Canada would 
be able to build an electrical co-generation plan which would 
make it more competitive while maintaining exacting 
environmental standards and enhancing environmental 
protection.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10255"> 10255 </A></B>
<P>
	This may open the door for the further expansion of 
Weyerhauser's pulp and paper production capacity. The 
possibilities for economic spin-offs are great. These initiatives 
mean jobs, they mean growth and they mean a prosperous 
Prince Albert-Churchill River.
<P>
	We must strike a healthy balance for the role of government in 
economic development. We must facilitate growth and allow for 
local initiatives to flourish. We must provide the context for a 
dynamic and innovative economy, unimpeded by the dinosaurs 
that have monopolized the economy in the past.
<P>
	Governments cannot afford to be economic and social 
dictators any more. They can afford to be enablers of growth, 
enablers of individual community, provincial and national 
creativity, economically and socially from coast to coast.
<P>
	Too much government money has created in us the belief that 
government can fix everything. It cannot. It has created 
economic and social dependency. The budget and this bill have 
set Canada on a course where people will be free to succeed. 
They will be free to build that sense of community, of caring and 
sharing that has been eroded by the misplaced belief that 
government can and must do everything. Governments will now 
be free to be true partners with one another and the people, a 
partnership that will result in economic growth and an even 
greater feeling of compassion and community.
<P>
	Yes, we are all responsible one for the other. Because we 
borrow less money, because we use less money, we shall be free 
to prosper together and to help one another.
<P>
	Once again, my sincere congratulations to the finance 
minister who has done a great job with a great budget.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have two questions for the member for Prince 
Albert-Churchill River.
<P>
	The first one is with regard to agriculture. During the election 
campaign I heard this member and many of his colleagues from 
Saskatchewan defending agricultural programs, saying they 
were going to defend the farmers, that these things would not 
change, that the funds would keep coming.
<P>
	By what reasoning can he defend his government's actions of 
drastically reducing the funds farmers receive? We came clearly 
up front during the election and said that we would take these 
funds and there would be a reduction. However, those funds 
would go into an account that would help prepare the farmer and 
protect him from subsidies by other foreign nations. Now the 
farmer is left with nothing. How can the member possibly 
reconcile this new radically different position from what they 
said during the election?
<P>
	The second question is with regard to the MP pension plan. I 
am wondering how this member can justify borrowing money to 
pay himself and his colleagues a huge pension.
<P>
	Why is it important to opt out of the MP pension plan, a very 
extravagant plan? It is important that we set the example. We 
can always find excuses about why we deserve more and how we 
ought to have more. If we realize as parliamentarians what a 
mess this country is in, I am wondering if we do not have to start 
by setting the example.
<P>
	I was recently asked a question after this was announced of 
whether the MP pension plan will hurt me personally. Of course 
it will. If I opt out, it is as if I had the winning ticket in a lottery 
and never went to pick up my million dollars. Of course it will 
hurt. I will always know and live with that fact, that I could have 
gone back to my constituents and justified the fact that I 
deserved that money. However, I think there is a time when 
principles count for something. We are opting out to signal to 
Canadians how serious our problems are. I am wondering how 
this hon. member can justify borrowing more money to pay MPs 
an extravagant pension.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member opposite 
indicates that he listened to me and my hon. colleagues say 
something different than what is happening now in relation to 
agricultural subsidies. It is quite obvious that he was not paying 
close attention to what was happening in Prince 
Albert-Churchill River if that is what he thinks.
<P>
	It has always been my position that while we do need 
agricultural support programs, we need them at such a level 
where they are adequate and predictable, where they are not 
changing week after week as has been happening in 
Saskatchewan over the last number of years, where everybody is 
going to know what the rules are.
<P>
	Specifically with respect to the Crow benefit, it was indicated 
during the election that what would happen with the Crow 
benefit was subject to what happened at the GATT negotiations 
which occurred after the election. This was clearly stated to the 
public, to the farmers. The GATT negotiations necessitate 
change and we are doing the change, which is exactly what we 
said during the election campaign.
<P>
	With respect to the hon. member's talk about MPs' pensions, 
when members of the Reform Party opposite table in this House 
a letter from the Alberta government saying that one of its 
members no longer accepts a big pension while he is sitting here 
as a member of this House earning a salary, when the hon. 
Reform Party also sets forth a letter from national defence and 
the RCMP saying that members who are retired from those areas 
are not getting those federal pensions, then perhaps we can talk 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10256"> 10256 </A></B>
<P>
about the views of the federal pension plans. There is a great 
deal of hypocrisy within the Reform Party on the issue of 
pensions.
<P>
	This government said exactly what it would do in the red book 
with respect to MP pensions and has gone even further than it 
said in the red book. This government lives up to our 
commitments. We lived up to them before. We will live up to 
them in the future. The judgment has been made by the 
international monetary markets and all Canadians as to the 
success of our budgetary endeavours.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I will be dividing my time with other Reformers.
<P>
	I really become frustrated every day as I sit in the House. 
Every time Reformers rise to speak on behalf of average 
Canadians we are met with laughter, jeers, derisive comments 
from the Liberal Party. I began to wonder why we are mocked 
and ridiculed when we have the courage to be up front and 
honest with Canadians.
<P>
	I did not come here to be on a power trip. I came here to solve 
the problems. The biggest problems we face are the national 
debt, the annual deficits and rising interest costs.
<P>
	I have four teenage children who will pay over half of their 
income in taxes for the rest of their lives for the mistakes made 
by the Liberal Party during the past 25 years. Through my work 
in this House I hope and pray that my grandchildren will be able 
to see their taxes go down.
<P>
	I hear the Liberals already saying it is not their fault, that the 
Tories were in power for nine years. That is a very lame excuse 
because not once in those nine years while the Liberals were the 
official opposition did they tell the Conservatives to get their 
spending under control, balance the budget and put a cap on 
increasing interest payments.
<P>
	The Liberals protested every cut and they wailed for more 
government spending on social programs that do not work. The 
Liberals are responsible for the fiscal mess this country is in and 
even now while they are in power they are unwilling to face the 
painful truth.
<P>
	During the 1993 election Reformers told the truth about the 
state of the country's finances and our zero in three plan. The 
Liberals put out a red ink book which played politics and 
ignored the truth.
<P>
	In the taxpayers' budget we introduced last week Reformers 
told the truth. This week the Liberals introduced a budget which 
once again ignores the truth and plays politics. Because this 
government keeps putting off the inevitable it is slowly 
destroying the country.
<P>
	The Liberals keep cutting back on programs and services, 
increasing taxes. Because they do not cut enough to balance the 
budget interest costs keep going up and the federal government 
keeps going deeper into debt.
<P>
	Reformers have proposed two plans to get off this deficit and 
debt treadmill and the Liberals ignore the truth when it is as 
plain as the numbers in the budget in front of them.
<P>
	This deficit is like a cancerous tumour, eating away at our 
flesh. It is making us sick and preventing us from living a 
healthy life. The most compassionate operation one could do is a 
surgical removal of this deficit tumour. Instead the Liberals 
operate very year just cutting out a little, letting the cancerous 
deficit tumour keep growing. As it grows it eats up more and 
more of pensions, welfare, health care and the programs run by 
the government. It does not take a rocket surgeon to figure out 
that the most compassionate thing one can do is undergo the pain 
of removing the tumourous deficit as quickly as possible.
<P>
	Bill C-73 is a disgrace. This bill is a confession of failure by 
this government and past governments. This bill clearly 
demonstrates how firmly entrenched annual deficits have 
become to feed the federal government's overspending 
addiction. This bill provides the evidence that governments past 
and present have been unable and unwilling to live within their 
means.
<P>
	While many Canadians will think we are debating the budget 
today, I would like to clarify that we are debating a bill which 
shows the failure of all previous governments during each of the 
last 20 years to balance their budgets.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	Each year we debate a bill like this one to give the federal 
government the authority to borrow the billions and billions of 
dollars which it says it needs to make life better. Canadian 
taxpayers are waiting to elect a government that will tell them 
the year when there will be no need for the government to 
introduce a bill giving it authority to borrow money.
<P>
	This bill asks Parliament to give the government authority to 
borrow $28,900,000,000. I think it would be very interesting for 
Canadians to know something about the process. It has become 
so commonplace, so routine for the government to borrow 
billions of dollars each year, year after year, that it even has a 
permanent standing order in the House of Commons which 
limits debate on this bill to two sitting days during second 
reading. Not only does the government want Parliament to give 
it authority to borrow billions of dollars every year, it also does 
not want to give opposition parties or even taxpayers enough 
time to properly debate questions or propose alternatives for the 
government to consider.
<P>
	The Liberal party says it needs money, fast; do not take too 
long about it either. Two days of debate is lots. How many 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10257"> 10257 </A></B>
<P>
questions can we ask about borrowing $28.9 billion anyway? No 
amount of debate, no amount of intelligent questions, no amount 
of committee meetings,  votes, amendments or motions to 
reduce the government's estimates is going to change one thing 
anyway, so why bother? Why bother debating it?
<P>
	Liberals think that debating the budget or this borrowing bill 
is a complete waste of time. They think this because they know 
that when all is said and done, when the debates, when the 
questions, when the analysis are over they will not have changed 
this budget one cent. All this talk that we do in here every day 
has absolutely no influence on what is decided in those back 
rooms.
<P>
	This budget is a disgrace because it spends too much, it cuts 
too little and it gives no hope to Canadian taxpayers that the 
Liberal government will ever be able to produce a balanced 
budget. This budget is a disgrace but this budget process is an 
even bigger disgrace. The process is a disgrace because it goes 
against common sense and against democratic principles.
<P>
	Why can 295 members of Parliament not enter into an 
intelligent debate? If the majority agrees that there are more or 
better ways to save taxpayers' money, why would the 
government not agree to implement the recommendations? Why 
is the most important piece of legislation which the government 
brings down every year set in stone? Why will the Liberal 
government not allow Canadians to have input through their 
democratically elected representatives at this most critical point 
in the budget process? Does it honestly believe that this budget 
is the best there can possibly be? Does it honestly believe that 
every dollar outlined in the estimates is essential?
<P>
	New ideas are developed every day, but this government says 
that it cannot change the budget. It needs to borrow $28.9 billion 
and nothing we can say or do will ever change its mind. Is that 
any way to run a country?
<P>
	Any changes which we as Reformers suggested are scoffed at, 
even in committee. Not one change took place from all the 
changes I suggested. Some of the changes were small and none 
of them took place in that committee, which handles more 
money than any other committee.
<P>
	If a Reform government were in power today it would have 
the budget balanced by 1998 and the Government of Canada 
would no longer need a borrowing bill. If a Reform government 
were in power borrowing bills would not be a routine occurrence 
year after year. A borrowing bill under a Reform government 
would be a rarity. Under a Reform government a borrowing bill 
would be such a rarity that taxpayers would want to know what 
fiscal or natural emergency brought about the occurrence. They 
would be asking their members of Parliament to rise to ask the 
government what had happened. It would be a national news 
story. What we are doing here today will not get any press. I 
would be surprised if it did.
<P>
	There are two extremes in this debate. On the one hand the 
Liberals want to limit debate on borrowing $28.9 billion to two 
days during second reading in an attempt to circumvent the 
democratic process.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	On the other hand, the Reform Party is proposing to 
implement a taxpayers protection act that would limit the ability 
of majority governments to run spending deficits, raise taxes 
and borrow money. Our taxpayers protection act would force 
governments to balance their spending and taxes over the course 
of each business cycle. It would put a cap on government 
spending and taxation. Eventually our taxpayers protection act 
would be entrenched in the Constitution to prevent future 
governments from changing it.
<P>
	In closing I point out the major failing in the government's 
budget: the government is actually transferring more to banks in 
interest payments than it spends on social programs.
<P>
	In this fiscal year the government will spend $49.5 billion on 
interest payments and $49.2 billion on social programs, which 
include old age security and pensions, health transfers, 
education transfers, welfare programs, and equalization 
payments to the provinces.
<P>
	In 1996-97 the Liberals project that interest payments will be 
over $50 billion a year. Not only do the Liberals have to cut more 
spending to balance the budget, but every dollar that Liberals 
spend in interest payments is a dollar they cannot spend on 
social programs.
<P>
	This is a failure. The bill is a disgrace. The process is 
undemocratic. I am frustrated with the House of Commons and 
what goes on here. We need to be taken more seriously.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I thank the member for Yorkton-Melville for his input. Many 
of us on this side listen to what they have to say. I know 
whenever there were good ideas that previous governments sort 
of gobbled them up and used them as theirs.
<P>
	I will make a couple of comments and then I will ask a 
question. One comment I hear a lot in the House from Reformers 
is about the red ink book. I am the member for Bruce-Grey and 
I want to tell them that the word redd means cleaning up a mess 
and getting the house in order. That is exactly what the 
government is doing.
<P>
	In the sixties we had problems with a fuel crisis. There were 
mechanics who fixed old fashioned cars with carburettors. 
However, modern cars from perhaps 1993 onward are distinctly 
different; they do not have carburettors. When drivers put their 
foot to the floor in cars with carburettors, a certain volume of air 
came in through the carburettor, mixed with the fuel, and the 
fuel was dumped out the exhaust.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10258"> 10258 </A></B>
<P>
	Modern cars have from one to four computers. When drivers 
switch on modern cars the computers react to the temperature 
outside. If it is zero degrees they know exactly what kind of 
fuel is needed. There is no RPM from the RPM gauge. There 
is no air flow through the manifold pressure sensing devices. 
The computer plugs in the value. The car starts and goes into 
what is called an open loop. In that open loop the computer 
triggers. The oxygen sensing device senses the fuel coming out 
of the carburettor. It knows that maybe it is too rich and sends 
a message back to the computer. The RPM works and so on and 
so forth.
<P>
	I am using this analogy because the government is like the 
modern devices on cars. We have people with the talent and 
ability, such as the finance minister, the Prime Minister, 
members of the cabinet and members of the government 
including the rump over there, to adjust to new conditions.
<P>
	In the case of a brand new car, if drivers want to pass they put 
their foot to the floor. The air conditioning system and 
everything that is not necessary are shut down. That is the first 
thing that happens.
<P>
	The government found itself in the position where there was 
debt that had been incurred over two decades at which time no 
government had the political will to do what we are doing. We 
are chopping $29 billion over the next three years. We have 
contingency funds. We have gold reserves. We have dollars to 
back up situations when the interest rates rise to make sure that 
we can look after that particular eventuality.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	In addition, we are not like members opposite who open the 
hood of a new car and shut it because they do not know how to 
fix it. They come back with old-fashioned ideas, looking for the 
carburettor that is not there or looking for some other device that 
is not there. That is their problem. If they have great ideas to 
suggest to the House, I assure them we will accept them.
<P>
	What would the Reform Party do to repatriate our foreign 
debt?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Madam Speaker, that 
is an interesting question. I listened to the preamble and the 
question had nothing to do with what he was telling me. There 
was absolutely no relation. It is the typical Liberal approach to a 
problem.
<P>
	We have a huge government problem. The Liberals tinker 
with it a bit, make a few minor cuts and tell everybody how great 
it is that they are making these cuts. They do not look at the 
overall picture.
<P>
	I like his example of cars with carburettors. The government 
is choking off the economy. If they put in too much gas, if they 
borrow too much money and have a government that is too big, 
they choke off the economy. That is what the government is 
doing. The government really does not have much of an idea 
about how the economy works.
<P>
	I also like his analogy of using the colour red, because very 
often it means bleeding, bleeding, bleeding the taxpayer to 
death.
<P>
	In conclusion I say again that the process is undemocratic. 
When I go home I am overwhelmed and humbled by the support 
I get. It is dishonest of the government to make fun of us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is a real pleasure to stand in the House today to address the 
request of the government to borrow $28.9 billion, something 
that has become an extremely bad habit that the government 
must soon break before it breaks the country.
<P>
	It is very important to put that $28.9 billion in perspective. As 
people in the House know, but perhaps the public is not aware of 
it, we have a debt today of $551 billion. It is one of the highest 
debt to GDP ratios in the world. We have huge problems with 
respect to the amount of overspending we have done over the 
last 22 years. I would point out that over that period of time 
mostly Liberal governments have been in place.
<P>
	It is even more discouraging that the government has set a 
goal for itself: to spend another $100 billion more than it takes 
in during the four years before its mandate is up. We will have a 
debt of over $600 billion before its mandate is up. I find it 
shocking. I find it alarming. However, the government has put 
that into its plans. It says that somehow it is a good thing and the 
rational way to proceed. I reject that.
<P>
	Let us talk about what happens to an economy when a 
government continues to overspend day after day and year after 
year. I invite hon. members across the way to look at what has 
happened to the unemployment rate and compare it to the rise of 
the debt and the deficit. They move in parallel courses, both 
rising upward very sharply. I find that quite alarming.
<P>
	I invite members across the way to note that tax levels have 
rocketed upward with the debt and the deficit. That impedes the 
ability of the economy to produce jobs. By the way, I point out to 
my friends across the way that governments do not produce jobs. 
Business does. When they take credit for 450,000 new jobs 
being created, it is an insult to the business people who work 
everyday to make a living, to make a profit to support their 
families.
<P>
	A country is a lot like a river. There is a tremendous amount of 
power in a river when it shoots down a river valley. It can 
produce a lot of good when there is a water wheel or a turbine in 
that river; as the river goes rushing by it produces a lot of energy. 
There is a tremendous amount of good out of that.
<P>
	Governments are a lot like dams. The good governments are 
very small dams. Mostly they allow the river to keep flowing, to 
push forward to the sea, its ultimate goal. The bad governments 
are the very big dams. Those big dams are constructed when 
governments continue to overspend and overregulate. They 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10259"> 10259 </A></B>
<P>
build the  dam up bigger and bigger. Pretty soon the river quits 
flowing and the economy as a parallel stops.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	We now have a huge dam on the river. We have a lot of water 
sitting dormant. I equate that to all the potential productivity in 
the country that is not fulfilled because it has to sit there. Then 
there is the water that evaporates from the dam. I would equate 
that to all the people who have left the country. I am talking 
about people with high skill levels and lots of capital who can go 
to other jurisdictions. Many of them have. We see doctors 
fleeing across the border. We see businesses running across the 
border. I admit the NDP government in Ontario has not been a 
big help; it has contributed to the problem.
<P>
	We also see a lot of the water ending up in a backwater in 
sloughs. I equate that to people stuck on social programs who 
see no hope coming forward because the government has created 
safety nets that are more like fishing nets. People get caught in 
them and are unable to escape.
<P>
	Unfortunately the human resources development minister has 
failed completely to come up with a new way to provide social 
security for people while at the same time not remove incentives 
to work.
<P>
	The final thing that happens with a big dam is that eventually 
trickles of water start to undermine the dam or go around it 
because they flow up over the riverbank. I would equate that to 
the people who have joined the underground economy and are 
continuing to pursue their dreams in spite of the government and 
not because of it. More and more of that is going on all the time.
<P>
	The last subject I want to talk about is my children and 
everybody's children. I phone home at night and talk with my 
youngest little boy who is six years old. I hear his little voice on 
the other end of the telephone line. I find it very exciting. I sit 
and talk with that little twerp for a few minutes about how his 
day was and what kind of aspirations he has. I talk with my 
10-year-old about the same sorts of things. I find that very 
uplifting. At the same time I find it very sad.
<P>
	Like everybody in this place and like Canadians everywhere 
who have hopes and dreams for their children, grandchildren, 
nieces and nephews, I get discouraged and angry when I hear 
that the government is planning to load another $100 billion on 
to the backs of those children. Government members laugh 
about it. They sit there and laugh about it like they are doing 
right now. That makes me fighting mad.
<P>
	I am telling members across the way that if they continue to 
do this they will have to bear it on their consciences. It is a big 
joke to them. They sit and laugh about it. However, Canadians 
do not laugh about it. They will pay a huge price the next 
election when they have to explain how they can justify adding 
$100 billion to the debt, driving people out of the country, 
driving jobs out of the country and destroying the social safety 
net.
<P>
	When will they have the guts to do the right thing: start 
cutting, get the economy back on track and get a handle on the 
debt and deficit? I can hardly wait for them to stand and 
challenge me on questions and comments because I have some 
questions of my own.
<P>
	Government members sit there blithely joking about the fact 
they will borrow another $28.9 billion. I hope they can explain it 
next week to their constituents who have children like I do and 
like most of the people in this place and are wondering how in 
the world they can pay back those bills after 22 years of 
overspending.
<P>
	I appreciate the chance to talk to government members about 
this matter. I truly hope they get the message not only from me 
but from taxpayers across the country who are fed up with 22 
years of overspending.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the hon. member's speech. 
Maybe he has not had a chance to read the newspapers today. In 
Ontario there has been a 78 per cent acceptance of the budget as 
it was presented. The lowest percentage of support in Canada 
was in Quebec and that was at 55 per cent. All the other 
provinces fell in between those two figures. What we have 
presented to Canadian taxpayers is a fair but lean budget, which 
is exactly what they called for. That is what my constituents 
called for.
<P>
	I would like to challenge the hon. member because I have had 
a chance to read the budget which his party presented. What I 
read was something similar to the doctor saying to the family 
outside of the operating room that the operation was a success 
but unfortunately the patient died. The Reform party is talking 
about cutting $15 billion from social security. I would like to 
know from the hon. member where he would cut that $15 billion 
from something that is the fabric of this nation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Madam Speaker, I reject very much the hon. 
member's premise which is that the social safety net is somehow 
the fabric of this nation, as though people in this country cannot 
somehow create their own tremendous culture by virtue of their 
own dreams and aspirations and in what they contribute to the 
country.
<P>
	Having said that, I would be happy to answer the hon. 
member's question. He has asked where we would cut and we 
laid it out explicitly, unlike the government. During the election 
campaign government members said not to worry about social 
programs, they were not going to touch them. A year later, of 
course, they did a tremendous flip-flop. The hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce announced that the government has 
flip-flopped on its red book promises. There is still $20 billion 
that the government will have to cut to get its deficit to zero, at 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10260"> 10260 </A></B>
<P>
least $20 billion by its own projections, and it has not laid out 
how it expects to get there.
<P>
	Is the government telling people everything? Is it really not 
going to cut any more social programs, like it says, or is it going 
to get to zero like it tells people? It cannot be both ways.
<P>
	We have been very up front with people. We said we would cut 
$15 billion. We would cut $3 billion out of old age security. It 
will go from $20 billion to $17 billion. We would make big cuts 
to transfers for welfare. We have said that. We are not 
embarrassed at all to say that. We know that we have to do that so 
that ultimately we will not allow social programs to completely 
unravel. We have to make those cuts.
<P>
	I would like to emphasize again that for the hon. member to 
say somehow Canada is a social safety net is ridiculous. People 
who work every day for a living look at that. People who 
contribute to the economy and make great contributions to the 
culture of this nation look at that and say if that is the best we can 
do to become a country, produce some bloated government 
bureaucracy to come up with a bunch of social programs, that is 
not a country at all. That is a social welfare state. The hon. 
member across the way does not understand the country at all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with interest to my friend's version of the new trickle 
down theory. He elaborated so much that it became a river flow 
for a while.
<P>
	It has always intrigued me how the Reform party-and I say 
this with all respect because I believe it is serious when it makes 
these proposals-believes that somehow if we reward the rich 
and the wealthy the benefits will eventually trickle down to 
regular folks. I want to say to my friends in the Reform party that 
Canadians are fed up with being trickled on. For years and years 
there has been this trickle down approach, first from the Tories 
and now from the Liberals with the encouragement from my 
friends in the Reform party.
<P>
	I listened carefully to my hon. friend's presentation today. 
The impression he leaves is the country with the least amount of 
government is the best country. By that definition countries such 
as Africa would be booming in terms of their economies and 
things would be great.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	The fundamental reason we are the number one place out of 
192 countries in the world in which to live and raise a family is 
government programs of all sorts.
<P>
	What country in the world would he hold up as a model of his 
approach; in other words, an example of less government, fewer 
social programs?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order. While the 
member for Medicine Hat was on debate he was referring to his 
relationship with his children and the hon. member for 
London-Middlesex was hurling comments across the floor 
directed at the hon. member's children.
<P>
	I find that absolutely reprehensible.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I do not believe that is a 
point of order. The hon. member for Medicine Hat, very briefly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Madam Speaker, in response to the member for 
Kamloops, I guess the country I would hold up is the country 
that Canada used to be. There was a time when people were 
counted on to rely on their own resources to a great extent to find 
their way in the world. They did that most admirably and it 
enabled us to build a social welfare state that would protect the 
people who could not look after-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Resuming debate, the 
hon. Minister of Public Works and Government Services.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a real 
opportunity for me to participate in this debate and to share with 
my colleagues on all sides of the House the activities that my 
departments and agencies will be doing over the next 12 months 
and for the next three years.
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity to congratulate my colleague, 
the Minister of Finance, who tabled the budget here on Monday 
of this week, which addressed a number of fundamental 
problems that the Canadian government has been faced with not 
only for the last year and half but for the last nine or ten years.
<P>
	I want to congratulate my colleague, the Minister of Finance, 
on facts which are indisputable. For instance, over the last year 
there have been 433,000 jobs created in this country. The 
unemployment rate has fallen by 1.7 per cent. I think all 
members will recognize that although that is encouraging it is 
certainly not enough. However, it is a positive indicator.
<P>
	Exports are at a record breaking level, something Canadians 
ought to be proud of. As we export our products it means 
additional investment for Canadians and thereby jobs for 
Canadians whether they are in New Brunswick or in other parts 
of Canada, including Ontario and western Canada.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10261"> 10261 </A></B>
<P>
	Inflation is the lowest in three decades, another factor that 
ought to be taken into consideration. Canada had the best 
economic growth of any major industrialized country in 1994. 
Canada is set to have the best job creation record and the best 
economic growth record of the G-7 countries in 1995.
<P>
	If that is not an indication of support for the Minister of 
Finance and the plan that he put before Parliament in 1994, as he 
did here on Monday evening, I do not know what further 
affirmation one could get to say that we have the full confidence 
in the Minister of Finance and the plans he has laid before the 
people of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	I think many members would recognize that I do not like to be 
partisan in debate, and therefore I will select a quote from a 
newspaper today which I believe stated that 78 per cent of the 
people in Ontario, the largest province in this country, supported 
unequivocally the budget of the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	This budget, as I have said both privately and publicly, is a 
tough budget because it affects the lives of a lot of Canadians. In 
my own departments and agencies there are some substantial 
reductions. I offer to the House, as I believe I did on a previous 
occasion, that there would be substantial cutbacks in Public 
Works and Government Services Canada. Over a three-year 
period my department will contribute toward reducing the 
deficit in that particular department in excess of $350 million. 
There are 5,263 employees who will be dislocated as a result of 
this federal budget. Those who have the audacity to suggest that 
kind of measure is not a tough measure are missing the point.
<P>
	I realize I only have a few moments but I want to share with 
the House a couple of important features of the budget, 
particularly in my Department of Public Works and Government 
Services. Canada Mortgage and Housing is reducing its 
expenditures in order to contribute toward the deficit. The 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency over a three-year period 
will reduce its expenditures by $173 million with person years 
being displaced.
<P>
	The Royal Canadian Mint will try to contribute to increasing 
the revenues for the Government of Canada by the introduction 
of the $2 coin and by reducing the composition of the different 
coins, thereby providing additional revenues.
<P>
	I know members wish-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My hon. colleague, we are all waiting with 
baited breath for you to continue your words and of course when 
we return after Question Period you will be recognized first off.
<P>
	It being two o'clock, we will now proceed to Statements by 
Members.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, not 
only does the Minister of Finance's budget target the poor once 
again, it offers nothing to stimulate employment. The minister 
himself implicitly recognizes that fact, since he predicts no 
improvement regarding the unemployment rate, which currently 
stands at 9.7 per cent for Canada and 12 per cent for Quebec.
<P>
	Not only does the budget include no job creation initiatives, it 
delays the infrastructure program, the only measure announced 
in the previous budget to stimulate employment. The 
infrastructure program, which was initially designed as an 
emergency measure to stimulate employment following the 
recession, will now be spread over five years.
<P>
	One cannot help but wonder if the minister lives on a different 
planet. Is he not aware that, to get back to the pre-recession 
employment level, close to 800,000 jobs must be created in 
Canada? It is time for the minister to get to work on that.

stop refugee claimants at the border, and cost savings, if any, 
will go to overseas selection of refugees. That is amazing.
<P>
	In our paper on refugee determination, we called for only one 
person to hear claims. We called for denying the hearings to 
those who had travelled through the U.S. We called for inland 
cost savings to go overseas. I am glad this minister read our 
paper. If he really wanted to reform the process then he would 
stand up to special interests, scrap the IRB and restore some real 
common sense and accountability to the system.
<P>
	Today's announcement will not make the system more 
accountable. It does not guarantee that the world's highest 
refugee acceptance rate will go anywhere but up. It does not do 
what needs to be done. That is altogether typical of the 
immigration minister: lots of talk but no real reform.

wine making. This weekend from March 3 to 5 wine makers and 
wine lovers from across the province will come to Niagara for 
the special celebration of Ontario wines.
<P>
	The excellent reputation of Ontario wines continues to spread 
around the world. Ontario wines have received many 
international awards. Our own colleague, Gary Pillitteri, won a 
silver medal for Riesling best buy at the World Wine 
Championship in Chicago.

	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
one of the most distressing responses that came out pursuant to 
our budget was the intellectual dishonesty which emanated from 
the premier of Ontario and his finance minister. Their answer to 
the budget was to inform the citizens of Ontario that it will result 
in fewer health benefits and fewer hospital beds, even though 
Mr. Laughren admits the hit means a meagre 2 per cent cut in 
provincial spending.
<P>
	I was dismayed to hear this, but not surprised. It reveals the 
NDP mentality whose knee-jerk reaction is to punish the people 
of Ontario for electing a federal Liberal government, a 
government which has a post-budget approval rate of 63 per 
cent, an all-time high.
<P>
	This does not have to be. We are giving the provinces the 
power to develop and apply solutions to their regional problems 
as they see fit. If they are not content with the amount of dollars 
given, let them tighten their belts as we are doing ours. However 
Premier Rae wants to tighten other people's belts. He would 
prefer to cut down on hospital beds but gives no thought to 
cutting his own government's waste and especially so-

hockey game. On this occasion the MPs won back the Challenge 
trophy which they had lost to the pages in 1993. Some Reform 
members suggested this was due to the fact that there were no 
longer any Conservatives with the team.
<P>
	The game was notable in that this was a rare occasion when 
Liberals and Reformers co-operated in a winning effort. I must 
say it was also notable for the good spirit between the pages and 
the members.

	The pages are to be congratulated for their great effort and for 
their accomplishments at gender balance. Several women 
played for the pages while none played for the MPs, although 
invited to do so.

<P>
	How can the mayor of Hull, Yves Ducharme, seriously claim 
that the loss of 14,000 jobs in the Outaouais, as announced in

the Commission sur l'avenir du Québec that independence 
would be catastrophic because it would result in job losses in the 
public service? How ironic!

	The chairman of the Outaouais urban community, Marc 
Croteau, went even further by claiming that the federal budget 
would force the region to diversify its economy. Either these

when the province of Alberta gets its own fiscal house in order, 
the Liberal Party of eastern Canada has once again swooped in 
and hammered her taxpayers.
<P>
	The elimination of the public utilities income transfer tax is 
nothing more than a selective tax grab against Alberta's private 
sector which will raise gas and electric bills for all Albertans. 
The Minister of Natural Resources has truly shown us that 
Ottawa has become her primary residence. It is blatant partisan 
political endeavours like this that make Calgarians now 
question the closure of CFB Calgary.
<P>
	Was this an economic decision in the best interests of the 
country or a political cheap shot at a city that sent six Reformers 
to Ottawa? Calgarians want to see the books. Show us this is 
truly a money saving measure and not a lesson for not voting 
Liberal.
<P>
	Like all Albertans, Calgarians are prepared to tighten their 
belts as long as it is fair. As a reminder to the Prime Minister, no 
matter what the Liberals do politically to the west, Alberta will 
keep sending fiscally responsible Reformers to Ottawa.

	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the red 
book says: ``Canadians with young families need a support 
system that enables parents to participate fully in the economic 
life of the country. That is why the availability of child care is an 
economic issue''.
<P>
	That is what the red book says. That is what the government 
promised the people of Canada. However, was child care even 
mentioned in the budget? Not a word. Now with the decision to 
proceed with block funding to the provinces, the federal 
government relinquishes what little influence it has to 
encourage the provinces to invest in child care.
<P>
	Also, by slashing billions of dollars from provincial transfers, 
the government has reduced the ability of the provinces to offer 
quality child care. This is tragic. What does this say about a 
country that has turned its back on its children?
<P>
	Children are our future. Young people are our future. Was the 
term youth even mentioned in the budget? Unfortunately not. 
Foreign bond traders and currency speculators may be happy 
with the budget, but what has the government done to our 
children and our youth, especially those in need?

outstanding political, social and cultural contributions to

Basmajian greatly influenced generations of physicians in

biofeedback techniques used for rehabilitation following injury 
to the central nervous system.

House that the government had no intention of maintaining 
national standards in our health care system, nothing could be 
further from the truth.
<P>
	Fears by the New Democratic Party of pending doom in the 
upcoming provincial elections should not encourage them to 
distort the honest truth about this government's commitment to 
health care in Canada. The Minister of Finance has made it clear 
in his budget that ``the conditions of the Canada Health Act will 
be maintained. Universality, comprehensiveness, accessibility, 
portability and public administration of the Canada Health Act 
are fundamental for this government''.

to meet their soft red book target because of the whining and 
crying of these Liberals. What I really wanted to call them 
would probably be unparliamentary.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in an interview on CBC radio, the Prime Minister 
tried to appease the wrath of the provinces by saying that they 
should take it as a compliment and a sign of trust that the federal 
government has decided to let them pay an additional $7 billion 
for health care, social assistance and post-secondary education. 
That takes guts, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister have the arrogance to ask the 
provinces, especially Quebec and Ontario, to take it as a 
compliment that an additional $7 billion will be cut, which puts 
them in the unenviable position of deciding whether to cut 
services or raise taxes?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, several years ago, the provinces started cutting their 
programs for health care, social services and education, and we 
kept sending money to the provinces.
<P>
	However, because of our present financial situation, we had to 
make cuts. They did and we are doing the same. Today, everyone 
has to put his financial house in order, both the federal 
government and the provinces.
<P>
	For years, the Leader of the Opposition has been asking us to 
reduce the federal presence in these sectors. When we do, he 
says: Pay, but keep quiet. In a democracy, he who pays the piper 
usually calls the tune.
<P>
	Since we did what they wanted us to do, he should be satisfied, 
and stop criticizing.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister thinks the federal government 
pays the piper, but all it does is collect the money from the same 
taxpayer who, in the end, is stuck with the bill for these transfer 
payments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not realize that he has fooled nobody 
by dumping the deficit in the backyard of the provinces? This 
tactic has already produced a negative side, as is seen in the 
decision by the Dominion Bond Rating Service to put Ontario's 
credit rating under review following the federal budget cuts in 
transfer payments?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we prepared the budget to squarely face the fiscal 
reality of the nation. At the moment I know the Canadian people 
support the tough action the government took because it was the 
right thing to do.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, will the Prime Minister be as frank as his Minister 
of Intergovernmental Affairs was yesterday in Quebec City, 
when he admitted that budget cutbacks mean that Quebec will 
have a potential loss of $3.5 billion three years from now, 
something his Minister of Finance refused to admit yesterday in 
this House?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is true that there will be a loss of revenue in some 
provinces. As in many other sectors in this country where we 
have made cuts, people will have less money. That is what 
management is. When we can no longer afford to pay, we have to 
cut, and that is what we have done. We did not walk away from 
our responsibilities. There are people who blame us, and we are 
prepared to take the blame, but on the other hand, I know the 
Canadian public realizes that this government has not neglected 
its responsibilities and that we have done what the people 
wanted us to do.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government wanted to make the $7 billion reduction in transfer 
payments to the provinces for post-secondary education, health 
and welfare look like a decentralization measure to demonstrate 
the flexibility of federalism. In a case of real decentralization 
a transfer of additional responsibilities is accompanied by the 
means to assume them, that is, tax points.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister have the gall to ask the provinces, 
as the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs did yesterday, to 
clean up their finances? He dumps an additional $7 billion 
charge on them and asks them to do for him the clean up job that 
he is incapable of doing in federal spending.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have in fact cut 19 per cent of federal government 
operations. Transfers to the provinces are cut, I believe, by 14 
per cent. We were not as harsh on the provinces as we were on 
ourselves. I think the hon. member should recognize this. There 
is no difference between tax points and cash payments; they 
represent a transfer of resources from the federal government to 
the provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
more we ask, the more we learn. Yesterday the Minister of 
Finance admitted that the cuts to the provinces represented 4 per 
cent. Today it is 14 per cent. Tomorrow, maybe-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is the truth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> I prefer to believe the Prime Minister, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> He is just as honest as his Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Will the Prime Minister admit at least that the 
reduction in transfer payments is not decentralization, since, as 
the Minister of Finance said yesterday, the federal government 
is refusing to transfer the corresponding tax points, because it 
does not want to give up any of its leverage in post-secondary 
education, health care and welfare? Will he acknowledge this?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when the Minister of Finance spoke of 3 per cent, he 
was talking about 3 per cent of a provincial budget. The figure of 
14 per cent is the cut in transfers. That is the distinction.
<P>
	It is a funny thing about money transfers. For years, the 
opposition has been telling us to get out of these areas of 
jurisdiction. And when we do so, they tell us to keep on paying. 
But the more we stay in these areas, the more federal taxpayers 
have the right to insist that we be involved in such matters. We 
are saying to the provinces that, with the new system, we are 
giving them more flexibility, as they have been requesting for 
years.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HEALTH">HEALTH</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in an interview yesterday on the CBC, the Prime 
Minister suggested that medicare needs to be reduced and revert 
to meeting more basic needs.
<P>
	The Liberal budget includes further reductions in federal 
transfers for health care and the intergovernmental affairs 
minister has apparently told the Quebec government that 
Canada's health laws need to be opened up. All of these things 
are completely opposite to the promises in the red book on 
health care.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Is there a federal plan 
to restructure health care and health care funding? If there is, 
why did the government choose to omit that plan from Monday's 
budget?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was a member of the House of Commons when the 
health care system was introduced. The five conditions written 
into the act will remain. I will not jeopardize the medicare 
system in Canada.
<P>
	It is a very good system and we want to maintain it. We are 
holding discussions with the provinces at this time to see what 
can be done to make sure that while we reduce the cost of 
medicare we maintain the quality of service. That is exactly 
what we are trying to do.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	The five conditions which are written into the act are there. 
They were in the red book and as long as I am Prime Minister 
they will remain in the laws of the land.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, one of the cornerstones of integrity in government is 
full disclosure. If the federal government has plans to reduce 
spending on health care in the short run in order to save 
medicare in the long run, it should simply say so. That is what 
the Reform Party did in its taxpayers' budget. Canadians have a 
right to expect the government to be equally frank and up front.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Is the government 
planning further reductions in health care spending, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we do not spend money on health care. The provincial 
governments spend the money. It is not us. We have no control 
over the spending of the money.
<P>
	We help the provincial governments with their health care 
systems and in exchange we ask for the five conditions to 
remain. It is the pride of Canadians to have a health care system 
which is universally free for everyone, not a system in which the 
rich have better services than the poor. That is why we are still 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10267"> 10267 </A></B>
<P>
spending money on medicare, to ensure that these principles 
remain.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister began his answer by saying that 
they were not spending money and ended up by saying that they 
were spending money. Every time the Prime Minister gives an 
evasive or political answer to this question it just heightens the 
suspicion that the federal government has some alternative plan.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Again, I ask for an 
honest, straightforward, one-word answer.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Order.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sure that all hon. members take for 
granted that both the questions and the responses will be honest. 
That goes without saying. We need not ask either for the 
question or the answer to be honest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> I ask the Prime Minister again for a straight, 
forthright, one-word answer. Is the government planning 
further reductions in health care transfer payments to the 
provinces, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when I see the leader of the Reform party getting up to 
talk about the protection of medicare I wonder if Colonel 
Sanders has become a vegetarian.
<P>
	What we intend to do with the transfer payments and 
everything else is clearly written in the budget. If the hon. 
member reads it he will have the answer.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage. The minister told Parliament yesterday that he never 
sent Mr. Manera any letter, nor did his deputy minister, 
regarding figures other than those contained in the budget. 
However, today, Mr. Manera claims that, one hour before the 
budget was tabled, the deputy minister of heritage sent him 
figures regarding budget cuts hitting the CBC over the next three 
years to the tune of $266 million.
<P>
	How can the minister reconcile the statements he made 
yesterday with those Mr. Manera made today and which are 
totally contradictory?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, that will not be difficult. You already know 
what decisions the government made in the budget. As I 
explained yesterday, the CBC's budget was drawn up for the 
coming fiscal year. The remaining figures come from the 
program review that was undertaken last August.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, how can the minister keep on pretending that only 
the budget figures were given to Mr. Manera, while the 
document he received from his deputy minister contained 
information regarding a cabinet decision for the next three 
years?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, our colleague is quite tenacious. She bounds 
off on a fishing expedition with lots of energy, yet comes back 
with nothing more than the refuse from the lake floor that her 
hook happened to catch on to. The decisions are contained in the 
budget and the other documents that Mr. Manera may have in his 
possession must be documents on program review.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	The government knows that the days of billion dollar budgets 
for the CBC are gone but has failed to admit it to Canadians. The 
Reform Party has been consistently honest and open about 
downsizing the CBC.
<P>
	Yesterday the chairman of the Standing Committee on 
Canadian Heritage stated publicly that it would have been more 
straightforward with Canadians to have included future cuts to 
the CBC in the budget and that it should have given all of the bad 
news up front.
<P>
	Why does the minister not recognize, as does his colleague, 
that they should have come clean with Canadians about their 
plans for cutting the CBC?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has made clear that in a 
budget which is a rigorous one all the agencies of the Canadian 
government have to participate in bearing the load.
<P>
	We have done so with the CBC. We have indicated very 
clearly that there will be a cut next year. We have not removed 
the cuts which go back to the Mazankowski budget.
<P>
	There is a clear situation in which the CBC has to bear part of 
the load and we think that it will be able to do so.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
despite the Prime Minister's promises not to cut the CBC as 
outlined in the Liberal red book and despite what the hon. 
minister said, the cuts that have to be made to the CBC must be 
up front and honestly stated.
<P>
	The Reform Party has said that the CBC cannot continue as we 
know it today and the figures in this secret document from the 
minister-

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. I would ask the hon. member not to use 
a prop and to please put her question.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, instead of 
sounding the death knell for the CBC by making blind cuts, why 
does the hon. minister not realize that a viable future for the 
CBC lies in the private sector?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we know that our colleague would like to see 
the disappearance of the CBC as a public broadcaster in spite of 
the great credit it has earned itself over the years for Canada.
<P>
	This does not surprise me. Not such a long time ago when the 
issue she raised was that of a country program with one 
Canadian program and channel to be defended against an 
American channel, she took the side of the American channel. 
Not only that, the Canadian channel was located in her own 
riding.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. In his budget 
plan, the Minister of Finance says he must ensure that the old 
age security program is financially sustainable. Yet, in response 
to a question on the changes planned by the government to the 
old age pension plan, the minister deliberately tried to dodge the 
issue by talking about the Canada Pension Plan, which is 
something else entirely.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	Since the Minister of Finance claims that the current old age 
pension plan has become unsustainable, can the Prime Minister 
confirm his government's intention to reduce benefits and 
access to this plan?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have no intention of reducing benefits and access to 
this plan. However, all social programs must be reviewed. That 
is what the Minister of Human Resources Development is doing.
<P>
	Studies were conducted in other areas, and the Canada 
Pension Plan, which is the pension paid to citizens in Canada, 
needs to be reviewed at this time. It is something we have to do 
in any case, in preparation for an upcoming meeting with 
provincial governments, and because programs are dovetailed to 
a certain extent.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development intends to 
review the whole question, which is very important for the 
future of seniors in Canada. This government does not favour 
the status quo. It has the capacity to review all elements of the 
social policy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, changing the status quo may affect benefits and access, 
as well.
<P>
	Since the study on old age pensions, which had been 
scheduled for last year, has been deferred once again, are we to 
understand that the government does not want to debate 
publicly, before the Quebec referendum, its plan to cut old age 
pensions?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would really like to know when this referendum will 
be held and whether there will even be a referendum. After 
reading in the newspapers about the differences and 
contradictions among opposition members on this subject, how 
can I know when the referendum will be held? We are not 
influenced by that, since they are not even able to agree on a 
question.
<P>
	If they want to win the referendum, all they have to do is ask 
the very short, very clear question that I am suggesting. If they 
want a guaranteed ``yes'', they only have to ask the following 
question: Do you want to stay in Canada? And Quebecers will 
say yes.

	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General has severely criticized the 
department of Indian affairs for its lack of financial 
accountability, its lack of program monitoring and its lack of 
program evaluation. Yet instead of being cut back like all the 
other departments in the government, Indian affairs actually 
received a $447 million increase in its budget.
<P>
	Considering that it is well documented that Indian affairs 
spending is out of control and has a serious lack of 
accountability, how can the minister even begin to justify an 
increase in his department's budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased the hon. 
member asked that. The Reform party has attempted to get quite 
a bit of misinformation throughout the country, but not with 
very much success. Most people who have looked at the budget, 
and obviously the Reform has not, will know that the birthrate in 
the aboriginal community is two and half times that of the white 
community. Next year per capita the aboriginal person will 
receive less than they do now.
<P>
	To do those things as we said in the red book, in addition to the 
442 people we already laid off, we will be laying off another 300 
people. We will be freezing salaries at the ministry, as the 
member knows. We will also be freezing salaries in the 
aboriginal communities and we will be cutting $15 million from 
the northern development program.

	That is the reality, not the myths that the member and his party 
are spreading throughout the country.

	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let us be clear about this. Mismanagement is the 
problem, not money. Both the Auditor General and the Indian 
affairs department's own internal audits have reported a plague 
of serious financial mismanagement both at the departmental 
level and at the band level.
<P>
	How can the minister of Indian affairs stand and defend this 
$447 million increase in his budget without first getting the 
mess in his department cleaned up?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this member has 23 First 
Nations in his riding. Maybe for once he will stand and defend 
one of them.

<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	This member will talk about those bands that have troubles. 
Sure those bands have troubles. However, over 80 per cent of the 
600 bands in this country are managing their affairs. For the 152 
that require help, we are giving them help. Eight-five per cent as 
of January have remedial action plans in place which means 
they, like us, are cutting staff. They are deferring housing. They 
are cutting much of their infrastructure and they are dropping 
programs. That is the reality.

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Prime Minister said that the federal government 
had no intention of giving up its control levers over the health 
sector. Meanwhile, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
alluded for the first time to the possibility of reviewing the 
Canada Health Act.
<P>
	How does the Prime Minister reconcile the comments made 
by his minister, who clearly mentioned the possibility of 
amending the Canada Health Act, with his own statement to the 
effect that the government intends to keep all its control levers 
over the health sector?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is easy. We, on this side of the House, keep repeating 
it. The minister said it: the five principles governing the Canada 
Health Act will remain in force.
<P>
	There may be circumstances where some amendments could 
be made. However, we will not compromise on the principles: 
they are there to stay. There is no contradiction between that 
position and the possibility of discussing certain changes which 
could benefit both the federal government and the provinces. 
However, the five principles will not be changed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since, 
according to the Prime Minister, the Canada Health Act will not

what the Prime Minister stated, namely that the five standards 
governing the Canada Health Act would remain in effect.
<P>
	What I said regarding the Canada social transfer was that we 
could, through mutual consent, change existing conditions 
applicable to social assistance. This is absolutely true and in 
accordance with what was said. Again, as I said yesterday during

question is for the minister of fisheries. Canada is standing firm 
on its position that the European union must adhere to NAFO's 
set quotas for turbot on the Grand Banks. However, the 
Europeans in a continuing campaign of misinformation are 
telling anybody who will listen that Canadian fishermen do not 
need, do not want and cannot catch the Canadian quota for 
turbot.
<P>
	I ask the minister to confirm whether this is fact or fiction. 
Are Canadian fishermen ready, willing and able to take the 
rightful quota that has been set for them through NAFO?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
Canadians have shown a tremendous interest this year in taking 
60 per cent of the quota assigned to Canada by NAFO.
<P>
	I am informed that in the 35 to 40-foot category somewhere 
between 200 and 500 boats are now gearing up to participate in 
the fishery. From the sixty-five to one hundred foot category, 
five vessels are now gearing up. From the fifty-five to 
sixty-five foot category, forty vessels are now gearing up.
<P>
	For the first time in a decade Canadian offshore vessels, 
vessels from fisheries products, internationals and national sea, 
are going to the offshore to catch turbot to take the Canadian 
share. One left yesterday at noon. One will leave in 45 minutes. 
They are going out on the continental shelf beyond 200 miles 
and they are going to take Canada's share of the turbot quota.

	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Liberal budget eliminates the WGTA subsidy by August 1 of this 
year, cuts the dairy subsidy by 30 per cent, cuts safety net 
programs by 30 per cent, and eliminates the feed freight 
assistance.
<P>
	The government has taken away the funding but has not taken 
away the unnecessary regulation that would cut costs, allowing 
farmers to recoup some of these losses.
<P>
	I have a question for the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food. When will the minister reduce unnecessary 
regulation and specifically how will he make the system work 
better for less?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. gentleman will 
know, over the course of the last year or so some good progress 
has been made in dealing with regulatory issues. We have passed 
in the House new legislation pertaining to the Canada Grain Act, 
which is a step in that direction, to improve the regulatory 
situation.
<P>
	Certainly a major part of our western grain transportation 
reform plan is an efficiency package, which is being worked 
upon by the Minister of Transport and myself in consultation 
with all stakeholders in the western Canadian grain handling 
system, to develop a system in western Canada that is 
substantially lower in cost overall, certainly much more 
efficient than it is today and faster in getting our grain to the 
markets where it needs to be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think 
Canadian farmers would expect a little better answer than that. 
Certainly any farmer would know that the minister better have a

	How many years will it take the minister to hold the 
discussions as laid out in the discussion paper and prepare a plan 
to replace the current system?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the discussions with respect to 
the efficiencies package have been ongoing now for several 
months with the active involvement of 14 or 15 farm 
organizations in western Canada, together with a variety of 
other stakeholders in the industry.
<P>
	We have indicated to the stakeholders participating in the 
discussions that as soon as the fiscal framework was tabled in 
the House in the form of the budget, which of course happened 
on Monday of this week, we would want to proceed very quickly 
with the finalization of the details.
<P>
	Therefore, as far as the efficiencies package is concerned to 
the extent that it requires legislation, that legislation can be 
concluded conceptually within the course of the next month. It 
can be presented to  Parliament this spring and enacted into law 
before June 1995.

<P>
	This morning, <I>La Presse</I> reported that Libertina Rizzuto and 
Luca Giammarella, suspected by the Swiss authorities of trying 
to launder $3 million through Swiss banks, were released, 
although the investigation continues. It seems their release 
came as a result of the half-hearted assistance the RCMP gave 
Swiss police authorities.

give the Swiss authorities their full co-operation when they 
refused to provide information crucial to legal proceedings in 
Switzerland?

	Notwithstanding the blustering of the Minister of Fisheries

<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans,

taken an interest in the matter, because for the last year we have 
been working very diligently to put an end to overfishing.
<P>
	As part of the process of putting an end to overfishing, last 
year we did not have this bellicose noise. We had the 
co-operation of the Reform Party and the co-operation of the 
Bloc Quebecois. I recognize that last year was a rare time when 
the House was unanimous and passed Bill C-29 to take the 
necessary measures to throw flag of convenience vessels off the 
nose and tail. They left last May and they have not returned.

	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Transport. On October 18, I asked 
the minister how he could justify spending nearly $10 million a 
year to keep the Coast Guard College in Sydney open when the 
Marine Institute in Rimouski, Quebec, the Pacific Maritime 
Training Institute in Vancouver and the Marine Institute in 
Newfoundland, among others, offered the same services. I never 
heard back from him on that.
<P>
	How can the minister contemplate, as outlined in the last 
budget, imposing higher rates on Coast Guard service users, 
when he does not have the courage to end needless duplication, 
as in the case of the college in Sydney, which costs the taxpayers 
$10 million per year?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, every institution my hon. colleague mentioned makes a 
significant contribution to the Coast Guard and other services 
within Transport Canada. We have no intention of changing the 
status of the Coast Guard College in Sydney, Nova Scotia.
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, why 
did the minister not take advantage of the budget to announce

at a lower cost?

	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr.

produces people who are highly skilled and world recognized. 
We understand the role played by the various provincial 
institutions referred to by the hon. member.
<P>
	I would hope the hon. member would understand that the 
presence of a coast guard academy such as the one at Sydney is 
absolutely essential to maintain the level and the standards that 
are well known around the world which have been maintained by

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
according to the estimates tabled on Tuesday, the Treasury 
Board secretariat will be creating 10 more management 
positions at a cost of $3.5 million to the taxpayer. That is 
$350,000 for each executive. The President of the Treasury 
Board must have some spectacular executives in mind for that 
kind of salary.
<P>
	How can the President of the Treasury Board pad his 
executive suite with 10 more managers while in the same breath 
cut 45,000 jobs from the rest of the civil service?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would be happy to look into the specifics of the matter 
the hon. member mentions.
<P>
	Let me tell you, Mr. Speaker, that overall the executive ranks 
in the public service have been reduced over the last four years 
by some 26 per cent.
<P>
	As the Minister of Finance announced the other day, in our 
budget expenditure plan over the next three years there is a 
reduction of some 19 per cent in government spending. As part 
of the reduction in staff there will be proportional representation 
at the different levels: executive, middle management and 
frontline workers. The executive level will be part and parcel of 
the government's overall plan of reduction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> I am not sure the 
minister heard my point, Mr. Speaker. I said that he was going to 
increase his own departmental executives by 10.
<P>
	He said the other day: ``We will continue to manage changing 
priorities by reallocating resources''. This is not my idea of 
reallocating resources by adding more to his department. It 
seems to me that the resources will be reallocated not toward a 
reduction of the deficit but to his own department.
<P>
	Does the President of the Treasury Board need to increase his 
executive staff by 15 per cent when he is reducing the total 
number of the federal civil service by over 20 per cent?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not know from where the hon. member gets those 
figures. There is no increase in the staff at Treasury Board.
<P>
	In fact there is a reduction as there is in all departments as part 
of the overall plan to get the deficit of the country down. That 
has been part of the government's program as announced by the 
Minister of Finance.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HEALTH">HEALTH</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Health. As the minister knows, as 
cash transfers to provinces go down the tax point shares go up.
<P>
	Yesterday the Prime Minister, speaking straight from the 
heart, said: ``When you transfer tax points you lose all leverage 
after that because you don't collect the money. The day that you 
don't have any more cash, you can't use the leverage''. That 
suggests to me that it is straight through the heart of the health 
care system.
<P>
	I want to ask a question of the minister whose major 
responsibility to the Canadian citizen is to protect the national 
health care system. Clearly she has not been successful. Will she 
do the right thing and resign?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I explained very clearly it is because we want to 
maintain the five conditions of the health act that we have to 
make sure we transfer cash. That is why we decided to have a 
system of block funding so that we could have some influence.
<P>
	When they have tax points the provinces are not obliged to 
listen to us any more. I recognize that we need some leverage 
because if we did not have leverage some provinces would have 
already cut into the five conditions. We need to have the means 
to make sure they do not use the fact that they have only tax 
points to destroy medicare.
<P>
	We will keep what is needed for medicare to stay as it is.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-73, an act to provide borrowing authority for the fiscal year 
beginning on April 1, 1995, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when I began 
earlier today, I started off with Madam Speaker, was interrupted 
by Mr. Speaker, and now I have a different Mr. Speaker in the 
Chair. I would like to be certain that this Mr. Speaker will 
remain in the Chair for the duration of my short intervention in 
this debate.
<P>
	As I said earlier to my colleagues in the House, the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services has had 
to sustain some significant reductions. I note my colleague from 
the Reform Party. No doubt he will have numerous questions for 
me when we go before committee. I might add he usually asks 
very good questions.
<P>
	I want to share with him and other members of the House that 
we will be commercializing the Canada Communication Group, 
an aspect of public works and government services. We will be 
doing away with the stock item supply. We will be going to 
direct deposit across the board to save the taxpayers significant 
amounts of money. Cheque production sites will be consolidated 
in order to save costs to the taxpayer, contributing to the savings 
we are putting toward the deficit over a three year period of $353 
million.
<P>
	In addition, public works and government services, Treasury 
Board and all agencies of the Government of Canada have been, 
presently are and will continue to look at ways in which to make 
additional savings in terms of the reduction in office space 
which houses a variety of government departments.
<P>
	Program review was conducted by my colleague the Minister 
of Intergovernmental Affairs and had a number of aspects 
associated with it. One was a vertical examination of all 
expenditures in each of the departments. As a consequence of 
that examination, there will be less need for additional space.
<P>
	I want to be very careful and very prudent. I welcome 
suggestions from members across the way in terms of how we 
can do public-private partnering in this regard and how we can 
have additional savings as it relates to the space requirements 
we need as a national government across the country.
<P>
	These savings, as I indicated earlier, will total $353 million 
and will dislocate 5,263 employees over a three year period. It is 
very difficult to try to sugarcoat tough decisions, but I want to be 
clear. Although there will be some dislocation of jobs, many of 
those jobs will reappear in the private sector. We ought not to 
downplay the significance the private sector can play in terms of 
handling some of these services and activities which, prior to the 
budget, were being conducted by government departments.
<P>
	The Department of Public Works and Government Services is 
a common service department. We act in relation to the requests 
made to us by other departments and agencies of the 
Government of Canada. Where the opportunity exists, our 
objective and goal is always to try to get value for the 
expenditures within our department. We will be vigilant in 
reaching that goal in the coming months and years. Again I 
invite the co-operation and suggestions of members opposite to 
make certain we abide by that objective of value for our money. 
Where the opportunity exists I hope they will provide us with 
good, meaningful suggestions.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation is another agency 
which comes under my responsibility. It has a historic, national 
and international reputation in the housing sector. Cabinet and 
the Minister of Finance, in view of the fiscal capacity of the 
Government of Canada, are giving savings to reduce the deficit 
in excess of $300 million.
<P>
	We will be closing over 20 offices across the country. We will 
be cutting back on our research efforts as a national housing 
institution. We will be doing away with the scholarship program 
which has been part and parcel of Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation for quite some time. If anyone were to suggest that 
those are not tough, difficult measures, I would think they were 
being less than candid with themselves and with the House.
<P>
	I do want to say that the Minister of Finance has given us a 
balance. On the one hand we still have 600,000 units. It is an 
expenditure by the government of over $2 billion annually, 
housing one million Canadians who need the assistance of the 
state as they try to provide dignity and opportunities for their 
families and their communities. That expenditure is significant.
<P>
	It is hoped that over an additional three year period we will be 
able to have additional savings and will be able to do some 
things in other sectors. However, I do not want to give a false 
impression to the House because it would be misleading and 
very unfair to suggest otherwise.
<P>
	With the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, the 
government over a three year period will be reducing its 
contributions to that agency. I would like to take a moment to 
explain the mandate of ACOA. The mandate of the Atlantic 
Canada Op-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10275"> 10275 </A></B>
<P>
portunities Agency is to effectuate where possible economic 
activities in the Atlantic region.
<P>
	Those of us who come from the Atlantic region, such as my 
colleague the hon. member for Dartmouth, will attest to the fact 
that economic growth in many of our communities is not what 
we want it to be. We are continually trying to find ways to foster 
economic growth. We have moved away from a previous set of 
targets in terms of providing grants to small and medium sized 
businesses. We have done away with that. We have moved to a 
system of repayable loans which provides more accountability 
for all.
<P>
	There is still a lot of partnering. As an agency of the crown we 
can partner with the provinces, universities and non-profit 
organizations. This is done not for the sake of having 
announcements but for the sake of trying to get communities, 
the intellectual side, the business side and the non-profit side 
together, forging a coalition to try to meet the challenge of 
creating economic activity in the poorer regions.
<P>
	Much has been said about regional economic development in 
the past. I am sure much more will be said by those who oppose 
that forum. Let it be understood that as the minister responsible 
for one small agency, ACOA, I believe as the red book and the 
1994 and 1995 budgets have identified, that regional economies 
are the backbone of the nation.
<P>
	There is no question there are differences between the 
economy of Atlantic Canada and that of Quebec. There are 
differences between western Canada and the Atlantic region. 
There are differences between Ontario and the west, be it the 
prairies or British Columbia. They are different. We must 
acknowledge that factual thing: a small population base, a 
widely dispersed people over a large geographical mass. It is our 
task not to put the blame on those that have come before us and 
tried to seize the moment and the opportunity by creating 
through partnerships something that will provide some hope and 
some dignity to individuals in that region of the country.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	All agencies of government were asked to provide moneys to 
cut the deficit. Fifty person years will be reduced at the Atlantic 
Canada Opportunities Agency, 15 person years at Enterprise 
Cape Breton. All aspects are being reviewed.
<P>
	As members opposite find opportunities to either ask 
questions or put before me as the minister responsible, as my 
colleagues in the Atlantic Region do, ways in which we can 
improve, to cut things and to add to things, I would be happy to 
hear from them.
<P>
	I want to make something very clear to those members who sit 
in the House. I make no apology to any member, any political 
party, and any representative of the press for standing up for a 
region which has historically sustained a lot of economic 
difficulty. As I say to my friends and as I shared with caucus 
colleagues, we in Atlantic Canada do not want handouts. We 
want a hand up. Regardless of where they live, Canadians are 
entitled  to that kind of opportunity from the national 
government.
<P>
	In the time that I have remaining, I want to briefly touch on 
the subject of the Royal Canadian Mint. Colleague opposite 
knows that I have umpteen different agencies for which I am 
responsible so I am just hitting the highlights of some of them.
<P>
	With regard to the Royal Canadian Mint, I want to clarify a 
rumour. It was circulating in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia that the $2 
coin we will be issuing will have the picture of the hon. member 
for Dartmouth on the coin. I want to make it perfectly clear it 
was a difficult decision I had to make personally, but given what 
I had to work with I think everyone can understand why I 
reached the decision I did.
<P>
	Let the House be aware that the new $2 coin will save 
taxpayers over a 20-year period a quarter of a billion dollars.
<P>
	We have gone one step further. We are looking at all of the 
coins and their composition. We are going to change the 
composition of those coins in order to reduce their cost, thereby 
increasing the revenues which will total almost an additional 
$12 million per year for the 20-year duration of an average coin. 
That is new revenue for the national government. It is new 
revenue for the purposes of writing down the deficit of the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	I want Canadians to know that these measures have been taken 
because we listened to them. I am the minister responsible for 
public works, government services, and a host of other agencies. 
I have gone before the standing committee for a record number 
of times for any minister; three times. I have had good questions 
from opposition members. I have had good suggestions from 
opposition members. Equally so, I have had very good quality 
questions and suggestions from government members. I want to 
thank them for their help and assistance.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	I throw out a challenge to all members of the House. If we are 
sincere, which I take as a given, of reducing the deficit of the 
government in the years ahead, they should come forward with 
solutions. Yes, criticize too because that is part and parcel of the 
political process. As I have told my exempt staff as well as all of 
my deputy ministers, it is fine to identify problems but it is more 
important to identify solutions to those problems.
<P>
	I know that my time has come to an end but I would be happy 
to attempt to answer any questions my colleagues may wish to 
raise at this time.

	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister 
of Public Works said that using $2 coins would result in savings 
of some $225,000. I wonder how much it will cost to repair our 
pockets though, because it is going to be a heavy load to carry. 
My comment is somewhat in line with the sense of humour 
displayed by the minister when he alluded to the possibility of 
having his face appear on the new $2 coin.
<P>
	The closing of some CMHC offices is a more serious issue. I 
agree that the government must reduce spending. However, I 
find it hard to understand why the minister decided to close the 
CMHC office in my riding of Longueuil, since some 1.2 million 
people live in the Montérégie. I think it would have been 
justified to keep an office to manage CMHC affairs in that 
region. That region has a larger population than the province of 
Nova Scotia where, I imagine, there must be at least one CMHC 
office. So, I ask the minister: Why he is taking that step and, 
second, from where will he manage all the properties in the 
Montérégie?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the 
question. It is a very legitimate and important question that one 
would ask of a minister.
<P>
	My colleague is quite right in making representations to me 
on the issue. However, I say to him as I say to all members, 
difficult decisions had to be made by the government relating to 
the reduction of expenditures.
<P>
	In the riding adjacent to mine that members refer to quite 
often as being my district but really is not, we closed the office 
as well. I do not take any joy as the minister responsible for 
Canada Mortgage and Housing for having to shut down offices.
<P>
	Administratively it is important that Canada Mortgage and 
Housing make those kinds of decisions in order that we can 
contribute to bringing down the deficit of the Government of 
Canada. I have had numerous meetings with my colleague the 
Minister of Finance who did not cherish the fact that we had to 
reduce those offices.
<P>
	I want to tell my colleague opposite that his constituents, 
which he ably represents, will still have the services of 
representatives from Canada Mortgage and Housing from 
neighbouring communities.
<P>
	Notwithstanding reductions at Canada Mortgage and 
Housing, I received no less than seven or eight interventions 
from his party. I thought he was to congratulate me on the rent 
geared to income which was rumoured to go from 25 per cent to 
30 per cent. The Minister of Finance and the cabinet have 
maintained it at 25 per cent.
<P>
	On the one hand it was difficult to close the office in his 
constituency. He will still receive quality service from 
neighbouring communities. On the other hand we have been fair. 
We have not increased the rent geared to income for those 
citizens who are occupying our social housing units across the 
country.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I was hoping the minister would put to rest the 
terrible rumour I heard that the figure on the new proposed $2 
coin might be a soft walled, shiny topped dingy. That did not 
happen and it is unfortunate.
<P>
	I want to get down to the matter of his responsibility with 
regard to ACOA. We know there are several regional 
development agencies flowing from the federal government: 
ACOA, western economic diversification, FORD-Q and other 
northern development agencies.
<P>
	If someone with a grade five education sat down and thought 
about it, he or she would realize this whole concept is wrong. 
First, history tells us it is wrong. It has not worked in his region 
of Atlantic Canada. We have seen DREE grants, ACOA grants 
and loan programs for not years but decades and they have not 
worked. They have been part of a continuation of a depressed 
economy. In some of these regions they have not solved the 
problem.
<P>
	If we think about it, the reasons are obvious. First, the 
payback of taxpayers' dollars going through the administration 
here in Ottawa and then back out to the regions is very costly. 
They are very expensive departments with gold windows that 
have to be replaced and huge staffs. It is also an opportunity for 
ministers to have undue influence in the tendering process. It 
tends to have people come to ministers hat in hand, asking for a 
grant or a loan.
<P>
	I know that recently the minister responsible for ACOA has 
removed the granting program. I believe that is due in large 
measure to criticism from the Reform caucus that pointed out 
the blatant pork barrelling and the problems with the whole 
program of grants.
<P>
	Now ACOA is restricted to lending funds to business. In fact, 
they have reduced the lending. However, businesses can get 
loans from other institutions such as banks and credit unions. 
Why would we need ACOA to grant loans? It is a very costly 
way for the taxpayers to help businesses. Also the amount lent 
out is reduced. Yet we still have the department and the minister 
responsible as well as his staff. There are not the cuts at the top 
we need because we are doing less with more.
<P>
	How can the minister stand in the House and justify ACOA, 
western economic diversification and other regional 
development agencies that have failed miserably. They have 
added poverty to Canada and have been an opportunity for pork 
barrelling and misuse of federal funds.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Mr. Speaker, such an easy question from an 
easy representative. The hon. member's assertion is factually 
incorrect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Make some sense for once.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> I did not interrupt the hon. member when he 
was speaking. Maybe he can give me the same courtesy.
<P>
	Let him remember and understand history. Yes, regional 
economic development programs have not been a raving 
success. To suggest there have been no successes is factually 
incorrect. It is factually incorrect to suggest that they have not 
benefited certain regions. The hon. member should travel the 
country extensively before he states false and misleading 
information of that nature.
<P>
	The hon. member makes the statement that somehow we 
changed the programming of the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency because of the interventions of the Reform Party. The 
people who changed that program from grants to loans were the 
business community and business representatives in Atlantic 
Canada. When I travel Atlantic Canada, which is extensively, I 
meet with them time and time again. I have listened to what they 
have said and listened to what the Atlantic Liberal caucus has 
said and that is the reason we moved from grants to repayable 
loans.
<P>
	Finally, the hon. member made reference to a dingy on the 
coin.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	Let me say to the hon. member that yes, the students at the 
University College of Cape Breton have referred to this wall that 
they have constructed under an infrastructure program as the 
``Dingwall''.
<P>
	I want to tell my hon. friend that just the other day I drove by 
the ``Dingwall'' in a car with white walls. I want to assure the 
hon. member that the ``Dingwall'' is a hell of a lot more 
effective and durable than the white walls on that car. I think the 
hon. member knows who I am referring to when I talk about the 
white walls.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
Monday, before the Minister of Finance tabled his budget, I was 
worried because I realized Canada was bankrupt.
<P>
	This was not my opinion but that of the New York <I>Wall Street 
Journal</I>, in an article that appeared on January 12, this year, 
under the heading ``Bankrupt Canada''. I also knew that 
Moody's in New York had put us under a credit watch and was 
waiting for the right moment to reduce our credit rating, which 
would put upward pressure on the deficit and the national debt.
<P>
	Considering these facts, I knew the Minister of Finance would 
have to turn the situation around. I thought he would be fair to all 
taxpayers, however. I would have liked to discuss the main cuts 
introduced by the Minister of Finance, which are not, in every 
case, appropriate and transparent, but I am sure my colleagues 
will do a better job, since these subjects are not my specialty.
<P>
	As the official opposition critic for transport, I was expecting 
cuts but I had no idea the Department of Transport was up for 
sale. I found that out last Monday.
<P>
	As a result of program review, budgetary cuts will total $1.1 
billion or 50.8 per cent of total expenditures forecast from 1995 
to 1998. If we include cuts announced in the previous budget, 
the Department of Transport's spending levels will be reduced 
by 1.4 billion during the same period. In fact, budgetary savings 
as a result of program review will total $2.6 billion over three 
years.
<P>
	Take, for instance, the transfer of airports to local authorities. 
The problem, since this is about downloading the deficit to the 
provinces, is that these transfers to local or provincial 
authorities will not include the corresponding tax points. That is 
the problem.
<P>
	Air Canada was sold, and now Canadian National is on the 
block. Means of transportation that our ancestors put in place 
are now being sold off, not as a face saving gesture but to make 
the government's failure in this respect less palpable. What can 
we say about all this? Is this supposed to be a spring sale by the 
federal government? Is this a closing out sale or a panic sale?
<P>
	Since the Bloc Quebecois arrived in force in Ottawa, we have 
been in favour of big projects to jump start the economy and 
replenish the government coffers. In this regard, I spoke a 
number of times in this House to encourage the government to 
set up and invest in rapid transport, a high speed train in the 
Windsor-Quebec City corridor. The budget made no mention 
of this project. In fact, it indicated that there would be no more 
mega-projects.
<P>
	From the start of the budget speech to the end of it, I watched 
the Department of Transport crumble. I watched the legacy of a 
century disintegrate. I kept waiting for the comforting 
announcement of a project that would get the economy 
moving-a high speed train. But no such luck.
<P>
	Let us have a look at the coast guard now. We are presented 
with the integration of the Coast Guard into the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans. At first glance, it would seem to be an 
interesting arrangement, because there is a promise of greater 
efficiency. But we must look carefully. Even though the budget 
contains no concrete measures, other than those affecting the 
fleet, the federal government plans to change the operations and 
level of service of the Coast Guard. These changes will take the 
form of cost recovery measures and increased fees.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10278"> 10278 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	These measures may jeopardize the competitiveness of ports 
along the St. Lawrence and of the shipping industry as a whole. 
Furthermore, part III of the budget estimates includes 
provisions to merge the Canadian Coast Guard fleet with 
Fisheries and Oceans, to delegate certain ship inspection 
activities to classification societies, to transfer to the provinces 
responsibility for inland waters of lesser importance and for 
more sound management of public ports, with the potential 
elimination of certain facilities.
<P>
	This budget also provides for an increase in service fees, 
which is tantamount to a hidden tax to be paid by people using 
such services. This measure targets shipping services of course. 
Services provided by the Coast Guard benefit the public and for 
this reason fees for such services should not be increased. An 
increase in fees for these services, which limit the number of ice 
jams on the St. Lawrence, would prevent the Coast Guard from 
saving Canadian lives, ensuring navigation safety and would 
increase the risk of ecological accidents on the St. Lawrence.
<P>
	In conclusion, such a fee structure would limit the 
competitiveness of Quebec ports vis-à-vis their American 
counterparts and the transport minister and the federal 
government have known this for a long time. The transport 
committee, of which I am deputy chairman, is currently 
undertaking a tour of the country's principal ports. In particular, 
we have visited Montreal, Quebec City and Mont-Joli in 
Quebec. We have heard clearly that higher rates would put an 
end to traffic on the St. Lawrence. Shipowners will prefer to 
unload their cargo in Halifax, or to forge on to ports in Boston, 
New York or Baltimore.
<P>
	Is that the end result the minister hopes to attain? Stem traffic 
on the St. Lawrence? Steer traffic towards Maritime or 
American ports? Could it be that he is trying to scare Quebecers 
by a vision of what could be in store if they separated? It is not 
fear that has kept Quebecers in confederation for so many years, 
but the hope that they would be treated fairly, which 
decision-makers have failed to keep alive.
<P>
	Quebecers are intelligent enough to figure out what the 
current government is up to, in particular the Liberal Party of 
Canada, which has always tried and is still trying to ruin Quebec 
and to play favourites with other provinces. My case in point is 
the closing of the Coast Guard college in Sydney, while the 
Quebec Marine Institute in Rimouski or, for that matter, other 
institutes in other provinces could have very easily done the 
same work. This duplication is costing $10 million per year to 
provincial institutions which could easily have taken over the 
job.
<P>
	Now, on to privatizing CN. Canadian National is a Crown 
corporation that has served Canadians for many years. It is one 
of the institutions that has made it possible for Canadians from 
coast to coast to communicate with each other. If it were not for 
the  railways, Western Canada probably would not have been 
developed to the extent that it has. The government now intends 
to sell CN, under the pretense that the decision will give society 
the flexibility needed to quickly make strategic decisions on 
operations and investments.
<P>
	Is this an admission by the Minister of Finance that his 
government is not in a position to make strategic decisions? The 
sale of CN could cause many problems. Before selling off our 
economic development tools, we must take several precautions. 
According to the Nault report, some preparation work must be 
carried out before CN can be sold, namely reducing the debt, 
increasing profits and rationalizing the network.
<P>
	First of all, the eventual buyer must be required to protect the 
rights of the Canadian people. Let us also keep in mind that the 
Nault report favours an Air Canada-like privatization process. 
We will have the opportunity to review these issues and to 
question the Minister of Transport both in the House and in 
committee. With regard to the national airport policy, we are 
told that airport commercialization will continue. Six national 
airports have already been transferred to local management.
<P>
	The Quebec government will have to support local groups 
from small municipalities who want to enter into negotiations 
with Ottawa. As you can appreciate, Quebec taxpayers will 
again have to foot the bill for this federal policy.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, from what I just said, you can understand that I 
am far from enthused by the budget trends regarding the 
Canadian air, sea and ground transportation sector.
<P>
	This government shows its total lack of imagination. 
International financial players called for cuts, but the 
government cut indiscriminately, hitting seniors and the 
disadvantaged especially hard.
<P>
	For over a year, we have been asking the minister to establish 
an integrated transport policy in Canada. This policy would 
determine what should be transported by rail, by ship, by plane 
and by road. Without being authoritarian and inflexible, this 
policy could provide for fiscal incentives favouring the best 
means of transportation.
<P>
	Most of the countries in the world are developing rail 
transportation because it is the cheapest. Here in Canada, we 
remove rail tracks everywhere and convert them to bike paths. 
We let trucks with excessive loads onto our roads. The roads are 
being destroyed and the provinces must invest enormous 
amounts to maintain them.
<P>
	Yesterday, I read an editorial by a great Quebecer and 
Canadian entitled ``Imperial Federalism''. What an appropriate 
headline to describe the federal government, whether 
Conservative or Liberal. They act without consulting, lead by 
fear, and always repeat the same mistakes. That is Canadian 
imperialism for you.
<P>

<HR>

<P>
	This government may feel that Quebecers rejected the 
Charlottetown Agreement by mistake or because they were in 
a bad mood. But it would be wrong. Quebecers can see clearly. 
They want to be part of the solution and not part of the problem. 
As long as they are in this imperialistic Confederation, the rest 
of Canada will think that Quebecers are the problem.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance tried to convince us that his budget 
was a new form of federalism by attempting to decentralize 
some areas of jurisdiction, without transferring tax points, 
providing that Confederation partners comply with national 
objectives.
<P>
	Quebec is a nation, a people. It has its own objectives and will 
never agree to be led by an imperial federalist government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
thank the hon. member for his excellent speech. I think he takes 
the interests of the Quebec transportation industry at heart, and 
he represents them well.
<P>
	I would like him to touch on the possible implications of these 
cuts in transfer payments to the provinces, which the Minister of 
Finance indicated will be to the tune of $7 billion over the next 
three years. Transfer cuts mean less money being paid to 
Quebec. At the same time, the federal government continues to 
tax Quebec at the same level. Moreover, tax hikes are imposed 
on Quebecers, representing a deficit of about $6.5 billion for 
Quebec in taxes alone. Add to that some $2.5 billion less coming 
back to Quebec every year, and this makes a shortfall of $9 
billion for the people of Quebec.
<P>
	Instead of cutting taxes in Quebec, the federal government is 
cutting the share Quebec used to get. This makes for a rather 
significant shortfall, in fact a very significant shortfall for 
Quebecers. How can this be offset? As the Minister of Finance 
said, Quebec will have to either reduce public expenditures 
further or impose tax hikes Quebec taxpayers who are not only 
seeing their taxes go up instead of down, but receiving about 
$2.5 billion less from the federal government every year, which 
is utterly unfair. It is important that the people of Quebec be 
reminded over and over again of this fact.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	How does the transport critic see the transportation industry 
in Quebec being affected by this drastic drop in overall revenue?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Having been more than 
generous with the 10 minute period allotted to the hon. member 
for Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, I would ask that we get 
back on the right track, speaking of transportation. So, if he 
could keep his answer as short as possible, under two minutes in 
any case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Thank you Mr. Speaker for being so 
understanding.
<P>
	I will answer the hon. member for Longueuil. The question 
comes unexpectedly, even though the member and I belong to 
the same party. We can make a comparison. I am convinced that 
when a Liberal member asks a question to a Liberal minister 
during question period, viewers in Canada and Quebec can tell 
that the answer has already been prepared. However, this is not 
the case here. I did not expect the question from the hon. 
member for Longueuil. However, I will try to answer it to the 
best of my knowledge.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Ah, Ah!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> You can laugh if you want.
<P>
	My colleague raises an interesting issue. I already had the 
opportunity to tell the Minister of Transport, in committee, that 
if the federal government privatizes or commercializes airports, 
ports and the St. Lawrence Seaway, Quebecers will have to ask 
themselves this crucial question during the upcoming 
referendum debate: Are we getting our money's worth, 
considering that we pay $28 billion in taxes every year to 
Ottawa?
<P>
	When the federal government is investing in Quebec, it is not 
giving anything to Quebecers. When elderly people receive a 
cheque with the maple leaf on the stub, it is not a donation from 
the federal: it is money which these people, their spouse or their 
children have contributed through taxes. Consequently, this 
question is very much to the point, as is the whole issue of how 
the provinces will be able to provide the required financing.
<P>
	For example, the federal government wants to transfer some 
regional airports. These airports will be managed by the local 
community, because the provinces have clearly indicated that 
they do not want those regional airports, and indeed I think they 
would have been ill-advised to take on that responsibility. I 
received confidential minutes in which the following issue was 
raised: If the local authority cannot make a profit with the 
airport in Sept-Îles, which currently makes $1.9 million in 
profit annually, what will happen? The federal airport in 
Sept-Îles will close. Consequently, will our taxes be adjusted 
accordingly? That is a very good question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the hon. member 
for his co-operation. The hon. member for La Prairie.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to start by drawing the attention of this House to the size of 
the federal government's debt and the fact that government 
measures have done so little to change a situation that has now 
become chronic. The government must balance its budget as 
soon as possible, because its credit is fading fast.
<P>
	The 1995-96 estimates tabled by the Minister of Finance 
show that public debt charges now represent 30 per cent of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10280"> 10280 </A></B>
<P>
government spending, while 22 per cent goes  to payments to 
persons and 16 per cent to payments to other levels of 
government.
<P>
	The last two payments combined represent 38 per cent of total 
spending, barely exceeding public debt charges as a percentage 
of the total budget. I think it is clear we have a problem when the 
cost of servicing the debt is only 8 per cent less than what the 
federal government transfers to Canadians and to the provinces 
in the form of transfer payments.
<P>
	Considering the decline in program spending over the next 
few years and the expected increase in public debt charges, we 
will soon reach the point where debt charges alone will exceed 
total transfers to persons and the provinces. In other words, a 
larger share of our tax dollars will go to investors and people 
who buy government bonds than to the citizens of this country. 
Is that the kind of flexible federalism the Minister of Finance 
wants?
<P>
	It is clear that the minister's budget has done nothing to stem 
the growth of the debt. The deficit for the year ending on March 
31 would have been $41 billion, not $39.7 billion as forecast in 
the last budget, if the government had not used the surplus in the 
Unemployment Insurance Fund to absorb part of the deficit. 
Normally, the surplus should have been applied to job creation 
and dealing with the structural unemployment.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	The government is still putting off the real decisions until 
later. The cost of the public debt will increase from the $42 
billion it will be at the end of this year to nearly $51 billion in 
two years' time.
<P>
	We have to conclude that Liberal carelessness has brought 
this prosperous country to the brink of bankruptcy. Under the 
most optimistic scenario, the deficit will not be eliminated 
before the turn of the century. At that point, the cost of servicing 
the public debt will be over $60 billion. What waste and what 
wealth lost. Imagine what we could do with another $60 billion 
in the government coffers annually.
<P>
	The government is adding insult to injury. It continues to 
invade provincial jurisdictions, but without paying any more for 
the programs for which it imposes national standards on the 
provinces. Quebec will have the unpleasant job of taxing its 
citizens in order to comply with the federal standards pertaining 
to the block funding planned by the present government.
<P>
	In the end, Quebec will pay, but Ottawa will set the rules. The 
funding will be decentralized, but decision making power will 
remain in Ottawa. The federal government is not transferring 
any tax points in exchange for the reduction in transfer 
payments to the provinces. The government is doctoring the 
truth and putting the real decisions off until after the Quebec 
referendum. The federal contribution to social assistance, health 
care and education will drop by $7 billion in the next two years. 
This is a huge amount in terms of health care and  education, but, 
unfortunately, too little to put an end to the deficit.
<P>
	Overlap with the provinces will not disappear. Program 
review and efforts at streamlining have focused particularly on 
departments and agencies that are strictly under federal 
jurisdiction, where there was no overlap or duplication with the 
provinces. These departments include the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade, National Defence and 
the Department of Transport.
<P>
	The federal government is not getting out of areas under 
provincial jurisdiction, where little streamlining efforts have 
been focused. While it is chipping away the unemployment 
insurance program little by little, the government is imposing a 
temporary tax on bank capital, which will bring in $100 million 
over the next two years.
<P>
	During this same period, the unemployed will be contributing 
$3 billion to deficit reduction, that is, 30 times what is being 
asked of the banks. This temporary tax represents only a little 
more than 1 per cent of the banks' annual profits, while the 
middle class remains overtaxed. Two sets of rules: a temporary 
tax on bank capital and a permanent tax of up to 50 per cent on 
the income of middle class families.
<P>
	There is also the excise tax. The federal excise tax on gasoline 
is increased immediately by 1.5 cents a litre to help reduce the 
deficit. Why, then, wait until 1999 to reinstate the 21-year rule 
for family trusts? Doubtless, to enable these families to find 
another tax shelter. Always a double standard: one for the 
monied, another for the workers, the unemployed and the middle 
class.
<P>
	The impact of the budget on Montérégie and the riding of La 
Prairie, which I have the honour to represent in this House, is 
also devastating. While the Auditor General was saying that we 
could save close to $1 billion if national defence were better 
managed, the government decides to close the base at 
Saint-Hubert, even though Quebec only has 15 per cent of the 
country's military facilities.
<P>
	After losing the Royal Military College in Saint-Jean, 
Quebec and the Montérégie region are losing the base at 
Saint-Hubert.
<P>
	Almost 40 per cent of the inhabitants of the town of Brossard, 
which makes up 55 per cent of the federal riding of La Prairie, 
are of an origin other than Canadian. Several are recent 
immigrants, others are political refugees. The budget would 
impose a fee of $975 per adult immigration request on future 
immigrants. We should bear in mind that this amount is more 
than the average annual income in several countries. Is the 
government opening the door to rich immigrants only? We 
should ask ourselves this question. Why impose an entrance toll 
on people who want to come here to improve their economic 
situation? There is something despicable about reducing the 
deficit on the backs of people who have yet to set foot on 
Canadian soil and  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10281"> 10281 </A></B>
<P>
whose financial situation is often unstable. Is this the image 
Canada wants to project as a land of welcome?
<P>
	Are Canadians so powerless to resolve their deficit problem 
that they have to tax people who are thinking of settling here? 
This measure is revolting and should be rejected by Parliament.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to add that the government's 
borrowing power must be limited and nearing its saturation 
point if we have to enforce such deficit reduction measures. It is 
from this perspective that we should examine Bill C-37.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened attentively to the remarks made by my colleague from 
the Bloc Quebecois. It is obvious that when measures taken by 
the governing party are good ones-because they are in the 
interest of Quebec as well as Canada-such measures will 
always be disparaged by the party in opposition whose views are 
exclusively separatist.
<P>
	We all know that the business and international communities 
have responded favourably to the budget brought down by the 
finance minister. In other words, it is the most responsible 
budget possible.
<P>
	The current government said it would control the debt and the 
deficit, but I would also like to draw to the attention of this 
House remarks made during the last election campaign by the 
Right Hon. Prime Minister of Canada who stated that the debt 
and deficit must be controlled but also that a fair balance must 
be struck between the government's social role and the reality of 
budgetary constraints.
<P>
	To my mind, the finance minister's budget is in every respect 
consistent with the Liberal philosophy of a fair balance. We will 
get the deficit down. Indeed, we have reached and ever 
surpassed our objectives because the deficit is lower than 
anticipated. In saying that the government has a social role to 
play which must be maintained, well, with this budget we have 
fundamentally reconsidered the role of government.
<P>
	People are saying that block transfers to the provinces are 
disastrous, I say that is pure grandstanding. I myself was a 
member of the parliamentary committee on the reform of social 
programs and I must say that, throughout Canada, people were 
asking for greater flexibility for the provinces. In Quebec and 
everywhere, people asked for block transfers. And so when the 
finance minister says he is rethinking the role of government, it 
is in fact to restore greater autonomy to the provinces through 
these block transfers.
<P>
	What else could people ask for? The block transfers obviously 
entail some cuts, but we must not lose sight of the fact that the 
cuts we are imposing with this transfer in regard to the Canada 
assistance plan, health and post-secondary education is not as 
harsh as the measures we have imposed on ourselves. We must 
remember that by making a block transfer to the provinces, we 
are eliminating some overlaps, thereby reducing administrative 
costs.
<P>
	Needless to say, this budget could be described as exemplary 
and that is why opposition members are trying to discredit it, but 
they are having a hard time doing so because that is not 
consistent with their views. This budget has something for 
Quebec and the other provinces, it gives them greater autonomy. 
That is what Canada will be like tomorrow and it is the Liberal 
Party, the present government, which will bring Canada into the 
next century.
<P>
	And now, my question. In Quebec, people talk about wanting 
to regain autonomy in budgetary matters, returning taxation 
power to the province of Quebec, about having more budgetary 
capacity come separation. Considering that equalization works 
to Quebec's advantage-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I must take 
into account the fact that the hon. member was allotted ten 
minutes with five minutes for questions and comments; that 
time has almost run out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to tell the hon. member 
for Outremont that what the federal government will be 
transferring to the provinces in terms of block financing is a 
thinner envelope, a teeny weeny envelope.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	When I mentioned in my remarks that the federal government 
was adding insult to injury, I was referring to the fact that, 
historically, as the Prime Minister said earlier today, to have a 
say, you have to pay. Up until now, the federal government paid. 
But in the future, while withdrawing financially, thereby 
passing on to the provinces the dirty job of cutting back social 
programs, the federal government wants to continue laying 
down standards, national standards. That is the problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont, Lib.):</B> That is not true. 
Read the budget carefully. Go ahead.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> If the hon. member for 
Outremont will let me finish. Naturally, some social programs 
have to be maintained, but the problem is this: at this rate, 
certain cuts have been so poorly targeted that, if you tie program 
spending to debt charges and the debt continues to grow at the 
same rate, there will come a time, five or six years down the 
road, when program spending cuts to the tune of $75 billion will 
become necessary to match debt charges of $75 billion. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10282"> 10282 </A></B>
<P>
federal government will then be paying as much on debt service 
as on all programs provided to individuals and the  provinces. 
We will have a crisis on our hands. That is what this government 
is leading us into.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to join in the 
discussion today. For too long in Canada we have been living in 
a context which ignores the future implications of our actions. 
The government has done much more than sit back and wring its 
hands about the serious economic situation of our country.
<P>
	Canadians and the governments they elect, whether locally, 
provincially or nationally, have for a long time been well aware 
of the impact of the deficit, of how it undermines consumer 
confidence, of how it diminishes our ability to compete 
internationally, and of how it robs our children of an 
economically viable future.
<P>
	More often than not governments did not act, refused to act. 
On February 27, 1995 the government demonstrated its 
willingness to act. The government demonstrated its courage 
and commitment to make the necessary sacrifices to ensure a 
better future for Canadians. The Liberal government has 
submitted to the House a framework that will deliver back to our 
country and to its citizens the confidence and optimism needed 
to create a strong, dynamic economy, which is necessary in the 
context of market globalization.
<P>
	To listen to the members across the way we would think that 
point has been missed on them. As a member of the human 
resources development committee of Parliament I am in a 
position to say that the strong actions taken in the budget reflect 
our determination to maintain our commitment to the principles 
of the Canada Health Act and reinforce our commitment to work 
with the provinces to provide better and more affordable 
services.
<P>
	The provinces have always argued that they are closer to the 
people, that it is their constitutional prerogative to administer 
social programs in a cost effective way. The Canada social 
transfer will be negotiated by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and will allow them to do just that.
<P>
	The bottom line is that Canadians want both government 
levels to work together to manage social programs better. The 
budget continues the fundamental structural reforms needed to 
do that. If we do not act now, our social programs will not 
survive in the future. We care about our systems of health and 
education. We care about protecting seniors and the most 
vulnerable in society.
<P>
	I would like to share with the House some recent experiences 
in my riding of Etobicoke-Lakeshore. My constituency office 
receives numerous calls on a daily basis. In the recent days 
preceding the budget I received well over 800 calls from 
constituents asking me to convey their thoughts to the minister 
that personal income taxes should not be raised. This was a 
message that I as well as  other members of the House 
communicated to the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	I knew the finance committee had been around the country. 
We heard Canadians tell us what should be done. I am here to say 
that the process worked. The views of Canadians are reflected in 
the budget. I will give some instances.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	In my own riding one of my constituents, Mr. Ted Morris, 
said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Income tax remains the same, thank God. This is a budget that seems to have 
deflated indignation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Morris also brought the message of a local bank manager 
happy about the increased value of the Canadian dollar, a local 
real estate broker pleased with the national unity implications, 
and a retired department store employee wondering whether the 
provincial government would follow suit.
<P>
	To some of the residents in a popular Etobicoke donut shop 
yesterday morning there was an understanding that governments 
in the past have lived off their credit cards and that this 
government was ready to start correcting spending habits.
<P>
	I have a letter here sent today by fax from a constituent, Mr. 
Michael Kern. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am pleased that personal income taxes did not increase. For the moment I 
feel that the new gas tax is acceptable.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He went on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Over the past several days the media has been monitoring the opposition to 
the new budget. I am sure that you have seen news reports of the opposition 
parties giving their critique of the budget. However on the same news reports 
reactions from the public are usually shown. My opinion of the budget seems to 
be in line with that of the general public. We are satisfied. It seems that the only 
people upset are the opposition parties.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I can go on and refer to several other points that he said. He 
referred to the new immigration policy. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That is not bad, not as bad as groups would make it out to be.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When you join a social club you have to pay an initiation fee and I believe that 
the privilege of immigrating to Canada should be no different. The bottom line 
is this. Mr. Martin has taken the initiative to reduce the deficit, something that 
previous federal governments seemed to dance around. In addition, Mr. Martin 
has done so through sensible cutbacks and corporate taxes. I am happy to see 
that the working Canadian finally does not have to shoulder the responsibility 
alone. Mrs. Augustine, please accept my congratulations to your government on 
a practical budget that I feel we can all accept.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I am not certain what messages the Reformers get.
<P>
	Our government is committed to providing a fair and reliable 
system of protection for seniors. I know there are several seniors 
in my riding wo are watching the debate today and who are 
concerned about protection for seniors, equality, balance and all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10283"> 10283 </A></B>
<P>
the things required to ensure the pension system is sustainable in 
the long term.
<P>
	The budget states the basic principle for reform in terms of 
seniors programs is to ensure the system continues to be 
affordable and that we have some goals for changes in 1997. The 
budget states these basic principles: undiminished protection 
for all seniors who are less well off, including those receiving 
the GIS; continuing full indexation to protect seniors from 
inflation; the provision of OAS benefits on the basis of family 
income, as is now the case with the GIS; greater progressivity of 
benefits by income level; and control of program costs.
<P>
	The bottom line remains that Canada is still the best country 
in the world and remains a model for other nations. With the 
budget the government has demonstrated leadership. Canadians 
know that we will continue to benefit from a number of social 
programs that reflect our understanding of community. These 
programs are implemented in a way that permits governments to 
take into account changing times and changing needs.
<P>
	It is in the spirit of federal-provincial co-operation and to 
provide the greatest possible opportunity for our economic 
recovery that I join in the debate and support the budget.
<P>
	As someone who is an immigrant to the country, I know there 
are concerns by all who are in the process of applying for 
permanent residence. As the minister of immigration said, we 
are all in this together, those who are joining us, those who are 
here and those who want to be here.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	The fee is set out in typical Liberal fashion. As a caring and 
compassionate government we ensure that no one will be turned 
away as a result. Loan programs and other ways of assisting are 
also included in the process.
<P>
	This is an excellent budget and I call on everyone in the House 
to endorse it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the hon. member for 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore, who told us about the interesting things 
she sees in the budget. I had the opportunity to travel with the 
hon. member when the Committee on Human Resources 
Development criss-crossed the country. I would like to know if 
the hon. member is as satisfied with the measures announced in 
the budget as with the lack of certain measures.
<P>
	Was she not hoping that something would be provided for 
social housing? Indeed, it is clearly established that the best way 
to fight poverty in Canada is to provide a dwelling, at a 
reasonable cost, to people who often have to spend 40, 50 or 60 
per cent of their budget on housing, because other forms of 
assistance are inadequate. Does the member not think that the 
budget should have provided something in that regard?
<P>
	During the committee hearings held across the country, did 
the member hear anyone say that the government had to take 
$700 million out of the UI fund, as provided in the budget? Did 
anyone ever tell the committee that cuts should be made to the 
UI program? When the committee travelled to 
Rivière-du-Loup, did anyone ask that all transportation 
subsidies be eliminated immediately, that the whole economic 
structure of the region be changed without any transition period 
to adjust, and that the UI fund also be reduced, thus leading 
people to leave the region? Did the member hear any such thing 
and is she pleased with this budget as regards social housing and 
the cuts affecting the unemployment insurance fund and the 
transportation subsidies?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to recollect for my 
hon. friend our experience across the country. Over and over we 
heard the messages. Maybe we interpreted them with different 
ears. However, people told us over and over about jobs and the 
creation of jobs. They told us that the best social security for 
individuals was the ability to find work and the ability to 
provide for their families.
<P>
	It is also important to note that the individuals who spoke to 
us on a number of issues stressed quite strongly the fact that they 
wanted the involvement of the federal government. They wanted 
some principles, some national standards, and some way of 
operating that would ensure protection and security in the fact 
that the federal government would provide the necessary 
support.
<P>
	As federal legislators, the expectation from us is to ensure 
that we provide the kind of economic climate in which 
individuals will find jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Kenora-Rainy River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of one of the toughest budgets in 
Canadian history. A tough budget was needed to keep the 
country on track. It is a budget that Canadians have been calling 
on the government to table and I am proud to stand in my place 
today to support it.
<P>
	We have answered the demands of Canadians with a tough but 
fair budget. We have taken the necessary fiscal action in a 
sensitive manner that addresses the priorities of all Canadians. 
No doubt there is pain involved, but the pain does not hit like a 
sledgehammer. A sledgehammer would devastate everything 
around the target. Rather, it is like a bow and arrow. We hit the 
targets dead on without devastating everything around us.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10284"> 10284 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	This budget is the arrow that will hit our deficit target without 
destroying the foundation we have built.
<P>
	That is the difference between the budget that was tabled by 
the finance minister on Monday versus the budget we saw by the 
Reform Party the week previous. You can cut, but there are ways 
to cut. I would emphasize that this is the difference between the 
Liberal Party philosophy and the one across the way.
<P>
	The 1995-96 the federal budget has gained widespread 
support. Yes, there is opposition that this budget is too strong or 
does not go far enough or will spell the end of Canadian society 
as we know it. The answers to those criticisms are easily found.
<P>
	The budget comes down squarely at a crossroad for this 
country. It must be a strong budget as Canada meets the 
economic and fiscal challenges leading into the next century. If 
this budget went any further, slashing and burning government 
spending with reckless abandon, that is just where Canadians 
would find themselves, abandoned by their government.
<P>
	As I said before, Liberals do not abandon people. By taking 
this sensible approach to our fiscal situation, it is this 
government that will ensure social programs and basic services 
remain apart of Canadian society.
<P>
	This is a make or break budget for our deficit situation. We 
must not impede economic recovery and the potential for 
growth. By taking the steps contained in this budget, we are 
directly acting on our fiscal position so that Canada can 
maintain and not destroy the universal social programs that 
define this nation.
<P>
	This budget must satisfy demands of international markets, a 
reality of living in a global trade environment. The financial 
community quickly graded this budget with high marks.
<P>
	Interest rates have dropped and our dollar immediately 
climbed in the markets. The government did not panic. We 
listened to Canadian taxpayers, to international markets, to 
dozens and dozens of interest groups. Then we acted with 
sensible, intelligent and compassionate approaches.
<P>
	We are, as the finance ministers says, breaking the back of the 
deficit. The international community has acknowledged we are 
on the right track. Many of my constituents have told me that 
they are impressed with this budget. Canadians obviously 
approve.
<P>
	The budget takes necessary steps to secure Canada's fiscal 
position. The federal budget is just strong enough. The minister 
of finance has found the right mix of spending cuts and revenue 
measures to ensure a fiscal trend of deficit reduction.
<P>
	This budget significantly reduces government spending but is 
crafted in a way that is fair to all regions of the country. We must 
bring our finances in order. To do that Canadians everywhere 
must share, quite frankly, in the price we must pay for fiscal 
responsibility.
<P>
	I hasten to add that sharing in the cost of reducing our deficit 
will not involve paying more tax. We will meet and exceed our 
deficit reduction targets without an increase in personal taxes.
<P>
	The government has taken on the challenge of fiscal prudence 
while maintaining steady economic growth. This is not an easy 
task. Our choice is to fundamentally change the structure of 
government. Our focus is on reduced spending and a smaller, 
smarter government.
<P>
	I have been a long time supporter of our public sector service. 
The reality we face as Canadians, and one that must be shared by 
our public servants, is that government must be streamlined. 
The public sector must find a way to become more efficient. It is 
a tough assignment but I am confident that Canada's public 
servants can bring government into the next century.
<P>
	If anyone is capable of meeting that challenge, it is the men 
and women working in the public sector. These professionals are 
embarking on a difficult transition. I urge our public servants, 
many of whom I know personally, to apply their skills and to 
contribute to Canada's future.
<P>
	We all know that the public sector will lose about 45,000 
positions, but last year alone there were almost a half a million 
new jobs created in Canada. The objective of this delicate 
budget is to bring the government house in order without 
upsetting the balance of economic stimulus. A healthy economy 
will provide jobs for skilled people such as those who will be 
leaving the public service.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Government supports the creation of new jobs but it is 
business that does most of the hiring. We will realize savings 
from cutbacks in government spending but there is also 
increased revenue from newly created jobs.
<P>
	My riding is located in northwestern Ontario. It is a region of 
Canada that can be used as an example of how the budget will 
impact Canadians. Northwestern Ontario will suffer from 
spending cuts and revenue measures. We will lose forestry and 
mining developing funding shared by the federal and provincial 
governments. The decrease in dairy subsidies will affect us and 
the gasoline tax will hurt.
<P>
	I realize, as my constituents do, that we will survive. I think 
everyone of us realizes that we have to share the burden in one 
way or another. My riding has never depended on government 
for its survival. I think the majority of my constituents would 
rather see government get its act together instead of receiving a 
handout.
<P>
	Northwestern Ontario has carved an economic foundation 
from the resource sectors such as forestry, mining and tourism. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10285"> 10285 </A></B>
<P>
Comprehensive diversification of our regional economy is a 
long term goal which is progressing.
<P>
	I am encouraged that this budget, while reducing or 
eliminating subsidies, is keeping business support programs in 
place. Small business loans, export and marketplace services 
and technology support all remain a part of the federal mandate. 
We are also optimistic about the future of tourism initiatives that 
have become a federal priority.
<P>
	The relationship between small business and the banking 
sector has been a longstanding concern in my riding. When I was 
in opposition it was something we talked about on numerous 
occasions, that small business is still not getting a fair shake 
from the financial institutions in the country.
<P>
	In the budget the access to capital for the reasonable ventures 
essential to the economic growth in my region is again going to 
be a priority of the finance minister. I am still hopeful that 
sooner or later the banks in this country will realize that without 
them we cannot get this economy rolling to the extent we believe 
it can.
<P>
	Recent increases in the Small Business Loans Act are a 
positive sign. A region such as northwestern Ontario is dictated 
by unique circumstances. I also feel the privatization of crown 
corporations will be received well in this House and in the riding 
I represent.
<P>
	I chaired a government task force to study the future of the 
Canadian National Railway. The commercialization of CN is 
one of the recommendations in our final report. This action and 
other commercializations such as Petro-Canada has great 
potential for the private sector. It puts business in the hands of 
business people and leaves government with the task of 
regulating, not operating.
<P>
	The fearmongering on the issue of social programs is 
something I want touch on a little. The issue of Canada social 
transfers does not hold much water in my riding. If we changed 
the system my constituents would applaud that simply because 
they are not satisfied with the current structure of social 
programs as they exist today.
<P>
	Like many members of the House, I have conducted a survey 
on social security. The overwhelming response was that social 
policy must change. This budget sets social policy changes in 
motion and I applaud that. Once again, the government has not 
pressed the panic button.
<P>
	The other side tends to press the panic button to make people 
concerned about the fact that we are not moving quickly enough. 
Those who have been here around here a little longer will realize 
that if we take our time and put the right programs in place those 
will be the programs that will survive the test of time and they 
are the kinds of programs that built this country and made it the 
great place we live in.
<P>
	If we are to change our system we have to make sure it is a 
change for the better and not for the worse.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	This budget makes it clear that this party is responsible for 
universal social programs in Canada. It will be this party that 
brings social policy into the 21st century. Of course the only way 
we will do that is to ensure we can afford it and this budget does 
just that.
<P>
	This is a responsible budget. We are attacking the deficit but 
we are planning our attack without undue casualties. The social 
fabric of our nation will survive. We are setting a responsible 
pace of deficit reduction to preserve economic growth and 
stability.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
interested to hear the hon. member saying his constituents have 
been very pleased with the budget, especially when the Prime 
Minister and a number of other Liberal MPs have been saying 
how this is not a budget they wanted to bring in, that it is an 
anti-Liberal budget.
<P>
	I wonder if this actually means the people in central and 
eastern Canada voted Liberal because they had no other choice 
and that they actually do not want traditional Liberal budgets or 
traditional Liberal policies. Polls taken on things like justice 
and the budget show that Canadians actually want Reform style 
policies and budgets.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member whether the fact that he is getting 
compliments about the budget actually means people do not 
support Liberal policies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I have on numerous occasions in 
this place, let me make very clear to my friend across the way 
that I do not come from central Canada. I come from western 
Canada. I happen to be the member of Parliament for 
Kenora-Rainy River, which is in a vast riding in northern 
Ontario. It is on central time and is so close to Winnipeg we have 
very western ideas. The riding has been voting Liberal long 
before I was alive and, yes, there was a Reform candidate who 
ran in my riding. He was lucky to get his deposit back, the lucky 
soul that he was.
<P>
	I can assure this House that my riding, being of very western 
flavour, believing very strongly in Canada's social programs 
and fabric, would not have been voting Liberal since the turn of 
the century if it did not believe in Liberal principles.
<P>
	If this budget, as is being suggested by the member, were not a 
Liberal budget I would have heard about it first and foremost in 
my riding because my riding, as I said, only voted one other way 
in its history and that was when it lost its way in 1984 when 
everybody was foolish enough to vote Tory and it went with the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10286"> 10286 </A></B>
<P>
NDP. I can assure members that my constituents learned their 
lesson that one time and now have gone back to the Liberal fold.
<P>
	I have received five phone calls on the budget from people 
who were concerned about social programs. The remainder of 
the people in my riding have called to say this is a great budget 
because it sends us down the track. It also recognizes that we did 
not get into the mess in three years, like the Reform Party seems 
to suggest, and we will not get out of it in three years as it 
suggests.
<P>
	It took us 20 years to get into it and it will take us some time to 
get out of it. We should use our good, common sense and not tear 
and gut the heart and soul out of Canada by doing that, but take 
our time and restructure the economy the way it should be 
restructured.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
be brief. I would simply like to add to the comments of my 
eloquent colleague, who clearly, has done a fair analysis of the 
budget situation. I would like to add, on the matter of national 
standards, as I mentioned earlier, that the Minister of Finance 
created a new transfer in the budget to be called the Canada 
social transfer.
<P>
	The opposition is saying that again we are setting national 
standards for the Canada social transfer. I see nothing wrong in 
setting national standards. The problem with national 
standards-and again the opposition is trying to doctor the 
truth-is that, in the past, the standards were set unilaterally by 
the federal government. Now what we are saying, and it is in 
black and white in the budget, is that we are inviting all of the 
provinces to work together to set national standards jointly and 
in a spirit of co-operation.
<P>
	This is the new Canadian federalism, flexible federalism, 
co-operative federalism. We are not trying to hide the truth or 
use some form of trickery to take away what is in fact in the 
budget and what was requested by all of the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to quickly say to my colleague 
and to other colleagues in the House that federalism is by far one 
of the best systems in the world. There is a reason for that. The 
reason federalism works so well and why other countries wish 
they had a federal system like ours is because it is fluid. It is not 
static. The reason federalism works is its ability to be flexible.
<P>
	Anyone who has analysed where we were when we first 
became the country of Canada and where we are today with the 
changes that have taken place has found that we have been able 
to adapt to tremendous change when necessary. It is the reason 
this country has been so successful.
<P>
	If this government keeps on track the way the finance minister 
has been going, I predict as I did in the last election that by the 
end of the 1990s we will have our deficit under control. We will 
be paying off our debt. We will be back on track. We will still be 
the best country in the world. Our fiscal and monetary policy 
will be back to where it would have been had we not had that 10 
years of Tory rule which messed it all up for us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as I rise to debate this borrowing bill, I must flag a historic event 
for the House. We have finally witnessed a budget that, however 
timid, at least attempts to cut federal spending in real terms.
<P>
	It has been decades since we have seen this kind of budget and 
it marks a great victory for the Reform Party of Canada. This 
budget would have been unheard of only a few years ago. It 
indicates a stunning conversion on the part of the Liberal Party.
<P>
	I am delighted the financial markets have reacted positively 
so that things may go well for our country. Above all, I wish for 
prosperity and stability for Canada. When that happens I am 
pleased, no matter who brings down the budget.
<P>
	However, just as a leopard cannot change its spots, I cannot 
believe the Liberals have really been converted. The budget was 
an act of pure necessity, not something done out of the courage 
of their convictions. The Liberals did the bare minimum they 
could in order to avert a national financial disaster. Had he had 
his way, the Prime Minister would have increased spending and 
taxes even more than he did. He said as much on the CBC 
program ``Morningside'' yesterday.
<P>
	In this respect there is no denying that the presence of the 
Reform Party of Canada in this House is a bulwark in defence of 
the taxpayer, a stronghold of protection of the public interest. 
The Reform Party, working with Canadian taxpayers, can take 
the credit for this change in direction.
<P>
	Fifty-two members of this House put sustained pressure for a 
year and one-half on this government to reduce spending. The 
government finally responded by adopting a plank from the 
Reform Party agenda, just as it adopted the agenda of the NDP 
when that party was a factor in this House.
<P>
	Although the Liberals have formed the government, there is a 
new game in town. Today the government is forced to respond to 
the criticisms from a fiscally responsible opposition, no longer 
from the loonie left. They still form the government and they 
still have the numbers in this House to pass any laws they 
choose, but they no longer possess the moral or political 
mandate from the people to complete their leftist agenda. The 
political mandate is passing to the Reform Party of Canada. The 
Reform Party is now driving the national policy agenda. In that 
reality, I take great satisfaction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10287"> 10287 </A></B>
<P>
	There is so much more left to be done. So much of the public 
interest was ignored in this budget. The government went half 
way, but it could not bear to bring itself all the way in order 
to defend our economy, to defend our social programs and our 
future prosperity. I am truly dismayed by several aspects of this 
budget. All things politically correct were left virtually 
untouched.
<P>
	My constituents have indicated clearly, for example, that they 
want the CBC to be downsized by two-thirds. Instead, it was cut 
by 4 per cent. Through an extensive survey process my 
constituents told me that they want the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development to be substantially reduced. 
Instead, the government increased that budget by 12 per cent. 
Special interest groups are left virtually untouched. The Canada 
Council was cut by a mere 2 per cent. The National Film Board 
was cut by just 5 per cent.
<P>
	I find it disgusting that the government can go ahead and cut 
UI but not make dramatic reductions to these other agencies. 
The government has not dealt equitably with the people of 
Canada in leaving so many institutions unscathed. How can the 
Liberals start cutting our social safety nets when they refuse 
first to abolish their own gold plated MP pension plan?
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	Many budget items simply reflect the power of individual 
ministers. Why did Cape Breton Development Corporation 
receive a 69 per cent increase? The fact that it is in the riding of 
the Minister of Public Works and Government Services may 
have something to do with it. Why will CIDA be downsized by 
only 30 people? The Minister of Foreign Affairs swings a lot of 
weight in cabinet.
<P>
	As I have already stated, this budget was not about fairness. It 
is not that I am in disagreement with all of its decisions, but the 
hypocrisy of this budget makes me question everything the 
government says. This budget was all about broken promises. 
The examples are legion.
<P>
	The government promised never to change the workforce 
adjustment directive without union consent. It is breaking it. It 
promised massive changes to social programs. There are none, 
though there must now be massive changes down the road. It 
promised not to increase taxes on the middle class but it did it 
anyway. It promised to reform the GST, but the GST is 
unchanged. The Prime Minister was to repudiate the NAFTA. 
Today he praises it. He promised to increase foreign aid to .7 per 
cent of GDP. On Monday he slashed it by $500 million.
<P>
	Two years ago the Reform party proposed cutbacks in the 
public service totalling 30,000 to 35,000 employees, cutbacks 
which would have been over and done with by now. The Liberals 
called us callous and uncaring. Now they are gleefully laying off 
45,000 public servants. The Minister responsible for Public 
Service Renewal says that even more layoffs are in the works. 
That is callous and uncaring.
<P>
	Farmers will remember the broken promises. Remember how 
the Liberals would never sign the GATT without strengthening 
article XI(2)(c). They signed it anyway. Western grain farmers 
lost the Crow subsidy. They can add to that a new fuel tax and 
major cuts to farm programs in the agriculture department itself.
<P>
	This government quite happily kicked farmers in the teeth, 
but not until after it had won the election. Farmers are willing to 
do their part, but if cuts in other areas were as serious as the 
agricultural cuts, we would now have a balanced budget within 
our sights.
<P>
	My own constituency is presently facing a grave economic 
situation because of this budget. It will take a hit all out of 
proportion to its own numbers. The Hope weather station will be 
closed next month. More important, Canadian Forces Base 
Chilliwack in my riding will be closed over the next four years. 
This will mean $105 million or 7 per cent of all economic 
activity in Chilliwack will be cut out.
<P>
	Perhaps the Minister of Finance did not see the study that was 
released on Monday. It showed that in terms of regional 
distribution, British Columbia gets $700 million per year less 
than it should, given its share of the population. Again, we are 
ready and willing to make sacrifices in B.C., but why would the 
government increase the regional disparity by taking $100 
million more out of British Columbia?
<P>
	With the possible exception of Cold Lake, Alberta, there is no 
community in Canada that will suffer more from this budget 
than Chilliwack. And the Liberals call that fair? I call it 
shameful. The people of B.C. will one day pass judgment on 
Liberal policy.
<P>
	No longer will there be a land forces presence west of the 
Rocky Mountains. In the case of a natural disaster or civil 
disorder there will no longer be that natural resource that the 
people of B.C. can count on. This is short-sighted. It is bad 
policy in a civil, military and an economic sense. The third 
largest province in Canada deserves better.
<P>
	Now I must come to the bill before us. The fatal weakness of 
the budget is that this bill will work great harm in Canada. In two 
years Canada will pay $51 billion in interest alone. Program 
spending will decline to $108 billion and interest payments will 
increase to half of our program spending. That borrowing bill is 
nothing more than an enormous social program for foreign 
investors.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance decries the Reform taxpayers' 
budget, but Reform alone faces up to the truth. Because of the 
interest payments on our national debt, the frightening prospect 
of the total destruction of many of these programs is looming 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10288"> 10288 </A></B>
<P>
directly ahead. We are choking the life out of them by 
continuing to run huge budget deficits.
<P>
	After all the Liberal fanfare, the deficit is still huge. It will 
still be $25 billion two years from now. By then we could well be 
in the middle of a recession. The American economy is already 
showing signs of a slowdown. If that continues, or if it happens, 
our economy will be in a meltdown.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance criticizes Reformers for suggesting 
that we adjust social programs now while there is time. In the 
next breath the government admits it is conducting its own study 
into the pension situation. By the time it screws up its own 
courage to act, the cuts it will make to old age pensions will truly 
be devastating. They will leave seniors in real poverty.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	The Liberals can see the numbers as well as anyone. They 
know what needs to be done to protect our social programs in the 
future, but they are going to put off action because they do not 
have the guts to make the tough decisions today. In fact they will 
heap abuse on Reform suggestions, even if these suggestions are 
in the public interest, even if they are quietly undertaking to do 
exactly the same things themselves in an underhanded way.
<P>
	Last week I tabled a petition with 20,000 names, calling for no 
new taxes. In a few days I will table 13,000 more names. I 
personally delivered 2,000 letters from my constituents to the 
office of the Minister of Finance calling upon him to balance the 
budget without raising taxes. These people did not get their 
wish. Canadians wanted a timetable for a balanced budget but 
the government failed to deliver.
<P>
	There are simple tests of good government: conscientious 
control of the public purse; a strong clear vision of and 
commitment to the public interest that reaches far into the 
future; attention to regional fairness; and equitable reductions in 
government spending. I am disappointed that the government 
has failed these tests.
<P>
	This budget has failed the Canadian people. No matter how 
well it is accepted by the markets in the short term, the numbers 
predict our future in the long term. The government had a chance 
to mend our social safety net on Monday, but through Bill C-73 
it will allow interest payments to tear it to shreds over the 
coming years.
<P>
	Shame on the government that it has squirrelled away the past 
year and a half making budget balancing all that much more 
tougher than it needed to be. It is a shame it is planning to saddle 
our nation with another $90 billion in new debt, a debt which 
will be a pox on our social programs, a curse on our taxation 
levels, a drag on our job creating businesses and a millstone 
around the necks of our children and grandchildren, forever and 
ever, amen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last night I had the opportunity 
to review the base closures on television. The Chilliwack base is 
being closed which I understand is part of the member's riding.
<P>
	There is not a member of Parliament on this side of the House 
who did not feel the pain that was expressed on that show last 
night. That is why many of us on this side of the House for the 
last few months have been trying to communicate to the 
opposition, to the Reform Party that we should not just be 
talking about the federal deficit. We should be talking about the 
human deficit.
<P>
	What bothers me is that the debate has not expanded beyond 
the deficit in traditional terms. We have to figure out what we 
are going to do in the long term. Not only our country but other 
countries around the world have been faced with fluctuating 
interest rates. Capital is being pushed around by people who are 
shorting their own currencies and playing with derivatives and 
everything else. We as one nation in the G-7 are almost victims 
of this international game which is being played.
<P>
	I wish that with the Reform Party members we could expand 
this debate. Let us not just think about the budget and the tough 
decisions we have had to make on this side. Make no mistake, 
we feel the cuts on this side as much as they do. I would venture 
to say many of us feel them even more. As Liberals it goes 
against the very grain and soul that brought us to this place, 
whereas the Reformers seem to be much more conditioned to 
deep cuts regardless of the human side of it.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	Would the member be willing when we return after question 
period, along with his other colleagues, to maybe enter into a 
debate on a new and improved Bretton Woods agreement? We 
should start looking at what we can do to change interest rates, 
not just for Canada but for all the world. At the rate we are going 
it is not just Canada that is in trouble. It is the whole world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
presentation. I understand his first point about the base closures. 
I realize that base closures have affected many ridings and cross 
party lines. Some of the Bloc members have had ridings 
affected. I know many of the Liberals have had closures in their 
ridings as well.
<P>
	With the closure of CFB Chilliwack there will no longer be an 
army base in all of British Columbia. There are 12 bases in 
Canada. There is not even one in B.C. To me that is a concern. 
Emergency preparedness is a concern. Even more so, it is a 
concern that there be a national armed forces presence.
<P>
	I am concerned that people from B.C. get an opportunity to be 
trained in Quebec, as I am that Quebecers get an opportunity to 
be trained in B.C. It is just a matter of equity. I realize I am not 
singled out in one sense, and yet on the other hand it is a mistake 
in the long term not to have a land forces presence anywhere in 
British Columbia. It is short sighted. I realize I share  that hurt 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10289"> 10289 </A></B>
<P>
with many members on both sides of the House, but it is short 
sighted.
<P>
	The member talks about the cuts we want to make regardless 
of the human side. Reformers have consistently said it is 
because of the human cost that we have advocated change. It is 
no fun to be the guy who says we have to make severe cuts and 
we even have to readjust our expectations in the pension plan. 
What fun is there in that? The reality is I want to preserve the 
core of that for people who need it.
<P>
	By preserving it now in a relatively short order, we can 
preserve the parts that make Canada great. It is because of the 
human side. The last point about the Bretton Woods institution, I 
have a private member's bill on the Order Paper about the 
accountability of international financial institutions-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I regret the member's time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> It is because of the time that he took.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> With the greatest of respect to members on 
both sides of the House, the total time is five minutes and I think 
that has been fulfilled.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I look 
forward to the day when I will not have to rise to speak about a 
borrowing bill.
<P>
	Liberal members of course, have spent the last few days 
claiming that the finance minister's budget is the greatest thing 
to ever bless Canada. They claim that the world financial 
markets love it and that their constituents love it and all is well. 
In fact, I would like to thank the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood for confirming that the budget that the 
people like so well is not Liberal policy. It simply confirms that 
people do not want Liberal policies.
<P>
	Members opposite for the last two days have been claiming 
the dollar is going up and interest rates are coming down. They 
say: ``Don't worry. Be happy''. I think the decline in interest 
rates has a lot more to do with the amount of money people have 
put into GICs in the last few days for their RRSPs. It has given 
the banks a surplus of money that they have to get rid of.
<P>
	Today the dollar did not continue to go up the way members 
opposite had hoped. It continued to slump, down to 70.92 today, 
which is more than a cent and a quarter below the high the day 
after the budget.
<P>
	Perhaps this means that the international markets have had 
time to look a little more closely at the budget and they can see 
that most of the cuts are deferred until next year while all of the 
big tax increases occur this year. However, I do think we really 
have to wait a few weeks before either side decides they have the 
answer to whether the dollar is going up or down. We need to 
give the markets time to really continue to study this document.
<P>
	There are tax increases in the budget that are really going to 
hurt the average Canadian very much. Liberal MPs must be the 
only people in the country who think that a penalty tax on banks 
is not going to affect the loan rates or the service fees or 
something else that people use at banks.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	Liberal MPs must be the only people in the country who think 
that a 1 per cent increase on the surcharge tax for corporations 
will not trickle down to price increases or service charge 
increases.
<P>
	Liberal MPs must be the only people in the country who think 
that a 1.5 cent a litre increase in the tax on gasoline will not 
mean higher prices at the pumps.
<P>
	Despite all of these deceptive increases in taxes that will hit 
the average Canadian, the ship is still going down, albeit a little 
more slowly and with a few less crew on board. In three years the 
interest payments on the debt will have consumed every single 
cent the finance minister has saved in his latest budget.
<P>
	The minister was quoted in the Vancouver <I>Province</I> as saying: 
``The light at the end of the tunnel is much closer than any of us 
might think''. That light is getting larger because there is a 
locomotive bearing down on us. The finance minister may be 
going in the right direction but he is on the wrong track. 
Increased taxes will not bring confidence to the job creators of 
the country, that is businesses.
<P>
	I know members opposite think the government creates jobs 
but it is actually business that creates meaningful and real, long 
lasting jobs. If businesses do not feel good about the economy 
they will not expand and create jobs.
<P>
	Let me compare the finance minister's performance with that 
of some of the governors in the United States. A constituent in 
my riding, Mr. John Dickenson, provided me with a tape of a 
speech made by Governor Carol Whitman of the U.S.A. She is 
the governor of New Jersey.
<P>
	Governor Whitman cut business and income taxes three times 
over a two-year period, a 30 per cent cut in taxes at the same 
time as she slashed spending to comply with a balanced budget 
amendment. Opponents, for which we can read Liberals, said: 
``The sky is falling. The economy will be destroyed''. Instead, 
60,000 new private sector jobs were created by the private sector 
and tax revenues actually increased.
<P>
	The same pattern is evident in state after state. Governor Bill 
Weld of Massachusetts cut spending by $1.7 billion in his first 
month in office. He also cut taxes five times and now has the 
lowest unemployment levels in the United States.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10290"> 10290 </A></B>
<P>
	The same month that President Clinton signed the biggest tax 
increase in history for the American people, Governor John 
Ingler signed the biggest decrease in Michigan history, bringing 
the lowest unemployment rate to Michigan in 20 years.
<P>
	New Zealand has also had similar results from its program of 
massive cuts to government spending at the same time that the 
tax system was revised and taxes were reduced.
<P>
	The proof is there. Zero in three actually works. These 
examples show that the very best way to put more money into 
the hands of the poor, of families, of businesses and of everyone 
is to cut spending and taxes. Tax cuts and spending cuts make it 
easier for people to buy a home and to improve their standard of 
living. Things work better when people make their own 
spending decisions instead of having their spending decisions 
made by good, old Uncle Liberal government back here in 
Ottawa.
<P>
	There is nothing moral, compassionate or virtuous about 
increasing taxes. I will say that again in case any members 
opposite were sleeping. There is nothing compassionate, 
virtuous or moral about increasing taxes. High taxes punish 
those people who are the most productive in our society. High 
taxes are a symptom of a government's failure, incompetence 
and inability to recognize the damage that those high taxes are 
doing to society.
<P>
	Even some Liberals have come to realize something is wrong. 
They realize there is too much crime, too much family violence, 
too much poverty and too high a debt. Some are even starting to 
realize that the biggest single social program is the transfer of 
all that interest payment to the creditors of Canada's debt every 
year. That is one social program that is still growing.
<P>
	The government has not realized yet that Liberal policies have 
caused these problems and these problems will not be solved by 
throwing even more government money, especially borrowed 
money, at those problems.
<P>
	I heard another member talking about compassion earlier. 
Compassion is something one cannot buy. It is something that 
comes from within. One does not buy it by throwing dollars at a 
problem.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to change tack a little and relate a little more 
about my experience in New Zealand over the Christmas break. I 
was in New Zealand visiting relatives and I had the opportunity 
to meet for an hour and a half with the Right Hon. David Lange, 
who was Prime Minister of New Zealand at the time of the debt 
crisis in 1984.
<P>
	I would have laughed if anyone had told me a decade ago I 
would one day sit with a Labour minister of finance and actually 
enjoy speaking to him. I came away from the meeting with a 
great deal of respect for a man who has faced the debt monster, 
came to grips with it and  realized that a free market economy is 
the best way to deliver healthy social programs.
<P>
	Mr. Lange said: ``We have passed through the age of left and 
right wing governments to a time where we have maintenance 
and reforming style governments''. Those are the terms we 
should be using today. This new set of labels put into words a 
concept I have been struggling with for some time because I 
knew despite the accusations of the other side of the House, the 
Reform Party is not a crazy right wing party. We are not either 
right or left wing.
<P>
	I will use an example. The members opposite can jeer. I use 
the example of the 1992 referendum on the Charlottetown 
accord when all three traditional parties; the NDP, the PCs and 
the Liberals lined up on the yes side and Reform on the no side. 
Does that make us left or right? Which one? Neither. It made the 
three traditional old line parties maintenance style parties. They 
did not want to change the status quo. We were the reformers, 
the ones that wanted to change the status quo, make the 
necessary changes.
<P>
	Mr. Lange's Labour left wing government became a 
reforming style government when it had to face the debt 
monster. During the period following that debt crisis from 1984 
to 1994 the National and Labour parties took turns in office, but 
they were all reforming governments. They continued the 
program of government spending cuts and tax decreases to 
generate the necessary stimulus to the economy.
<P>
	Today New Zealand has a maintenance style of government, 
National by name, which has projected a $2.5 billion surplus for 
this year. Last year they had a $900 million surplus and put $800 
million more into social programs because of it.
<P>
	Mr. Lange predicts that New Zealand will have a maintenance 
style government for the next decade. Unemployment is down to 
6.5 per cent and the economy is growing at an annual rate of 6 
per cent.
<P>
	I can see the puzzled looks on the faces of the Liberals. 
``Please tell me it is not so'', they are saying. ``Please do not say 
that the private sector actually creates jobs. Please do not tell us 
it is better if government is smaller and that it makes spending 
cuts''. Mr. Lange told me that the Canadian Liberal Party is a 
maintenance style of government. It is just used to keeping 
things running when things are good and if Canada had to face 
its problems it needs a reforming style of government to do it.
<P>
	Mr. Lange also told me in retrospect he wished he had moved 
faster on the cuts because it was so stimulating to the economy. 
A decade later, New Zealand has a diversified, free market 
economy competing in the global marketplace. Exports now 
include plastic bottles to Japan; wooden boxes to the U.S.A., 
mozzarella cheese and hamburger beef to Canada; furniture to 
Singapore; metal castings to Taiwan; aircraft parts to Boeing in 
Seattle. The free market economy will solve our  problems. We 
should not be borrowing more money. We should be cutting 
spending.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty pursuant to 
Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, World Summit for Social 
Development; the hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow 
Lake, The Budget; the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, The Budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Essex-Kent, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to the comments of my colleague. I have 
heard the same comment day after day from the Reform Party 
that the Liberals are really very unrealistic about what is 
happening.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	Why did John Bulloch, president of the Canadian Federation 
of Business, state that our budget was very believable, very 
credible? Why did John Fund, who wrote a highly critical 
editorial about Canada's $540 billion debt, congratulate the 
government for being on the right course?
<P>
	Could the member please inform me why the powerful 
Canadian Manufacturers' Association called our budget the first 
very serious attempt at balancing this country's books? Why is it 
that yesterday the chartered accountants association in this 
country congratulated the Liberals and said that we scored four 
out of five on their questions? We were at the top of the list in the 
way we responded to the debt and the deficit in this country.
<P>
	The Canadian bond raters raised Canada's status. Each 
financial group, each authority on business in this country has 
come forward one after another. It is not the Liberals. They are 
not people who have been friends to the Liberals. They are 
representing very specific business and financial interests in 
this country. They applaud the steps taken by the minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate the member opposite for pointing out once again 
that a successful budget receiving praise from many areas is not 
a Liberal budget. This confirms what I have been saying time 
after time this afternoon. People wanted a budget that was not a 
Liberal budget. They were very pleasantly surprised by the 
general direction, although not quite far enough. The 
international markets seem to be telling us that.
<P>
	Everybody out there wanted a budget that was nothing like a 
Liberal budget. All the member has done is confirm yet again 
that people do not want Liberal policies. They do not want 
Liberal financial answers. They want real reforming budgets, 
reforming policies and a Reform government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
never good for me to get up to speak after I have listened to the 
nonsense and the rhetoric form the other side, particularly the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	I have sat in the House for quite a few years. I have listened to 
a lot of rhetoric in the House. The hon. member's rhetoric is 
perhaps the most unbelievable I have ever heard. He gave his 
entire speech talking about experiences in Michigan and New 
Jersey and the wonderful things that are happening everywhere 
else but in Canada.
<P>
	I want to let him know something because he obviously has 
been out of the country for quite a while. There has been a 
revolution happening in Canada. It has been a revolution the 
Liberal Party has created about putting government back where 
it belongs, serving the public, allowing the free market to 
proceed.
<P>
	Guess what? The Canadian public has looked at what we have 
done. It has not just given us a thumbs up. It has given us a 
resounding vote of confidence. Today the Angus Reid poll 
indicated the path we have taken with the recent budget is 
supported by over 70 per cent of Canadians polled. This was 
despite the doom and gloom and the nonsense the Reform Party 
spouts like a loose water cannon daily in this place.
<P>
	Those members came into this place not because the Canadian 
public wanted a Reform style of politics but, with the greatest of 
respect, they came into this place in many ridings because the 
Tories simply lost the ridings, not because anybody agreed with 
the policies they had.
<P>
	I consider myself to be a left leaning Liberal. I happen to 
believe that the New Democratic Party has a voice that 
Canadians need to have heard in debate. I look across at the Bloc 
Quebecois and I have listened to the members opposite. Other 
than the fact they are horribly misguided with respect to their 
bent on sovereignty, most of these individuals opposite are 
Liberals by philosophy. One has to listen to them. They may 
want to take their province out of Canada but they have an 
underlying concern for the individuals, for the social policy, for 
the programs of this country.
<P>
	I would not call the Reform Party left or right. That would put 
it on the continuum of common sense. It is right off the mark 
when it comes to being responsible and reflective of Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	I want to talk a bit about the budget and this borrowing 
authority. I know the member is new here but even if there were 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10292"> 10292 </A></B>
<P>
a balanced budget there is still the need for a borrowing 
authority of government. The taxes do not come in every single 
day. They come in mostly at one point in the year. The borrowing 
authority bill is a time that we can stand up in the House and talk 
a bit about the fiscal reality of Canada.
<P>
	When we took over government we took over a government 
that had lost the confidence of investors not just in Canada but 
around the world. We took over a government and an institution 
that had lost the confidence of Canadians.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said time and time again when he was on 
the campaign trail that if he did not do anything else as Prime 
Minister of this country he would put respect back into politics. 
What we say we will do, we will do. He put most of the main 
ideas in a thing called the red book. Much to the chagrin of the 
Reform Party and members opposite, almost daily there is 
another commitment in the red book fulfilled by the Prime 
Minister, the cabinet and the Liberals in this government.
<P>
	That is probably one of the reasons that Canadians, 
international investors, people who buy Canada savings bonds, 
people from all over this country and beyond finally sat up and 
said it is amazing, they can finally have a government in power 
in Ottawa that says what it means and does what it says it will do.
<P>
	Let us be realistic here. I have been here seven years. We used 
to watch and wait for the Tory finance minister to get up and it 
was like throwing darts with a blindfold on his deficit 
projections, whether they were going to hit. We wonder why the 
international community lost confidence in the Canadian dollar. 
We wonder why it lost confidence in the Canadian economy. It is 
because the previous ministers of finance who were on the right 
wing of the spectrum, the Reformers of late, could not add up.
<P>
	Every time they came in with a projection the international 
money markets and consumer confidence went right down the 
toilet. We could hear the big flush every time one of those 
budgets came in.
<P>
	Our finance minister put a budget last year and he has not only 
met the projections, and that is the first time in recent history 
that has been done, he exceeded the projections. When he 
walked in this time and put a budget forward and the Canadian 
public and the people who invest and buy our bonds in the 
international community and who invest in business in Canada 
said finally they have somebody in government who is credible. 
So did the Canadian public in the poll released today.
<P>
	I want to talk about how we have not abandoned our principles 
as Liberals. I am a Liberal. During the lead up to this debate and 
this budget I harboured grave concerns about where we were 
going as the Liberal Party.
<P>
	I am one of those individuals who believe in the principles of 
liberalism, of fairness and equity. I believe the people of this 
country have a collective right of ownership of the resource that 
is Canada. While one of the roles of government is to ensure that 
the free market system works and is attractive to people to come 
and invest, the Government of Canada has a fundamental 
responsibility to ensure that wealth is redistributed. That is 
absolute horror to the ears of the Reform Party. I believe that 
with every ounce of my being.
<P>
	When this great debate started and we had this deficit that had 
to be brought under control I thought we were going to lose our 
principles. I thought as the Liberal Party we were going to find 
ourselves following a right wing Reform-Tory agenda. We did 
not.
<P>
	I have discovered something. I discovered that we can stand 
up and defend the vehicles that deliver the programs until the 
cows come home but if the vehicles are broken they are not 
going to be able to deliver the programs. The programs are 
merely a manifestation of the principles. The principles of those 
programs, our social programs, our transfers to the provinces, 
our equalization program, EPFs and health care, unemployment 
insurance, all of those things and all of those programs that we 
provide as government are merely a way to deliver the Liberal 
principles of wealth, regeneration and redistribution, of going in 
and making sure that government has the ability to help those 
who are least able to help themselves.
<P>
	I was more than pleased when I heard the budget announced 
the other night. I was worried there would be an adverse regional 
impact. I guess once bitten twice shy. To be quite honest, last 
year I felt that the budget disproportionately hit some of the 
regions like Atlantic Canada.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	I was extremely vocal in my concerns and in my criticisms. 
Over the last 12 months we have grown as a government and we 
have learned to listen. We have had the most massive prebudget 
consultations in the history of this country. We listened, not just 
to people out on the hustings but also to people in this party and 
people in the House.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has crafted a document I did not think 
could be done. First, he has satisfied the international investor 
community that Canada is serious about its deficit and 
eventually dealing with the debt. Second, he said that we are still 
a country that believes in the greatness of the resource that is 
this nation and the rights of the individuals to have their 
government give them a hand up when necessary. Third, he 
recognized this country first and foremost is a regional country. 
The economies in this country because of our geography and our 
history are regional economies.
<P>
	The finance minister came in with a budget that did not 
disproportionately hit any part of this country, that recognizes 
that the real future of this country is getting our debt and deficit 
under control while at the same time not throwing the baby out 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10293"> 10293 </A></B>
<P>
with the bath water and wherever possible preserving those 
basic and fundamental principles of Liberalism.
<P>
	I am not happy that as a result of the burgeoning deficit some 
of our public servants who have done a tremendous service for 
Canada have had to go. The President of the Treasury Board has 
listened. He has come in with a package which is fair and in most 
cases more than reasonable. We have said to the public servants 
of Canada that times have changed. Yes, government has to do 
more with less and our priorities must shift.
<P>
	With those individuals who have helped to build this country 
and deliver the programs we are prepared to sit down and be as 
generous as we can with early retirement, early departure and 
transfers, if possible, to other programs. No, we are not perfect 
as a government and this budget is not perfect, but it is the 
closest thing to perfection in a budget that I have seen and that 
the Canadian public has seen in many years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to ask my friend, the hon. member for Dartmouth, a few 
questions. I had the opportunity to take a trip with him to Japan, 
during which we had long discussions. Despite that opportunity, 
I was still a little surprised to see that he was so proud and happy 
today, and so impressed with the Minister of Finance's budget.
<P>
	I fail to see how anyone could be proud, for example, to say 
that most of the deficit reduction measures will be achieved by 
offloading the problem onto the provinces. Responsibility for a 
large part of the federal deficit will be squarely put on the 
province's shoulders. For example, the Minister of Finance says 
that Quebec will receive almost $7 billion less from the federal 
government, which will, of course, continue to tax Quebecers as 
much as ever.
<P>
	How can he be proud to see that, in two years' time, Canada 
will have tacked on another $50 billion to its debt? How can he 
be proud of that? How can the hon. member for Dartmouth be 
proud to see that, in two years, Canada's accumulated debt will 
have climbed to $611 billion? How could we be proud of that? 
This does not make me in the least bit proud. Therefore, I would 
simply like the hon. member to answer my question.
<P>
	Instead of making fiery speeches, he may be better advised to 
come down from the clouds and realize that, in two years, 
Canada will obviously have to collect more income tax and 
impose other taxes. The country will give much less to its 
citizens, since the interest payments on the debt alone will be at 
least $50 billion. How could we possibly be proud of that?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for 
his questions. I have a great deal of respect for the work that he 
does in Parliament. We have had discussions. I think he should 
drop this bit about sovereignty because he knows that Canada is 
a great place and I know he feels that fundamentally.
<P>
	My colleague has asked me two questions. On the one hand, 
he has raised a concern about debt downloading to the 
provinces, that there are cuts in the transfers. I have to say to him 
that I am concerned about the cuts to transfers. The province of 
Quebec is much more able to withstand those types of cuts in 
transfers than places like Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and New 
Brunswick.
<P>
	In New Brunswick and Nova Scotia the provincial ministers 
of finance said the number one wish they had on their wish list 
going into this budget was not that they did not have their 
transfers cut, but that the federal government come up with a 
credible plan for getting its finances in order. If that was not 
done it would have a major negative impact on the stability of 
the dollar and interest rates. Every province in the country is 
individually financing a debt. Their number one priority was to 
have some credibility from the Minister of Finance.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	On transfers to the provinces we cut them by 4.4 per cent. That 
seems like a lot of money. It is 3 per cent of the revenue of the 
provinces. However, we cut our own programs, the ones we take 
credit or blame for, by 7.3 per cent. We cut ourselves more than 
we cut other people.
<P>
	With respect to the second question about the debt being too 
high, I agree with him 100 per cent. However, I do not agree with 
members of the Reform Party that it is a debt monster and that 
we should dance to their tune.
<P>
	We have tried to recognize that the debt is too high but that in 
order to control the debt we must control the deficit first. We are 
not prepared to sacrifice that fundamental nature of Canada to 
satisfy those on the far right, the ones who are off the mat. We 
are not prepared to go in and sacrifice ourselves to the big debt 
demon, as the former member said, by slashing programs and 
dismantling those things that are fundamental to the nature of 
the country.
<P>
	I would think the hon. member opposite in a quiet moment 
would reflect on what we have done. We have probably created 
another good argument as to why Quebecers would want to stay 
in Canada. At this point in time, for the first time I might add in a 
long time, Quebecers just like Nova Scotians have a government 
in Ottawa that says what it means and when it says something it 
does it.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, does the member who just spoke have any sense of 
embarrassment whatsoever for saying that the red book was still 
their Bible?
<P>
	I heard throughout the campaign and many times here that the 
immigration level would be 300,000 and it is 200,000; that the 
GST would be gone; that there would be a renegotiation of 
NAFTA; and there would be no cuts in social programs.
<P>
	Unfortunately I am running out of time, but the list is so 
embarrassingly large that if I had made those comments I could 
not speak for blushing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with the member that 
there are some embarrassing things going around today, the 
most embarrassing of which is the dismal performance of the 
Reform Party's response to the budget that has resulted in its 
popularity in the country going right down the you know what, 
Mr. Speaker. We can hear it flushing.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the debate and have come to one 
conclusion, that Liberals are the only Tories left in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This budget represents a profound change in Canada's basic 
structures and a total break with the principles that built this 
country. At issue here is much more than just a simple budget. 
This is about the kind of country we want to leave to our 
children. It is about the very essence of our national identity. 
The Liberal government has just set the parameters of policies 
that will take us into the 21st century, not as a strong and united 
Canada but as a fragmented Canada.
<P>
	The Liberals maintain that we have no choice and that there is 
only one way to reduce the deficit. The New Democratic Party 
agrees that debts and deficits are unacceptable and that we 
cannot continue to live on credit, but we absolutely disagree that 
this is the way to do it. The Liberals are wrong. There is an 
alternative.
<P>
	There are two ways to reduce the deficit: one way is to make 
decisions collectively, and the other way is to turn the regions, 
social groups and interest groups in this country into rivals, all 
competing for the same dollar.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The budget is not straight from the heart. The budget is 
straight through the heart of the future of the country that I 
believe the majority of Canadians thought they were going to get 
when they voted for the government.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	The minister has said that this is a tough budget. However, it 
is much more than that. It fundamentally breaks the social 
consensus that has been built up over a number of years, often 
through vigorous debate, to build a country based on 
bilingualism, multiculturalism and a sense of community that 
by working together we will accomplish more for each 
individual.
<P>
	Many parts of the budget will not be felt by Canadians for one 
or two years down the road. There is no question that the 
government has turned its back on much of the Liberal tradition. 
In a year or two Canadians will be asking what it means to be a 
Canadian. We should all be concerned about whether we will be 
citizens of a country or simply citizens of one region or another?
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, there is no disagreement about the 
need to address the debt and deficit. We do not see any serious 
attempt to deal with the inequities in the tax system. There is 
some work around the fringes, but there could be much more 
fundamental work done in the budget.
<P>
	On the day after the budget individuals earning $100,000 with 
a nice subsidized box at the SkyDome and who eat in expensive 
restaurants were happy because their lives were not touched at 
all. However there was great cause for concern by senior 
citizens, single mothers and young people.
<P>
	A country is more than a bond market or more than just how 
the economy functions, although that is obviously important. It 
is about how the economy functions for the people. I want to 
address very briefly in the time I have several ways in which I 
feel the budget has made us a lesser nation.
<P>
	How ironic it is that just two weeks ago we celebrated the 30th 
anniversary of the Canadian flag. The question people might be 
asking two years from now is: What kind of Canada will that flag 
fly over?
<P>
	Several aspects of the budget have fundamentally changed the 
social consensus I spoke of earlier. One is the issue of 
globalization. Globalization is not just economic. It is about 
Canada's role as an international citizen. It is about the common 
security between other countries and ours. In many ways the 
budget largely turns its back on the poor of the world.
<P>
	A very important part of any country is freedom. I ask my 
friends on the other side whether they can truly say that the 
budget has given more freedom to Canadians. Certainly a 
mother living in poverty has no freedom. An elderly person who 
cannot get adequate health care has no freedom. A young person 
who cannot attend college, university or technical school has no 
freedom. The budget limits freedoms and the potential of 
citizenship for many groups. Also the budget limits the freedom 
of such fundamentals as collective bargaining by breaking 
collective bargaining with the public servants.
<P>
	The budget does not mention poverty, job creation or youth. It 
is important to point out that unemployment is not free. It costs 
the country approximately $42 billion a year in direct payouts. If 
the government would have set a target to reduce unemployment 
by 1 per cent, $5.16 billion would have been added to the tax 
<P>

<B><A NAME="10295"> 10295 </A></B>
<P>
revenue and social spending would have been reduced by $1.24 
billion. There is another way.
<P>
	Turning to other areas, the government has completely 
abandoned child care and universality. Independence for the 
elderly as a principle has also been abandoned, as the previous 
member spoke about.
<P>
	Community and regional fairness is another hallmark of what 
it is to be a country. The flag is not just fabric. It is what we 
weave together. It is how we make sure that a Canadian standard 
of service will be available in Newfoundland, Yukon or central 
Canada. There is no question that as the government has 
proposed block funding this is gone.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	Sustainability of the environment is a very important area. 
Cutbacks to the environment are quite severe in the budget. I 
think they should be of concern to every Canadian. If we look at 
countries internationally, for example east bloc countries that 
ignored the environment to build their economies, we see that 
they are paying a dreadful price.
<P>
	Similarly part of the social consensus of Canada has been that 
we are a country that respects human rights, the dignity of 
individuals and gender equality. It takes much more than words 
to achieve that.
<P>
	In the abandoning of national standards and in the abandoning 
of a national vision the Liberal government is abandoning us to a 
balkanized and regionalized country, which will not stand us in 
good stead in international markets, as we discussed earlier.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Aspects that until now were considered essential to our 
society are no longer important. Children will not enjoy what we 
considered to be fundamental principles: they will have no 
national medicare, they will have no national railway linking 
communities across the country. Healthy and vigorous rural 
communities will be a thing of the past. They will not know what 
it is like to have good public services and a government for all 
Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In summary, the budget has failed the country. It is beginning 
to dismantle much of what was done to make the country first in 
the assessment of the United Nations or one of the best places in 
the world to live.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I hope my colleague from Yukon will agree that the 
budget is doing something unusual by proposing cuts to special 
interest groups.
<P>
	One such special interest group that may be subject to cuts is 
the Canadian Labour Congress, which we learned this past week 
is supporting the Quebec Federation of Labour in its campaign 
to support the separatist cause in Quebec. Some of the money the 
Quebec Federation of Labour is using is money that comes from 
the Canadian Labour Congress. It was about $500,000 and in 
turn came from Ottawa and the labour education program that 
pays the CLC $3 million a year.
<P>
	In the past the CLC has spent $1.5 million on supporting the 
NDP's election campaign, the biggest donor of any political 
party in the country.
<P>
	Does my colleague from Yukon feel that cutting special 
interest groups with a political agenda not in keeping with the 
majority of the Canadian public is a good thing or a bad thing?
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member opposite has 
been strongly speaking out against what he calls special interest 
groups. I am not clear whether the member has been equally as 
strong in including in special interest groups the Business 
Council on National Issues, the Canadian Chamber of 
Commerce and the Canadian Manufacturers Association. If he 
has, he will have done a service.
<P>
	I object to his term special interest groups. It has now become 
a Reform Party slogan. Often it is used to marginalize people 
rather than to include them.
<P>
	There is a place in a thriving democracy for different points of 
view to be presented vigorously. As a good Liberal I am sure he 
would agree that it is necessary to have a functioning democracy 
in which every part of society has the ability to participate in 
helping to shape public policy not just during an election but 
throughout.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.30 p.m., the 
House will now proceed to the consideration of Private 
Members' Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

	The House resumed from November 24, 1994, consideration 
of the motion that Bill C-262, an act to provide for the 
settlement of labour disputes affecting the export of grain by 
arbitration and to amend the Public Service Staff Relations Act 
in consequence thereof, be read a second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to take part in the 
debate on this bill to providing for the settlement of labour 
disputes affecting the export of grain by arbitration and amend 
the Public Service Staff Relations Act in consequence thereof.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10296"> 10296 </A></B>
<P>
	First of all, I think it is important to ask ourselves if this bill 
is beneficial to Canada. Is it worthwhile? Will it improve labour 
relations in this industry which is vital to Western Canada's 
economy and that of Canada as a whole?
<P>
	We, in the Bloc Quebecois, do not think so. We think that 
imposing arbitration will only make the conduct of collective 
bargaining more complicated in an industry that had bad 
experiences in the past. Let us bear in mind that this Parliament 
has already had to bring in special legislation to impose the 
terms of the final offer to settle labour disputes in this industry 
and there has been no significant change since. The climate has 
remained tense and continued to deteriorate for several years, 
precluding any compromise solution where both sides come to 
an agreement, which is the ultimate goal of the bargaining 
process.
<P>
	This bill also contains ambiguous provisions. For example, 
clause 3 reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-no trade union of employees shall declare or authorize a strike, and no 
employer of such employees shall declare or cause a lockout, if the strike or 
lockout would cause cessation of work by any employee whose work is essential 
to any stage of the progress of grain from the premises of the producer of the 
grain to export.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This wording is rather vague. It could be open to 
interpretation as to who these employees are and whether or not 
their work is performed at any stage of the progress of grain 
from the premises to export. So, in our sense, such ambiguity is 
dangerous and could make labour relations more difficult 
instead of making them easier.
<P>
	The second point I want to make concerns compulsory 
arbitration. A typical example people hear about every day is the 
situation in professional sports. Police forces in Quebec have 
used the procedure as well. It seems that repeated use of this 
procedure does not improve labour relations, which tend to 
deteriorate. There is also a tendency to avoid putting all one's 
cards on the table, which one should normally do when two 
parties negotiate, in order to reach an acceptable settlement.
<P>
	Compulsory arbitration tends to make the parties reason along 
the following lines: I am not going to show my hand right away, 
because if I do, when we go to arbitration, the arbitrator will 
make even more concessions to the other party and I will be the 
loser in this process.
<P>
	Compulsory arbitration does not seem to offer any advantages 
for either party and does not seem to be a satisfactory way to 
solve these problems.
<P>
	From past experience, and I speak as a former director of 
personnel in an educational institution, I would say that 
prohibiting strikes offers no guarantee that people will not walk 
out just the same. In this field, for a law to be successfully 
enforced, justice must be done and must appear to have been 
done.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	The mere fact of imposing arbitration and prohibiting strikes 
will not work if there is a major stumbling block for the workers 
or the employer. The employer insist on imposing a lockout or a 
virtual lockout, or the employees may decide to walk out just the 
same, which puts them in an illegal position. While in a normal 
bargaining process they would not have that problem and it 
would simply be a matter of letting the market decide. We must 
realize that sometimes good intentions do not achieve the 
expected results.
<P>
	We must also find ways to avoid a decline in productivity. My 
point is, that by prohibiting legal strikes, we may encourage 
behaviour that is even more damaging and that without 
necessarily leading to a work stoppage, will be detrimental to 
production and create a conflict situation in the workplace, 
which is tantamount to giving the parties a kind of leverage that 
goes well beyond what is traditionally provided in the 
legislation.
<P>
	The last back-to-work legislation passed by Parliament, in 
the case of the Port of Vancouver, is a good example. Wages 
were the only item that remained to be settled, but the parties 
could not agree. When the final offer was put on the table, both 
parties refused to budge. In this particular case, the employer's 
offer was accepted, but it could have been the other way around. 
There have been such cases in other sectors. If the union's offer 
were accepted because it was reasonable, theoretically 
speaking, it would not necessarily suit the employer and could 
interfere with efficient operations, so that the result could be 
damaging both to the company and the employer.
<P>
	So these are also things we must consider, and we should 
realize that, with all our good intentions about settling disputes 
through arbitration, we may be creating situations that are far 
more complex. The bill before the House today is an example of 
the kind of well-intentioned approach that will fail to achieve 
what we ultimately want, which is better relations in the 
workplace.
<P>
	Compulsory arbitration also takes away any interest the 
parties may have in negotiating, in finding compromises 
together. A period of negotiations between an employer and a 
union also includes periods of exploring solutions, which are not 
formal bargaining sessions but rather periods of exploring how 
solutions may be reached. Compulsory arbitration will stymie 
this exploration, because both parties will refrain from putting 
interesting solution proposals on the table, discussions will be 
formalized. In the end, people will be more dissatisfied than if 
they had been able to take the negotiations to their conclusion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10297"> 10297 </A></B>
<P>
	We therefore need to create a different climate in this 
industry, a climate in which labour relations will lead to much 
more interesting results. An example of this is what happens 
in Canada's major ports. Labour relations there have often been 
difficult. In the smaller ports, however, agreements are reached 
because the parties talk to each other and succeed in reaching 
interesting conclusions.
<P>
	This House must therefore reject this bill, not because of its 
intent, but because of the terms proposed in it, which will not 
improve the situation and which, before long, will require us to 
reconsider this sort of situation. In conclusion, I will describe 
the situation with the police force in Quebec, as one example. 
Compulsory arbitration was commonplace; decisions were 
made. In the end, the solutions did not permit the employer to 
assume its obligations satisfactorily. The reverse could have 
been true as well, with union members finding themselves in an 
unacceptable situation.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is therefore opposed on the principle that 
the parties' right to negotiate must be respected. There is also a 
concern for pragmatism and for reaching solutions that lead to 
joint agreements. When the parties have a signed collective 
agreement, the parties must bear in mind, during the life of the 
agreement, that they agreed to the solution reached by both of 
them. When there is compulsory arbitration, however, one of the 
parties wins and the other loses. Labour relations between 
winners and losers is not the way to the future. Rather, we must 
make the parties face their responsibilities squarely and really 
oblige them to negotiate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of the constituents of Hamilton West, I have the privilege 
to speak to Bill C-262, the grain export protection act 
introduced by the member for Lethbridge.
<P>
	This bill seeks to make it illegal for anyone, employee or 
employer, to cause any cessation of work at any stage of the 
progress of grain from the premises of the producer of the grain 
all the way to export. It should be obvious that this bill would 
affect a large number of Canadians, indeed everybody who 
comes near grain, from the farmer who grows the grain to those 
on the trains and ships which carry the grain.
<P>
	At this time I want to focus on one particular aspect of this bill 
and what it brings to the labour relations atmosphere with the 
government's own employees. That is the provision in this bill 
which would amend the Public Service Staff Relations Act by 
adding new criteria limiting the right to strike.
<P>
	This bill seeks to add to the Public Service Staff Relations Act 
in section 2 and section 78(1) words which would have the effect 
of prohibiting employees from engaging in any strike activity in 
areas related to the orderly progress of grain from the premises 
of the producer of the grain to export.
<P>
	When the Public Service Staff Relations Act was introduced 
almost 30 years ago, the legislators included a unique concept to 
labour legislation. That was the notion of designating 
employees as essential and denying them the right to strike. That 
is to say that employees whose duties included functions which 
were performed in the interests of the safety and/or security of 
the Canadian public could not engage in a strike. If one was to 
search the Canada Labour Code or other labour codes, one 
would not find many examples of such a concept.
<P>
	In my opinion this is a good, reasonable and justifiable 
concept. Employees of the federal government and numerous 
other federal institutions should not be in a position to withdraw 
services which would cause harm to the safety or security of 
Canadians. This provision has stood the test of time.
<P>
	When public servants engage in a strike activity a number of 
their colleagues continue to work and provide essential services 
to the public. The last public service strike provided us with 
many examples of this particular provision.
<P>
	Both air and marine search and rescue operations continued. 
Ice breaking continued. Mariners' charts and maps continued to 
be produced and updated. The all important function of 
providing notices to shipping carried on. As well, fisheries 
patrols were maintained and employees involved in this 
function continued to provide a service to the public.
<P>
	Air operations continued and airport facilities were 
maintained. Weather observations continued. Forecasts were 
prepared and communicated to the users and of great comfort, 
notification bulletins affecting aviation safety continued to be 
produced and disseminated.
<P>
	Naturally, prison guards and correctional services are deemed 
as essential services and continued to perform their tasks. All 
those employees, including those who provide care and security 
for inmates, medical care, food, heating and all those functions 
necessary to maintain the system continued to perform their 
duties.
<P>
	Health care was maintained by designated employees in such 
areas as poison control, hazardous product identification, 
medical support at federal hospitals, ambulance drivers, and 
dental and chronic care in isolated areas. Also designated were 
some employees who were involved in research related to health 
care which used laboratory animals.
<P>
	Essential to Canadians, income security programs such as UI, 
family allowance and the Canada pension plan continued. This 
included the processing of new claims as well as the issuance of 
benefits.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10298"> 10298 </A></B>
<P>
	Employees involved in customs and immigration control 
remained on the job. Included among these essential jobs were 
employees responsible for the primary inspection of meat and 
fish products imported to this country.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, the provisions of the Public Service Staff 
Relations Act also precluded those involved with national 
security from striking. Included among those were the civilian 
federal employees who provide support to RCMP operations.
<P>
	Of interest to my colleagues in this place, parliamentary 
operations were designated as an essential service. <I>Hansard</I> 
continued to be printed, along with committee reports and other 
parliamentary publications. Simultaneous translation services 
also continued to be offered.
<P>
	These are some examples of the services considered as 
essential for the safety and security of the public and for which 
the public service employees could not withdraw services. The 
central theme throughout this list is: These services are essential 
for the safety and security of the Canadian public.
<P>
	It is evident that the current provisions of the Public Service 
Staff Relations Act have by and large served the Canadian public 
well. By tinkering with these provisions and including the 
notion of economic hardship in the grain industry, are we trying 
to fix what ain't broke?
<P>
	It is an unfortunate but accepted reality that strikes will cause 
inconvenience and maybe even economic hardship to some. 
However, if we are to accept that employees have the right to 
strike to put pressure on the employer, then we must accept the 
results. If it is our view that strikes should not cause hardship to 
anyone, then it is my suggestion that all strikes be declared 
illegal.
<P>
	This bill starts along that road. It is headed in a direction that 
can only bring grief to employer-employee relations in this 
country. I would not argue that the movement of grain is not 
important to Canadians. Obviously it is, but I do not believe the 
production or movement of grain is essential for the safety or 
security of the public.
<P>
	The movement of grain is, like other commercial activities, 
an important economic activity in this country. If we were to 
introduce the idea that there can be no strikes or lockouts in the 
grain industry, which sector would be next? Would it be the auto 
industry? The shipping industry? How about forestry services? 
In a certain section of the country, ore production is extremely 
important. Should we consider banning work stoppages there 
too?
<P>
	If we are able to use economic criteria, I am confident that 
every member of this House could cite an enterprise worthy of 
consideration for a bill such as this. I would like to remind 
members that in many jurisdictions police services are given the 
opportunity to withdraw from their  jobs. Medical practitioners 
and teachers also have this ability.
<P>
	As I mentioned, if we accept that employees have the right to 
strike and to exert pressure on their employer, then they must be 
permitted to do so. The introduction of a provision in the Public 
Service Staff Relations Act prohibiting strikes in any one 
specific area, be it grain handling or some other industry, begins 
to erode this right. Employees either have the right to strike or 
they do not. The provision restricting the right to strike in the 
federal public service to those performing services essential for 
the safety and security of the public is a restriction, but I think it 
can be reasonably argued.
<P>
	In addition, this provision has been in place for almost 30 
years and still allows the public service employees to withdraw 
services. As we saw during the last public service strike, 
employees still have the ability to exert considerable pressure 
on the employer.
<P>
	Times, they are achanging. We have to roll with change. I do 
not feel the way to begin a positive and co-operative renewal of 
labour relations is by introducing legislation which begins to 
erode what labour considers a basic right. If we are going to give 
labour the right to withdraw services in order to exert pressure in 
collective bargaining, then we must allow this withdrawal of 
service to have some effect.
<P>
	I am sure the member for Lethbridge did not intend anything 
sinister but was simply advancing a proposal that would protect 
the interests of the grain industry. While the reasons for desiring 
protection from strikes or lockouts are noble in themselves, we 
must look at how we propose to do this and the results such a 
proposal would bring.
<P>
	While I agree with the member that the grain industry is an 
important aspect of this country, as many other industries are, I 
cannot accept the notion that Parliament legislates protection at 
the expense of the rights of other Canadian citizens. Despite 
what I believe are good intentions, the results would be 
inappropriate and I cannot support this bill.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to rise today and support Bill C-262. 
In the course of my speech I will probably deal with some of the 
things mentioned by the member for Hamilton West.
<P>
	Going back to the speech by the Bloc Quebecois member, it 
seemed by the way he spoke that he misunderstood the 
difference between basic arbitration and being legislated back to 
work, and having compulsory arbitration and the concept of 
final offer selection arbitration.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10299"> 10299 </A></B>
<P>
	I am surprised the member for Hamilton West so eloquently 
spoke against this issue, because the Liberal Party imposed this 
on a strike last year in the Vancouver docks. I am speaking in 
favour of this type of settlement, but I first want to explain 
where the Liberal government made two mistakes in the way 
it did it.
<P>
	First, the government waited until there was already 
significant hardship being imposed, not just on a few people and 
a few on the sidelines who were involved in the strike, but on the 
whole economic well-being of Canada. Something that started 
in the port of Vancouver spread across to farmers on the prairies. 
It almost shut down mills in the interior of British Columbia that 
were on the edge. It affected hundreds of thousands of people. It 
is something we have to examine and decide whether there is a 
better way. As I said, the first problem was that the government 
took so long to do something about it.
<P>
	The second mistake is that the employer and employees in 
that strike situation negotiated. They then took their strike 
option and were still considerably far apart.
<P>
	If we are to impose a change of rules, we should give the 
people an opportunity to readjust to the new rules. The game was 
changed in midstream. The parties were not given the time to go 
back to the table to try and resolve it, to see if they could work 
together more closely.
<P>
	That is what final offer selection arbitration is inclined to do. 
It is not a matter of picking and choosing a piece of this or a 
piece of that when arbitrating a settlement. The way this works 
is that the final offer is laid on the table by both sides and the 
arbitrator then picks either one side or the other. In labour 
negotiations this tends to move the two sides very close 
together. This is because if one makes an outlandish proposal 
and the other is being reasonable, the reasonable side's offer will 
be accepted virtually every time.
<P>
	I suggest we look at this in terms of protecting the grain 
industry in Canada. As the member for Hamilton West said, by 
all means we should start looking at it in a broader sense.
<P>
	For example, consider that a house is burning down. A 
fireman stands by on the sidewalk watching the house burn, 
perhaps while a young child is inside. He does so because the 
fire department is on strike. All of us accept that as being 
absolutely unthinkable. So does the fire department and it 
accepts this kind of responsibility.
<P>
	Can we accept the concept of a police officer standing by 
watching someone get mugged or raped because the police 
department was on strike? We cannot accept this either.
<P>
	However let us go to the other end of the scale to a small 
business with little impact on the community and no impact on 
the national economy. In that situation we say it is okay for it to 
be a battle of wills and an economic situation for the two forces 
at work there. We will let the employer or the employee, 
depending on who comes out the victor, use their position of 
relative unimportance to  negotiate a higher wage or to force the 
employee to take a lower wage.
<P>
	The difference between the two is the degree of importance. 
We are saying that if you are important, we will not let you have 
the same rights as people who are unimportant. Not only for the 
sake of the grain industry, I suggest it is time we actually started 
to look at the whole concept of how we settle labour negotiations 
in this country.
<P>
	Unlike what the Bloc member said, this is not an unfair type of 
action that will cause the relationships between employers and 
employees to deteriorate. If anything, it may turn it the other 
way and cause them to negotiate in much better faith and try to 
resolve the differences between them.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	Employees will not be asking for a 100 per cent raise and the 
employer saying he wants them to take a 50 per cent cut. They 
are going to try to move to the most reasonable position 
possible, so that if it comes down to this final offer selection 
arbitration they are going to have a fairly reasonable offer on the 
table in the hopes it will be selected. If they are unreasonable, 
they are likely going to lose. That is the whole concept of this.
<P>
	The member for Hamilton West talked about how the Public 
Service Staff Relations Act works. Let me give an example of 
how it works.
<P>
	The air traffic control system in this country is not designated 
as an essential service. The air traffic control system has the 
right to go on strike, but if it does, it shuts down the entire air 
industry in Canada.
<P>
	The government instead said it had the right to go on strike, 
but in the event of a strike the government has the right to 
designate a number of employees to maintain the essential 
service within the air traffic control system. The controllers said 
they certainly wanted to maintain the safety of this country, 
hospital flights, food flights to the north, emergencies and these 
types of things. They would deal with these, and so they said 
they had no problem with this concept of designating 
employees.
<P>
	Then the government turned around and designated every 
single employee in the air traffic control system and said that the 
essential duties were everything that they did. It went to court 
and the court upheld it. A wonderful system. Now the air traffic 
controllers can go on strike, which means their contract is no 
longer valid. The government can pay them anything they want 
to and they still have to report for duty.
<P>
	We have to find another system. Without getting into the 
budget argument right now, we are in a very fragile situation 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10300"> 10300 </A></B>
<P>
economically speaking and we cannot shut the industry of this 
country down. In the event of strikes, who loses?
<P>
	The public loses. They are the number one loser. The second 
loser is usually labour. No matter what kind of settlement they 
get, if they are off work for any period of time they are likely not 
going to make that wage back up. The problem is they have to 
have some kind of hammer to use as a threat if everything else 
fails. The majority of the negotiations end up with settlement, 
but when they do not they always have to have that hammer.
<P>
	We have to invent a new type of hammer, one that is fair for 
labour and one that is fair for management. We need some 
system that says you must move your negotiations very close 
together or chances are you are going to be the loser in this 
negotiation.
<P>
	This is a step in the right direction, examining it in the case of 
the grain. We do not want to come at this all at once as a total 
revolutionary system for this country. This is a good place to 
start. This is a good place to work some of the bugs out of the 
system.
<P>
	We do have to look for alternatives. Strikes are something that 
went on in the 1800s. Surely we have to evolve from something 
that maybe worked last century. We are about to go into the next 
one. Maybe we need to find new solutions for this country. This 
is a system that can work, that the unions will look at and I 
believe they will accept. The primary objector is going to be one 
or two people at the very top. I believe the worker in Canada will 
benefit rather than lose from this type of legislation.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have this opportunity to participate in the debate on 
second reading of the bill proposed by the hon. member for 
Lethbridge.
<P>
	The proposed legislation, Bill C-262, would seek to ban work 
stoppages involving the movement of grain from producer to 
export and to provide for arbitrated settlement in those cases 
where parties involved in the grain handling and transportation 
industry were unable to resolve contract differences.
<P>
	On the surface one cannot argue against the general object of 
the bill, that is, to keep Canadian export grain flowing smoothly 
to overseas markets and not to be stalled or halted by labour 
dispute. Unfortunately, while my honourable colleague and I 
share a particular desire to see Canada's reputation as a reliable 
exporter of grain maintained, we are obviously in disagreement 
as to how that end is achieved.
<P>
	The banning of legal strikes and/or lockouts and the 
imposition of arbitrated settlements are measures which only 
serve to exasperate labour management relations. It will do little 
to bring long term solutions to problems which we are 
attempting to address.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to share with hon. members a unique initiative 
currently under way in the western grain storage and handling 
industry, one which exemplifies the type of positive and forward 
thinking which labour and management are capable of applying 
to human resource issues in the industry.
<P>
	Following three significant work stoppages in the grain 
handling and transportation sector, in the fall of 1991 a dialogue 
was initiated with industry representatives to review the need 
for improvement in labour-management relations and to 
consider ways of minimizing disruptions to the movement of 
grain to export markets. Discussions with the parties led to the 
conclusion that there was little in the way of support for 
essential service legislation governing dispute resolution in the 
grain handling industry. Any system of partial designation 
would be cumbersome to administer and likely to lead to 
interminable disputes. A complete prohibition on work 
stoppages would involve third party determination of contract 
impasses and effectively remove control of the process from 
both sides of the industry.
<P>
	There were two key problems which were identified during 
discussions with the parties involved in the grain handling 
industry. First, there was the expectation that government would 
intervene rapidly to terminate any work stoppages, thus 
enabling one or both parties to avoid its responsibilities for 
settlement. Second, there existed a problem of inadequate 
communications between the parties at appropriate times and 
levels during the period between bargaining rounds on the 
longer term issues which, if left unaddressed, might rebound 
negatively at the bargaining table.
<P>
	Hon. members will be encouraged to hear that both labour and 
management expressed agreement on the utility of exploring 
ways to improve their dialogue and to ensure the future 
competitiveness of the industry in their own mutual interest, as 
well as in the interest of the Canadian farmers and the Canadian 
economy.
<P>
	At a subsequent labour-management conference for officials 
of the western grain elevator industry agreement was reached on 
pursuing the possible establishment of a sectoral council on the 
industry. A working group with equal representation from 
labour and management chaired by a neutral government 
official was established to discuss the possible format in terms 
of reference for a human resources study which could eventually 
lead to the establishment of such a sectoral body.
<P>
	The working group held a series of meetings over the course 
of the next year which culminated in the submission of an 
application to the sector studies directorate of the former 
Employment and Immigration Canada for assistance in carrying 
out a human resource issue study of the industry. Approval for 
the study was received and the firm of Deloitte &amp; Touche was 
chosen by the working group to carry out the industry study.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10301"> 10301 </A></B>
<P>
	Following an initial meeting between the consulting firm and 
a larger steering committee, representing not only management 
and labour interests but various agencies concerned with grain 
handling and transportation, the study was initiated. The 
process consisted of several phases ranging from employee 
questionnaires and focus groups through to the establishment 
of surveys and interviews with senior human resource 
personnel. The study focused on the educational and skill 
requirements of the industry and the training and reskilling 
available to meet such needs. It also looked at various methods 
of dealing with workforce adjustment within the industry and 
drew on the industry knowledge of the respondents to assist in 
predicting industry trends of the future.
<P>
	During the course of the consultants' work there were regular 
meetings with the steering committee to ensure that the study 
was following the direction intended and that the methodology 
agreed to was being followed. The study has been finalized and 
will now be turned over to the original working group for 
consideration and action, including the possible establishment 
of a sectoral council for the grain storage and handling industry.
<P>
	This initiative, involving both labour and management in the 
grain handling industry, is but one example of the co-operative 
approach which is being pursued by industry participants to 
meet the challenges they are facing. The fact that the two sides 
have met and constructively reviewed major human resource 
issues speaks volumes. Hon. members on both sides of the 
House should welcome this display of co-operation which we 
naturally hope will translate into improved labour relations 
within the industry.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	Both the Ministers of Human Resources Development and 
Agriculture and Agri-Food should be commended for ensuring 
that labour has had an opportunity to play a significant role in 
respect of department initiatives. The Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food has ensured that the representatives of unions 
involved in the grain handling and transportation system are 
active participants in this May 16 group which meets regularly 
to ensure that Canada's export grain commitments are being met 
and that the system is functioning well.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development, in addition 
to the support shown for the possibility of a sectoral initiative in 
the western grain elevator industry, has encouraged ongoing 
consultation with labour unions and employers in the federal 
jurisdiction concerning possible amendments to the Canada 
Labour Code.
<P>
	Earlier this year when a work stoppage involving 
longshoremen at the west coast ports threatened this country's 
reputation as a reliable exporter of grain and other commodities, 
the Minister of Human Resources Development introduced 
legislation to bring about an end to the disruption and provide 
for a final settlement of issues separating the two sides. While 
not a popular  measure, the bill introduced by the minister 
demonstrated the government's commitment to ensuring the 
well-being of western Canada's agricultural economy.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would simply suggest that the measures 
contained in the bill before us are inappropriate and do not 
reflect current reality in the grain handling industry. Removing 
the collective bargaining rights of workers and replacing them 
with imposed arbitration will do nothing to further the positive 
thrust of the initiatives mentioned earlier.
<P>
	This government is a strong supporter of free collective 
bargaining but recognizes that there are occasions when lengthy 
work stoppage in the grain handling industry could pose 
significant economic losses for the agricultural economy, as was 
the case in the recent longshoring dispute. In such cases the 
government is prepared to intervene in disputes and ensure the 
resumption of operations and the settlement of the dispute. This 
type of commitment should preclude the need for the measures 
proposed in Bill C-262.
<P>
	I would therefore urge all hon. members not to support the 
proposed legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to say that I do support the private member's bill C-262 
because I think there has come a time for real action in the 
labour management disputes that we have seen in the handling 
of grain for export markets.
<P>
	To think that since 1966 the government has had to legislate 
these workers back to work tells us that the current system is not 
working. As much as the previous speaker would tell us that they 
do not want to deny anybody the right to collective bargaining, 
the point is that we want to enforce and give some motivation for 
management and labour to arrive at a negotiated settlement 
within the collective bargaining process. This whole bill is 
designed to give that a whole push forward. It is to say that if one 
does not bargain within the collective bargaining system then 
one may not enjoy the rules imposed by the arbitration process.
<P>
	What we are talking about here is a simple dispute settlement 
mechanism. Right now when the two sides cannot agree they 
appoint an arbitrator. He then sits down, looks at the one side, 
looks at the other side, sees what is being offered and makes 
some kind of reasonable determination somewhere between 
these two sides. It fosters a desire by one side or both to make 
exorbitant demands or to deny reasonable demands. The 
arbitrator then has to choose and make a settlement.
<P>
	If they cannot come to some conclusion within the negotiation 
process that is free and open, if they agree not to agree, then this 
bill will require that each put forth their final proposal. 
Whatever that is they will put forth a final proposal, free, open, 
entirely their own.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10302"> 10302 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	The arbitrator will pick one or the other with the intention that 
he would pick the one that is most reasonable. It is an incentive 
to both sides to be very reasonable in their final offer. The 
arbitrator will pick the one that is most reasonable. Therefore 
the desire to be as close as possible to reasonableness only 
makes simple common sense.
<P>
	That is why when I hear the speeches from the other side, from 
the government side, the side that runs this country, saying this 
bill is going to deny free and open collective bargaining I am 
wondering if those members have even read the bill or even 
thought about the bill, to see that this is some direction to the 
arbitration process once everything has broken down and that 
these decisions do not fall within the parameters of the arbitrator 
but that he has a choice of one or the other, whichever is most 
reasonable. That is the incentive that this bill is going to 
provide.
<P>
	I will split my time with the member for Wetaskiwin. I am 
going to stop at this time and allow him to share his views as 
well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
pick up where my colleague left off.
<P>
	Witness the labour dispute at the port of Vancouver in January 
and February, 1994. For 11 days the grain shipping process was 
paralysed. Some estimates place the loss to Canada's grain 
industry at hundreds of millions of dollars.
<P>
	It is absolutely ludicrous that such losses were allowed to 
occur. These losses came about as a result of a failed collective 
bargaining process.
<P>
	We cannot allow one sector of the grain shipping process to 
harm everyone else in the chain. When there are disruptions in 
the grain marketing system individual farmers are not the only 
ones to suffer. Workers everywhere else along the shipping 
chain are affected. It has a domino effect on the whole industry.
<P>
	When a strike occurs grain starts to back up in the system. The 
system becomes, if you will, constipated. The grain stops its 
otherwise perpetual flow from farm to market. This is 
detrimental to numerous people. Whether at the grain elevator 
or somewhere along the railway many people are forced to 
endure pain because of the actions of a few. This is not 
acceptable.
<P>
	With many unions that are involved in the grain transportation 
process we are left with the never ending threat of strike action. 
All too often strikes do occur. When they occur they disrupt the 
economy.
<P>
	More than just accepting the measures suggested in Bill 
C-262, we might also look at further legislation that would 
require all union contracts affecting grain handling 
transportation to come due at the same time. This would 
simplify things and perhaps put an end to the rotating type of 
strikes.
<P>
	No one benefits from a strike. Unionized workers suffer 
losses of income while on strike. While they may win an 
increase in their pay, all too often the net result is a loss of 
income. Employers lose in a strike. They lose money, they lose 
contracts and they pay demurrage on waiting ships. Besides that, 
no work gets done.
<P>
	In the case of grain transportation strikes there are an 
incredible number of people who are directly harmed: railway 
and all its workers, dock workers, shipping companies and their 
employees, and of course farmers are harmed.
<P>
	This represents only the direct impact of a strike action. 
Countless others are harmed indirectly as well. The ultimate 
casualty is the whole Canadian economy. Exports represent a 
huge sector of our economy. Canada's balance of trade 
continues to tilt in our favour. We must ensure that we retain this 
favourable balance.
<P>
	As borders become more and more meaningless Canada must 
be prepared to take on the entire world. That means we must 
achieve competitiveness to attain a dominant position in the 
global economy. When Canadians are unable to access the world 
market we all suffer. The thrust of the bill is final offer selection 
arbitration. I believe these measures will be fair to all sides.
<P>
	Legislation such as Bill C-262 provides a reasonable answer 
to endless strikes in the grain transportation sector of the 
economy. Further it represents a reputable solution when 
considering legislation that could apply to other areas in the 
labour market.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	Historically strikes affecting grain movement take place 
when markets are good and when prices are up. The use of 
binding arbitration to settle labour disputes is a good way to 
avoid unnecessary and crippling strikes. This would go a long 
way to foster good relations and co-operation between labour 
and management. With management and labour working hand in 
hand, our reputation as a reliable supplier of grains and oilseeds 
would improve with the possible result of increased demand, 
increased price and perhaps an increase in employment.
<P>
	Since 1966, as my colleague has already alluded to, we have 
gone through this process 13 times when the federal government 
has had to intervene and introduce back to work legislation to 
keep the grain flowing to market. We need to ensure that never 
again are such measures necessary.
<P>
	The bill provides for a dispute settlement process that I 
believe will be fair to all parties. This bill could not be of more 
immediate importance or more timely. The looming threat of a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10303"> 10303 </A></B>
<P>
strike on the national railways again threatens the process of 
grain handling.
<P>
	Above all, grain must be able to continue its orderly flow to 
market. The principle of keeping the economy flowing should be 
our number one priority. We need legislation like Bill C-262 to 
ensure that the economy does not face unnecessary crippling 
work stoppages. Disruptions in the market hurt everyone.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for several decades industrial relations in industries 
under federal jurisdiction in the private sector have been 
governed by the Canada Labour Code, Part I.
<P>
	Part I of the Canada Labour Code is a model of how industrial 
relations should be governed in a democratic country. It has 
been functioning well and has been an important element at the 
basis of the political and economic structure during many 
decades of economic prosperity.
<P>
	I draw attention to the fact that the grain transportation 
system has been functioning very well of late. Last winter was 
one of the most disruptive winters imaginable. It was a winter 
which reduced the flow of grain from farms to the country 
elevators. It slowed railway operations. Limits on the 
availability of grain hopper cars was also a constraint. Still the 
grain transportation and handling system recovered from a low 
level of grain exports early in crop year 1993-94 and recorded a 
4.7 per cent gain over the previous crop year.
<P>
	Today the grain handling and transportation system is moving 
ahead at an impressive pace with new records being set for grain 
shipments. The Regina <I>Leader Post</I> reported early in November 
on the fact that Canada's grain ports are moving at a pace well 
above average.
<P>
	Vancouver and Prince Rupert in October set a new record for 
the west coast which was 27 per cent that the average for 
October over the previous five years. Thunder Bay reached a 
pace not seen since 1991-92. Its handlings for October of this 
year were 35 per cent above the previous five-year average. 
This is encouraging news which should impress on us the 
resilience of the grain handling and transportation system and 
its ability to cope effectively with adverse conditions.
<P>
	When the legislation that established the code was adopted by 
Parliament in 1972, it replaced the industrial relations and 
disputes investigation act of 1948. It recognized there has been a 
long tradition in Canada of labour legislation and policies that 
are designed to promote the common well-being through the 
encouragement of free collective bargaining and the 
constructive settlement of disputes.
<P>
	When it passed the legislation that established the Canada 
Labour Code in 1972, Parliament indicated that it supported 
``labour and management in their efforts to develop good 
industrial relations and constructive collective bargaining 
practices'' and ``it deemed the development of good industrial 
relations to be in the best interests of Canada in ensuring a just 
share of the fruits of progress to all''.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	These principles were so fundamental to industrial relations 
that they were specifically mentioned in the preamble to the 
code. The bill before us proposes to make a very radical 
departure from these principles. It proposes to significantly 
alter industrial relation practices in the federal private sector.
<P>
	Bill C-262 zeros in on the dispute settlement mechanism as it 
would apply to industries involved in grain handling and 
transportation. It would remove the right to strike or lockout and 
replace the present dispute settlement mechanism with a final 
offer selection of compulsory arbitration.
<P>
	This might be an appropriate point to take a closer look at 
arbitration and see what the ins and outs of the process might be. 
Typically a hearing is conducted and is presided over by a third 
party neutral. The parties present their positions in an 
established, formal procedure. The neutral listens to the 
positions of the parties, weighs the evidence carefully and drafts 
a decision that he or she feels to be fair to both parties involved. 
In an arbitration proceeding the decision of the arbitrator is final 
and binding on both parties.
<P>
	There is a certain advantage to arbitration in that it brings a 
sense of finality to the bargaining process. The parties may not 
be happy about the results that will be imposed on them but it 
does provide for a solution.
<P>
	Some very clear weaknesses to the arbitration process should 
not be overlooked. First, it is not inconceivable that one party or 
the other could reject an arbitrator's award. It might possibly 
resort to strike or lockout action to vent frustration or to express 
rejection of the result of the process. For that matter, it is very 
possible that both parties may be dissatisfied with the 
arbitrator's ruling and not have recourse to any other dispute 
settlement process. The arbitration process is not perfect.
<P>
	While evidence supports the perception that the use of 
arbitration can reduce the number of strikes, it is not likely that 
strikes or lockouts can be eliminated entirely.
<P>
	A further disadvantage of arbitration that we are likely 
familiar with because it has been repeated over the years, is the 
fact that in adopting or having arbitration imposed on them, the 
parties have to give up their authority to make decisions 
concerning the issues in dispute.
<P>
	Union leaders give up their right to seek the support of their 
membership on key issues and management gives up its ability 
to control costs as it sees fit in the course of company 
operations. This leads me to believe that management and 
labour in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10304"> 10304 </A></B>
<P>
the grain industry are likely to have serious reservations about 
their support for a bill such as the one we have before us.
<P>
	A further consideration that I feel is very significant to the 
whole collective bargaining process is the fact that compulsory 
arbitration is very likely to undermine the collective bargaining 
process between a particular company and a union. If arbitration 
of final settlements is imposed on the parties, fewer and fewer 
items will tend to be resolved by the parties themselves before 
going to arbitration. The tendency is for the number of 
outstanding issues to build up before reaching the arbitration 
stage with each successive round of bargaining.
<P>
	Evidence suggests that labour and management tend to use the 
same approach to dispute settlement with each round of 
bargaining. This means that the parties may tend to become 
addicted to arbitration and this can undermine an otherwise 
health collective bargaining relationship.
<P>
	Another area in which arbitration takes some criticism is on 
the size of monetary awards. The charge is sometimes heard that 
wage settlements are higher in arbitrated settlements than in 
negotiated settlements. The evidence on this point apparently is 
inconclusive but I would suggest it is a point on which 
management in the grain handling and transportation industry is 
likely to object to Bill C-262.
<P>
	I do not want to leave the impression that there is not a role for 
arbitration in our system of collective agreement dispute 
settlement mechanisms. The Canada Labour Code, Part I, 
already contains provision for the peaceful settlement of 
disputes during the term of collective agreements by arbitration 
or some other mechanism. Our system of compulsory collective 
agreement settlements during the term of agreements through 
arbitration or some other peaceful means contributes to a high 
degree of stability in our industrial relation system.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	I would like to draw the attention of the House to section 7(1) 
of Bill C-262. It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>An arbitrator appointed under section 6 shall forthwith require the union and 
the employer to provide to the arbitrator, in writing, within fifteen days</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) a list of the matters agreed upon, and a proposal in contractual language to give 
effect to them; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) a list of the matters remaining in dispute and a final offer in contractual 
language in respect of the settlement of all of them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It appears to me that there is very little, if any, room in this 
process for the parties to negotiate a settlement even if they 
wanted to. Neither does there appear to be room for the 
arbitrator to assist the parties to come to a negotiated settlement. 
In fact, there does not appear to be any room for negotiation at 
all, aside from the arbitrator being provided by the parties with a 
list of matters they agree on and a list of matters they do not 
agree on.
<P>
	If we continue on with section 7(2), it indicates that the 
arbitrator has 60 days within which to determine the matters on 
which the trade union and the employer are in agreement, 
determine the matters remaining in dispute and then, according 
to the wording in section 7(2)(c), ``decide the matters in dispute 
by selecting either the final offer submitted by the trade union or 
the final offer selected by the employer''. Again there does not 
appear to be any room for negotiations between the parties when 
they appear before the arbitrator. If there is, why is it not 
provided for in the process?
<P>
	I have to ask why the process would be structured in this way. 
Presumably the bill would ensure that any disruption to the flow 
of grain would be brought to an end by invoking the legislation if 
the bill were passed. That being the case, I fail to see why 
allowance could not be made for the parties to negotiate under 
the guidance of an arbitrator, acting more like a mediator early 
in the process, and yet retain the authority to render an award on 
unsettled issues. All the advantages of negotiated settlements on 
particular issues could be retained in the interests of the parties 
collective bargaining relationship. At the same time we would 
have the certainty of a final solution being worked out through 
arbitration.
<P>
	We should take a further look at the form of arbitration that is 
proposed by the bill. Earlier we heard about some of the 
advantages and disadvantages of arbitration in general. Other 
considerations should be mentioned specifically in connection 
with final offer selection and this might be a good time to do so.
<P>
	It seems that final offer selection was developed to deal with 
some of the criticism that traditional arbitration acquired over 
the years. For example, in conventional arbitration in which the 
arbitrator is free to determine the content of an award, 
arbitrators sometimes get accused of splitting the difference in 
the parties' positions. Conventional arbitration encourages the 
parties to stay as far apart as possible during negotiations, 
especially on wages and other monetary items.
<P>
	It has been argued that final offer selection, in contrast, is 
supposed to provide encouragement to the parties to move 
closer together in the course of bargaining. Under final offer 
selection there is said to be an incentive for either party to know 
as much as possible about the other's bargaining goals and their 
real bargaining position.
<P>
	It should be noted that there are several variations on the form 
of final offer selection that we find being practised. For 
example, there is a form of final offer selection in which the 
total package of items forms the position of either party. The 
arbitrator takes the package of either labour or management, in 
total, and cannot mix and match as he or she might consider 
advisable in the interests of the parties. This form of final offer 
selection on a package of issues may be more easily applied to a 
few monetary items at any one time but it is less well  suited 
when an arbitrator has to deal with the package that includes 
matters of principles to either side.

	For this and many more reasons I have no hesitation in

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="WORLDSUMMITFORSOCIALDEVELOPMENT">WORLD SUMMIT FOR SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on February 21 I asked the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
if Canada would support the 20:20 vision proposal and action 
plan to be considered at the World Summit for Social 
Development which will take place in Copenhagen later this 
month.
<P>
	The goal of the summit is to attack global instability due to 
third world poverty and social injustice. The challenge is 
enormous. At this time 1.3 billion people in the world live in 
debilitating poverty; 550 million people end each day hungry; 
1.5 billion people lack safe water and sanitation; and 800 
million living in developing countries and 335 million in 
industrial countries are unemployed or underemployed.
<P>
	As I said at that time these conditions threaten world stability 
and peace. It is in the interest of all countries to take action 
against them. The 20:20 vision proposal and action plan must be 
supported by Canada and all countries at the summit.
<P>
	Will the minister or the parliamentary secretary state clearly 
that Canada will support these proposals and that the overall 
goals of the summit will be supported as well? I would also like 
to know that Canada would give the work of this summit and its 
goals the highest priority.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure 
to respond to the hon. member's comments and expansion on the 
question directed to the minister some days ago.
<P>
	The World Summit for Social Development is to take place 
next week in Copenhagen. It will be the first major international 
event to propose a vision for social development that has taken 
place in the 21st century.
<P>
	Over a period of 18 months the federal government has been 
working with provincial and territorial governments, labour, 
business, aboriginal organizations and non-governmental 
organizations to prepare the Canadian participation and make 
the summit a success.
<P>
	Many Canadian objectives are incorporated in the summit 
documents. I would like to list some that Canada will be 
supporting: reduction of poverty through job creation; economic 
security for people through productive employment; respect for 
human rights and fundamental freedoms; respecting women's 
equality; respecting and valuing cultural diversity; and 
spending less worldwide on military hardware and more on 
investing in people, in other words to be less concerned about 
the security of the state and more concerned about the economic 
and social security of individuals.
<P>
	In this context the 20:20 formula the member referred to will 
be discussed in Copenhagen. It is certainly of interest to Canada. 
Donors would allocate 20 per cent of their official development 
budget to meeting the basic needs of other countries. Recipient 
countries would allocate 20 per cent of their national budget to 
programs aimed at meeting the human needs of people. However 
in Canada we plan to allocate 25 per cent of the CIDA budget to 
meeting basic human needs.
<P>
	In an increasing global environment international security 
and stability have an important impact on Canadian people and 
Canadian prosperity. Actively promoting social justice, poverty 
alleviation, good government and human rights at home and 
abroad is an investment in Canada as well as assistance to those 
in greater need.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday in the House of Commons I expressed 
my concern and outrage over the pending loss of the Crow 
benefit.
<P>
	As far as a great number of Saskatchewan farmers and I see it, 
the federal government's abandonment of its responsibilities 
under the terms of the Western Grain Transportation Act is the 
single most damaging element of this week's federal budget.
<P>
	In fact the headlines in Saskatchewan newspapers this week 
bear this out. The Regina <I>Leader-Post</I> states it best with its 
single word headline ``Devastated'', followed by the subheading 
``Budget leaves farm leaders reeling''.
<P>
	In today's newspaper the premier of Saskatchewan, Mr. 
Romanow, is quoted as saying:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If this goes through in the next four or five years we will see the most massive 
restructuring of rural Saskatchewan with respect to trading patterns, towns, 
villages, cities-since 1905.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10306"> 10306 </A></B>
<P>
	We all remember it was the Liberal Party that originally 
began the process of getting rid of the Crow rate. The names 
Otto Lang and Jean-Luc Pepin still bring out emotions full of 
hard feelings on the prairies.
<P>
	Although the Liberals failed originally to destroy the Crow, 
they did succeed in weakening it enough so that today just one 
decade later they could finish it off. This is absolutely horrible.
<P>
	The loss of the Crow benefit is bad enough by itself, but the 
government has compounded our prairie anger in two other 
ways. First, it has abandoned the farm economy without any 
plan or structure in place to help the economy recover. Second, it 
has offered a one-time payout which is not only inadequate but 
is inappropriately targeted only to land owners.
<P>
	I have already argued elsewhere that loss of the Crow benefit 
without a long term plan to replace it could lead to the erosion of 
land values, a loss of farmers and farms, a reduction in the rural 
tax base and therefore a reduction in the support for the 
maintenance of the rural infrastructure, and with this a further 
loss of quality of life in rural Saskatchewan.
<P>
	The Crow benefit just two years ago was providing a net 
annual benefit to the province of Saskatchewan of $400 million. 
It will take a pretty hefty investment in diversification and value 
added production to replace that $400 million just to remain 
economically stationary.
<P>
	The Liberals have made no provision for that investment. Our 
problem on the prairies has never been the Crow rate. It has been 
a lack of investment capital. The will has always been there for 
value added production but the money to make it happen has 
been absent.
<P>
	The fight to save the Canadian Wheat Board has not been 
considered in all of this and if the supply of wheat is threatened 
then so too is the future of the board. Can we consider this in our 
long term equation?
<P>
	I want to know if the federal Liberals have taken any time at 
all to properly think out the long term implications of this 
decision. If they have, I want to see their documented evidence 
and reasoned conclusions. If they have not, shame on them.
<P>
	At the same time I want to note that the Liberals are preparing 
to pay out $1.6 billion in compensation, even though they know 
that $7 billion to $9 billion is required if there is to be any 
fairness in the system at all.
<P>
	Not only has the government failed to meet this fairness test, 
but it has also said that the money will be paid only to land 
owners. Does the government not realize that about one-third of 
the seeded acreage is currently under lease to banks or other 
financial institutions including the Farm Credit Corporation?
<P>
	The people who have been paying and will continue to pay the 
freight costs of grain sold for export and are leasing their land 
from a government owned corporation will not see a single cent 
of this payout, no matter how important it is.
<P>
	The Liberals have demonstrated a complete lack of 
understanding of the prairie farm economy. With this single 
move in the budget I hope they are prepared to reconsider now 
what they have done before it is implemented and before the 
ultimate damage is done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure 
to respond to the hon. member's comments. I only regret that it 
is two minutes and not twenty, because I think I could help him 
understand. I am sure in the end he would understand and 
appreciate the action we have taken.
<P>
	The hon. member is suggesting that the elimination of the 
Crow will have a damaging effect on the prairie economy. In 
fact, this government is certainly committed to restoring the 
economy in western Canada to its full potential. The document 
that has been put forth for discussion purposes, and I stress that, 
would see approximately half or about $800 million of the $1.6 
billion ex gratia capital payment going to Saskatchewan.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	The share will be representative of Saskatchewan's share of 
prairie grain movement. Farmers will also benefit from the 
capital gains tax advantage.
<P>
	The government's assistance however is not limited to that. 
There will also be a share in the $300 million adjustment fund. 
That will be available for some areas in Saskatchewan as well.
<P>
	These initiatives are only part of this government's plan to 
restore the prairie economy and help make this region an 
integral economic force in an increasingly competitive global 
marketplace. Changes with respect to freight rates have the 
potential to encourage diversification and value added 
production throughout the west.
<P>
	I might interject here. I just got off the phone with a friend in a 
riding next to mine whose company is in the livestock industry. 
It had three orders from pork producers in western Canada today 
to increase and make some changes in those operations because 
of what this is going to do. It is indeed going to follow up on 
diversification.
<P>
	Only days after the announcement, and the above is a good 
example, that potential is being recognized. Industry groups are 
already talking about moving into other crops and diversifying 
their operations.
<P>
	It is not only farmers who are adjusting. Transportation 
industries ranging from trucking companies to seaports are 
closely examining the services they offer in order to increase 
<P>

<B><A NAME="10307"> 10307 </A></B>
<P>
their efficiencies. Some are  already offering suggestions for 
alternate commodities based on the transportation costs of these 
products.
<P>
	These activities, coupled with the government's assistance to 
help farmers adjust to the short term impact of the loss of the 
WGTA will inevitably lead to long term economic growth in the 
prairies.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member not to underestimate the skills and 
resources of all those involved in the prairie economy. These 
factors along with the financial assistance being provided will 
ensure a rapid adjustment to changes in the WGTA and the long 
term economic benefits for the prairies and for all Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday, March 1, I received an unsatisfactory 
response from the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	I asked him whether the human resources investment fund 
infringed on the powers of the provinces and perpetuated the 
inefficient management of the labour force.
<P>
	The minister's answer was very vague. He told me that my 
question had nothing to do with the fund's goal.
<P>
	Since then, I acquired a copy of an information sheet for the 
staff of the human resources department which gave examples 
of some activities that could become part of the human 
resources investment fund. I will list them: putting more 
emphasis on employment development services, literacy and 
basic skills training, training and on-the-job training, 
assistance for child care and the earned-income supplement.
<P>
	If the human resources investment fund will be covering these 
kinds of activities, how can the minister say that the fund will 
not infringe on the provinces' jurisdiction over manpower?
<P>
	When it comes down to it, we can say that the minister made 
the same error during the debate on Axworthy's social program 
reform: the situation was properly diagnosed, they realized that 
the current system did not work, but they prescribed the wrong 
treatment.
<P>
	Once again, they have decided that Ottawa must manage the 
fund, even though it is well known that the provinces manage 
areas directly related to manpower training much more 
efficiently.
<P>
	Another possible activity is implementing a national strategy 
based on the job market. How can the minister suggest such an 
option when we all well know that, for years now, there have 
been 1.5 million jobs available in Canada for approximately 
500,000 unemployed people, and that the breakdown in the 
equation lies between the job market and training.
<P>
	The solutions suggested to us are the same old solutions, the 
federal government will come and tell the provinces how to do 
their job in their areas of jurisdiction. Does the minister not 
realize that this kind of attitude is entirely out of touch with our 
solutions for the future, for the 21st century, a future in which 
the idea that ``small is beautiful'' will be much more relevant 
than huge structures with national bureaucracies telling the 
local workforce should adjust?
<P>
	With this fund, is the minister not going to perpetuate the 
same vision he has today, so that at a local level, in each 
community, manpower management committees will have to be 
devised to try to bring together again all the stakeholders and 
achieve what this federal system is unable to achieve, assuming 
of course that it can be done at a local level at least? Could the 
minister not take another approach, an approach to truly put 
manpower training back into the hands of the provinces who 
express such an interest, as Quebec has, where there is a 
consensus among unions, employers and the education sector.
<P>
	All stakeholders involved in the manpower sector in Quebec 
have been saying for a long time that the best way to address the 
unemployment problem is to ensure a good fit between training, 
job creation measures and the unemployed who are waiting for a 
job. So could the minister not reconsider his decision and ensure 
that people at the grassroots who have the means to find 
solutions are allowed to do so, that is in Quebec and in the other 
provinces seeking the same types of responsibilities in the area 
of manpower training?

	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
have the opportunity to respond to the question posed by the 
hon. member on the human resources investment fund that was 
recently announced in the budget.
<P>
	The human resources investment fund will build on the 
strengths of its initial program components. Those program 
components include employment programs and services, social 
development programs in such areas as literacy and 
participation of disabled persons, the Canada student loans 
program and youth programs such as Youth Service Canada and 
Youth Internship.
<P>
	The terms of the fund's operation will be developed in the 
coming months in consultation with the provinces with whom 
the government has already indicated its willingness to work.
<P>
	The objectives of the fund may in some cases be best achieved 
through the direct delivery of services by the federal 
government. In other cases provinces or at times even local 
authorities may be best placed to achieve our common goals.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	Based on what we have learned through the broad 
consultation process associated with social security reform, the 
new fund will establish certain principles. It will help create 
opportunities for people to develop skills, secure employment 
and adapt to change. The fund will better equip Canadians to 
keep their jobs in a changing world and provide the skills to 
find a new job quickly if it becomes necessary.
<P>
	The new fund will focus on individual and local needs instead 
of trying to fit people into programs with rigid eligibility 
criteria. Programs will be tailored to meet the needs of the 
individual. At the same time the fund will encourage people to 
take charge of their own lives, establishing mutual 
responsibility. Individuals, employers and local communities 
will have as much at stake in the employment initiatives as 
governments.
<P>
	The human resources investment fund will strengthen 
partnerships and create an effective division of responsibility 
between levels of government as well as among governments 
and the private sector.
