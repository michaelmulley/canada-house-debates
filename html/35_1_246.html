	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36(8), I have the honour to table, in 
both official languages, the government's response to 11 petitions.

	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I am honoured to commemorate, in the name of the 
government, one of the most important events of the century: the 
creation of the United Nations Organization on October 24, 1945.
<P>
	Fifty years ago, the first signatories of the UN Charter, including 
one of Canada's greatest prime ministers, Mackenzie King, 
gathered together in San Francisco to work out their vision of hope 
for humanity.
<P>
	Amid the ruins of a devastated world, our predecessors firmly 
believed that, for the sake of humanity, they had to build a better 
future. They also knew that peace and development were not a 
matter for a few countries but one for the whole planet and all its 
peoples.
<P>
	Today, as we contemplate the achievements and turmoil of the 
past 50 years, one thing is clear: the UN is a universal organization, 
not only because almost all the countries of the world are members, 
but because it is involved in all fields of human activity.
<P>
	From peacekeeping and peacemaking to education and the fight 
against poverty; from human rights and development to the 
environment, human health, refugee assistance and programs to 
promote economic stability and growth; from democratization 
efforts to initiatives to share technologies and improve food and 
agriculture, Canada can be proud of the progress made by the UN 
in improving the fate of millions around the world.
<P>
<B>(1005)</B>
<P>
	But we can also be proud of our contribution to these efforts. We 
Canadians were among the first to sign the charter. It was also a 
Canadian, the late lamented John Humphrey, who wrote the first 
draft of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It was my predecessor, Lester B. Pearson, who helped usher the 
UN into adulthood. Among his valuable contributions to the UN, 
none was more visionary than his proposal to help set up the first 
peacekeeping operation in 1956 during the Suez crisis. Since then, 
more than 100,000 Canadians have served in over 30 peacekeeping 
missions around the world, without mentioning our contribution to 
the Korean war. Today I want to pay tribute to those who have 
served and those who have died in the service of peace and in the 
service of the United Nations.
<P>
	Canada has worked through the UN to fight for the rights of the 
poor and the underprivileged, to promote respect for the 
environment and to push for disarmament. We have consistently 
been one of the largest suppliers of food aid. We have assisted in 
missions to monitor elections in many parts of the world.
<P>
	The International Civil Organization is based in Montreal. The 
Food and Agriculture Organization was founded in Quebec City 
and just last week celebrated its anniversary by holding a major 
conference there.
<P>
	Canada has played a leading role in the international atomic 
energy agency as well as in many other UN specialized agencies. 
We have served on the security council in every decade since the 
UN was created and we have recently declared our intention to run 
for a security council seat for the 1999-2000 term.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And last year, Canada announced that it would nominate the City 
of Montreal as the future home of the Secretariat for Biodiversity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As we stand here today at the beginning of the next chapter in 
UN history and on the threshold of the 21st century, I am pleased to 
state that Canada remains firmly committed to the United Nations 
system. I pledge our continued support for the UN's goals.

<P>
	I had the honour of addressing the United Nations General 
Assembly in New York last month. I outlined what Canada 
believes should be the UN's main priorities for the years ahead. 
This government believes the UN should pay particular attention 
to three main objectives: preventive diplomacy, rapid reaction and 
peace building.
<P>
	All of the components of the UN system must help identify and 
resolve tensions before they generate into conflict. When 
preventive diplomacy efforts fail, the UN must be able to intervene 
quickly and effectively on the ground.
<P>
	In New York I tabled Canada's report on how to increase the 
UN's rapid reaction capability. I was encouraged by the positive 
attention given to our recommendation.
<P>
	Alongside these efforts, the UN must continue its ongoing work 
of peace building and articulate the visions of development centred 
on the individual and one that balances the economic and social 
agendas for the purpose of improving the well-being of society.
<P>
	Just as the world has undergone many changes since 1945 and 
has had to adapt to new requirements, modern technology and 
fiscal restraints, so must the United Nations greet its future with a 
strategy for revitalization to meet the challenge of the next century. 
Those challenges often arise quickly and harshly. Canada will 
continue to hold out its hand to the UN to help ensure that the 
general assembly, the security council and indeed the whole UN 
family are best able to meet the needs of the future in a 
co-ordinated, efficient and fiscally responsible manner.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	The UN has accomplished great things in its first 50 years. There 
have of course been set backs. We can make the UN better, 
however we cannot hope to make it better when some countries do 
not pay their dues. Countries can pay their dues and they should 
now. That is not to say that we cannot reform the scale of 
assessments to reflect current economic realities. We should and 
without delay.
<P>
	The UN at 50 should take stock of what it has done, how it has 
done it and how it can do things better in the future. We must look 
back and reflect on the spirit that carried the architects of the UN 
forward. Their vision was bold. Their challenges were great.
<P>
	Today we are faced with universal problems that threaten the 
achievements of the last 50 years. Unlike 50 years ago, we have a 
proven universal mechanism that can help us meet those 
challenges. Let us make it stronger and better. That is the challenge 
for the years to come.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
proud to have this opportunity today to speak on behalf of the Bloc 
Quebecois on this fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the United 
Nations Organization.
<P>
	The Minister of Foreign Affairs gave a relatively appropriate 
picture of the past achievements of the UN, the challenges facing it 
today and the role played by Canada.
<P>
	In my comments on this anniversary, I would like to focus on 
two main issues which I feel are fundamental and which may have 
been purposely avoided by the minister.
<P>
	First, the matter of promoting human rights and democracy. 
Second, since this is the era of globalization, I would like to discuss 
that very typical characteristic of the UN, its universality. The 
UN's membership includes nearly 200 countries, 28 of which 
joined since 1990.
<P>
	First, human rights and democracy. As I listened to the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs say how proud he was, and rightly so, of 
Canada's contribution, adding that it was a Canadian, the late John 
Humphrey, who wrote the first draft of the universal declaration of 
human rights in 1948, I could not help thinking of this 
government's lax approach to promoting human rights and 
democracy.
<P>
	Considering that this government has refused to commit itself to 
recognizing the results of the referendum to be held next week in 
Quebec, it is somewhat surprising to see the minister holding forth 
at the United Nations and recalling the UN's achievements in 
promoting human rights and democracy.
<P>
	That takes some nerve, I must say. And coming from a 
government that has decided from now on to focus exclusively on 
business interests and literally to turn its back on promoting human 
rights and democracy, it is downright embarrassing.
<P>
	The late John Humphrey must be turning over in his grave today. 
The Bloc Quebecois has strongly criticized and condemned 
Canada's abdication of its historic responsibility for human rights 
and democracy.
<P>
	Before I finish my comments on this first point, I will read one 
of the most interesting recommendations made by the Bloc 
Quebecois in the dissenting report of the Special Joint Committee 
reviewing Canadian foreign policy. The Bloc Quebecois 
recommended that the Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade and CIDA, working in co-operation with NGOs 
and business corporations, draw up guidelines to give concrete 
expression to the key components of Canada's foreign policy 
respecting democracy and human rights.
<P>
	Among other things, these guidelines could include a mandatory 
framework for analysing situations involving gross and reliably 
attested human rights violations. They were to be formulated as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15731"> 15731 </A></B>
<P>
soon as possible and made  public no later than the UN's 50th 
anniversary celebrations scheduled for October 24, 1995. But 
October 24, 1995 is today, and what is the government tabling? 
Nothing, nothing tangible on promoting human rights and 
democracy. What an opportunity lost by Canada.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	These guidelines were to serve as inspiration for new legislation 
and regulations to govern the transactions of the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade, CIDA, NGOs and business 
corporations with states belonging to the international community.
<P>
	We felt that Canada's foreign policy, as it concerns democracy 
and human rights, should be more consistent and absolutely honest 
and open, so as to maintain the respect and prestige Canada had 
acquired, which a sovereign Quebec would certainly have been 
able to perpetuate.
<P>
	Today there is every indication that this will be the case if 
Quebecers vote in favour of sovereignty on October 30. More than 
ever before, and this is again borne out today, it is high time that 
Quebec was finally able to participate fully in international 
politics, realize its aspirations and defend its own interests. Faithful 
to its democratic values of openness and tolerance, Quebec fully 
intends to stress greater concern for humanitarian aid and equality 
among nations.
<P>
	This brings me to my second point, the universal aspect of the 
UN and the lessons to be learnt. I would like to refer now to several 
quotes from the secretary general of the United Nations' speech on 
nationalization and globalization at the first conference of young 
leaders, May 24, 1992.
<P>
	The timely words of the UN secretary general are even more 
timely today. He said: ``In order to enter into a relationship with 
another, we must first be ourselves. For that reason, the first 
prerequisite for the proper globalization of our modern life is a 
solid sense of identity. Excessive or misunderstood globalization 
might result in the creation of a kind of cultural soup, one uniform 
culture, which would do nothing positive for the world''.
<P>
	A sound sense of identity. Such was the message of the secretary 
general of the United Nations. This in fact is really the code for 
access to the world, a body of cultural references. According to the 
secretary general, the United Nations is that body of cultural 
references.
<P>
	Now, what is the situation concerning cultural identity and 
cultural reference for Canada and Quebec? English Canada, we 
agree, needs solid anchor points in order to cope with the invasive 
American culture. Quebecers, on the other hand, base their identity 
on Quebec first and foremost. Therein lies Canada's whole 
problem; it is based on the assumption of a single nation, with one 
and the same culture, the so-called Canadian culture.
<P>
	This denial of the existence of Quebec as a historically 
constituted nation disavows the existence of two founding peoples. 
Canada is, therefore, having serious problems defining itself. It is, 
in fact, a country still in search of an identity. Its existential 
problem is that it is torn in two directions by a dual identity. 
Recalling the words of John A. McDonald at the time Canada was 
created: ``We have created Canada; now we must create 
Canadians'', we in Quebec are saying ``We have created 
Quebecers; now we must create Quebec''.
<P>
	To return to my main theme, the concept of the nation-state: a 
nation is, first and foremost, a shared desire for a shared life. It is 
the first step toward universalism. Universalism itself, therefore, is 
nourished by nation states. The secretary general's speech 
illustrated the value of another underlying principle of universality, 
and that is sovereignty. He expressed it as follows: It is the art of 
making unequal powers equal. Without state sovereignty there is a 
danger of chaos, a danger of destroying the very instruments of 
international co-operation''.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	He continued as follows: ``A world in order is made up of 
independent nations, each open to the other, respecting their 
differences and their similarities''.
<P>
	This is one of the most essential messages, perhaps the most 
essential one, we can glean from the United Nations Organization, 
that great international institution which embodies these essential 
values more than any other body. This is why we believe that a 
sovereign Quebec will be able to participate fully in international 
life in its own right, bolstered by a solid identity, a solid anchor 
point, a single and unique cultural reference. Then it will be able to 
communicate with other nations, with the universal, to use the 
terms of the UN secretary general. It will do so by assuming its fair 
share of the obligations imposed upon it by its allegiance to the 
values of democracy, peace and justice.
<P>
	There is no doubt whatsoever that this is the spirit within which a 
sovereign Quebec will assume its responsibilities on the 
international scene. Since Quebec is faithful to these values, there 
is no doubt in our minds that the United Nations will open its doors 
wide to us the day after our accession to the status of a sovereign 
state.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago the 
charter of the United Nations mapped out many high principles. 
These were noble aspirations but the reality of the UN has not lived 
up to that dream.
<P>
	For decades the UN has remained incapable of acting forcefully 
to achieve those principles. The primary problem is that it cannot 
adequately finance its operations. If the UN is to respond to the 
many global problems which exist it must have sufficient resources 
to do the job. Since it has not been doing its job effectively,  it is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15732"> 15732 </A></B>
<P>
difficult for the UN to take the moral high ground and pressure its 
member states to pay up.
<P>
	What is required is major reform and the sooner the better. 
Without this I cannot blame some of those in default for not paying 
their bills. Why invest in an operation that is so bureaucratically 
top heavy, inefficient, and many times ineffective?
<P>
	A further problem with the UN is the inefficient way the 
specialty agencies operate. Studies have found significant 
overlapping and duplication of work, limited responsiveness as 
well as a lack of transparency. In these agencies the UN has a tough 
time getting its job done. Certainly this is something that has 
created a number of institutional obstacles.
<P>
	There are many areas where the UN should be improved and 
overhauled for the 21st century. To begin and most important, 
Canada must insist the UN eliminate the duplication and waste 
which contributes to its ineffectiveness. If the UN is ever to recover 
from its current crisis, this is an absolute prerequisite.
<P>
	Furthermore, Canada must take a proactive and constructive role 
in reforming the UN so that it can better live up to its original goals 
of collective security, freedom, justice and human development. 
Canada is a respected player in the UN and we can provide 
effective leadership in the reform process. This will be extremely 
important going into the 21st century.
<P>
	We must also strengthen the UN to attack the root causes of 
conflict, lack of democracy, poverty, abuse of human rights, 
intolerance and the uncontrolled spread of military technologies. In 
addition, many of the environmental problems which have emerged 
over the past several decades cannot be remedied without effective 
international co-operation. A revitalization of an effective UN 
would greatly help in all these areas.
<P>
	The minister mentioned peacekeeping. This is a very important 
duty of the UN in which Canada has played no small part. 
Canadians attach a great deal of importance to our country's 
peacekeeping tradition but times have changed and peacekeeping is 
becoming more perilous and unpredictable. Therefore, this 
Parliament must establish clear criteria to make sure that our scarce 
peacekeeping resources are used where they can be most helpful 
and not used where conditions are unacceptable. We must realize 
that Canadians cannot participate everywhere. Our men and 
women in uniform have served the cause of peace very honourably 
for years and we are very proud of them.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	Never again should our troops be left to twist in the wind, as 
happened in Bosnia, while the government in Ottawa failed to 
remove them for months and months from a dead end mission 
where the mandate could not be carried out properly.
<P>
	In conclusion, the UN faces many challenges over the coming 
years. If this 50th anniversary celebration is to mean anything, then 
we must address these challenges head on. The UN will not survive 
unless it becomes effective, accountable and transparent in all of its 
activities. These are the changes that we need. These are the 
changes that the Reform Party will support.

	The House resumed from October 23 consideration of the

and Import Act, the Income Tax Act and the Tax Court of Canada 
Act, be read the third time and passed.

<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the tax incentives 
provided in the Cultural Property Export and Import Act are for all 
Canadians and not only for the wealthy.
<P>
	The act has been in effect for almost 20 years, that is since 1967. 
It has evolved and it must continue to do so in order to encourage 
Canadians to keep within the country those objects that are part of 
our heritage. The more Canadians are aware of the existence and 
purpose of this legislation, the more they donate interesting 
property related to our heritage.
<P>
	Indeed, we notice an increase in the number of gifts made to 
public institutions and authorities responsible for keeping such 
property and making it accessible to ordinary citizens, the rich as 
well as the poor, now and in the future.
<P>
	Economic considerations are not the only reasons underlying 
this bill. It is also important to make sure that our cultural heritage 
remains here in Canada. When the original legislation was passed, 
it did not include any deterrent to prevent the sale of Canadian 
cultural property on the free market. Consequently, Canadians have 
forever lost many important elements of their culture and heritage.
<P>
	These objects were sold abroad and have become the property of 
public and private collections throughout the world. This is a major 
and permanent loss of heritage for Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15734"> 15734 </A></B>
<P>
	Cultural and heritage institutions in Canada have a long and 
proud history.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our first museums had an educational purpose: to organize and 
transmit knowledge in the natural sciences. For example, the first 
known museum in Canada dates back to 1831, when the Halifax 
Mechanics Institute opened a public museum and reading room. 
Later came the establishment of the arts museums. By 1903 Canada 
had 21 museums. Today our museums are respected and renowned 
worldwide.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Canadian Museum of Civilization is one of those renowned 
institutions which attract visitors from all over the world. People 
come here to admire its distinctive architecture. But what would 
that magnificent building be without its collections? Without their 
artifacts, works of art and books, our museums, galleries and 
libraries would only be empty buildings, rooms and walls.
<P>
	Bill C-93 will ensure that the collections of Canadian museums, 
art galleries and libraries are up to date, diversified and exciting.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	Canadians are increasingly interested in their heritage. They 
expect the government to play a role in developing heritage 
collections. Bill C-93 is an attempt to meet these expectations.
<P>
	An article in <I>The Ottawa Citizen</I> in October 1994 described the 
importance of gifts of cultural property for Canadian museums. 
Here is the story of one such gift.
<P>
	Ainslie Loomis was a university student in 1939 and regularly 
visited Britnell's bookstore in Toronto. One day, while browsing 
through a box of old books, she came across an album of 
photographs entitled <I>The Antiquities of Cambodia</I>, which had been 
published in 1867. The price was marked as $2.25, but Britnell's 
dropped it to 75 cents. In 1993, and now living in Brantford, she 
gave the album to the National Art Gallery of Canada; it was worth 
$10,000.
<P>
	The article went on to explain that the National Gallery of 
Canada came into being through gifts of works of art. At its 
creation in 1880, the National Gallery's collection comprised only 
donated works.
<P>
	Leanora McCarney of Hull, Quebec, has been giving works of 
art to the National Gallery for 15 years. She says that when they 
travel abroad they see galleries with entire wings full of donated 
works. She does not believe Canadians are in the habit of donating 
works the National Gallery. She hopes to start a trend, because she 
feels people should understand that what is involved is their 
heritage.
<P>
	In making it easier for people to donate cultural property to 
museums, galleries and libraries, the government will perhaps 
make Leonora McCarney's wish come true.
<P>
	The implementation of measures, like Bill C-93, to consolidate 
our museum, gallery and library collections has an effect on other 
sectors of the economy besides the arts and culture. Cultural 
tourism is a flourishing part of the tourism industry.
<P>
	On the whole, the tourism industry brings in nearly $30 billion a 
year and employs over 600,000 Canadians in 60,000 tourism 
related industries.
<P>
	In Canada, recent trends indicate most tourists visiting Canada 
want a cultural experience different from their own. The 
Department of Canadian Heritage is trying to improve heritage 
tourism in Canada.
<P>
	Many examples may be found in Canada of the contribution 
cultural tourism makes to the local economy, while promoting 
people's awareness of cultural values and encouraging their 
participation.
<P>
	Thus the activities proposed at the Musée de la civilisation in 
Quebec City are an excellent way to approach culture, community 
development and cultural tourism.
<P>
	Opened in 1988, the museum promotes experience on a human 
scale with a collection of over 80,000 pieces illustrating life in 
Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	The leadership role of this museum in the city's cultural and 
educational development is widely recognized. This museum is 
now regarded as an essential tool for promoting public 
participation in cultural heritage activities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Clearly museums, galleries and libraries are not elitist shrines or 
ivory tower domains for the happy few. They are democratic, 
diverse institutions open to all citizens. They make a vital 
contribution to the cultural and scientific life of the community. In 
Canada, museums, galleries, archives and libraries are resources 
and inspiration to people of all communities, backgrounds, ages 
and abilities.
<P>
	To all Canadians our museums, galleries and libraries represent 
our authentic and irreplaceable link with our history, culture and 
heritage. Successful passage of Bill C-93 will help to ensure that 
these institutions remain vibrant temples of the human spirit, a 
strong presence for all Canadians to inspire us and reflect who we 
are.

legal mechanism  available in Canada that promotes conservation, 
thus helping to define our heritage. Again, this incentive to 
establish and protect Canadian culture is only an incentive and not 
a tax deduction or loophole. This incentive in the form of an 
individual tax credit is available to all Canadians.
<P>
	Its scope was broadened in 1992 to include artists by 
encouraging them to donate their creations to designated 
institutions interested in collecting their work. I do not need to 
explain to you that artists are among our poorest fellow citizens, at 
least financially. This tax incentive provides us with a way, 
however small it may be, to allow major works by living artists to 
enter the public domain, where they will help inspire and educate 
citizens much better than if they remained hidden in the artists' 
workshops.
<P>
	The Cultural Property Export and Import Act plays another very 
important role: encouraging Canadians to espouse philanthropic 
principles, to think about future generations, to seek today what 
may become a national treasure tomorrow, and to collect works of 
art.
<P>
	Those who argue that cultural property donations can only come 
from the rich are completely mistaken, to say the least. In fact, 
some of the greatest collectors in the world had very little money at 
their disposal and sometimes even went without food in order to 
buy works of art.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	We need more of these people in our country, people who can 
recognize what is of aesthetic value, people who can have a passion 
for history or, even better, people who can understand the scientific 
and technical symbols which define us as a nation.
<P>
	This bill is designed for those who feel it is their civic duty to 
keep alive our heritage as a young country, and it seeks to welcome 
objects which are symbolic and representative of our country. To 
promote the making of collections and to stimulate a philanthropic 
spirit is the least that the federal government can do to ensure that 
our heritage remains accessible to all Canadians.
<P>
	Our country is still very young. It is less than 150 years old. We 
have a duty to develop existing private and public collections, so 
that our culture can thrive and be the envy of other countries. More 
importantly, this will allow Canadians to be fully aware of their 
place and identity as a nation.
<P>
	Given the current economic context, it is particlarly appropriate 
for us to take all possible measures to keep our cultural treasures in 
Canada, and to encourage the public to think twice before selling 
abroad family objects brought here by their ancestors over a 
century ago, not to mention a masterpiece by Riopelle bought 25 
years ago for next to nothing.
<P>
	We are talking about Canada's heritage but, more importantly, 
about the preservation and development of that heritage.
<P>
	I am convinced that everyone in this House should support this 
wise piece of legislation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Because the arguments are sound I encourage all members of the 
House to support the bill, which is based on sound logic and makes 
good sense for the country.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I wish to inform the House that pursuant to 
Standing Order 33(2), because of the ministerial statement, 
Government Orders will be extended by 23 minutes today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
rising to speak to Bill C-93 and I will argue today that not only is 
this piece of legislation flawed, this whole act is completely 
unnecessary. I am quite amazed at the lengths to which the 
government has gone to introduce this type of legislation for what 
appears to be not a problem at all or at least a very minor problem. I 
will argue the legislation has caused far more problems than it 
could ever hope to solve.
<P>
	I quote from a Revenue Canada pamphlet called ``Gifts and 
Income Tax'':
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Income Tax Act and the CPEIA provide tax incentives to people who 
want to sell or donate significant cultural property to Canadian institutions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Canadian Cultural Property Export Review Board-is responsible under 
the CPEIA for certifying that an object is of ``outstanding significance and 
national importance''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When an object of this nature is donated to a designated Canadian institution 
or public authority, and is certified by the CCPERB, the donor does not realize a 
capital gain. For purposes of the tax credit, the donor can claim the FMV of the 
gift up to the total amount of tax still payable after claiming any credits for 
charitable donations and gifts to Canada or a province.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	When that legislation was originally brought in I believe in 
1977, right from that time we have had all kinds of problems with 
people trying to take advantage of that legislation.
<P>
	I quote from a newspaper article, March 24, 1995, in the 
Montreal <I>Gazette</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Tax avoidance schemes under which unscrupulous art donors obtain bloated 
write offs for works given to public galleries and museums are on the rise across 
the country, the Canadian Museums Association warned yesterday.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>These dubious donations have become so rampant in recent months that 
Ottawa might shut down the program under which tens of millions of dollars of 
art is donated to Canadian public institutions each year, said John McAvity, 
executive director of the 2,000-member association.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Warning members to be more vigilant against such schemes, McAvity said: 
``The donations in question appear to be  motivated purely by tax avoidance </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15736"> 15736 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>considerations rather than philanthropic reasons-These donors appear to be 
neither serious nor knowledgeable collectors or even known to the museums''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Under the scheme, which dates back at least 20 years, a donor buys a work of 
art for well below the artist's usual fee. The donor would then have the work 
evaluated for four or five times the amount he had paid for the work, donate the 
piece to a gallery, museum or registered charity and write off 100 per cent of the 
evaluated amount, art experts explained.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At the heart of the donation issue is the concept of fair market value.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Michel Rolland, president of a firm that facilitates art donations to public 
institutions, said that if a client was able to obtain a work of art for well below 
the usual going rate then the client has made a shrewd investment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But a Revenue Canada brochure states that ``the generally accepted meaning 
is the highest price, expressed in terms of money, that the property would bring 
in an open and unrestricted market between a willing buyer and a willing seller 
who are both knowledgeable, informed and prudent, and who are acting 
independently of each other''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In other words, if you were willing to only pay $2,000 for a work of art then 
you should in all likelihood only get a tax receipt for $2,000, said Robert Kerr, a 
Montreal chartered accountant who writes for the <I>Gazette</I>.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>After five or so lean years many artists are desperate to sell their work at 
almost any price, said Thérèse Dion, a local art consultant.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Rolland's Art-Transit Int. Co. has paid Montreal artist Catherine Widgery 20 
per cent of the usual price for her work. ``If it is a $10,000 work, I get $2,000'', 
she said.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Similarly, a copy of an Art-Transit artist's contract obtained by the <I>Gazette</I> 
shows that some artists are paid only 18 per cent of their usual rate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``It seems like a win-win situation'', said one Montreal artist who did not 
wish to be identified. ``Museums are happy to get things free. Artists are happy 
because they have a bit of money in their pockets. So everybody is happy. What 
is not kosher is that a client is buying it (a work) at below its value, but getting 
the write off for a different amount''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Still the artist added ``I find the whole thing a bit fishy, but everybody's doing 
it''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>According to the documents obtained by the <I>Gazette</I>, Art-Transit's 
warehouse contained, as of January 26, a total of 7,241 works of art.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	These include works by several artists.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The documents also show that some of the artists have enormous quantities of 
works with Art-Transit: Guiangoldo Fucito is listed as having 494; Francine 
Larivée has 440; and Claude Paul Gauthier has 485.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	The point is that while some people say it is a win-win situation, 
it is good for the artists and it is good for the people getting the 
write offs. It is profoundly unfair to taxpayers who are granting 
these people a write off for the full appraised value of the art work. 
In this case it is art work that was bought for $2,000 but that 
according  to the appraisal is worth $10,000 and therefore the write 
off is $10,000.
<P>
	This thing is nothing but a huge rip off. We are talking about 
over 7,000 works of art in one company alone where this is being 
done. I have no idea what the value is but it has to be astronomical. 
This is not fair. This is a rip off.
<P>
	Previous to 1977 when this legislation came into place people 
donated works of art, artefacts, sculptures, whatever, because they 
wanted to give them to museums. They did it for altruistic reasons. 
They are philanthropic. They did not care about the write off.
<P>
	There were museums previous to 1977. There were art galleries. 
There was lots of art in them. According to this article, since before 
1977 we have had this problem with these scams. It would be bad 
enough if that were all there was to it. This tax credit is far richer 
than one can get if one donates to a regular registered charity.
<P>
	If one donates to the food bank all one can do is donate up to 20 
per cent of total income which is the most one can get a deduction 
for. However, if an art dealer or someone savvy who knows the tax 
law can work this deal they can actually write off their entire tax for 
a year by donating these so-called works of art. To me that is 
unbelievable.
<P>
	A gentleman from an art gallery came in front of the Canadian 
heritage committee in Hamilton. In his judgment most people 
would give out of the goodness of their heart but there are some 
people who are on to this. He said it was probably the wealthiest 
people who would make the biggest contributions to the art 
galleries and take advantage of this situation.
<P>
	What we have is a tax avoidance scheme, in my judgment, that 
permits the wealthiest Canadians to get away with paying little or 
no tax. That is profoundly unfair.
<P>
	In the last budget the government was talking at length about 
how we had to have tax fairness. My hon. friend across the way is 
nodding. This is not tax fairness. This is not in alignment with any 
kind of taxation system that treats people the same way. Absolutely 
not.
<P>
	Why are we fooling around with legislation like this? We should 
be rolling this legislation back. We should be bringing in flat tax or 
a single tax or a proportional tax, a tax system that treats people 
equally. We certainly do not want one that treats people who donate 
art better than people who give to the food bank or to the Salvation 
Army or to the cancer society. That is ridiculous. How can we 
justify that? That is absolutely out of the realm of anything that 
makes sense.
<P>
	I am sure people are wondering how much this costs Canadians 
every year. Last year there was something like $60 million in tax 
deductions handed out. Depending on people's tax situation, it 
could amount to as much as the  full $60 million in actual loss to 
the Canadian treasury if people did not donate to anything else and 
it consumed absolutely all their income so they did not pay any 
income tax at all. That is not realistic, and I recognize that. 
However, suffice it to say that people did avoid paying millions and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15737"> 15737 </A></B>
<P>
millions of dollars in taxation because of this scheme. That is not 
fair and that is not right. We should have a transparent system.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	Just before the last election there was a bit of a furore in the 
newspapers about former Prime Minister Mulroney donating his 
personal papers to the National Archives. Someone said they saw a 
figure of how much of a tax break he was to get. The gentleman 
subsequently said he had made an error and he did not know why he 
quoted that figure. That is not the point. The point is that we have 
no idea how much people get in terms of a tax break for the 
donations they make. These things are protected through the 
Income Tax Act. We have a situation where people are making 
donations and we have no idea how much they are being appraised 
for because that would violate their privacy. Is that the best system?
<P>
	It was not very long ago that someone at the National Gallery of 
Canada decided it was a good idea to buy ``The Voice of Fire''. It 
was an American art piece. It was three stripes. It cost 
approximately $1.8 million. People went absolutely berserk, and 
rightfully so. In my judgment it was a complete waste of money.
<P>
	If we visit the gallery and look at the comment book, people 
have said over and over again: ``The emperor has no clothes''. I 
think Canadians feel that way too. The point is that we know how 
much money we paid for that piece of art, but for these other things 
we do not know how much revenue we are forgoing when we 
purchase them. That is wrong. It should be out in the open. We 
should know how much we are paying, either through a tax credit 
or directly for items that are purchased on our behalf by our 
government. That is how an open democracy should work.
<P>
	The legislation is completely contrary to that. That is why we 
should not be fooling around with the amendment to the legislation 
but should instead be repealing the whole bill. It is absolutely 
ridiculous.
<P>
	I want to talk about some of the specifics of the legislation. The 
legislation offers an appeal process over and above the cultural 
export review board. If people do not feel they are getting a fair 
price from the review board for their donation they can ultimately 
appeal it to Revenue Canada. If memory serves, that was the 
situation prior to 1993 or 1991, I have forgotten which. At any rate 
we would be returning to that situation.
<P>
	I question whether we should have the review board at all. It is 
another layer of bureaucracy. How are the people appointed to the 
review board? They are appointed the  same way everyone else is 
appointed to government boards. They are appointed on the basis 
of who they know. They are appointed because of their 
connections. It is quite conceivable that a former prime minister, 
such as Brian Mulroney, could donate papers and have the decision 
made on the value of those papers by people he appointed to the 
board. It is ridiculous.
<P>
	A few times the National Archives of Canada has gone to the 
board and the board has said this is the value of the former prime 
minister's papers. We never find out what it is, but those people 
who may indeed have been appointed by the prime minister are 
making those judgments.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	This appeal process will allow us to go to Revenue Canada and 
ultimately I suppose to the tax courts. However, our sources tell us 
that we have approximately 6,000 cases before the tax court today, 
6,000 backlogged cases. Why are we bringing more stuff to these 
people? Why are we bringing more decisions for them to make? I 
would think there are more important things for those people to be 
doing than arguing about the price of somebody's dinosaur fossil or 
their three stripes on a piece of paper, their so-called art.
<P>
	I make another point about the legislation. I believe the 
legislation, which goes back to 1977, and the art bank, which falls 
under the purview of the Canada Council, have worked against 
artists. They have hurt artists by flooding the market with all kinds 
of art and alleged art that has no business being out there in the 
marketplace today. We have something like 18,000 pieces of art 
stored in warehouses today, stuff that is supposed to be in the art 
bank.
<P>
	We have this legislation that encourages art galleries to go ahead 
and purchase these things because the money is not coming out of 
their budgets. All they are doing is going to the people at the export 
review board and saying: ``We think this is pretty good. Put an 
evaluation on it. The guy is going to give it to us. Whether or not 
we hang it on the wall now or at any time in the future is really 
irrelevant, because it does not cost us a thing''. They are not 
working with a budget. They can bring in as much of this stuff as 
they want. The only ones who pay are the taxpayers.
<P>
	The people in this article say it is a great scheme and everybody 
wins. It is win for the art gallery and win for the artist, but it is big 
time lose for taxpayers who are out millions and millions and 
millions of dollars in revenue. There are no safeguards built in to 
ensure the galleries and the museums are using their power to do 
this responsibly. There is no check in place to make sure that 
happens.
<P>
	This is horrible legislation. I would argue that before 1977 we 
had very good art galleries. We were able to hold on to our works of 
art. We were able to maintain  different pieces of important cultural 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15738"> 15738 </A></B>
<P>
property because people ultimately gave these things to our 
institutions over a period of many years. We know they did that.
<P>
	Surely this new legislation encourages some people to use the 
system by taking advantage of the tax credits. Also, the legislation 
encourages us to keep not only Canadian art but American art and 
artefacts and foreign artefacts of all kinds as well. People are using 
this to say this is to keep Canadian culture in Canada. We should be 
accurate here and say that it is also used to buy all kinds of foreign 
art.
<P>
	The fact is that people gave art before 1977 to these institutions. 
In trying to encourage people to give even more we have opened up 
a Pandora's box. We have allowed all kinds of people to milk the 
income tax system, to take advantage of it to the point where we 
now have the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> writing articles about it. We really 
have what amounts to a tax avoidance scheme going on, which 
obviously costs taxpayers millions and millions of dollars. That is 
ridiculous.
<P>
	We have that problem. We have the problem that it is not 
transparent. We have people donating but we never know how 
much money they get in the form of tax deductions for their art. We 
have an export review board that could be appointed by people like 
the Prime Minister, who will end up passing judgment on things 
they want to give. We have a problem with the art market being 
flooded because of this type of incentive, this kind of screwy 
incentive we have here. We have all kinds of problems with this 
extra bureaucracy and extra cost to solve what was a very minor 
problem.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	Instead of proposing an amendment that will send this to the tax 
courts where there is a backlog of 6,000 cases, why do we not just 
do away with the whole thing? Let us just do away with it. Then we 
can get rid of all these problems. We will not have the Montreal 
<I>Gazette</I> writing nasty stories about all the scams that are being 
worked to take advantage of the situation.
<P>
	We will not have, on the one hand, people in our party and in the 
Liberal Party campaigning to simplify the tax system and, on the 
other hand, the government working against that concept by 
providing tax incentives for the wealthiest of Canadians to take 
advantage of this system and avoid paying tax. That is crazy. It is 
so unfair it is unbelievable. I cannot believe the government, the 
minister, the parliamentary secretary and members across the way 
are arguing for this type of legislation.
<P>
	I hope people take the time to write some letters about this. I 
hope they take the time to contact their MPs and ask how this can 
be fair.
<P>
	Let me conclude by saying that although this is a fairly 
innocuous piece of legislation, when people find out about it they 
will not be pleased. They will say that when the government spoke 
in the last budget about achieving  tax fairness they believed the 
government. Now the government is turning around and proposing 
legislation that is exactly contrary to that. I hope the government 
will realize that and stop the bill before it goes any further.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I wonder 
if I could have unanimous consent to seek clarification on some of 
the member's comments.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The Chair can only ask for 
unanimous consent. The first three speakers have 40 minutes 
without questions or comments, but with unanimous consent the 
House can do whatever it so chooses. Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I would be 
happy to do that and I will ask my colleagues to consent to do that. 
However I have to disappear for a radio interview at 11.30 a.m. I 
have to get back to my office. If we could do this in five or six 
minutes it would be great.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We will have to. I have to 
stay within the 40-minute constriction as much as possible. I would 
hope that certainly would happen.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the member 
referred to the gifts and income tax book he was rather selective in 
his reading. I wonder why the member did not bother to inform 
Canadians on how cultural property is actually certified. I wonder 
if he would be willing to read into the record exactly how they are 
certified, just so that he does not mislead Canadians into thinking 
that it is a free for all for everybody and anybody can give anything 
to any cultural institution.
<P>
	Would he be willing to read the paragraph on page 18, so as not 
to mislead Canadians, and the first two paragraphs on page 19, so 
that Canadians are fully informed? As usual, I find that the Reform 
Party is rather selective in what it chooses to read out of transcripts.
<P>
	I reassure the Reform Party that it will secure its place in 
museums beside the extinct species, with the dodo bird and the 
dinosaurs.
<P>
	The member's discourse is somewhat limited in nature. When he 
was quoting from Mr. McAvity, who is executive director of the 
Canadian Museums Association, he was very limited in the quotes 
he chose. Mr. McAvity went on to say that they are the voice of 
2,000 museums.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The 
member opposite was asking a question. The whole purpose of 
interrupting the proceedings was to ask a question of my colleague. 
This is not a question. This is a statement.

<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the hon. member for 
Comox-Alberni for his intervention. It is certainly in the spirit of 
unanimous consent knowing that we do have some restriction given 
the statement by the member for Medicine Hat that he had other 
obligations when they accepted the unanimous consent.
<P>
	Without further ado I would simply ask-
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> I have a point of order, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All we are doing at this point 
is using up valuable time. I simply ask the parliamentary secretary 
if she could possibly put the question so I might allow a reasonable 
amount of time for the member to respond.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Guarnieri:</B> Mr. Speaker, Mr. McAvity, who represents 
2,000 not for profit museums in Canada, said: ``We are very 
pleased to be here today in support of these amendments. The 
museum community has been patiently waiting for these 
amendments for several years''. He went on to say: ``This 
legislation was universally applauded by Canadian museums as it 
brought our community in line with those of many other western 
nations whose governments have been supporting the enrichment 
of public collections through similar legislation for years''. Mr 
McAvity went on to say even more resoundingly that the Canadian 
Museums Association came before the committee to voice its 
wholehearted endorsement of these amendments.
<P>
	Given all of the above, does the hon. member think he has more 
expertise than those individuals to judge what is good for Canadian 
museums? I thank the hon. member for his patience in allowing me 
to put the question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member was taking 
advantage of my good nature a little bit, but that is okay.
<P>
	I will acknowledge that there are a couple of paragraphs on 
pages 18 and 19 that do explain fairly specifically that the export 
review board has to judge an object to be of outstanding 
significance and national importance because of its close 
association with Canadian history or national life, aesthetic 
qualities and value in the study of the arts or sciences in order to be 
eligible to be designated for a tax deduction. The fact is that $60 
million worth of those are designated every year. That is a 
tremendous amount of money, as the hon. parliamentary secretary 
would know.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary was asking me about Mr. McAvity 
and the museum association and was pointing out that the museums 
like the legislation. Of course they do. They have unfettered access 
to all kinds of things with no budget. They do not have a budget. 
The museums can basically say: ``We would like that work of art or 
that artefact. We will take it to the review board and get it to tell us 
what it is worth and whether it is  significant. When the board does 
that, then we get it''. It is that easy.
<P>
	The only one who pays is the taxpayer. It is certainly good for the 
artist or the person who is donating it because he or she gets that 
big tax credit. It is certainly good for the museums. Why would 
they have any problem with this? They probably love this stuff. It is 
profoundly not good for taxpayers who have to take it in the pocket 
every time one of these donations is made.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank all members who 
participated in this extension of the debate for their co-operation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
before I get into the main body of my speech, I would like to 
proffer a couple of comments relative to what was said by the hon. 
member for Medicine Hat.
<P>
	I did not listen to all of his speech but I did hear a chunk of it. On 
two different occasions he described the legislation as being 
horrible and innocuous. I would think the hon. member would find 
some disparity between those two adjectives, innocuous and 
horrible.
<P>
	After listening to him I suspect he probably thinks the legislation 
is more horrible than it is innocuous despite the fact that this is 
anything but sweeping legislation. It really is what we might call a 
technical bill to put back into legislation a review and appeal 
mechanism, something that was inadvertently left out in 1991.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	Again, in commenting on observations made by the hon. 
member for Medicine Hat, it is quite clear he believes that the free 
market system can do the job. At one point in his speech he said 
that we just do not need this kind of legislation at all. He was not 
only referring to providing an appeal mechanism or a review 
mechanism; he was talking about the entire system of public 
support for donations of Canadian heritage to museums.
<P>
	We would have to be dreaming. We would have to be in full 
flight of fantasy to believe the museums would do as well without 
this legislation. Without this incentive, without this kind of 
legislation, many of the donations to the museums across the 
country, and we are talking about more than 2,000 institutions, 
would dry up. This was forcefully put to the committee of which I 
have the honour to chair by witnesses a few days back.
<P>
	Let us not fool anybody. This legislation is absolutely necessary. 
The comments by the hon. member for Medicine Hat truly reveal 
what the so-called Reform Party feels about supporting cultural 
institutions and specifically museums. Reform members simply do 
not support public support at all which is wrong headed. It is a 
mistake and is not something that is shared by the Canadian public.
<P>
	I listened to the hon. member and he seemed to plead on behalf 
of taxpayers, as if he spoke for all taxpayers.  While many

taxpayers believe they are overburdened, and in some cases they 
are, most taxpayers are quite enlightened and support this kind of 
legislation. They appreciate museums. They appreciate cultural 
institutions. They support artists of all kinds. They want to reach 
out and help Canadians in the cultural field. They accept that this is 
what this legislation is doing.
<P>
	This is certainly recognized by the museums. If it was not 
helpful the museums would be saying that, but that is not what their 
witnesses were saying. They came to the committee and said this 
legislation is needed and is supported.
<P>
	This wanders perhaps a little off the bill, but this bill has 
something to do with preserving Canadian heritage. Everyone 
knows as well as I do the crisis this country is going through right 
now. We all know the crisis this country faces and we have a 
heritage. We have a tremendous history. On Monday we want all 
Canadians, not just Quebecers, to appreciate this heritage, this 
history, this land, this great nation. That is what this country is all 
about.
<P>
	This cultural property bill is just an infinitesimal part of the 
efforts of preserving Canadian heritage. I feel very, very strongly 
that come Monday Quebecers will show that they are going to 
preserve Canadian heritage in a much greater way through the 
ballot box rather than through the mechanism of the cultural 
property bill.
<P>
	The hon. member for Medicine Hat said he has no idea as to the 
tax expenditure involved in this kind of legislation. The tax 
expenditure is in the neighbourhood of about $60 million. Again, it 
is fully supported by Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	Getting to the main body of my presentation today, we have 
debated the merits of the Cultural Property Export and Import Act 
long and hard.
<P>
	Some time ago the hon. member from the official opposition 
clearly understood that the lack of an appeal process in relation to 
determinations of fair market value by the Canadian Cultural 
Property Export Review Board was the result of an unfortunate 
oversight. That is really what it is, an unfortunate oversight.
<P>
	Bill C-93 is a technical bill. As such we must remember that its 
purpose is to restore a right that was lost when the determination of 
fair market value was transferred from Revenue Canada to the 
review board. We are correcting an error. We are removing a 
mistake that was made four years ago.
<P>
	The act is even more important and necessary today than when it 
came into force in 1977. That is because it is fast becoming the 
only source, and I emphasize the only source, through which 
institutions can hope to continue acquiring cultural property for 
their collections. That has to be borne in mind throughout this 
entire debate.
<P>
	With little or no acquisition funds, museums are now having to 
focus on donors to build their collections. Canada is therefore 
greatly in need of a means to encourage people to collect important 
examples of our national heritage with the ultimate aim of 
voluntarily donating to custodial institutions.
<P>
	The Cultural Property Export and Import Act must be cherished 
and developed to ensure that the level of collecting of important 
examples of our heritage continues to increase, not to decrease. 
That is important.
<P>
	In the 19th century the function of private collectors gained a 
new level of importance in the face of the spread of public galleries 
and museums throughout the world. While the impressionists and 
post-impressionists were to some extent barred from official public 
exhibitions, their work was nonetheless being bought by private 
collectors with or without the mediation of dealers. These works 
ultimately found their way into public collections only after their 
position had been established by the art market created by private 
collecting.
<P>
	This collecting spirit was not relegated just to contemporary art, 
but also to the diversity of products created throughout the world. It 
is thanks to the collectors of the last century and continuing 
through to today that the public has ultimately been led to an 
appreciation and understanding of those objects that have come to 
embody the trends and symbols which define the psychology and 
history of our development as a civilization.
<P>
	Collectors are the seers, the wise men of our times. They are the 
individuals who have foresight enough to recognize what is and 
what will continue to be of outstanding significance and national 
importance for generations to come. Custodial institutions for 
decades now have developed a strong rapport with collectors 
working alongside them as they collect, often with the ultimate 
intent to give to the public.
<P>
	We are seeing in Canada today collectors who have built up 
strong collections who, rather than automatically giving to the 
public through public collecting institutions, are faced with the 
choice of selling those collections for a handsome capital gain or 
donating them to designated institutions in return for a cultural 
property tax certificate. However, knowing the limitations of the 
cultural property determination process and the fact that there is no 
recourse to appeal the Cultural Property Export Review Board 
determination, we have witnessed several cases already where 
collectors are opting to sell their collections rather than holding 
themselves hostage to the bureaucratic process. It is very important 
to keep that in mind. If we are to respect and encourage the intent 
of our collectors to give to the public domain, we must find ways to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15741"> 15741 </A></B>
<P>
ease that process. Establishing a system of appeal to the Tax Court 
of Canada would be a very important step toward encouraging the 
concept of  making donations in our country, a step that the donors 
as much as the institutions are anxiously awaiting. That also has to 
be borne in mind. This is not only important to the institutions and 
the art community, it is important to the donors. In fact it is 
important to all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	Over the past few years, the Canadian Cultural Property Export 
Review Board has been the object of press articles focusing on the 
board's reduction of proposed fair market values in applications for 
certification of cultural property for income tax purposes. These 
stories, by the way, refer to a small proportion of all certification 
applications. The review board has responded by expressing the 
challenge of determining fair market value in these economic times 
where the markets in which cultural property circulates are 
extremely weak.
<P>
	It is therefore crucial that the mandate for determining fair 
market value rests in the hands of experts who are knowledgeable 
about the twists and turns, the ups and downs of the marketplace 
and who know how to relate often conflicting trends in the 
marketplace to the cultural property applications it has before 
them. This is a very intricate business and it cannot be left to rank 
amateurs. If the job is going to be done properly it has to be left to 
knowledgeable people, people who are experts and people in whom 
we have confidence. This has been thought out and taken into 
account.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Integrity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Yes, as my good friend from 
Broadview-Greenwood pointed out, people of integrity are also 
important.
<P>
	Speaking of people and integrity, the current review board 
consists of 10 members, the maximum number allowable under 
current legislation. These members represent the myriad of players 
who are actively involved in the process of preserving cultural 
property in institutions or public authorities who are designated to 
do so.
<P>
	Let us go through this. Two of the members are contemporary art 
dealers. Four members are or were employees of designated 
institutions who have expertise in archival material, Canadiana, 
contemporary and Inuit art. One member is an accountant, another 
is a lawyer and the remaining two members are members of the 
public at large. Several of the members who sit on the board are 
also collectors who are fully aware of the dynamics that come into 
play between institutions that collect and collectors who become 
donors.
<P>
	This not something that has been slapped together. This has been 
thought through very well. When we take into account the 
composition of the 10-member board we can appreciate the kind of 
thought that has gone into making up the board.
<P>
	In my opening remarks I referred to comments made by the hon. 
member for Medicine Hat. That same member at second reading of 
the bill expressed concern that a board appointed by the 
government and consisting of members who represent the 
community it serves could be-to use his words-too cosy, leading 
to a scratch my back and I will scratch your back situation. That 
kind of assumption places subjectivity over expertise and suggests 
that human beings are by nature incapable of assessing their peers 
objectively. I think he has underestimated the capabilities of people 
and perhaps even their integrity.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	We are not talking about amateurs, we are talking about 
professionals, professionals that value and wish to maintain their 
professional integrity. Further, as is the case with all professional 
organizations, the Cultural Property Export Review Board has a 
strict code of ethics to avoid any conflict of interest.
<P>
	I might add that the transfer of determining fair market value to 
the board in 1991 was not an arbitrary move, but rather the result of 
the realization that such determinations can best be made only by 
individuals who are actively involved in the environment in which 
cultural property circulates.
<P>
	The appeal process which the bill proposes will ensure the full 
use of the expertise available on the board. It is intended that given 
the thoroughness with which the first stage of the appeal process 
would be handled through a request for redetermination by a 
subcommittee, most issues with determinations of fair market 
value would be resolved and that requests for a further appeal to the 
Tax Court of Canada would be minimal. In other words, we do not 
see the two-stage review process being used on every occasion. We 
believe in most cases that all questions will be settled after the first 
go-around. Very few of these cases go to the Tax Court of Canada. 
It is important to keep that in mind. We are not interested in a 
prolonged process where both stages are used up on almost every 
occasion. We do not think that will happen.
<P>
	The second stage of the appeal process necessitates that the 
donor make an irrevocable gift to the institution. Only the donor 
would be able to request an appeal to the tax court up to 90 days 
after the redetermination process is completed. Again we are not 
talking about people who are in the game for frivolous reasons. 
They are serious donors.
<P>
	As with anything new, the first and second stages of the appeal 
process will be subject to trial and error before an efficient and 
workable system is developed. In other words, we can see this 
system, to some extent, maturing. One would hope that after the 
system has been used for a number of years, it will be more 
efficient and more mature. I believe that is a safe assumption. As 
with most processes, over a period of time after they have been 
used again and again, do get better.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15742"> 15742 </A></B>
<P>
	The museum community, as have donors and potential donors, 
has been anxiously awaiting the appeal process since the original 
announcement was made by the Minister of Canadian Heritage in 
November 1994. It was looking for the announcement up until 
then. It was cheered by that announcement. It has been looking 
forward to the legislation. It has been looking forward to the 
passage of the legislation and it has been looking forward to this 
kind of debate. With a little luck it will be given royal assent in 
the very near future.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	Over the past year and a half the review board has established 
positive working relationships with Revenue Canada and Justice 
Canada to ensure that donations of cultural property are made in 
the spirit of the act, that is, with a philanthropic end in mind. The 
board is to be highly commended for the effective action it has 
taken to discourage the use of the tax incentives under this act as a 
tax avoidance measure.
<P>
	Let me point out the kind of regime that has been set up to 
prevent misuse of donations. Not any Tom, Dick and Harry can 
come along with any kind of alleged piece of art and give it to an 
institution and get a tax break. It is not as simple as that.
<P>
	I want to draw attention to a couple of paragraphs from a 
pamphlet entitled ``Gifts and Income Tax''. The Canadian Cultural 
Property Export Review Board may rule that an object is of 
outstanding significance and national importance because of at 
least three criteria: close association with Canadian history or 
national life; aesthetic qualities and value in the study of the arts or 
sciences.
<P>
	This is important. To be eligible to have cultural property 
certified, an institution or public authority has to be designated by 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage. The institution or public 
authority has to have this designation before formally accepting 
one's gift if one is to receive the maximum tax benefit.
<P>
	The designation procedure ensures that the institutions and 
public authorities receiving cultural property are competent, 
classified, and maintain and preserve cultural property. Designated 
institutions are also required to make one's gift available to the 
general public for education, research or display purposes.
<P>
	I point that out because when I was listening to the hon. member 
for Medicine Hat, he left the impression, at least with me, that this 
was a kind of loose set-up that could be exploited by people who 
really do not want to give pieces of Canadian heritage for 
philanthropic purposes but just to get a tax break.
<P>
	I assure the hon. member for Medicine Hat and all Canadians 
that it is not as simple as that. There is a regime. There is a 
framework. It will have to be followed correctly and properly if 
pieces of art are to be accepted and where tax certificates are 
provided.
<P>
	I am told that the board has implemented measures to target 
suspect donations and to make determinations so that supposed 
donations made with an anticipated profit are unable to receive 
substantial financial gains. The board has been working closely as 
well with the Professional Art Dealers Association of Canada to 
ensure that all appraisals coming before it are fully substantiated 
with demonstrable sales of comparable works.
<P>
	As there are fewer tax incentives available to taxpayers today, 
the board is taking every measure possible to ensure that the tax 
incentive to donate under the Cultural Property Export and Import 
Act cannot be used as a loophole. The great importance of this act 
is the continuing development of our national heritage, and it 
merits extreme vigilance. The Canadian Cultural Property Review 
Board, I reiterate, is to be commended for its efforts thus far.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	This brings me back to those people for whom the Cultural 
Property Export and Import Act is intended, the donors, the 
institutions and the public; three major groups in this equation and 
we should not forget that.
<P>
	The purpose of the act is to encourage and ensure the 
preservation in Canada of important examples of our heritage in 
movable cultural property. Without acquisition funds to fulfil their 
mandates to collect cultural property, designated institutions must 
rely on donors.
<P>
	As I said at the beginning of my remarks, as much as we respect 
the marketplace, it is a dynamic place and we would not want to be 
without it for one minute, sometimes it comes up a little short. 
When it comes up short we as politicians have to recognize that. In 
this case we have recognized it because the museums, the 
institutions, cannot rely on the marketplace through some magical 
process providing the donations that are so required by these 
institutions.
<P>
	It would be nice to believe that the marketplace could wave a 
magic wand but it cannot, any more than the Leader of the 
Opposition can. We cannot rely on a magic wand in this case. We 
have to rely on well thought out legislation which will do the job 
for the institutions, for the donors and for the public at large. We 
think this legislation does it.
<P>
	I remind Canadians that without an appeal process that ensures 
recourse for determinations of fair market value of cultural 
property for income tax purposes, donations to the country's public 
institutions will become paralyzed and so will our heritage. 
Canadians do not want that, not for one minute. That is why we 
have this legislation. We as Canadians, the public, would suffer if 
this were to happen, this paralysis I was referring to.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15743"> 15743 </A></B>
<P>
	At a time when museum attendance has been steadily increasing 
and contributing to the economy of Canada  through cultural 
tourism, we cannot afford to abandon our duty to continue to 
inspire our people to partake in the cultural harvest of our nation.
<P>
	Museums are more popular today than ever before. Perhaps this 
has something to do with the fact that our country is getting older. 
It is 128 years old. We have a lot of heritage; heritage that has been 
captured by our artists, heritage that expresses Canada in all of its 
manifestations. We have a duty to encourage artists, to support 
donors, to support designated institutions so that this heritage in art 
form is preserved and protected because we will be a stronger 
country for it.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	Imagine for a moment what future generations of Canadians 
would think of us if we were oblivious to these facts, if we ignored 
these facts, if we let these precious pieces of heritage slip through 
our fingers, allowing these precious pieces of heritage to be 
squandered. They would condemn us. They would assess us very 
harshly. However, we would not have to wait for the evaluation or 
the assessment of history. I think our contemporaries would treat us 
very harshly.
<P>
	Canadians know what this country is all about. Canadians know 
what our heritage is all about. They also know what it takes to 
preserve that heritage because they know a country is not here for 
just today, tomorrow, next week, the week after, the month after or 
the year after. Like so many countries, Canada is here for a long, 
long time. In recognition of that we have legislation to support our 
artists, our donors, our institutions and the public at large.
<P>
	I think all Canadians, all taxpayers, support this. They will not 
share some of the criticisms we have heard of the bill. Of course no 
legislation is perfect. As long as human beings are what we are, 
imperfect, we will often create imperfect legislation. However, I 
think we have done a good job on this. Certainly the institutions 
have told us that. The museums have told us that. They came before 
the committee and praised this legislation. They praised the 
minister. They praised all of us in the House and they want the job 
done. They do not want this frivolous talk, this carping from the 
other side of the House.
<P>
	Criticism for criticism's sake does not make any sense. If you 
have something worthwhile to say, say it. To stand up on your hind 
legs, to carp and to criticize just to fill the air does not make sense. 
I think the opposition does us a disservice when it grandstands, 
when it indulges in that kind of talk. We want responsible debate. 
In some cases we have fallen short of the goal of responsible 
debate.
<P>
	Canadians support the legislation and they want it done. That is 
all I have to say and I hope we can have this legislation passed as 
quickly as possible. Canadians want it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We will now move to the 
next stage of debate in which members will be entitled to 
20-minute speeches subject to 10 minutes of questions or 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased 
to rise this morning on Bill C-93, an act to amend the Cultural 
Property Export and Import Act, the Income Tax Act and the Tax 
Court of Canada Act.
<P>
	The Cultural Property Export and Import Act came into force on 
September 6, 1977 together with certain complementary 
amendments to the Income Tax Act. The purpose was to preserve in 
Canada significant examples of Canadian heritage through the use 
of a system of export controls, tax incentives for private 
individuals who donate or sell cultural objects to public 
institutions, and assistance to institutions in purchasing cultural 
objects under certain circumstances. Bill C-93 would affect only 
the use of tax incentives. It is an amendment to the original act.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	The legislation will establish an appeal of decisions of the 
Canadian Cultural Property Export Review Board to the Tax Court 
of Canada. This bill is being sponsored by the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage and it is his responsibility through the Department of 
Canadian Heritage to develop, implement and promote cultural 
policies that will enable Canadian creators to flourish and Canadian 
consumers to enjoy and benefit from a wide variety of cultural 
products.
<P>
	The federal government clearly has a role in the development of 
policies and programs designed to encourage the production and 
preservation of Canadian cultural materials.
<P>
	In the area of heritage policies and programs the Department of 
Canadian Heritage provides support and assistance to museums 
across the country while at the same time ensuring that our national 
institutions, including the National Archives, the National Gallery, 
the Canadian Museum of Civilization, the Museum of Nature, the 
Museum of Science and Technology and the National Library, 
function in an environment conducive to giving Canadians 
maximum access to our cultural heritage.
<P>
	Culture is fluid, always changing and must not be looked on as 
something rigid or something around which barriers or parameters 
can be built. Culture is diverse. Customs that may seem strange to 
one culture will often be part of the daily life of another.
<P>
	It is for these reasons that it is important these cultures are 
reflected in the collections of our museums so that others will be 
exposed to them, will learn from them and will in turn understand 
them.
<P>
	The Cultural Property Export and Import Act already serves as a 
vital instrument to protect Canada's diverse  cultural heritage by 
building strong public collections. Bill C-93 will serve to 
strengthen this legislation and will help to ensure the history of all 
Canadians is preserved for future generations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15744"> 15744 </A></B>
<P>
	The amendments contained in Bill C-93 should not be reviewed 
in isolation but rather as part of a comprehensive policy for 
preserving our heritage. Historic sites, parks, museums, 
monuments and historic buildings are all symbols of what makes us 
unique as Canadians. Their preservation is essential as both 
reminders of the past and sign posts for where we are going in the 
future.
<P>
	Part of the greatness of our history and our heritage rests with 
not only the deeds of past generations but with national treasures, 
the artefacts, works of art and personal objects they created. By 
preserving and displaying these objects in museums the past can 
continue to live in the present.
<P>
	The influence of American television, movies and printed 
materials can blur the distinction between Canadians and 
Americans and cause us to forget the great achievements of 
previous generations of Canadians. The preservation of our cultural 
property and museums, archives and libraries ensures the 
continuation of a distinct Canadian identity.
<P>
	According to the Canadian Museums Association there are over 
2,000 museums in Canada. These museums range from small, 
seasonal, one person operations to medium size facilities, as we 
have in several communities in my riding of Erie, to great urban 
museums such as the Canadian Museum of Civilization, the Art 
Gallery of Ontario, the Glenbow Museum and the Montreal 
Museum of Fine Arts.
<P>
	All of these museums enjoy national and international 
reputations because of one reason, their collections. Great 
collections do not occur by accident but instead develop from 
careful nurturing and the generosity of donors and benefactors who 
believe in the importance of preserving Canada's patrimony for 
future generations.
<P>
	Critics of Bill C-93 like to say tax incentives for donations of 
cultural property are tax loopholes for the rich. In saying that they 
are ignoring the rigorous standards museums, archives and 
libraries apply to get at these acquisitions. Our cultural institutions 
do not frivolously accept people's junk and offer them tax 
incentives. If that were the case the contents of my garage would 
make me a rich man. On the contrary, they make conscientious 
professional judgment about what objects or collections are worthy 
of certification because they are, in the words of the act, of 
outstanding significance and national importance.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that there are over 2,000 museums in 
Canada. To be eligible to apply to have objects certified as cultural 
property and therefore made eligible  for a tax credit, a gift must be 
made to an institution that has been designated under the act. But 
not just any organization that operates a museum or calls itself a 
museum is eligible to be designated. I am informed that there are
<P>
only approximately 300 designated institutions in all of Canada. 
Only a fraction of those 2,000 museums in Canada are even eligible 
to apply to receive the tax benefits offered by the legislation. That 
small number of designated institutions is an indication of one of 
the safeguards that was built into the original legislation and is 
further enhanced in the bill now before the House.
<P>
	To be designated a museum, archive or library, it must be a 
non-profit corporation and have as its principal activity the 
acquisition and preservation of cultural property. It must also have 
a collection that interprets and displays to the public. It must have a 
professional staff and it must be open to the public on a regular 
basis. This means that before an institution is even able to apply to 
obtain a tax credit for an object that it wishes to bring into its 
collection, the institution must demonstrate that it has the ability to 
preserve that object in perpetuity. The institution must then apply 
to have the object certified as a cultural property by the Canadian 
Cultural Property Export Review Board.
<P>
	Again, the tax credit is not automatic just because a museum or 
other institution is designated and wishes to add an object to its 
collection. It must be demonstrated that the object is of outstanding 
significance and national importance and that it fits within the 
acquisition mandate of the institution. After that, arm's length 
appraisals for the fair market value of the object must be obtained. 
These are provided by evaluation experts who have no association 
with either the recipient institution or the person donating the 
object. Again there is a safeguard in the system.
<P>
	The appraisals are reviewed by the Canadian Cultural Property 
Export Review Board and it determines the fair market value for 
income tax purposes. The review board is composed of experts in 
all aspects of cultural property: museum personnel who are 
knowledgeable about its significance and the means to preserve it 
and dealers and collectors who are active in the marketplace and 
know the prices at which objects regularly sell.
<P>
	Establishing the fair market value of cultural property or any 
other commodity is more of an art than a science, and it is 
inevitable that disagreements will occur. In 1987 in the Ontario 
high court a judge wrote in his ruling that fair market value was a 
notional or hypothetical concept, an opinion arrived at by evidence, 
assumptions, calculations and judgment in the absence of an actual 
transaction. In such a situation it is obvious why there may be 
disagreement about the fair market value of a particular object.
<P>
	Responsibility of the review board to determine fair market 
value can at times be very onerous, particularly when dealing with 
unique objects and donations to a wide  range of institutions. The 
experts on the review board recognize this. That is why they fully 
support the two appeal processes established by the bill. They 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15745"> 15745 </A></B>
<P>
understand that it is important for donors of cultural property and 
recipient institutions to be able to request a thorough review of 
their decisions through the redetermination process and, if 
necessary, through an appeal to the tax courts of Canada.
<P>
	The present law enables the review board to redetermine the fair 
market value of an object if additional information becomes 
available. To date this system has worked well, but there have also 
been cases when donors have felt that further consideration of the 
information that had been provided was required or that additional 
emphasis on salient facts was needed. This was not possible if a 
redetermination could only take place when additional information 
had been provided.
<P>
	Bill C-93 removes the requirement that additional information 
be provided before a redetermination takes place. This means that 
the review board will be able to revisit its decision at the request of 
a donor or recipient institution with or without the provision of 
additional information.
<P>
	We believe it will be difficult to design a first level of appeal that 
is fairer or more equitable than this one.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	If after a redetermination the differences between a donor and 
the review board still have not been solved, the donor must 
complete the gift, if he has not already done so, and may then 
appeal the determination of fair market value to the Tax Court of 
Canada. This is an important point, because at the time the appeal 
is made to the Tax Court of Canada the donor will have made an 
irrevocable gift to the museum, archive or library. He will no 
longer be the owner of the object. The cultural heritage of Canada 
will therefore have been enriched regardless of the tax court 
decision about the object's value.
<P>
	What will be at issue in an appeal to the tax court will be the fair 
market value of the object for income tax purposes. The question of 
outstanding significance and national importance will have been 
resolved, and the donor will have made the gift in the knowledge 
that the fair market value of the donation remains an issue.
<P>
	Again, those concerned about fairness in the tax system and 
whether rich people are benefiting from a tax loophole will 
appreciate that the process, by its very nature, guarantees that the 
tax system is fair and that it will not be abused.
<P>
	If donors are prepared to make a gift with the full knowledge that 
they may receive a tax credit for less than they believe an object is 
actually worth, they are clearly not being motivated by money or 
profit when they make a donation. If that is their only concern they 
can  withdraw the gift, sell it on the open market, and no tax credit 
will be given. This system is a win for all involved.
<P>
	The amendments in Bill C-93 not only reinstate a previous right 
of appeal but improve on it by establishing two processes that will 
permit an open dialogue about the fair market value of an object. 
We believe the ability to discuss fair market value, a concept that 
involves evidence, assumptions, knowledge and the exercise of 
judgment, will lead to better appraisals provided to the review 
board when it makes its initial determinations. This in turn will 
lead to a limited number of requests for redeterminations and in all 
likelihood to only a few appeals to the tax court.
<P>
	Bill C-93 is being strongly supported by museums, archives and 
libraries, by collectors and donors of cultural property, by dealers 
and appraisers, and by the review board. I urge all members of the 
House to support the bill. The amendments are technical in nature 
and respond to strong concerns expressed by the heritage 
community. Their passage into law should be seen as part of the 
ongoing commitment of the Government of Canada to ensure the 
preservation of Canada's cultural heritage. This will benefit the 
culture and heritage of my riding of Erie. This will benefit the 
culture and heritage of the finest country in the world, Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to make a comment on this important piece of legislation, Bill 
C-93, an act to amend the Cultural Property Export and Import Act, 
the Income Tax Act and the Tax Court of Canada Act.
<P>
	I congratulate the member for Erie for laying out the provisions 
of Bill C-93. I want to explain to Canadians in very straightforward 
language what those provisions mean. It is extremely important for 
Canadians to note, as was expressed by the member for Erie and by 
the previous speaker, the member for Winnipeg St. James, that this 
is not a bill that is directed, as Reform would paint it, to somehow 
provide benefit to the rich. To demonstrate that, I did a little 
calculation of what the implications might be.
<P>
	If taxpayers were interested in making a contribution of a book, 
an artefact, et cetera, to a museum, library, et cetera, and the 
contribution were deemed to have a fair market value of $1,000, 
assuming their original cost of acquiring it many years ago may 
have been $100, under the current tax act if they were to sell that 
artefact to a museum they would realize a capital gain of $900. Half 
that capital gain is taxable. Reform is saying this is a rich man's 
scheme, so let us assume the highest marginal rate, in which case 
they would pay tax of $225 on the taxable capital gain. That means 
that the net cash to the owner of the artefact would be $725 on the 
sale to the museum of the $1,000 artefact.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15746"> 15746 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	The legislation provides a tax credit to the donor of the artefact. 
If that artefact is shown to have a fair market value of $1,000, the 
tax credit would be 17 per cent on the first $200 and 29 per cent on 
the balance. In total, the tax credit or the reduction of taxes 
otherwise payable would be some $266.
<P>
	It really comes down to a matter of cash. A straight sale would 
generate $775 to the taxpayer who sold the artefact to a museum. If 
a tax credit system is used, the donor only gets $266. In that regard 
it is clear that those who are prepared to donate to our cultural and 
heritage institutions assets of value that have been determined by a 
rigorous process of review and assessment would be receiving in 
real cash terms substantially less than if they had sold them 
directly.
<P>
	If we are talking about true value, as the hon. member for 
Winnipeg St. James spoke of so well, since our cultural institutions 
have very little or no real cash to acquire assets this is really the 
only way to allow them to acquire those assets. It allows those 
institutions, the libraries, the archives, the galleries, et cetera, to 
remain current in terms of the cultural and heritage artefacts and 
documents that are available. It allows them to be competitive. It 
allows them, as the hon. member for Winnipeg St. James indicated, 
to continue to attract Canadians and visitors from around the world 
to visit our cultural and heritage institutions.
<P>
	It should be clear to Canadians that in Bill C-93 the mechanism 
of a tax credit allows our Canadian institutions to acquire these 
items at substantially less cost than if they had to buy them at their 
fair market value. Considering also the tourism value that is 
generated through our cultural and heritage institutions, there is no 
question that the bill provides a very advantageous arrangement for 
all Canadians.
<P>
	The hon. member for Erie might want to amplify or comment on 
the benefit to Canada that will be generated as a result of the 
provisions of Bill C-93.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maloney:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Mississauga 
South put forward in a very clear and concise manner the benefits 
of the tax credit to the cultural industry, as opposed to the loss of 
taxes. The difference is minuscule.
<P>
	When I bring my family to Ottawa there is nothing better than 
visiting the various museums. It is an interesting way to spend a 
day. Many people come to Ottawa to do that. They should be 
encouraged to do it, but not only in Ottawa. In my community of 
Erie there are small museums which are expanding. It certainly 
provides enjoyment for all people, not only in the riding of Erie but 
for the tourists who visit us.
<P>
	The bill can only amplify and increase the benefits we must 
ensure our cultural community has, not only for ourselves but for 
future generations.
<P>
	I had a conversation with the German ambassador to Canada last 
week. I was asking him about the reunification of East and West 
Germany. He said that one of the concerns they have is bringing 
their art objects back from countries such as Russia, where they 
were carted away during the war.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	Preservation of heritage and culture is important to all countries 
throughout the world. We must not let it happen in our country 
where we just cut it off as the Reform Party has suggested. It will 
flounder and die.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Loney (Edmonton North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity again to speak in support of Bill 
C-93, an act to amend the Cultural Property Export and Import Act, 
the Income Tax Act and the Tax Court of Canada Act.
<P>
	As members will recall, the purpose of the bill is to establish an 
appeal of decisions of the Canadian Cultural Property Export 
Review Board to the Tax Court of Canada. Members will also 
recall that this is the reinstatement of a right that had previously 
existed. I repeat that it is the reinstatement of a right that had 
previously existed but was lost when the responsibility for 
determining the fair market value of certified cultural property was 
transferred from Revenue Canada to the review board.
<P>
	Some people have incorrectly called tax incentives for donations 
to museums, art galleries, archives and libraries a tax loophole for 
the rich. While some wealthy people do benefit from these credits, 
there are also many people who donate important objects of 
Canadiana that have been in their families for generations.
<P>
	According to the Canadian Museums Association, over 60 
million people visited museums in Canada last year. As part of 
their experience of visiting a museum, these 60 million people 
were able to view objects that are now in public collections because 
of the tax credits available for donations. Without these incentives, 
many of these donations would not have been made and the objects 
would have instead been exported and sold to museums in other 
countries.
<P>
	If Canadians and visitors to Canada are not able to learn about 
our past by visiting museums, the damage to our history and to our 
identity as Canadians will be immeasurable. Museums, art 
galleries, archives and libraries are not just warehouses full of 
objects that never see the light of day. On the contrary, they are 
lively centres of education and learning where one learns about the 
past through objects that have been preserved for the present and 
future generations.
<P>
	The idea was perhaps most eloquently stated by Sir Arthur 
Doughty, Dominion Archivist of Canada from 1904 to 1935, when 
he wrote about archival documents: ``Of all the nation's assets, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15747"> 15747 </A></B>
<P>
archives are the most precious. They are the gift of one generation 
to another.  The extent of our care of them marks the extent of our 
civilization''. These words apply equally to the holdings of 
museums, art galleries and libraries.
<P>
	Tax incentives that offer partial financial compensation to a 
donor of cultural property are a small price to pay for the 
preservation of our national heritage. Through these tax credits, the 
Government of Canada is able to assist institutions to continue to 
acquire and preserve significant cultural objects when acquisition 
budgets are shrinking or non-existent.
<P>
	It is also important to consider these amendments in the tradition 
of tax incentives as a means to encourage charitable donations. 
Income tax exemptions for donations to educational institutions, 
hospitals and churches have been included in the Income Tax Act 
since its passage in 1916.
<P>
	In 1930 these exemptions were extended to registered charities. 
Tax exemptions for donations to educational and charitable 
institutions including museums, archives and libraries have 
therefore been a fundamental principle of the tax policy since 
income tax was first introduced.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	In recent years, the Income Tax Act has been amended so that tax 
credits now extend to gifts to non-profit organizations that provide 
housing for senior citizens, Canadian amateur athletic associations, 
Canadian municipalities, the United Nations and its agencies, and 
registered national art service organizations. As this list indicates, 
tax credits are part of an overall fiscal strategy to encourage 
donations to a wide range of organizations.
<P>
	Institutions designated pursuant to the Cultural Property Export 
and Import Act, that is institutions that have demonstrated they 
meet legal and professional requirements for the preservation of 
our cultural property, are both educational institutions and 
registered charities. Tax credits for donations to these institutions 
are therefore not new but instead are consistent with the history of 
giving in Canada.
<P>
	It has also been suggested that tax credits for donations of 
cultural property are a waste of taxpayers' money because donors 
are able to get rid of works of questionable importance. This 
suggestion demonstrates a lack of understanding of the collecting 
practices of Canada's custodial institutions and of the 
professionalism of Canadian curators. It also implies that every 
object acquired by a museum, art gallery, archive or library is 
automatically certified as a cultural property for income tax 
purposes.
<P>
	I would like to address each of these points in order, as an 
understanding of these issues is key to understanding the 
importance of the tax credits available for gifts of cultural property.
<P>
	First, with respect to the acquisition mandates and practices of 
Canadian custodial institutions, it must be  understood that these 
institutions are established with a specific mandate to acquire and 
preserve defined types of objects. Museum curators must therefore 
carefully select which objects they are going to acquire and must be 
able to demonstrate how they fit into this acquisition mandate. 
They do not accept just anything or everything. In fact, I have been 
told by senior museum curators that they turn down as many offers 
of gifts as they accept.
<P>
	Second, museums, archives and libraries are staffed by 
professional personnel who are acknowledged experts in their 
subject areas. They know what is culturally significant and what is 
not. They know what should be preserved and what sometimes 
unfortunately, must be allowed to perish or be exported. They are 
also keenly aware that their institutions cannot preserve every 
example of even important cultural objects. In short, professional 
judgment is applied when decisions are being made about what 
objects are worthy of being added to the permanent collection.
<P>
	Third, there seems to be an assumption that when an object is 
chosen for inclusion in a public collection it is somehow 
automatically certified as cultural property and therefore is eligible 
for a tax credit. Again, this is a fallacy. Just as professional 
judgment is applied to what will be required, it is also applied when 
deciding if an application for certification as cultural property for 
income tax purposes should be submitted. In short, only a fraction 
of the objects that are acquired in any given year receive a tax 
credit.
<P>
	To be eligible for certification, an object or a collection must 
satisfy the criteria of outstanding significance and national 
importance found in section 11(1) of the Cultural Property Export 
and Import Act, which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) whether that object is of outstanding significance by reason of its close 
association with Canadian history or national life, its aesthetic qualities, or its 
value in the study of the arts or sciences; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) whether the object is of such a degree of national importance that its loss to 
Canada would significantly diminish the national heritage.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is clear from these criteria that only truly significant objects 
are eligible for certification for income tax purposes. The decision 
is not made arbitrarily but rather according to specific legislative 
requirements that are applied uniformly to all objects that are 
considered for certification by the review board. It is also worth 
noting that the decision as to whether an object is of outstanding 
significance and national importance is made by a board composed 
of people who are active in the cultural community.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	The Cultural Property Export and Import Act requires that 
review boards be comprised of people who work in custodial 
institutions, people who buy and sell cultural property, or people 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15748"> 15748 </A></B>
<P>
who actively collect objects that are important to Canada's cultural 
heritage. The review  board is therefore a board of experts who are 
knowledgeable about both the significant and fair market value of 
cultural property.
<P>
	When the previous government decided to transfer the 
responsibility for determining the fair market value of cultural 
property from Revenue Canada to the Canadian Cultural Property 
Export Review Board it did so without consultation. Members of 
the review board were not consulted. Dealers and collectors of art 
and antiques were not consulted. Custodial institutions were not 
consulted.
<P>
	In the course of implementing its new mandate, the review board 
sometimes lowered the proposed fair market value of cultural 
property. While this was inevitable and had also been the practice 
at Revenue Canada, the result was that some donors felt that their 
donations had been undervalued. When they attempted to appeal 
the board's determination, it was discovered that the right of appeal 
that had existed under the Income Tax Act had been lost.
<P>
	In response to the concerns raised, consultations then took place 
with members of the review board, dealers, donors and 
representatives of the institutions that collect cultural property. 
Their response was unanimous: The right to appeal review board 
decisions was necessary to ensure that the system continued to 
work fairly.
<P>
	Bill C-93 is a manifestation of the will of the people. It is not 
something that was dreamed up by this government, nor is it an 
expansion of existing tax incentives for the donation of cultural 
property. It is instead the reinstatement of a right that was lost in 
1991. It is also a tangible demonstration that this government 
listens to the people of Canada and is prepared to move quickly to 
correct imbalances and inequities in the tax system.
<P>
	There has been much talk from members of the third party about 
fairness in the tax system yet they oppose a bill that is just about 
that, fairness. The current system with the lack of an appeal of 
determination of fair market value has been characterized by many 
people as being unfair. The establishment of not one but two appeal 
processes will restore fairness to the system. It will ensure that if 
donors believe they have a legitimate dispute with the review board 
they will be able to pursue it first with the review board and, if 
necessary, in the tax courts.
<P>
	Donations to museums, archives and libraries involve a 
triangular relationship between the donor, the recipient institution 
and when certification as cultural property is required, between the 
donor and the institution on one hand and the Canadian Cultural 
Property Export Review Board on the other. This relationship is 
one of mutual respect and co-operation in the preservation of 
Canada's heritage in movable cultural property. This relationship 
must also include a mechanism for dispute resolution if and when 
the participants cannot agree about the value of the gift.
<P>
	The appeal process of determinations by the Canadian Cultural 
Property Export Review Board proposed in Bill C-93 will permit
<P>
any donor of cultural property who disagrees with a review board 
determination the opportunity to pursue this first with the board 
and if necessary ultimately with the Tax Court of Canada.
<P>
	The amendments proposed in the bill should be viewed as a 
guarantee of the donor's right to natural justice through an appeal 
to the judicial system if that is warranted. These amendments 
should also be viewed as a reinstatement of a right of appeal that 
was lost in 1991 when the responsibility for determining fair 
market value was transferred to the review board.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	We believe it is important that the decisions of government 
boards and agencies be subject to appeal because even in the honest 
exercise of judgment, differences of opinion can occur. An open 
and transparent process with respect to determinations by the 
review board is essential and the right to pursue the matter in the 
courts, if no other resolution can be found, is consistent with both 
the Canadian legal system and the concept of natural justice.
<P>
	As Canadians we have the privilege to live in a country with 
many cultures. The material history, the cultural property of many 
diverse groups that make up Canadian society must continue to be 
preserved for the benefit of all Canadians. I believe the 
amendments contained in Bill C-93 will help to ensure this happens 
and will only improve the already unique Canadian approach to 
protecting cultural property.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would urge the support of the House for Bill 
C-93.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the comments by my dear colleague, the member for 
Edmonton North.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is a very innovative bill. I have had a chance to review both 
the comments and some of the supporting documentation provided 
by the minister of heritage.
<P>
	I am interested in the comments that my colleague from 
Edmonton made just a moment ago. In Ontario riding we have 
many museums and a number of people have donated artefacts over 
the years. It may come as a surprise to the House that Ontario 
riding was the riding and the county after which the rest of the 
province was named in 1867. Previous to that it was Upper Canada 
and Canada East.
<P>
	I have a very simple question for the member. Perhaps he could 
explain to the House some of the significant impacts the bill might 
have in the area like Edmonton where I know there are many 
people of various backgrounds who moved there over the years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15749"> 15749 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
Particularly the francophone community in that part of the country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loney:</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to the hon. member's 
question, Edmonton and northern Alberta in particular are areas 
where the descendants of many cultural and ethnic groups coming 
from many different countries settled, particularly as he pointed 
out the francophone community.
<P>
	The amendments in the bill will give the descendants of the 
people who settled the west, particularly after 1905 when it became 
a province, the opportunity to pass on to the province, which is now 
their home province, some of things that their parents, 
grandparents and possibly great grandparents brought not only 
from eastern Canada and other parts of Canada when they settled 
that part of the country but also from their countries of origin.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak in support of Bill C-93, an act to amend the 
Cultural Property Export and Import Act, the Income Tax Act and 
the Tax Court of Canada Act.
<P>
	Throughout Canada publicly funded organizations and 
institutions are being forced to re-evaluate their mandates, their 
operating procedures and their very reasons for being with 
increasing costs and reduced levels of financial support from both 
the public and the private sectors. The existence of many of these 
institutions is being debated. In my riding of Victoria-Haliburton 
it is a great worry for many cultural organizations.
<P>
	The cultural sector in Canada has developed through a 
combination of public funding, private funding and volunteerism. 
In order to meet the targets to reduce the deficit the government 
believes all institutions that receive public funds must become 
more self-sufficient.
<P>
	However, government is not going to just cut them adrift. Instead 
it will develop structural measures to assist them through this 
transition period. Tax credits, whether to assist in the development 
of a distinctively Canadian film industry or for the donation of 
cultural property to designated institutions such as those available 
through the Cultural Property Export and Import Act, are the one 
way the government is able to help through that transition time. It 
must be remembered that heritage institutions and related activities 
also contribute to the economy of Canada. The impact of heritage 
institutions and their activities are increasingly having beneficial, 
economic impacts on communities across Canada. A recent Nova 
Scotia study, for example, noted that the economic impact of the 
six major museums in that province significantly exceeded the 
direct expenditures associated with the operating of the facilities.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	Similarly, data available from a series of studies conducted in 
Alberta show that spending by visitors to historic sites averaged 
$50 million annually. These same studies have demonstrated that 
museums such as the Tyrrell Museum in Drumheller are often the 
top tourist attractions in a region.
<P>
	Much of the activities of museums, archives and libraries also 
support research, knowledge and public education. The research 
conducted by the staff of these institutions often leads to seminal 
discoveries and the effect of this can have impact in other areas 
such as the production and dissemination of CD-ROMs and 
publications.
<P>
	Exhibitions also educate the public, create employment and 
contribute to cultural tourism. Visitors who travel to other cities to 
view exhibits, stay in hotels, eat in restaurants, shop, attend events, 
take tours and spend money in a variety of sectors of the economy 
because they travel to a city or town to visit a museum.
<P>
	The recent exhibit at the Art Gallery of Ontario of impressionist 
paintings from the Barnes collection, is an excellent example of 
this and has provided concrete proof of the contribution cultural 
institutions can make to the economy.
<P>
	During the three and one half months this exhibit was on display 
in Toronto, almost 600,000 people visited the Art Gallery of 
Ontario specifically to see this exhibit. According to an economic 
impact study that was conducted afterward, almost $75 million was 
spent in the province of Ontario on trips or excursions that brought 
these visitors to the exhibit. This $75 million expenditure created 
ripple effects throughout Ontario's economy that resulted in the 
production of $137 million in goods and services.
<P>
	In addition to these impressive statistics, the Barnes exhibit 
produced employment and the amount of taxes associated with this 
event totalled almost $22 million for the municipal, provincial and 
federal governments.
<P>
	While these almost 600,000 visitors went to this cultural 
institution to see an exhibition they also had the opportunity to 
view works from the permanent collection of the Art Gallery of 
Ontario. The same is true for visitors to any other museum, art 
gallery, archives or library. Some of the works on display from the 
permanent collection would undoubtedly have been acquired as a 
result of the tax incentives offered by the Cultural Property Export 
and Import Act contained in Bill C-93.
<P>
	This represents another side of the economic impact of cultural 
institutions. The idea that the foregone tax revenue that results 
from a donation of certified cultural property is somehow lost 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15750"> 15750 </A></B>
<P>
money is simply not true. In the first place, the work of art or the 
artefact that is being donated to an art gallery or a museum will 
either have  been with the donor's family for generations or it will 
have been purchased by the donor at some point in the past and is 
now being donated to a public collection.
<P>
	If, in the case of a work of art, it was bought through a 
commercial gallery or an auction house, an open market 
transaction occurred. Money changed hands during that transaction 
and taxes were paid to governments both in the form of sales tax 
and income tax paid by the art dealer or the auction house.
<P>
	Similarly, these objects, often of great cultural significance, 
were purchased with after tax dollars, that is, with the disposable 
income of the donor. It is important to remember that a donor of 
cultural property is not reimbursed dollar for dollar for the fair 
market value of the donation. Instead a donor receives a tax credit 
equal to 17 per cent of the first $200 and 29 per cent of the fair 
market value beyond that. Simple mathematics indicate that the tax 
refund, the forgone revenue the donor receives is only a fraction of 
the fair market value of the object.
<P>
	If a person buys an object with after tax dollars, donates it to a 
distinguished institution and then receives a tax credit for 29 per 
cent of the fair market value of the object, it is difficult to see how 
anyone can fault that individual. They will also have donated it to a 
public institution where it becomes part of Canada's cultural 
patrimony that is accessible to everyone.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	Members of the third party have objected to tax credits for 
donations but they have not yet addressed the purpose and intent of 
this bill. Tax credits are not the issue. In any event, I believe I have 
adequately demonstrated that tax credits for donations provide an 
incentive and a modest acknowledgement of a donor's generosity. 
They do not, as stated earlier, even come close to reimbursing an 
individual and in fact can contribute to significant revenue gains in 
a variety of areas of the economy.
<P>
	It is perhaps worthwhile reminding hon. members that the 
purpose of this bill is to establish an appeal of decisions of the 
Canadian Cultural Property Export Review Board to the Tax Court 
of Canada. It establishes two types of appeal: the right of review of 
a determination by the review board itself and then, if necessary, 
the right to appeal to the Tax Court of Canada.
<P>
	This need for the right of appeal is not new however but a 
re-establishment of the right of appeal that was inadvertently lost in 
1991 when the responsibility for determining fair market value was 
transferred from Revenue Canada to the review board. There has 
been concern that the right of appeal would simply add to the 
backlog of cases to the tax court. We do not know if this will 
happen but every effort has been made to ensure that it does not. 
The redetermination process will allow  the majority of 
disagreements to be settled directly with the revenue board.
<P>
	Is the possibility of adding a few more cases to the workload of 
the tax court a reason to deny someone that right of appeal when 
they disagree with a decision that directly affects them? Is this a 
reason to open the reinstatement of right that was lost and now 
denies some individuals natural justice through their inability to 
appeal to the courts? I believe not.
<P>
	It is also questionable if the reinstatement, and this must be 
emphasized, of a right of appeal will lead to an increase in appeals 
to the Tax Court of Canada. This right to appeal existed before 
when the responsibility for fair market value resided with Revenue 
Canada. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that the tax court 
is in a position to resume this responsibility.
<P>
	People from every province and territory have made donations to 
institutions designated under the Cultural Property Export and 
Import Act and people from around the world are now able to share 
in the enjoyments of the works of art, archival collections, books 
and artefacts that are preserved in public collections as a result.
<P>
	These cultural institutions both preserve Canada's heritage in 
movable cultural property and make a significant contribution to 
the economy. Culture is not a frill enjoyed by only a few people but 
a valuable economic activity as well. To ensure that it continues to 
play this vital dual role, our museums, archives and libraries must 
have vibrant collections that will both contribute to knowledge and 
attract attention and visitors.
<P>
	The tax incentives offered by the Cultural Property Export and 
Import Act are an important means to ensure that the donations of 
significant cultural property will continue. Without a right of 
appeal, as contained in Bill C-93, some donors will feel that they 
have no recourse if they disagree with a decision of the Canadian 
Cultural Properties Export Review Board and they may not be 
prepared to make a donation.
<P>
	The appeal process will contribute to the preservation of 
Canada's cultural heritage collections of international stature. Both 
activities are important to Canada as a nation. I encourage all 
members of the House to support Bill C-93.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member. I congratulate him 
on a very able speech.
<P>
	The member must know that at second reading of the bill the 
members of the Reform Party voted against it. Some of us were 
kind of surprised at that because the bill does something to promote 
Canada's culture. It does quite a lot to promote Canada's culture I 
would suggest, particularly the culture that is contained in 
Canada's museums and art galleries.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15751"> 15751 </A></B>
<P>
	Does the hon. member agree with me that the Reform Party 
policy on this matter is inappropriate and that Reform Party 
members should be supporting the bill since they must recognize, 
as we do, that culture is an extremely important part of Canada's 
political, economic and social life?
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	The culture represented by Canada's art galleries and museums 
is a very significant part of our heritage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Reilly:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
Kingston and the Islands for his question. It is a very interesting 
one. I could not imagine not being in support of the bill.
<P>
	Museums, art galleries, archives and libraries in every province 
and territory benefit through the receipt of donations of cultural 
property as a result of these tax credits.
<P>
	I recently sent a collection of postcards, with no value or tax 
incentive for me, that I received dealing with western history, 
particularly in the province of Manitoba. It was sent in the 1800s to 
my riding of Victoria-Haliburton.
<P>
	I came across it in a collection and managed to pick it up for very 
little and I donated it to the Canadian Heritage Museum in 
Manitoba. It sent me a thank you. I should have asked for a receipt 
but I did not feel the collection had a lot of value.
<P>
	The collection significantly added to the heritage, the culture and 
preservation of culture in western Canada. It is very important for 
an eastern Ontario member to be concerned with western Canada 
and with the culture of western Canada, with the preservation of the 
culture in western Canada.
<P>
	I have a lot of trouble understanding why the Reform Party 
would not support such a bill. I know quite specifically that the 
areas those members represent have gained from Liberal members 
such as me, the member for Kingston and the Islands and the 
member for London-Middlesex.
<P>
	Somewhere along the line we have donated without any tax 
receipt. The collection I donated was postcards, but it was 
invaluable. I should have had it appraised. I felt it should be in a 
museum and was something people should be able to enjoy. It is 
preserved forever instead of being thrown in the garbage or kept in 
some personal collection where it is not seen.
<P>
	I also collect guns, much to the dismay of a number of people 
here. The gun bill is still in the other place. I have a gun that was 
carried by an army doctor in the first world war. I guess we would 
call it an oxymoron that doctors were issued handguns in the first 
world war. I have had recent discussions with the museum in 
Lindsay to donate that gun. If I am lucky enough to get a tax receipt 
for it, that would be fair. It is the only one of its  kind registered in 
Canada and therefore should be preserved so that the public can see 
it.
<P>
	Even going into the law and order issues Reform Party members 
seem to stand for, I cannot imagine why they would be in any kind 
of discourse with the bill. It is necessary. It will help preserve our 
culture and our heritage, a very important part of the fibre of our 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to speak in support of 
Bill C-93, an act to amend the Cultural Property Export and Import 
Act, the Income Tax Act and the Tax Court of Canada Act.
<P>
	The bill, as previous members mentioned, establishes two 
processes. The first gives the donor or the recipient institution the 
right to request that the review board reconsider its initial 
determination of fair market value.
<P>
	If after receiving a redetermination from the board the donor is 
still not satisfied, he or she may take the second step of appealing 
the board's decision to the Tax Court of Canada. The fair market 
value of cultural property certified by the review board is eligible 
as a tax credit of 17 per cent on the first $200 and 29 per cent on the 
balance over $200. The donor can claim the fair market value of the 
gift up to the total amount of his or her net income and there is no 
tax payable on any capital gain resulting from this gift.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	This is a technical bill, as was mentioned by colleagues earlier. 
The objective is the preservation of Canada's cultural heritage.
<P>
	I understand from a tax policy point of view where Reform 
members are coming from. They have a system of tax reform not 
unlike my own approach, a single tax system in which they want to 
flush out from the entire tax act of Canada all the preferences given 
in the various sectors.
<P>
	However, until we as a government get involved in total tax 
reform we cannot deprive sectors of our economy vital to the 
economic soundness of the country the opportunity of growth and 
participation in the economy. This is where the Reform Party is 
short sighted.
<P>
	If we say to the artists, the cultural community, that we do not 
want to give them the opportunity to participate in the tax act 
through tax credits, we cannot say no to them without having the 
same approach for the energy sector, the forestry sector, the 
tourism sector and so on. I am philosophically supportive of where 
Reform members are coming from but they cannot oppose only one 
sector.
<P>
	Until we get a commitment from the House for total tax reform 
we have to continue to do these tax credits on a sector by sector 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15752"> 15752 </A></B>
<P>
basis. Otherwise we will be punishing  one community while other 
communities get a free ride. That is wrong.
<P>
	Do we want to punish the cultural community and let the very 
wealthy people have the ability to send their kids to ivy league 
universities where they get tax credits or estate tax redemptions of 
up to $600,000 on property in the United States? It does not work.
<P>
	I want to come at the bill from another point of view, what 
cultural properties contribute to the tourism sector. I will give a 
specific example of a museum in Toronto which I know the 
Speaker is very familiar with, Canada's Hockey Hall of Fame. This 
is an example of a museum that celebrates the cultural soul of the 
country, hockey.
<P>
	About three weeks ago I had the opportunity of going through 
the Hockey Hall of Fame. I was absolutely blown away by the 
historical relics on display, with the feeling one gets as one goes 
through the hall of fame and looks at the history of hockey, its 
contribution in terms of job creation in hockey, the celebration of 
those magical moments in great Stanley Cup goals and so on. One 
walks out of that building with a sense of pride which I cannot 
describe on the floor of the House.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	There is another feature to this museum on which we are not 
dwelling. It is relevant to all museums, all cultural property 
establishments across Canada. These are tourism assets. The 
spinoff we bring to our community when we celebrate and package 
our cultural properties is phenomenal. What industries are affected 
by these tourism assets? We are talking about hotels and 
restaurants. We are talking about replicas of these assets 
manufactured in small craft shops. These cultural property assets 
and historic museums exist right across the country.
<P>
	I have been glancing through ``On the Road to Quebec'', a guide 
to the sightseeing attractions in Quebec. We are on the eve of a very 
important decision in our country. As I was going through this 
guide I could not help but feel emotional about some of the great 
cultural and historic sights and assets in Quebec. There is a litany 
of sights, tourist attractions and properties that celebrate the great 
history and the great contributions Quebec has made to Canada. 
Just going through those assets in Quebec right now alone makes 
the bill worthy of merit.
<P>
	I believe many Canadians right now are listening to these 
debates in the House because we are going through a very fragile 
time in our country's history. Many members are receiving calls in 
their offices by people concerned about the referendum on 
Monday. This is no secret. There have been many newscasts on 
television and radio and many newspaper articles stating that 
things are very fragile right now.
<P>
	To Canadians not living in Quebec, if ever there was a time when 
they could celebrate the great cultural assets  in Quebec, try to 
travel this weekend to Quebec to visit and celebrate some of these 
great Canadian cultural assets all over Quebec, especially in the 
outlying regions. We have great centres where our history and 
cultural assets are celebrated. This would be the weekend for 
Canadians, if they could find the time, to go and visit these centres, 
these communities and these small hamlets. While they are there 
they can go to the local manor, the local inn, stay for the weekend, 
talk to the community and express to them our hope and our wish 
that on Monday they vote for Canada.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	If a lot of Canadians did something like that, they would be 
making a great contribution in making themselves feel comfortable 
in another region of their country, and probably the Quebecers 
would welcome it. It has been my experience that the hospitality 
that Quebecers show, especially to people from outside their 
province, is first class-the restaurants, the inns, all the activities 
that go on in Quebec.
<P>
	I want to reflect for a second on the experience you and I have 
both had, Mr. Speaker, as fathers whose sons played in the Quebec 
pee-wee tournament, another great celebration we have in our 
country. Young boys from all across Canada go to Quebec City 
every February, a majority of them unilingual English, and play in 
the Quebec pee-wee tournament. One of the unique features of that 
Quebec pee-wee tournament is the fact that each and every member 
of the teams from across Canada lives with a family in a home in 
Quebec City.
<P>
	We both know, Mr. Speaker, that there is a very special feeling, a 
very special emotional attachment that stays with those young men 
when they finish that tournament and come home to their 
communities right across Canada. This tournament, which has been 
going on for almost 80 years now, has been one of the unique 
experiences young boys celebrate. It is a substantial and concrete 
example of hockey as a cultural instrument pulling people together 
in the country.
<P>
	I have absolutely no difficulty in supporting the bill before the 
House today. If our culture is strong, if our culture is celebrated in 
every aspect, our ability to galvanize and stay as a nation increases. 
In my mind, over the last few years we have had too little 
celebration, too little promotion of our history, of our culture and 
all those things that bind us as a nation.
<P>
	As I mentioned the other day in the House, we have become so 
preoccupied and so focused on deficit and debt reduction that we 
are actually melting away some of the glue that has been holding us 
together as a community and as a country. When we see cultural 
instruments as just another expense and in the name of deficit and 
debt we have to cut, we have missed the whole point.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15753"> 15753 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	The celebration and support of culture is an investment in the 
community. It is an investment not only in an economic sense but 
also in a spiritual sense. If we were to spend more time celebrating 
that aspect of our cultural heritage, we probably would not have 
some of those parochial thought processes that seem to be so 
apparent today taking over the agenda.
<P>
	I repeat that I celebrate the bill. I support the bill. I appeal to all 
Canadians who are looking for something to do this weekend to 
travel to Quebec and look at the great Canadian cultural properties 
that celebrate not just the heritage of Quebec but the heritage of 
Canada. It is those kinds of discussions, one region to another, one 
community to another, that ultimately will lead, I hope, to a great 
victory for Canada on Monday.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> That is a bit out of the norm, 
but while I would not this day or any other day compromise the 
integrity or impartiality of the Chair, I want to associate myself 
with the member for Broadview-Greenwood, particularly his 
memories of our young boys going to Quebec City for the Quebec 
pee-wee hockey tournament. I thank him for including me in that 
statement.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to support and address Bill C-93, the legislation that 
establishes an appeal for a decision of the Canadian Cultural 
Property Export Review Board to the Tax Court of Canada.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to amend the Cultural Property Export 
and Import Act with consequential amendments to the Income Tax 
Act and the Tax Court of Canada Act to establish an appeal of the 
determinations by the Canadian Cultural Property Export Review 
Board of the fair market value of certified cultural property.
<P>
	In December 1991 the responsibility for determining the fair 
market value of cultural property donated to designated Canadian 
museums, art galleries, and libraries was transferred from Revenue 
Canada Taxation to the review board. The review board assumed 
this new responsibility at its meeting held in January 1992. No 
provision for appeal of review board decisions was included in the 
legislative amendments, despite the fact that the right of appeal had 
existed when this responsibility was with Revenue Canada.
<P>
	Donors and custodial institutions expressed serious concerns 
about the lack of an appeal process. The Department of Canadian 
Heritage, in co-operation with the review board, then undertook a 
series of consultations within the community about the need for an 
appeal process. As a result of these consultations it was agreed that 
legislative amendments should be prepared to establish the right of 
appeal to the Tax Court of Canada.
<P>
	The bill establishes two processes. The first gives the donor or 
recipient institution the right to request that the review board 
reconsider its initial determination of fair market value. If after 
receiving a redetermination from the board the donor is still not 
satisfied, he or she may take the second step of appealing the 
board's decision to the Tax Court of Canada.
<P>
	It is appropriate that the bill is receiving third reading today, 
October 24, because today marks the 50th anniversary of the 
United Nations. It was 50 years ago today, within a few months of 
the end of World War II, that the United Nations formally came 
into being when its charter took effect. The United Nations has the 
difficult mandate of maintaining international peace and easing 
global suffering.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	We are also approaching the end of the United Nations world 
decade for cultural development. Launched in 1988, this decade 
will conclude at the end of 1997. The purpose of the world decade 
for cultural development is to promote activities that enhance the 
cultural components of development and undertake research and 
pilot projects that focus on the relationship between culture and 
development.
<P>
	Through agencies such as UNESCO, the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the UN also has 
responsibility for literacy, education and contributions to scientific 
and cultural development around the world.
<P>
	Canada has played an active role in the work of both the United 
Nations and UNESCO and is recognized internationally for the 
work it has done to protect the cultural property of developing 
nations. During the 1960s Mexico and Peru in particular, but many 
other southern and central American countries as well, experienced 
heavy losses of cultural property through illicit trafficking. Their 
appeal to UNESCO for a method to stop this led in 1970 to the 
UNESCO convention on the means of prohibiting and preventing 
the illicit import, export and transfer of ownership of cultural 
property. This convention, while it deals with measures to prevent 
the import, export and illicit transfer of cultural objects, places the 
onus on each country to develop their own measures to protect and 
preserve their cultural heritage.
<P>
	To join the international movement to protect cultural property 
Canada passed the Cultural Property Export and Import Act in 
September 1977. The purpose of the act is twofold: first, to ensure 
the preservation in Canada of significant examples of the nation's 
cultural, historic and scientific heritage; and, second, to protect in 
Canada the legitimate interests of foreign states concerned with the 
preservation of their cultural property.
<P>
	These objectives are accomplished by the following features of 
the act: first, the establishment of an export control list of defined 
categories of cultural property,  which restricts their export without 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15754"> 15754 </A></B>
<P>
a permit; second, the establishment of the Canadian Cultural 
Property Export Review Board to review applications for export 
permits and applications for the certification of cultural property 
for income tax purposes; third, the establishment of income tax 
incentives for gifts or sales of cultural property to designated 
Canadian institutions; and, fourth, procedures for the recovery and 
return of foreign cultural property that has been illegally exported 
from its country of origin.
<P>
	In 1978 Canada became a signatory to the 1970 UNESCO 
convention on the means of prohibiting and preventing the illicit 
export and transfer of ownership of cultural property. The 
convention, which contains measures to prevent the illicit import, 
export and transfer or ownership of cultural objects, places the 
onus on each signatory country to develop its own legislation to 
protect and preserve its cultural heritage and to establish measures 
to facilitate the return of illegally exported cultural property to its 
country of origin.
<P>
	The Cultural Property Export and Import Act contains 
provisions whereby it is a criminal offence to import into Canada 
cultural property that has been illegally exported from a country 
that is a signatory to an international cultural property agreement.
<P>
	Protection of another country's heritage is not sufficient if we do 
not protect our own. Canada therefore put into place export 
controls to regulate the export of cultural property from Canada. It 
is imperative that we discuss here today the control system. It 
should be noted that any object that is more than 50 years old and 
made by a person who is no longer living is subject to export 
control. For such objects, a cultural property export permit must be 
obtained before they can leave the country.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	The Canadian cultural property export control list provides a 
detailed description of the classes of objects that are subject to 
control. It divides cultural property into seven categories or groups 
of objects. The first is objects recovered from the soil or waters of 
Canada. The second class is ethnographic arts. The third is military 
objects. The fourth is decorative art. The fifth is fine art. Sixth is 
scientific and technological objects. The seventh is books, 
documents, photographs and sound recordings.
<P>
	To apply for a cultural property export permit, the exporter 
submits an application to a permit issuing officer who determines if 
the object is included in the controlled list. If it is not, the permit is 
issued forthwith. If it is included in the list, the permit issuing 
officer refers the permit application to the appropriate expert 
examiner.
<P>
	The expert examiner must then determine if the object meets the 
criteria of outstanding significance and national importance found 
in section 11 of the act which  reads as follows: ``The object is of 
outstanding significance by reason of its close association with 
Canadian history or national life, its aesthetic qualities or its value 
in the study of the arts and sciences; and whether that object is of 
such a degree of national importance that its loss to Canada would 
significantly diminish the national heritage''.
<P>
	It should be noted that if the expert examiner advises that the 
permit not be issued, the permit officer advises the applicant 
accordingly. The applicant either retains the object in Canada or 
appeals the expert examiner's decision to the Canadian Cultural 
Property Export Review Board.
<P>
	The review board then hears the appeal and either overrules the 
expert examiner or affirms his recommendation. If the review 
board overrules the expert examiner, the permit is granted 
immediately. If the board agrees with him, a delay period of 
between two and six months is established.
<P>
	There is an incentive system. The act establishes the Canadian 
Cultural Property Export Review Board which consists of nine 
members plus a chairman. It is composed of two representatives of 
the public at large, including the chairman, and four members each 
from the curatorial and dealer collector communities. As such, the 
board is an independent body of individuals with a recognized 
knowledge and interest in Canadian heritage.
<P>
	The work that occupies most of the board's time is not export 
control. The certification for income tax purposes of cultural 
property donated to Canadian institutions is of primary concern.
<P>
	At the time of passage of the Cultural Property Export and 
Import Act, the Income Tax Act was amended to provide an 
exemption from the payment of capital gains tax for gifts or sales 
of certified cultural property. In addition, the value of objects or 
collections that have been determined to be of outstanding 
significance and national importance is eligible as a tax credit up to 
100 per cent of net income instead of up to 20 per cent of net 
income that may be claimed as an exemption for charitable 
donations.
<P>
	Prior to these amendments, capital gains tax was payable for 
gifts in kind. Only federal and provincial government institutions 
could offer tax credits up to 100 per cent of net income.
<P>
	From 1977 to 1990 the review board had only an informal 
advisory role in the determination of the fair market value of gifts 
of cultural property. In 1990 the responsibility for determining the 
fair market value of certified cultural property was transferred 
from Revenue Canada Taxation to the review board. This was 
confirmed by legislative amendments to both the Cultural Property 
Export and Import Act and the Income Tax Act in 1991.
<P>
	No provision was made for appealing determinations of the 
review board. The right of appeal contained in the  Income Tax Act 
was then lost. The need for an appeal process was identified and 
acknowledged in 1993. By establishing the right of appeal, 
potential donors will be assured that if they are dissatisfied with the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15755"> 15755 </A></B>
<P>
review board determination, they will have recourse to the Tax 
Court of Canada.
<P>
	With the agreement of the Tax Court of Canada, the appeal to the 
tax court has been made retroactive to January 1992. That provides 
all donors who have made a gift since the right to appeal was lost 
and who wish to pursue an appeal with both the opportunity and the 
legal right to do so.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	Determinations of fair market value are now being made by the 
members of the review board, people with professional expertise in 
the various domains of cultural property who are also active 
participants in the various marketplaces where it is sold. These 
same people already experience an expertise in a quasi-judicial 
capacity, that of hearing appeals when export permits have been 
denied. It is only appropriate and sensible therefore that they 
assume the additional responsibility as they are experts in the 
subject matter with experience as an appeal board.
<P>
	An open and transparent process both at the time the review 
board determines and if necessary redetermines the fair market 
value of cultural property is essential. The right to pursue the 
matter in the courts if no other resolution can be found is consistent 
with both the Canadian legal system and the concept of natural 
justice.
<P>
	As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, let 
us remember that Bill C-93 is very much in the spirit of everything 
the United Nations stands for. The Cultural Property Export and 
Import Act has its philosophical roots in the activities of the United 
Nations because it both protects Canada's heritage and allows 
Canada to become a signatory to the 1970 convention.
<P>
	Bill C-93 is about fairness and natural justice, two principles that 
are fundamental to the United Nations. On this the 50th anniversary 
of the United Nations, it is only appropriate that all members of this 
House support this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, over the past few years a number of donors and 
custodial institutions have felt uneasy about the arbitrary decision 
making upon which the value of the goods donated to a museum or 
an art gallery were executed.
<P>
	In the mind of the member for Central Nova, are the protocol and 
processes that will allow for due process and the laws of natural 
justice to take place incorporated in the bill?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Skoke:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker. An open and transparent process 
at the time the review board determines and if  necessary 
redetermines the fair market value of cultural property is essential 
and the bill provides for that. The right to pursue the matter in the 
courts if no other resolution can be found is consistent with both 
our Canadian legal system and our concept of natural justice.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like the hon. 
member to expand very briefly on cultural property and the 
valuation and benefits to society in her area in particular. Could she 
expand on the benefits they receive?
<P>
	I agree with her wholeheartedly that reinstating the right of 
appeal is necessary. I want to commend her for her comments 
today.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Skoke:</B> Mr. Speaker, cultural property valued at 
approximately $60 million is donated to Canadian institutions each 
year. In my riding we have the Nova Scotia Museum of Industry 
which is a very new facility. It is one which is relying on cultural 
property donations. We look forward to hearing from anyone in 
Canada who wishes to make a contribution to our industry, science 
and technology museum.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too 
am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of Bill C-93, 
an act to amend the Cultural Property Export and Import Act, the 
Income Tax Act and the Tax Court of Canada Act.
<P>
	I also thank my French teacher, Madame Paré, for allowing me 
to interrupt my class to come to the House to speak on this 
important bill. To Madame Paré I say:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
I thank you for being patient with me.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On Friday, October 20, the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> carried a story with 
the headline: ``Museums, historic sites become hot ticket''. The 
story notes that museums and historic sites across Canada have 
been attracting more visitors and even a little more money.
<P>
	A Statistics Canada study also discovered that 12,000 full time 
and almost 20,000 part time employees worked in heritage 
institutions in 1992 and 1993. In addition to these paid employees, 
over 54,000 people volunteered their time to work in these same 
heritage institutions. These people are all working for one purpose 
and that is to ensure that Canada's heritage is preserved and that it 
is preserved in public institutions where it will be available for the 
enjoyment of all Canadians.
<P>
	Few collecting institutions today have any funds to purchase 
objects for their collections. As a result, they must rely on 
donations. The tax incentives available for donations to custodial 
institutions that have demonstrated they meet professional 
standards is one  way in which the Government of Canada is able to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15756"> 15756 </A></B>
<P>
provide assistance to ensure that their collections continue to 
reflect Canada's heritage.
<P>
	Donations to registered charities are eligible for tax credits, 
although the total value of gifts to charity in any one year cannot 
exceed 20 per cent of net income. Donations of cultural property 
that have been found to be, in the words of the act, of outstanding 
significance and national importance are eligible for a tax credit up 
to 100 per cent of net income and are exempt from the payment of 
capital gains tax.
<P>
	That does not mean they receive a tax refund equivalent to the 
fair market value of their donation. Non-refundable federal tax 
credits are based on 17 per cent of the first $200 of value of the 
donation and 29 per cent of any amount above that. When the 
exemption from capital gains tax is added to this, the best possible 
tax treatment a donor may receive is a refund equivalent to 50 per 
cent of the fair market value of the object or collection they are 
donating.
<P>
	A donation to a museum means that a donor is donating both 
significant cultural property and 50 per cent of the fair market 
value to the institution. It would be more profitable to sell an object 
in the open market than to donate it to a cultural institution. Tax 
credits are a fiscal measure that provide an enticement and an 
acknowledgement of the importance of the donation, but they are 
not meant to represent financial compensation.
<P>
	I will give a very brief example. I know that many Canadians 
who are watching the debate really want to know whether or not 
this is some sort of a scheme for rich Canadians, as the Reform 
Party would like to characterize it.
<P>
	If a taxpayer had an object of art with a fair market value 
appraised at $1,000 and that object of art cost only $100 when it 
was acquired many years ago and the taxpayer sold that object of 
art to a museum for the $1,000 fair market value, it would generate 
a $900 capital gain, half of which is taxable. On that capital gain, 
even at the highest marginal rate, $225 in income tax would be 
paid. That means the net proceeds to the donor would only be $775.
<P>
	If we compare that to the tax treatment that is being afforded to 
the donor under Bill C-93, the donation of the $1,000 artefact 
would generate a tax credit of 17 per cent on the first $200, or $34, 
and 29 per cent on the remaining $800, or $232. In total, the cash 
value of the refund to the taxpayer would only be $266. That should 
be compared to the $775 they would have received had they sold 
the object outright.
<P>
	In brief, what it really means is that the libraries, archives, 
museums and other cultural and heritage institutions of Canada are 
able to acquire for substantially less very important artefacts and 
cultural and heritage items for Canada. It is much more than they  
would be able to afford by paying the fair market value in cash.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	Approximately 1,100 applications for certification for tax credits 
are received annually with a total fair market value of 
approximately $60 million Canadian. Because this is a tax credit it 
results in foregone revenue of approximately $25 million to $30 
million annually. However, when compared to other tax incentive 
programs this is a very small amount of foregone revenue and has 
an impact far beyond the dollar value of the cultural property that is 
being preserved.
<P>
	Much of the cultural property being donated because of these tax 
incentives would otherwise be lost to Canada, as it would be 
exported and sold on the international market. By keeping these 
objects in Canada and in public collections they become part of 
Canada's heritage.
<P>
	Approximately 300 institutions in every province and territory 
of Canada have their collections enriched each year because of the 
existence of these tax credits. The Cultural Property Export and 
Import Act therefore plays an important role in the development of 
heritage collections in Canada. It encourages donations of 
significant pieces of our patrimony to the people of Canada through 
public collections and these donations are forever for our 
enjoyment and for the enjoyment of our future generations.
<P>
	The legislation was meant to promote private donations as a 
means of indirect government support when acquisition funds 
could not be sustained. Many Canadians are unaware of the 
important role played by private collectors in the preservation of 
our national heritage. Objects formerly from private collections 
now enrich our public museums, just as the great museums of the 
world have been supported by private individuals for centuries.
<P>
	In Canada we have our own unique examples: the donation of Sir 
William Van Horne to the Musée des beaux-arts de Montréal; the 
Zacks bequest to the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto; the 
collection of Lord Beaverbrook, now proudly displayed in the 
Beaverbrook Art Gallery in Fredericton; Dr. Norman MacKenzie's 
collection, which forms the basis of the collection of the 
MacKenzie Art Gallery in Regina; the magnificent and diverse 
collection of the Harvey family, which is now in the Glenbow 
Museum in Calgary; and the generosity of the Koerner family to 
the Museum of Anthropology in the University of British 
Columbia.
<P>
	These museums now house the collections of their benefactors 
and founders. Some even owe their existence to these private 
individuals who had a passion for collecting a strong sense of 
Canada's history. Because of their generosity and their decision to 
enrich our heritage these works are now preserved and will be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15757"> 15757 </A></B>
<P>
appreciated by  future generations of Canadians as they appear in 
exhibitions and are made available for research purposes.
<P>
	Government has a legitimate role to play in these transactions 
and must facilitate the movement of cultural objects from the 
private to the public sector by taking reasonable steps that will 
encourage philanthropy.
<P>
	Without the tax incentives offered by the Cultural Property 
Export and Import Act, collectors would cease to make donations 
to museums, archives and libraries and would instead sell their 
collections to the international market.
<P>
	There is a perception that it is only wealthy Canadians who have 
objects or collections to donate to our museums, archives and 
libraries and that only the wealthy benefit from the tax credits for 
donations of cultural property. This is simply not true. It is not true 
because of the reasons outlined by the hon. member for Erie, the 
hon. member for Central Nova, the hon. member for Winnipeg St. 
James and the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood, all who 
so eloquently spoke on behalf of this bill and on behalf of Canada's 
cultural heritage.
<P>
	As a result, museums in Canada, from the smallest local 
historical association museum in rural Canada to the major 
collecting institutions in Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal are the 
product of a collective belief. The Cultural Property Export and 
Import Act and the tax incentives it offers for donations nurtures 
that belief and contributes to a shared vision of Canada.
<P>
	In 1991 the Income Tax Act and the Cultural Property Export 
and Import Act were amended so that the responsibility for 
determining the fair market value of certified cultural property was 
transferred from Revenue Canada Taxation to the Canadian 
Cultural Property Export Review Board. Through an oversight the 
right of appeal that had existed in the Income Tax Act was not 
transferred at that time. As a result this right was inadvertently lost. 
Bill C-93 will reinstate the right of appeal that existed until 1991. 
That is what the bill does. It reinstates the right of appeal that 
existed before 1991.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	It does not extend the existing tax benefits for donations of 
cultural property nor does it make any fundamental changes in tax 
policy. The appeal of determinations by the Canadian Cultural 
Property Export Review Board proposed in Bill C-93 will permit 
any donor of cultural property who disagrees with a review board 
determination the opportunity to pursue this first with the board 
and, if necessary, with the Tax Court of Canada.
<P>
	The amendments proposed in the bill should also be viewed as a 
guarantee of the donor's right through natural justice to an appeal 
to the judicial system that it is warranted. The decision to transfer 
the responsibility for determining fair market value to the review 
board was  made in haste and without consultation with the people 
it affected the most, the recipient institutions and donors.
<P>
	The government learned from the mistake of previous 
government and has consulted widely with the donors, museums 
professionals, dealers and members of the review board. During 
this consultative process we learned that many collectors were 
discouraged from making donations because they did not wish to 
become involved in a process they had perceived to be unfair.
<P>
	The museum community is very pleased with the approach that 
has been taken with this bill and is convinced an appeal is 
necessary to ensure that donors will continue to support their 
institutions by making donations of cultural property.
<P>
	The bill establishes two appeal processes, one that involves a 
reconsideration of all the relevant information by the review board 
and another that involves a formal, legal appeal to the tax court. 
The bill goes even further to ensure fairness with the agreement of 
the Tax Court of Canada. The appeal to the tax court is made 
retroactive to January 1992. Every donor who has made a gift since 
the right of appeal was lost and who wishes to pursue an appeal will 
have both the opportunity and legal right to do so.
<P>
	The amendments proposed in Bill C-93 are extremely important 
because they offer a remedy to a situation that need not exist and 
should not exist. The right of appeal is a fundamental right and the 
bill proposes to re-establish a right that was lost through an 
oversight. These are technical amendments but are critical to the 
continued preservation of Canada's heritage.
<P>
	That concludes my formal remarks on the bill. I am very happy 
to stand in support of Bill C-93. I reiterate the rationale for the bill 
which is the reason I am here speaking to the House. The debate 
that has been going on, particularly by the opposition, the third 
party, has tended to paint those who donate cultural and heritage 
artefacts to our institutions as people who are doing something 
wrong, people who are rich, people who are taking advantage of a 
situation.
<P>
	In the example I outlined to the House it is very clear that in 
terms of cash in their pockets, those who have made that wonderful 
gesture to contribute part of Canada's heritage to libraries, to 
archives and to museums are doing it for much more than cash in 
their pockets and for substantially less than they would otherwise 
receive should they have sold those artefacts for fair market value.
<P>
	I compliment the parliamentary secretary and the member for 
Mississauga East for her excellent work on getting the bill through 
the House. I know of nobody that is more fiercely loyal and 
supportive of the Canadian cultural and heritage institutions. She 
has demonstrated that with her work in the House and by her 
extensive travel across the country promoting Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15758"> 15758 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have one brief 
question for my friend from Mississauga South who was an 
accountant in his former life.
<P>
	The bill before us responds to the concerns of the artistic donor 
and custodial community with respect to review board procedures 
as well as to concerns that donations of cultural objects are 
sometimes made for the purpose of tax avoidance. In his 
experience as an accountant has he seen widespread use of the 
legislation for the purpose of tax avoidance?
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Erie for 
his important question. As a chartered accountant, having operated 
a practice for over 25 years, I must admit that I have not seen any 
reports or cases come before the courts with regard to problems of 
donations of cultural property.
<P>
	The process outlined in the bill is a rigorous, independent one by 
people who are in the business of cultural and heritage artefacts and 
items. The process is meant to ensure fairness and equity in our tax 
system for Canadians who wish to make donations of cultural and 
heritage property. Because of that rigorous process there is no 
question in my mind that the determination of the values for tax 
purposes is fair and reasonable and represent fair values for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	Some members have described this process as a win, win 
situation. It is win, win for all parties. Museums and other cultural 
institutions will be able to acquire for the enhancement of their 
collections important artefacts and objects of art for the enjoyment 
of all Canadians at substantially lower values than they would have 
to put out should they have to purchase those at fair market value.
<P>
	That alone creates a situation of leverage. That leverage situation 
means that we get much more for the dollar. Donors of cultural 
property are not getting cash out of the deal. They are not getting, 
whether it be directly or indirectly through taxes on the transaction, 
more by the tax credit method. In fact, they are getting less. They 
are getting less than they would otherwise.
<P>
	It is fair to say that people who come forward and donate, and the 
figure is some $60 million a year, are not doing it because they are 
out to get something out of the system. They are, in fact, putting 
back into the system much more. It is a tremendous expression on 
behalf of Canadians who have been fortunate enough to acquire 
assets and objects of art that they are prepared to contribute to 
Canada, so that all Canadians can enjoy our wonderful heritage.
<P>
	It is timely that we are talking about cultural and heritage 
artefacts. No province could be more proud of its cultural heritage 
and its contributions to Canada than the province of Quebec. At 
this point, as a member and as a Canadian, I would congratulate it 
for the wonderful  contribution it has made to the Canadian culture 
and heritage. It is an outstanding example of what we can do as 
Canadians together. For that we should all be thankful.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask a question of the hon. member, but 
he has disappeared.
<P>
	The nature of Canadians is to give and support institutions 
within their communities, both at the lower level and to the senior 
levels of the museum chain. A country is known by its culture, not 
by its material aspects, and what it leaves behind for the world. 
Little by little the artefacts have been gathered together by small 
museums at the local level, the provincial level and the national 
level.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	Does the hon. member feel strongly that the bill will ensure that 
those who give those valuable artefacts whether to museums or to 
art galleries would be given fair compensation under the rules of 
the Income Tax Act as the bill is presently written?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> I thank the member for the question and the 
comment.
<P>
	Fair compensation is a relative term. For some Canadians fair 
compensation has to do with money. Bill C-93 provides for a tax 
credit mechanism with regard to the treatment or the non-treatment 
of capital gains. The donors are really getting only about 50 per 
cent of the equivalent of the fair market value. The donors are not 
getting in monetary terms fair compensation.
<P>
	When $60 million worth of artefacts are donated to Canada it 
must mean there are a lot of Canadians prepared to make those 
contributions so that all Canadians can enjoy the cultural and 
heritage artefacts we have.
<P>
	Their compensation is knowing we live in the best country in the 
world and that we want to share it with all Canadians and with all 
who visit our great country.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today we are continuing to 
debate the merits of the Cultural Property Export and Import Act.
<P>
	When the act came into place in 1977 the time was ripe for 
lengthy debate on the measures necessary so that the symbols of 
our cultural heritage were not only recognized but preserved. In 
1977, 10 years had already passed since Canada celebrated its 
centennial and it was time to take a hard look at who we are as 
Canadians, what we are as a country and consider what Canada 
could possibly become in the next 100 years.
<P>
	The Cultural Property Export and Import Act was brought into 
force very much in keeping with the spirit of encouraging the 
development of our nation not simply for nation's sake but as a 
nation that can hold its own beside its neighbour to the south and 
among its  neighbours that make up the world; to encourage the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15759"> 15759 </A></B>
<P>
development of a nation we call Canada, which peaks the interests 
of other nations.
<P>
	If we consider today is the future, 30 years into the next 100 
years of our existence as a nation, where do we stand today? We 
stand as a nation that can and does attract people from all over the 
world either to visit this country or to invest in it. Canada as a 
nation is respected around the world. Foreigners are impressed that 
despite our geographical vastness we are holding strongly together. 
Despite the diversity of our cultures we are keeping together. 
Despite the disputes we have had and will continue to have we are 
growing stronger together.
<P>
	As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the United Nations we in 
Canada are celebrating our commitment to developing all of those 
aspects integral to civilized nations.
<P>
	Standing here today debating the merits of the Cultural Property 
Export and Import Act makes us sound like cultural barbarians; to 
think that we have to justify measures that have been in place for 
almost 20 years, measures that confirm our commitment to work 
with the United Nations to stimulate cultural growth, academic 
excellence, scientific achievements, beauty and peace and 
harmony.
<P>
	How can we begin to presume that accomplishments and 
achievements can take place in a vacuum where the means to create 
awareness of progress are non-existent. Imagine our nation without 
our museums, art galleries, archival institutions. Imagine our 2,000 
museums without collections that live and breath and grow to 
reflect who we are and how we are placed in the context of the rest 
of the world.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	Imagine our nation without any symbols, without the pride our 
people can take in these symbols and share with our neighbours. 
Human nature is about interaction, linking history, the arts, science 
and our personal impressions, and sharing these linkages with our 
friends and colleagues so that we continue to learn, continue to 
seek, continue to live and continue to exist.
<P>
	Let me point out some examples of symbols of our national 
heritage which thanks to the provisions of the Cultural Property 
Export and Import Act are now being preserved in Canada and, 
more important, are being exhibited to the public for the world to 
see and from which to learn.
<P>
	In 1992 the Art Gallery of Ontario was successful in repatriating 
to Canada a magnificent painting by Franklin Carmichael, one of 
the founders of the Group of Seven, with the assistance of a grant 
provided under the terms of the very act we are here discussing 
today.
<P>
	To give a sense of the importance of this painting, the Group of 
Seven in their day were regarded by the public  as radicals, off the 
wall, artists who produce works of questionable artistic merit. As 
recently as the 1920s Canadians found the bold and confident 
landscapes painted by the Group of Seven what we might call too 
difficult. Imagine that, a Group of Seven painting being too 
difficult at a time when the rest of the world has already gone 
beyond landscapes, when impressionists had already been putting 
challenging images on the canvas for the past 50 years. 
Nonetheless, Franklin Carmichael was a central figure in the 
development of the decorative symbolist wilderness landscape that 
actually led to the formation of the Group of Seven.
<P>
	The painting the Art Gallery of Ontario succeeded in bringing 
back from England is a brilliant example of the kind of radical 
painting in Canada in the 1920s that Carmichael was so 
instrumental in bringing to public attention. Here was one painting 
that was so instrumental in giving the Group of Seven public 
recognition. This painting has therefore become a symbol of how 
one object, one artefact, can have such an impact on the further 
development on how the public perceives art.
<P>
	To see this painting hanging in the Art Gallery of Ontario today 
is only one example of how important it is for us to open our minds 
and our hearts to those who have the courage to introduce us to new 
ways of doing what we as citizens have been doing since we were 
born. To have access to the formative symbols of the past is integral 
to the definition of the present and to the assurance of the future.
<P>
	In the bill the establishment of an appeal should be viewed as a 
reinstatement of the right of appeal that was lost when the 
responsibility for determining fair market value was transferred to 
the review board in 1991.
<P>
	These amendments will ensure that donors who disagree with the 
determinations of the review board will have the right of appeal to 
the courts and will not be denied natural justice.
<P>
	The announcement of the establishment of an appeal process was 
received positively by donors, museums, art dealers and the media. 
These legislative amendments therefore enjoy a high level of 
public support.
<P>
	The amendments are technical in nature and respond to strong 
concerns expressed by the heritage community. Their passage into 
law should be seen as part of the ongoing commitment of the 
Government of Canada to ensure the preservation of Canada's 
cultural heritage.
<P>
	Further, I think of the Art Gallery of Windsor, of the many 
functions in my riding and in the neighbouring ridings in Windsor 
and Essex county, Art by the River in Amherstburg, Art in the Park 
in Windsor and many other charitable events. I know of the many 
dedicated volunteers who assist in these events and other displays 
of our culture. I also know the thousands of people who visit them 
benefit from the culture and the experience.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="15760"> 15760 </A></B>
<P>
	The Art Gallery of Windsor has now moved into a shopping 
centre. At first it was met with large opposition but now it is in 
the shopping centre and thousands of people are visiting it.
<P>
	More and more young Canadians are having the opportunity to 
see these displays of culture. More and more people are benefiting 
from what is being recreated in this act, continuing to be allowed 
their contributions worth up to $60 million a year open to all 
Canadians in public institutions, institutions that promote our 
culture and our heritage.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	During the summer when I was in Jonquière I had the 
opportunity to visit a display in Chicoutimi by a local artist. We 
have to remember how important it is to all of Canada to encourage 
Canadians to understand and benefit from the cultural aspects and 
to continue on. We are only in the 30th year of the next 100 years. 
There are 70 more years to go. I know that in Windsor and Essex 
county we continue to do that on a regular basis.
<P>
	Art in the park, for example, started small and has grown to such 
a large capacity it is now offered it in the winter as well. Thousands 
of people come through on Saturdays and Sundays and take the 
opportunity to purchase art. Many people in the local community 
have now taken and used art as a fundraising activity. Donations of 
art are used for auctions and other activities. It is important that we 
re-establish the appeal rights that were lost. The right of appeal 
should never have been lost. Unfortunately the last government 
decided that as a Canadian citizen one did not have that right of 
appeal.
<P>
	We in this government believe that the right of appeal in all 
subjects is very important. No one should be denied the right of 
natural justice. When they do donate something they should be 
given their true value in the amount of effort and donations. I 
believe the value is many times more than the fair market value 
actually is of the object because thousands of people will come to 
see these objects in years to come and will all benefit from them 
and will go on from there.
<P>
	Hopefully Windsor and Essex county can be a model for what is 
happening now and into the future.

	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Privacy Commissioner of Canada estimates that Canadians 
have their names crunched through various computers, back and

estimates that the buying and selling of personal information is a 
$300 million a year industry. This is a serious threat to the privacy 
of Canadians.

received from a grade 13 politics class at Mayfield Secondary 
School in the riding I serve. Not only have over 450 students signed 
a petition stating the importance of Canada's unity, they have also 
put together a video cassette in which they have voiced their 
concerns over the referendum as well as their love of the province 
of Quebec. This is being sent to a secondary school in Quebec.
<P>
	All Canadians are concerned about the Quebec referendum and 
its long term effects on Canada. Canada is not whole without 
Quebec, and it would be in everyone's best interest that Canada 
remain united.
<P>
	We should realize that all Canadians, from the youngest to the

concerned. They have every right to be. The rest of their lives 
hangs in the balance of the referendum. Canada's youth should not

	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of

Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today, October 
24, is an anniversary that celebrates peace over war and unity over 
division. Fifty years ago 31 nations from around the globe ratified 
the UN charter. It was on that day that Canada and other 
like-minded countries sought to ensure the peace and security that 
had proven so elusive to their generation.
<P>
	Today every Canadian from Quebec to Newfoundland to British 
Columbia can take pride in the accomplishments of Canada within 
the UN as exemplified by prominent Canadians like Lester 
Pearson, Major General Roméo Dallaire and Mr. Jules Deschênes 
at the World Court in The Hague. All have helped to build a strong 
and flourishing reputation for Canada.
<P>
	The UN espouses the principles of unity and co-operation. As we 
approach an uncertain time in our own history, let us remember 
how we as Canadians have promoted such principles. October 24 
marks an opportunity for all of us, from coast to coast, to reflect on 
what a united country can achieve and what a divided country will 
certainly lose.

	This is the conclusion of five years' work by Normand Poirier, 
Angus Lefort and Daniel Aucoin and many other volunteers, who 
wanted to give Acadians in the area their own community radio as a 
means of local development. Their efforts were backed by the 
Government of Canada and strongly supported by the 5,000 or so 
listeners in the station's coverage area.
<P>
	The opening ceremony was followed by a show featuring a 
variety of local musical talent. The show proved the point, if proof 
is required, that French language and culture are very much alive in 
Chéticamp, Grand-Étang, Saint-Joseph-du-Moine and many other 
places in Nova Scotia.
<P>
	The Acadian people here have roots, language and culture in 
common with the francophones of Quebec. They fervently hope 
they will continue to have a country in common after October 30.

Cheysson, former French minister of foreign affairs and former

that the European Union could sign a free trade agreement with a

position as a special European partner in North America is 
particularly attractive.
<P>
	So, as Quebec enjoys special ties with its North American and

comprehend the virtues of partnership? The Government of Canada

<P>
	A sovereign Quebec will continue to use the Canadian dollar 
and, as the Minister of Finance himself pointed out, it cannot be 
prevented from doing so. A sovereign Quebec will also assume its 
fair share of the federal debt. If the Yes side wins, Quebec and 
Canada will be well-advised to start negotiations immediately on 
the sharing of the debt and federal assets.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="REFERENDUMCAMPAIGN">REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Premier 
Clyde Wells of Newfoundland has entered the referendum 
campaign to set the record straight for the No side. It is out of the 
question that Quebec's status as a distinct society should be 
recognized constitutionally. Meanwhile, the Minister of Finance 
declared this morning that the distinct society clause should be 
enshrined in the Constitution.
<P>
	Of course my question is directed to the Minister of Finance. 
Could he tell us the government's position on the issue of distinct 
society? Is it the position he, as the finance minister, took this 
morning or is it the one taken yesterday by Mr. Clyde Wells, whose 
position is known to be very close to the Prime Minister's?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on this side of the House our position is quite clear. We 
have always said, in fact the Prime Minister himself has said that 
he supported the concept of distinct society in the past, he supports 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15764"> 15764 </A></B>
<P>
it today and is  prepared to support it tomorrow. The Prime 
Minister of Canada himself made that statement in this House. Is 
that not clear enough?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the 
Minister of Labour was gracious enough to answer the question, I 
will ask her another one.
<P>
	When the Minister of Labour says before this House and before 
all Quebecers who are listening that the Prime Minister is prepared 
to include in the Constitution the principle of a distinct society, is 
she referring-and this is my question-to the Charlottetown 
version preferred by the Prime Minister, in other words, a 
meaningless concept subordinate to the equality of the provinces 
and rejected by all Quebecers, or is she referring to the distinct 
society concept in the Meech Lake Accord, which the Prime 
Minister opposed? Which version is it, Madam Minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, which distinct society is the hon. member for Roberval 
talking about? Is he talking about the distinct society of Meech 
Lake, which Mr. Parizeau said at the time was an empty shell? Is he 
talking about the distinct society of Charlottetown, which the hon. 
member and the Bloc Quebecois refused to endorse?
<P>
	Is he talking about that distinct society? Is he talking about the 
distinct society Mr. Parizeau referred to last week, when he said: 
``To hell with distinct society, I want the separation of Quebec''? 
What is he talking about? We on this side are willing to state quite 
clearly that Quebecers are a distinct society in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, today, this 
is a very serious question, a question to which I would appreciate 
an answer, not this beating around the bush by the Minister of 
Labour in full view of the whole province of Quebec.
<P>
	My question-I will give her a second chance, and I would 
appreciate an answer-is this: Would the Minister of Labour be so 
gracious and so kind as to tell Quebecers who are listening, when 
she says she supports a distinct society, does she support a distinct 
society as defined in Charlottetown, which was rejected by all 
Quebecers, or does she support the distinct society defined in the 
Meech Lake Accord? Which one is the Minister of Labour, as a 
minister of this government, referring to when she says she 
supports this concept? We would like to know.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Yes, Mr. 
Speaker, we have a very serious decision to make. It is serious 
because on October 30, we decide whether or not we will break up 
Canada. That is what we are all going to do on October 30.
<P>
	When I hear the hon. member for Roberval, it sounds like he is 
saying: ``Madam Minister, put the distinct  society in the 
Constitution and we will forget about our referendum''. I do not 
think that is what he meant. But the fact is that between now and 
October 30, we want Quebecers to think carefully. We know we 
have a distinct society in Quebec, and we are proud of it. We are 
also proud to be Canadians, and that is why we will say no on 
October 30.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the premier of Newfoundland, Clyde Wells, 
said he considered that Quebec was indeed a distinct society but 
that there was no question of its having any particular status or real 
powers. These words killed the hopes of the no side, and especially 
of Daniel Johnson and Pierre Paradis, who are still begging the 
Prime Minister of Canada to commit himself to including this 
concept of a distinct society in the constitution.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Labour admit that the government of 
Canada could not include the notion of a distinct society in the 
constitution, even if it wanted to, because there will always be the 
likes of Clyde Wells, Frank McKenna and Roy Romanow there to 
tell us to forget about any ideas of a distinct society?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have never heard a worse example of twisting someone 
else's words. Never.
<P>
	Clyde Wells has acknowledged that Quebec is a distinct society. 
Mike Harris has acknowledged that Quebec is a distinct society. 
Why twist these facts on the eve of such a serious choice, a choice 
that concerns all of us, Quebecers and other Canadians both? What 
is going on? What is going on with the yes side? Are they running 
short of arguments for selling us on their option of Quebec's 
separation?
<P>
	This week is a week of great significance and we must reflect 
upon the meaning of this vote, and not allow Quebecers to think 
that they will still wake up Canadian the next morning. This is 
where the importance of the October 30 vote lies. I would like to 
see the yes side at least have the courage to tell Quebecers openly 
what their option is on October 30.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at least now we know that the Minister of Labour shares 
Clyde Wells' definition of a distinct society, as does the Prime 
Minister. Fine then. It goes over very well here in the House, but far 
less well in Quebec, as the minister is aware.
<P>
	The people who are getting worried at this point are Daniel 
Johnson and Pierre Paradis, not those in the yes camp. Those in the 
same camp as her, her former colleagues if she can still remember.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Labour have the courage to be frank with 
her friends in the yes group, her former colleagues, telling them 
that should there be a no vote on the referendum the predictable 
outcome of the 1977 constitutional negotiations will again be a 
resounding  failure, as the good buddy of the Prime Minister, and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15765"> 15765 </A></B>
<P>
the new-found buddy of the Minister of Labour, the ineffable Clyde 
Wells, has clearly stated?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, should there be a no vote in the referendum, you will see 
this country continue the transformation it began 30 or more years 
ago. And judging by how the people of Quebec have fared within 
this country over the past 30 years, we have every right to be proud 
of who and what we Quebecers are. This has been accomplished 
within the Canadian federation. We have always played a lead role 
in that federation. And after the no, we shall still be there, 
continuing to transform this country.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the past two days the value of the Canadian dollar has 
dropped by a cent and a half, interest rates have jumped 
alarmingly-the bank rate went up by 1 per cent today-and 
Canadian stock markets have witnessed the worst times they have 
had in eight years. The separatists are getting a foretaste of the 
economic consequences of their position.
<P>
	Would the finance minister tell Canadians in plain terms what a 
vote against federalism on October 30 would mean for their bank 
accounts, their mortgages, their jobs and their economic future?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is a direct 
correlation between lower interest rates and a higher quality of life. 
Lower interest rates mean higher retail sales, therefore a stronger 
domestic market. It means more construction. It means more job 
creation. It means heavily indebted governments will have more 
money to spend on the needed social programs.
<P>
	Markets react very negatively to political uncertainty. I cannot 
think of greater political uncertainty than arises out of those who 
would threaten to break up a country.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> To answer the member's 
question, it will lead directly to higher mortgage rates, lower job 
creation rates, lower retail sales and less money available to 
governments. In the case of the people of Quebec it also means 
tremendous uncertainty over the fate of the economic union and 
over the fate of their creating relationships with the United States.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The fact is that a country cannot be destroyed without grave 
consequences for its people and their lifestyle. Those who deny the 
consequences of separation deny the truth.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the separatists have been trying to downplay the economic 
consequences of the instability of the past few days. They have 
been trying to chalk it up to federalist fearmongering but money 
markets are not easily swayed by emotion or scare tactics. As the 
minister says, they react negatively to instability while they react 
positively to stability, certainty and positive initiatives.
<P>
	My supplementary question is for the Minister of Finance. Will 
the minister tell the House what positive steps can be taken to 
restore the faith of investors and lenders in the future of Canadian 
federalism?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, fearmongering is the 
result of those who espouse an option and who are afraid to tell 
their people the consequences of the option they are espousing.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> However, there is a very clear 
way. It is the only way to reduce this uncertainty. There is only one 
way to reassure the markets and that is to unequivocally vote no on 
October 30.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it seems to me there is one other thing that disillusioned 
Quebecers and sceptical money markets are both missing, which is 
the good news that Canadian federalism is going to change for the 
better. Canadians want it to change, the provinces want it to 
change, reformers in all political parties want Canadian federalism 
to change for the better.
<P>
	Quebecers can develop their language, their culture, their 
resources, their destiny within that federation. They do not need a 
yes vote and they do not need constitutional lawyers to guarantee 
that federal security.
<P>
	Will the finance minister make it clear the federal government is 
open to substantial positive changes within the federation, changes 
that do not require constitutional change, so that a no vote can 
mean both no to separation and no to the status quo?
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been attending 
federal and provincial finance minister meetings over the course of 
two years. I can say that without any exception at every single one 
of those  meetings, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15766"> 15766 </A></B>
<P>
every finance minister representing his or her province or territory 
has expressed fundamentally the need for change in the way in 
which governments relate to each other, the way in which our 
economy works and the way in which we approach the next 
century.
<P>
	Right across the country, in Quebec most certainly but also in 
western Canada, Ontario and Atlantic Canada, there is a deep 
desire for change, progress and improvement. We have seen that in 
the way the government has acted. Every single government 
department has begun to change the way in which it operates 
focusing only on the most essential.
<P>
	We are seeing it in our new trading relationships and in fact the 
minister is rarely here. Canada is in the process of opening new 
trading relationships right across the country. I take that back; the 
minister is always here in spirit.
<P>
	It is seen in the way the government is working with small 
business and the great degree of flexibility.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	One thing is very clear: we have a choice on October 30 between 
progress and change for our country or a backward step, as

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The Premier of Quebec and leader of the Yes side clearly 
expressed his intention to continue to use the Canadian dollar once 
Quebec achieves sovereignty. He also committed a sovereign 
Quebec to assuming its share of the enormous Canadian debt.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance not believe that he too should be 
clear and, rather than allow uncertainty to pervade the financial 
community, he should indicate that he has in fact prepared a plan 
``B'', should the yes side win on October 30, as it likely will, which 
he has stubbornly refused to confirm up to now?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the only thing that is 
clear in what the separatists say about the use of the Canadian 
dollar is their ambiguity.
<P>
	A week ago, the Leader of the Opposition said, at the Ahuntsic 
CEGEP, that he wanted a separate Quebec to use its own money. A 
year ago, in Portneuf, he asked what point there was in separating if 
Quebecers were not going to have their own money. In <I>L'Actualité</I>, 
where it appears in black and white, the Premier of Quebec said 
that keeping the Canadian dollar was simply a ruse, that he wanted 
a Quebec dollar. So who is speaking the truth? The Leader of the 
Opposition today or the Leader of the Opposition last week?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is 
totally false. The Leader of the Opposition did not say that.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance admit he has a responsibility to 
make a commitment that, the day after a yes vote, he will argue in 
favour of negotiations beginning quickly with Quebec to reach a 
partnership agreement, as the interests of both parties dictate?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have said 
repeatedly that Canada's interest would be to protect its rights 
within NAFTA. And, in order to protect its rights within NAFTA, 
Canada could not sign a special agreement with an independent, 
that is, separated, country. It is not that Canada would not, it is that 
Canada could not.
<P>
	Second, is the member saying that the Leader of the Opposition 
was incorrectly quoted on <I>Canada AM</I>, was incorrectly quoted in 
Portneuf and that the leader, the Premier, was incorrectly quoted in 
<I>L'Actualité</I> when, in each instance, they said clearly that they

the individual in question sued Correctional Service Canada for 
negligence after being seized as a hostage by other prisoners and 
beaten with an iron bar.
<P>
	He sued for $60,000. When the case came to court, there was a 
pretrial conference and the presiding judge strongly urged that the 
case be settled. The case was then settled for $12,000 of which 
about $8,000 went to the inmate's lawyer.

<P>
	There is no justification for rewarding John Lee, a murderer. It is 
disgusting. A victim's rights must be paramount, yet again the 
victim's family is forgotten. Justice is when the criminal pays for 
his crime.
<P>
	Why does the minister make crime such a profitable business for 
lawyers and criminals, yet ignores the pain and isolation of the 
victims?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Correctional Service Canada is mandated by the law to carry out 
the sentence imposed by the court. The courts have held on many 
occasions that if there is negligence in the way that it is done, then 
there is a cause of action for negligence.
<P>
	That is what happened in this case. The inmate was taken as a 
hostage. He was beaten with an iron bar. He sued for $60,000. The 
settlement that was advised as a result of a pretrial conference by 
the presiding judge was not $60,000; it was $12,000.
<P>
	There is no reward for murder or for acting illegally. It is simply 
a matter of following the precedents in previous cases.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The Canadian dollar and the stock market are now on a 
roller-coaster ride as a result of various national and international 
factors.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance admit that the financial markets' 
first source of uncertainty and concern about Canada is the 
enormous size of its deficit and its growing debt, which will exceed 
$600 billion next year?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the last budget was 
very well received by the international markets. Interest rates have 
fallen since then. The question we must ask is this: What will occur 
in four or five days? It is very clear that the referendum debate has 
had an enormous impact on savings, on our way of life, on job 
creation in this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance has a short memory. Two weeks 
after he tabled his budget, the Bank of Canada rate reached a high 
of 8.6 per cent, which was higher than the current 7.65 per cent 
rate, because that budget was poorly received and because 
government  finances were in bad shape. That is the main factor, as 
Moody's recognized in January.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Finance give such answers when the 
Governor of the Bank of Canada himself declared on October 12, 
1994: ``It is only because of the high debt and deficit levels that 
political uncertainty has become another concern''?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, if one listens to 
currency traders and the other parties involved, the cause of the 
problem becomes very clear. The hon. member and his separatist 
colleagues are only doing this in order to dodge the real issues, as 
their option will create political uncertainty, which will lead to 
economic uncertainty. The hon. member should say that he is in 
fact endangering Quebecers' and Canadians' savings, jobs and 
economic development.
<P>
	If this has nothing to do with recent events, why has the gap 
between Quebec and Canada savings bonds increased so much in 
the past few weeks? It is because the Quebec government refuses to 
accept its responsibilities, which involve managing for its own 
people?

<P>
	The justice minister recently accused the Ontario solicitor 
general of pandering to the gun lobby. I have evidence which 
strongly suggests that the minister is pandering to the Canadian 
Gun Coalition.
<P>
	Did the minister provide the Canadian Gun Coalition with copies 
of letters addressed to him supporting Bill C-68 without the 
consent of the authors?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if anyone is pandering it is 
members of the third party who see, for some reason which escapes 
the rest of us, some purpose in pursuing this subject at a time when 
the majority of Canadians and the House of Commons have 
spoken. We have already enacted legislation to act on the public 
will.
<P>
	As to the question which the hon. member puts, I will take the 
matter under advisement and investigate the facts. I do not have a 
factual answer at this moment. I will find one and I will furnish it to 
the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have in my

Gun Coalition obtained these letters which were addressed to the 
minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

anything to argue in his cause, so profoundly devoid of merit is his

commonplace events which he described some reason to become 
righteous and indignant.
<P>
	The fact is that people, organizations, cities and governments 
across the country have written to me in support of the gun 
proposals. My office is flooded with faxes and letters in support of 
Bill C-68. Those people who write in support of the legislation 
either expressly or implicitly authorize and urge me to spread

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Yesterday, in reference to Canada's future, the minister said that 
the No side was the one promoting change, as evidenced by the new 
Canada social transfer.
<P>
	With this surprising statement, is the Minister of Finance telling 
Quebecers that, following a No vote on October 30, Canada's 
proposed change would be the implementation of the social 
transfer through which Ottawa will, over a two year period, deprive 
the provinces of 7 billion dollars, including 2.5 billion in the case 
of Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, first, the figures used 
by the member are not valid.
<P>
	Second, the Canada social transfer will provide the provinces 
with a great deal of flexibility to innovate and find their own 
solutions to problems.
<P>
	This initiative truly shows the flexibility of the federal 
government regarding the involvement of the provinces in social 
programs. Indeed, what we see here is a fundamental change of 
attitude for the federal government and for the country, and the 
member opposite should congratulate us.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, are we to 
understand that the Minister of Finance believes that tomorrow's 
Canada is simply a matter of Ottawa deciding and the provinces 
paying, as confirmed by the establishment of the new Canada 
social transfer?
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

reflected in the statements made by the premiers of the other 
provinces, who not only recognized Ottawa's flexibility but also 
recognized that the country as a whole wants changes and wants 
co-operation between the provincial and federal governments, and 
said so.
<P>
	Whether the issue is harmonization with the minister responsible 
for public service renewal, harmonization in regional development 
or discussions on human resources, all the other provinces are 
co-operating to improve life for Canadians.

my question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	It seems that budget cuts are threatening the existence of the 
Queen's York Rangers, a Canadian reserve unit with a 250-year 
history. A special commission will report in the next few weeks on 
the future of Canada's reserves.
<P>
	Could the minister confirm that no decisions with respect to the 
future of the reserves will be made before the commission reports?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

York Rangers is but one of many distinguished regiments that have 
contributed much over the years to Canada's security with long and 
noble traditions going back, in the case of the Queen's York 
Rangers, to the time before Canada became a country in assisting 
the British in the American revolution.
<P>
	This heritage is vital to Canada's military preparedness. Earlier 
this year when we were discussing the rationalizations taking place 
in national defence I asked Hon. Brian Dickson, former Chief 
Justice of Canada, to chair the commission on the reserves but in 
the meantime gave instructions to the department not to effect any 
changes that would have an impact on reserve regiments until such 
time as the commission has reported and the parliamentary 
committee of the House and the Senate reviews the commission's 
conclusions.

question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	Two years ago the minister promised regulatory reform to help 
industry in Canada. Last December he tabled a report in the House 
in which he offered specific changes to the mining industry in order 
to help it some time in 1995.
<P>
	Will the minister table those reforms now, soon or can the 
mining industry expect something in its stocking by Christmas?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Industry and I are working very 
closely with the mining sector to ensure an efficient regulatory 
system.
<P>
	Last Thursday my department organized in co-operation with the 
Mining Association of Canada a regulatory reform workshop 
which brought together representatives of the Minister of 
Industry's department, the Department of the Environment, the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans, and the Department of 
Transport.
<P>
	Very constructive recommendations came out of that day-long 
workshop which we will be working on to ensure that the 
regulatory regime supports and does not interfere with a viable, 
productive mining industry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think the day-long workshop is already a two-year workshop. We 
need action more than just words.
<P>
	New regulations being considered by the environment 
department have scared officials within the Minister of Natural 
Resources' own department so badly that they have leaked a 
75-page memo to the press saying, among other things, they are 
scared to death of what this will do. It may harm the Canadian 
economy, inflame federal-provincial relations and may even affect 
Canadian sovereignty.
<P>
	Will the minister table that 75-page memo in the House and does 
she share the concern of her officials?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let me assure the hon. member that neither my 
officials nor I are scared in relation to what I think he is referring

	My commitment as Minister of Natural Resources is to work 
collaboratively, co-operatively with my colleagues, the Ministers 
of the Environment, Industry, Fisheries and Oceans, and Transport. 
At this point I am willing to go on record to the minister that 
working together we will ensure a regulatory regime that supports

unemployment insurance and old age pensions will be affected 
considerably by federal government cuts.
<P>

	When the Minister of Finance states that a no will make it 
possible for Canada to continue to evolve since change is already 
underway, as he says, is he giving us confirmation that Canada will 
continue to evolve along the path of cuts to education, health, 
unemployment insurance, old age pensions on which it has already 
set out?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, first of all the 
Minister of Human Resources Development has indicated very 
clearly with respect to the whole consultation process on 
unemployment insurance that it is far from finished, but that our 
objective is employment insurance, i.e. getting Canadians back to 
work. That is, moreover, the goal of his reform.
<P>
	On the other hand, concerning old age security, the Prime 
Minister has already stated very clearly here in the House that the 
federal government will never, never do anything to compromise 
the economic security of our seniors.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, will the 
minister admit that the federal government's choice to transfer its 
enormous deficit to the provinces by cutting Canada social transfer 
payments promises nothing positive for the future if Quebec were 
to say no, for Ottawa will be the one to set the national standards 
and Quebec will have to manage as best it can to apply them, with 
consequences one can well imagine for social programs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>First of all, Mr. Speaker, with 
respect to the Canada social transfer, it is very clear that the 
national standards involved are the principles of health insurance, 
to which Quebecers strongly subscribe. Secondly, a great deal of 
flexibility has been built in to allow the provinces leeway for 
innovation and for tailoring their programs to their own population.

the RCMP in Alberta, justice ministers in four provinces and

that a large segment of society, including the police, does not 
support?

	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr.

its annual meeting voted on a motion to not support Bill C-68, the 
gun control bill. That motion passed nearly unanimously.
<P>
	We have been saying all along that the frontline police do not 
support the justice minister's bill and yet he repeatedly says he is 
bringing in the gun registration and that the police requested it.
<P>
	Now that it is obvious the police oppose gun registration, will he 
act on the wishes of the police even though they conflict with his 
personal views?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

Canada, indeed the future of the confederation, the hon. member

firearms. It is fitting.

which he referred forms part of the Police Association of Ontario 
which represents all the frontline officers in Ontario. The Police 
Association of Ontario forms part of the Canadian Police

businessmen and women had in trying to meet their objectives 
which was getting access to capital.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15772"> 15772 </A></B>
<P>
	It is very important for me to recognize the critic for the Reform 
Party. One of the very unique experiences that we had in the 
industry committee was the fact that we worked as a team. We 
have many differences with the Reform Party. I for one do not 
feel as committed as they are to their attack on the deficit and 
debt. I find their approach too radical and too swift. However, one 
issue which we have consistently agreed on is the fact that small 
business is the hope of this country when it comes to putting 
Canadians back to work. It was because of our teamwork that we 
have been able to move an agenda forward on the access to capital 
front.
<P>
	The amendments in Bill C-99 before us today, which is an act to 
amend the Small Business Loans Act, are from feedback we have 
received from the men and women in the House who have been 
working on this issue. They are the result of feedback we have had 
from industry and the banking community. They are also the result 
of the feedback and the success we have had with the Small 
Business Loans Act.
<P>
	Some members will recall when we were in opposition that the 
then Conservative government initiated, in its last budget, 
amendments to the Small Business Loans Act. At that time, we 
supported those amendments because we believed that they were 
instruments for trying to break up the hardened attitude that many 
people in the financial community had toward taking risks with 
small businessmen and women.
<P>
	This bill is not meant to be a cure all for the difficulties that 
businessmen and women are having. It is a bill where we told the 
financial community that we would develop an act in Parliament 
where 90 per cent of the risk that it takes on a small business 
project, up to $250,000, the Government of Canada would 
guarantee if that business should fail.
<P>
	Since the Small Business Loans Act started, over many years, it 
has been used to help just under 500,000 small businesses in this 
country. Many people have had, through this act, the opportunity to 
take a shot at their dreams, create jobs and ultimately help create 
the economic fabric of this country.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	When the Government of Canada is guaranteeing such a large 
amount, the number one question obviously is what is the down 
side for the taxpayer.
<P>
	Until two years ago, on a loan float of about $3.5 billion, the loss 
to the crown was approximately $26 million. A loss of $26 million 
on a $3.5 billion float is pretty respectable. In the last year and a 
half, the float has increased considerably. The float right now is 
closer to about $8 billion. On that float, the estimated losses are 
approximately $100 million.
<P>
	Because of that increased loan loss, that $100 million, and 
because of our commitment to fiscal responsibility, the government
<P>
has decided to listen to the Reform  Party, to listen to the banks and 
others. It has decided that the act has to be redesigned in a way 
where those costs are recovered.
<P>
	The essence of this bill deals with a new formula so that those 
loan losses can be covered. Essentially the three components in the 
bill to recover the loss on that rather large float would be the 
following: the major elements would be first, a reduction in the 
minister's liability to pay a loss on any business improvement loan 
from 90 per cent to 85 per cent. The second point is the 
establishment of an annual administration fee and a restriction on 
the passing on of the fee to borrowers except through interest rates, 
the establishment of a claim processing fee and the granting of 
authority to make regulations respecting the release of security 
taken for the repayment of any business improvement loan.
<P>
	What we have done is this. Previously the guarantee was 90 per 
cent. It has been reduced to 85 per cent. If this is the way that the 
Small Business Loans Act can continue to be viable so that it is not 
going to be a drain for the taxpayer or a strain on the treasury or 
something that would generate too much nervousness with officials 
in the Department of Finance, then I naturally support all these 
amendments. These amendments are all good, solid amendments.
<P>
	The most important thing that the Small Business Loans Act did 
was this. Because all of us worked together on the Small Business 
Loans Act, it led to another journey that we all went on in the last 
two years. That journey happened in the industry committee where 
the Bloc Quebecois, the Reform Party, and government members 
all worked together on this total review of the difficulties that small 
business men and women were having in accessing capital.
<P>
	Members would probably recall that almost a year ago, the 
committee published virtually a unanimous report ``Taking Care of 
Small Business''. That report dealt with all of the various 
experiences men and women were having when dealing with 
financial institutions.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	All of us in this House heard over the last few years story after 
story after story of the difficulties many of our constituents were 
having in dealing with the various banks or other financial 
institutions. It was through that feedback that we became united in 
dealing with this issue.
<P>
	Some of the key recommendations in the report are now being 
implemented. As of the end of this month there will be a common 
quarterly reporting chart and statistics on the whole thrust of each 
individual financial institution's lending to small business by 
sector, by gender, by municipality and the size of the loan. That 
kind of accountability is going to change the whole bank culture 
and attitude toward small business.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15773"> 15773 </A></B>
<P>
	That has been the biggest accomplishment of our committee. We 
have made a very strong impact in  causing the men and women 
who are managing the banks to reflect and review the way they 
have been dealing with business. Not big business. We all know 
that whenever big business wants a $500,000 or a $3 billion loan 
the banks trip over themselves trying to lend those larger 
businesses the money. In the past few years some of those loans the 
banks were tripping over each other to give to the larger businesses 
ended up coming back in their faces, or part of them came back in 
their faces.
<P>
	We were not really concerned with the larger corporations. We 
respect the larger corporations and the job creation contribution 
they make to the community, but we were concerned with the small 
business community and the fact that the small business 
community represents virtually all of the new job creation that is 
happening in this country. I believe and I know many members 
opposite believe that those quarterly accountability sessions are 
shifting the attitudes of the banks.
<P>
	Ultimately, it does not matter what side of the House we sit on, 
we are here for one reason. We are here to get the economy of this 
country going again. The economy is only going to start going 
again when collectively we can work at creating an environment 
where business can flourish and give men and women the dignity 
of a job. That is the most important thing we can be working on 
today.
<P>
	It is no secret that there are just under three million men and 
women who do not have work. I cannot imagine getting up in the 
morning and not having a job to go to. Many of us here have been 
blessed with the fact that not only do we have a terrific opportunity 
to serve our country right now, but we have also had the 
opportunity to work throughout our careers. Very few of us have 
felt the pain or the assault on our dignity of not having a job. That 
assault on dignity is the toughest thing a man or a woman can face. 
Our number one responsibility is to assist in creating an 
environment where business can take those risks and chances to get 
the economy going. That is why we on this side of the House, 
supported by members opposite as well, believe that whenever we 
can pass an act of Parliament that will improve on creating more 
jobs, even if they are minor improvements, then we are on it right 
away.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	It is important that a bill like this does not take a long time to go 
through the House. That is why it is important to work together. If 
we can work together and get the proper amendments in this bill, 
then this kind of cohesion gives confidence to the marketplace and 
the people who execute this bill, the banks.
<P>
	This bill is not executed by the government. After it is passed by 
this House this bill will be implemented by the financial 
institutions in Canada. The bank managers make the decision as to 
whether or not that taxpayer guarantee should be given to a small 
business man or  woman. The implementation of the act is totally 
delegated to the financial institutions. Because of this guarantee 
those bank managers can take a bit more risk. Ultimately that is 
going to assist in getting the economy going.
<P>
	The small business sector represents the greatest hope we have 
for putting Canadians back to work. It is going to accomplish that 
once the proper environment is put in place. Also, the small 
business man or woman does not tend to create a lot of bureaucracy 
and therefore can be more efficient when operating a small 
business. They tend to have much closer relationships with the men 
and women who work with them. The family-like environment 
which happens in a small business in many cases generates the kind 
of activity that allows creativity to flourish, that allows 
productivity, which allows business to create better products at 
better prices.
<P>
	That is ultimately the reason our exports are going to be our hope 
as well. In the last few months our exports have been holding the 
economy together. Many of those exports, for example in the 
automotive sector, came from small and medium sized 
corporations. Some of them are organized in larger institutions but 
many of them are small, individual plants with a maximum of 30 to 
50 workers.
<P>
	We have to stop thinking of small business in the traditional way 
it has been thought of in this Chamber. For many years in Ottawa 
most of the attention was given to the larger businesses. The larger 
businesses had the resources to come to Ottawa and lobby their 
MPs or they had the resources through accountants and lawyers to 
do the work on the basic grants and support systems that were in 
place. Larger businesses had the resources to get their tax credit put 
into the tax act because they could afford to lobby the various 
departments including the Department of Finance.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	In the last two or three years we have discovered that a lot of 
these larger businesses with all the great contributions they have 
made in terms of job creation and research, are not creating the 
same kind of economic thrust. Now it is the small business 
community. Many of us have had to reorient ourselves, go back to 
basics and reacquaint ourselves to try to understand what the small 
business community really needs.
<P>
	Even though I frequently talk about access to capital, there are a 
couple of other things the government is going to have to address as 
well. We have to take up the challenge to reduce the paper burden 
and red tape. How many times do we hear that small business men 
and women are spending more time pushing paper and government 
forms than on their own businesses? We have become a nation of 
paper pushers. We have to realize that along with access to capital 
we must reduce the red tape and paper burden.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15774"> 15774 </A></B>
<P>
	The Department of Industry, the Department of National 
Revenue and the Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs 
have been working very hard in the last few months trying to 
create a one-all form. They are trying to organize various forms 
for business. They are working on a system that will be on one 
form, a simplified system for business reporting on various aspects 
of government responsibility.
<P>
	That is also another realization we have come to accept and 
support as a result of our continued campaign on the access to 
capital front. In other words, that journey on access to capital has 
led to the realization that reducing the paper burden is something 
we must also work on very diligently.
<P>
	The last thing I will touch on in terms of policy is where small 
business is crying out for our attention, which is the whole area of 
tax reform. Small business is telling us that the tax system is 
complex and inefficient. Many of them argue it is not fair.
<P>
	As a government we are committed. Our red book stated quite 
clearly that the whole GST regime we fought so vigorously against 
in opposition is something the government has to address in its 
mandate. There is absolutely no way any Liberal member of 
Parliament could ever expect to go back on the campaign trail to 
get re-elected unless the whole issue of the GST is dealt with.
<P>
	My goodness, in opposition we fought against the GST to the 
point that it nearly caused a riot in the other place. We challenged 
the government because of the complexity, the paper burden and 
the inefficiency of the GST. We on this side of the House are 
working very hard on total tax reform. It is a very complex issue to 
dismantle an entire structure the previous government set up. As 
the Prime Minister would say, it is not a matter of saying ``poof'' 
and it is gone. It has to be done responsibly, in a way that will not 
create a bigger problem than already exists.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	We believe that dealing with the issue of tax reform is central to 
the requirements of small businesses and their ability to work in an 
environment that allows them to maximize their potential. Bill 
C-99, an act to amend the Small Business Loans Act, is another 
example of where the government is fine tuning by working with 
small businesses and the financial institutions and dealing with the 
financial markets, the currency traders, who have control on our 
interest rates and our dollar.
<P>
	There is an issue I wish we could one day debate in Parliament. 
With the various challenges we take on in the House, whether 
related to industry, social programs or fiscal responsibility, deficit 
and debt with all the cutbacks, I would say the one challenge that 
we as a House of Commons have yet to face is the challenge of how 
we work with these currency traders who are essentially running 
most of the central banks of the world. These unaccountable, 
unelected currency traders move literally a trillion dollars a day, 
pushing paper, playing the derivative games. I have referred to 
them before as the private casinos in the financial institutions of the 
world. These men and women who move that currency around in an 
unaccountable way are affecting our interest rates, which in turn 
affect the investment activity and the job creation activity.
<P>
	I do not know how we can call ourselves a sovereign nation when 
we think of the fact that we have essentially lost control of our 
currency. We are sitting here as elected people, but every day we 
bow down to the currency traders, asking what the dollar is going to 
be, what the interest rates are going to be.
<P>
	Do the men and women in this room have anything to do with 
what goes on with those currency traders? No. Those currency 
traders are controlling the agenda. No matter how fiscally 
responsible the government is in the House, they could say that it is 
not good enough. Then suddenly they give us another squeeze and 
drop our dollar or cause a jerk in interest rates.
<P>
	I would love to have a debate in the House one day on how the 
currency traders of the world manage their affairs and what their 
accountability is-not unlike the challenge we took up two years 
ago when we said that we wanted to see what was going on with the 
financial institutions in the country and what they were doing with 
small business. These financial institutions were not initially 
receptive to our exchange, our views and our attempts to try to 
make their attitude and their culture more responsive to business. 
However, because we worked together I believe we now have a 
constructive relationship with the banks. I now believe those banks 
are actually starting to enjoy the growth and the improvement they 
are experiencing in their small business relationships.
<P>
	I would like to put to the House that an even bigger challenge 
would be how we could take on the currency traders of the world so 
we can once again get control of our economic agenda.
<P>
	In closing my remarks on the bill once again I thank members 
opposite, members of the Reform Party and members of the Bloc 
for working with us on these amendments so we can hopefully get 
them through the House before the end of the week.
<P>
	This is probably the last time I will be on my feet before the 
referendum vote on Monday. I appeal to those small businessmen 
and women who hopefully are watching or are participating in this 
debate to think between now and next Monday about anything they 
can do to help make sure this campaign for Canada is won.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	I personally believe that one of the things small entrepreneurs 
can do, because they have flexibility, is maybe find a bit of time to 
get into their vans, cars or  trucks and take their families to visit our 
great province of Quebec this weekend.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15775"> 15775 </A></B>
<P>
	When I was a small businessman I did a lot of business in 
Quebec, and I never had any difficulty doing work in that great 
province. I believe that one of the ways we can make sure Quebec 
votes for Canada on Monday is to make sure that a majority of 
those people, especially in the outlying regions of Quebec, feel 
comfortable with those of us who are outside Quebec.
<P>
	I know it is a precarious moment right now. Things are very 
tenuous. However, I think the greatest asset we have in the country 
is people from one region of the country talking to another, one on 
one, not through television ads. I respect these rallies, but the best 
way to bring togetherness is when people sit down and have a 
constructive, warm and caring relationship.
<P>
	I do not think it is too late to make a tremendous turn in those 
numbers we all read in the newspapers right now. I believe the best 
way to turn those numbers is by making sure this weekend, if one is 
from Ontario and maybe planning on driving north to a cottage or 
east down to Buffalo or Niagara Falls, to travel instead to the 
outlying regions of Quebec. Together, when we talk about all the 
assets we have as a whole nation, we will end up staying together.
<P>
	Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, for giving me the 
opportunity to speak on the bill. I pray God that next week 
everything is all there for Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
this opportunity to speak on behalf of my party to Bill C-99, an Act 
to amend the Small Business Loans Act.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary made it very clear that small 
businesses play a very important role in the Canadian economy 
and, of course, the economy of Quebec. Both the government of 
Canada and the government of Quebec have set up programs to 
support small business, because one of the problems facing people 
who want to launch a small business is the financing.
<P>
	Often these people are very keen and have interesting ideas, and 
if governments do not find ways to support them, their ideas often 
remain undeveloped and the business never materializes. Both the 
government of Quebec and the Canadian government have taken 
steps to provide assistance to entrepreneurs.
<P>
	Of course there are private investment funds in various 
provinces including Quebec, such as the FTQ's Fonds de solidarité 
which has some impact in this sector. However, the parliamentary 
secretary said that today in Canada a total of nearly $8 billion is 
invested under this program, which is an indication of its 
importance.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	Another indication is the fact that the program is popular among 
entrepreneurs. In our riding offices, we often see people with good 
ideas who decide to ask their member of Parliament for 
information on programs that could help them start a business.
<P>
	Canada has legislation, the Small Business Loans Act, which 
was adopted several years ago. This legislation has made it 
possible to lend money and start businesses. The bill before the 
House today proposes a number of amendments to this legislation.
<P>
	Originally, the purpose of this legislation was to provide 
guarantees for bank loans to entrepreneurs who wanted to start a 
business. This guarantee could vary from 85 to 90 per cent, and in 
fact varied from year to year.
<P>
	The cost to the Canadian government is what it costs someone 
who wants to guarantee loans. If the individual's business is not as 
successful as he expected, if he goes bankrupt, then the government 
of Canada has to pick up the loss incurred by the banks. In 1992, 
these losses totalled $44 million. The maximum was changed in 
legislation adopted in 1993 and a number of provisions were 
changed as well, so that in 1995-96, the government of Canada 
could be faced with picking up a total of as much as $100 million in 
losses.
<P>
	Considering the current state of federal finances, it is 
understandable that the minister should be concerned and that the 
debate on small business in the Standing Committee on Industry 
had to consider this aspect as well.
<P>
	That is why we have a bill before the House today. The purpose 
of the bill is to reduce the maximum for guarantees provided by the 
federal government. The maximum would be reduced from 90 to 
85 per cent of the loans approved. By reducing the maximum, the 
government of Canada is of course reducing its responsibility for 
amounts to be paid in case of bankruptcy.
<P>
	There is of course a corollary to all this: if the guarantee is less 
extensive, people with higher risk projects that may be more 
innovative will have more trouble obtaining guarantees. This is not 
unusual, and if the banks are unwilling to take the risk, some 
projects may be rejected.
<P>
	In fact, the 85 per cent rate goes back to before the amendments 
in 1993. It is of course an area where the government could save 
money. We hope there are no business people with clever and 
brilliant ideas, who are refused loan guarantees because of this 
provision.
<P>
	Also, an important aspect of this provision concerns us in the 
Bloc Quebecois considerably. With the amendment, the ceiling 
could be lowered even further, should the government decide to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15776"> 15776 </A></B>
<P>
regulate it lower. As  one of my colleagues was saying earlier, for 
the moment it is at 85 per cent. It could drop to 60 per cent. It could 
drop to 50 per cent. We really do not know.
<P>
	What is of concern in all this is that the government is giving 
itself the option in the bill before us to lower the ceiling by 
regulation. Government by regulation is reprehensible. I think the 
House of Commons has to take measures to ensure that the bills 
passed are good for the country. I think, when legislation gives the 
government the option to decide things of this importance by 
regulation, we are running the risk of hurting the country's business 
people.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	There is also another provision in the bill that causes us some 
concern. Basically the aim of amendment in the bill is to have 
moneys paid by the Minister of Finance in the event of a 
bankruptcy absorbed some other way. In other words, the Minister 
of Finance does not want to see the $100 million planned for this 
year back again next year. Another way for the government to 
ensure that losses are cut or even eliminated is for the program to 
be self-sufficient.
<P>
	My colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Industry, said it well: ``How are we going to go about recovering 
costs?'' Administrative measures will be taken. An annual 
administration fee will be charged. There will also be a claim 
processing fee.
<P>
	The bill provides that these administrative fees are not to be paid 
directly by the business people. It does provide that they can be 
paid by the business people indirectly. In other words, the interest 
rates on loans could be raised to cover the administrative fees that 
the banks would have to pay.
<P>
	This means doing rather deviously or hypocritically what cannot 
be done directly.
<P>
	I would like to think that government finances are important, but 
the program's efficiency is going to be reduced by this measure. It 
will be reduced, because the banks are not going to go out of their 
way for business people. By definition, the banks want to be 
profitable and they charge the highest interest rates the market will 
bear.
<P>
	As a result, entrepreneurs will have to bear higher costs in order 
to meet program requirements. This is one measure that causes 
serious concern among the members of the Bloc.
<P>
	There are some items that we would certainly have liked to see 
included in the bill which are not there. The Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Industry has said that the measures 
proposed in the bill were discussed in the Standing Committee on 
Industry and are contained in its report tabled in October 1994: 
<I>Taking Care of Small Business</I>.
<P>
	Although the Bloc was considerably involved in the drafting of 
this report and endorsed the bulk of its recommendations, it made a 
number of comments, in the form of recommendations, 
amendments or notes, which we felt improved upon the proposals 
for making the Small Business Loans Act more efficient and 
effective. One of these proposals was that ``the Small Business 
Loans Act ought to provide guarantees for small business operating 
capital loans. To implement such a measure, the government 
should carry out a cost analysis of such a program and take a 
responsible fiscal approach''.
<P>
	We know that the loan guarantee given is intended to help 
businesses meet expenses related to very specific aspects such as 
buildings and equipment, but not working capital. The problem is 
that, in recession conditions and crisis situations, and as a result of 
certain changes in the Bankruptcy Act as well, there are many 
small businesses which need financing for their working capital for 
a time, but they cannot take advantage of the act as it stands to 
obtain either financing or a guarantee of financing.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	To improve the way we help our small businesses, the Bloc 
Quebecois would have favoured an amendment saying that the 
operating capital of a business could also be financed with a 
government guaranteed loan under the Small Businesses Loans 
Act.
<P>
	There are a number of things we find disturbing in this bill. I 
mentioned the reduction in the maximum rate, which means fewer 
businesses will have access to the program or those that do may 
have to meet more requirements. Second, there is the matter of 
administration fees which we think will be passed on to businesses 
through an increase in the interest rates they will have to pay. And 
third, there are aspects that are not covered by the legislation such 
as the financing of operating capital.
<P>
	That is why the Bloc Quebecois will discuss the bill in 
committee, and propose amendments that will probably be along 
the lines of the comments I just made.
<P>
	I would like to make a few more comments as I conclude my 
speech. This may annoy some government members who will 
probably think that I am not on topic or other members who will 
say: ``Duplication and overlap, here we go again. It is the same old 
sovereignist or separatist refrain from the Bloc''. In any case, as I 
mentioned in my introductory remarks, in Quebec we have a 
number of programs with substantially the same objectives. Take 
the Paillé plan, named after the present Minister of Industry, which 
also provides for loan guarantees. Take what is being done by the 
Société de développement industriel du Québec. Since I became a 
member of Parliament, I noticed that many constituents who want 
to start a business are told to go to the provincial office and the 
federal office. In fact the situation is not quite clear. Often there is 
out and out competition.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15777"> 15777 </A></B>
<P>
	Who is responsible for this competition or overlap? I do not 
want to get involved in all that, but I simply want to point out 
that there is some overlap that is counterproductive. It does not 
do the entrepreneurs any good because they often do not know 
where they stand. And when governments at the provincial and 
federal levels do not belong to the same party, people often believe 
that if they go to one government, the other government will be 
annoyed and that will get them in trouble. I myself have never 
noticed that since becoming a member, but there are people who 
think they can play one government off against another or people 
who think there may be difficulty applying to one level of 
government when application or representation has also been 
made to the other government.
<P>
	So I think that, when measures such as this are before the House, 
we should note-and I am not saying criticize, but we should at 
least note-that there are overlaps, which could hurt business 
people and the government's budget.
<P>
	The same taxpayers, whether they are from Quebec or Canada, 
are helping to fund these programs through their taxes. And I really 
think a number of people use this sort of competition to try to get 
the best out of both programs. I think, in the long term that 
governments put themselves in situations where their expenditures 
under these programs will increase because of the competition, 
because of the overlap and because people try to take advantage of 
the opposition or even the competition between governments.
<P>
	With bills like this one, it is important to point out problems of 
overlapping created by such programs.
<P>
	In concluding, I would like to make one comment. More and 
more in the business community in Quebec and Canada, in the 
government and even in the Liberal Party, which did not follow 
such policies in the past, we are hearing talk of how the 
government should step aside, and the people who go into business 
should take on their responsibilities.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	There is a movement to re-establish the laws of free competition, 
to promote globalization, to pare down the size of government. The 
Minister of Finance is often seen to support such ideas.
<P>
	When the time comes to make cuts in social programs, in 
education, in unemployment insurance, we hear ``the government 
is overspending, it is too costly, the government must interfere less 
and less in the economy''. On the other hand, when we come to 
bills like this one, when we realize that when it comes down to it 
the government is guaranteeing eight billion dollars worth of loans 
this year, and I think that the legislation allows up to $12 billion. 
We realize that the neoliberal discourse of the governments was the 
same; it is the Liberals this time, but it was the same thing when it 
was the  Conservatives. I cannot see much difference in practice 
between the policies of the former Conservative government and 
those of the present Liberal one. They both took a neoliberal 
stance, calling for government to withdraw from the economy, but 
yet when we get down to practicalities, to instances where 
according to the very theories they espouse the government's 
presence might be questioned, then we see that they are continuing 
the same kind of intervention as before.
<P>
	Not that I condemn such intervention-the Bloc Quebecois is in 
favour of a healthy government involvement in economic 
affairs-but, on examining the bill and everything that goes with it 
and looking at what the Small Businesses Loans Act has done in the 
past, despite the fact that it has been extremely effective and much 
appreciated by entrepreneurs, I am forced to conclude that the 
government is saying that cuts must be made, the government must 
withdraw. In situations like these one realizes that not only is the 
government not withdrawing but it is even becoming increasingly 
involved.
<P>
	A few years ago there were $2 to $3 millions in loan guarantees 
annually, and this year the figure will be $8 billion. Perhaps, the 
way things are set out, the figure next year will be even higher. 
There is one big question mark: the government is acting in such a 
way that it will not cost anything on the budget. All the better, one 
might say. It is the banks and the entrepreneurs who will pay, but 
basically it is the government which gives the guarantees but wants 
to arrange things so that it will cost nothing. In the long run, the 
businesses themselves pay, because of the interest rates charged on 
the loans.
<P>
	One wonders really what purpose these programs serve. This 
morning I was looking at the industry committee's report ``Taking 
Care of Small Business''. Experts appeared before the committee 
stating that there was no certainty that business started up under the 
projects in question would not have started up anyway.
<P>
	I heard, in fact I listened carefully to the speech made earlier by 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry. He talked 
about a lot of things, but I would have appreciated it if he had tried 
to be more specific about the rationale underlying this bill. Is it 
effective? Is it true that about three-quarters or at least half of the 
businesses that were started with the help of this legislation would 
have been started in any case? What use is a program that 
guarantees loans but which basically does not cost the government 
a penny? We could say this is wonderful, it does not cost the 
government a penny, but on the other hand, if that is true and if the 
impact is neutral, why is the government involved in this kind of 
program?
<P>
	Do not get me wrong. As a member for the Bloc Quebecois, I 
will debate the bill in committee, we will ask questions and we will 
propose amendments, but I am very disappointed that a 
government that wants to make  cuts everywhere and has not done 
so in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15778"> 15778 </A></B>
<P>
this sector although, according to its ideology, it probably should, 
has introduced a bill like this one.
<P>
	I am very disappointed when a government introduces a bill 
providing for measures that, as was pointed out in the standing 
committee, were ineffective, and in the presentation given by the 
parliamentary secretary is incapable of proving otherwise.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	One wonders what the government is doing. Basically, it extends 
legislation, changes maximum guarantees and tinkers with details. 
Personally, I think this kind of legislation is effective and that the 
government has a role to play in the economy, but I would have 
liked to see the people who administer or claim to administer 
billions of dollars of taxpayers' money be more consistent and 
more credible when they introduce bills like this one.
<P>
	We will probably vote against the bill, considering my 
comments on this legislation, but once again, in concluding, I am 
inclined to be rather wary of a government that again is asking us to 
extend and restructure a bill, although it is incapable of 
demonstrating the bill is effective and produces the desired results 
for entrepreneurs and the Canadian economy.
<P>
	I will conclude my speech after comments that have indicated I 
am somewhat disillusioned with a government I thought would be 
more consistent in the way it manages the affairs of state. After two 
years as a member of the House of Commons, one becomes 
increasingly convinced there will have to be some major changes 
made in Canada, starting with the Canadian federation-or with the 
government that now claims to head that federation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
stand to enter the debate on Bill C-99, a bill to amend certain 
sections of the Small Business Loans Act.
<P>
	I want to pay particular tribute to the parliamentary secretary to 
the Minister of Industry for his very kind remarks and his 
description characterizing the industry committee that dealt with 
the report ``Taking Care of Small Business'', which was tabled 
about a year ago, and also some of the recommendations in the 
report, some of which are included and recognized in the bill.
<P>
	I would like to follow up on some of the suggestions he made 
about the significance of small business in the economy of Canada. 
It is not a secret to us or anybody who follows the economy of 
Canada that approximately 80 per cent to 85 per cent of the new 
jobs created in Canada are created by small business. When it 
comes to the Small Business Loans Act it is precisely that sector of 
our economy that this act addresses. In my opinion, these 
amendments are not sufficient. They do not go far  enough and 
some of them are virtually counterproductive.
<P>
	We must recognize that in the new economy that is developing, 
the important issue and the characteristic of a business is the ability 
to apply knowledge in a way that will provide for new services, 
new products, and particularly the application of new technology 
and the most recent discoveries of science. It is very clear that in 
the globalization of the economy and in the international 
competition that is developing it will become increasingly 
significant that the science and the technology of a nation will 
become a determining factor in that particular competitive 
environment.
<P>
	One critical factor in developing the ability to transfer 
knowledge and apply it to new products or new ways of processing 
and doing things will require a skilled and very knowledgeable 
workforce. That does not come by accident. It comes as a result not 
only of good technical schools and good universities, but begins in 
primary school, kindergarten to grade 12. It is here that we need to 
change our educational system so that it will become far more 
geared to science and technology, and particularly the science area, 
and that we all become sensitive and recognize that it is really 
science that is going to make the difference in the next century.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	We also know from past experience that it is the small business 
that is most able to apply this new knowledge, because it is not 
fettered with all this bureaucracy. It is not fettered with all these 
regulations and things that are internal and the internal politics that 
stand in the way of new ideas and adapting to change. We need to 
develop that kind of awareness and recognize that it is the small 
business group that is going to be the leader in this particular area.
<P>
	The whole idea of small business rests on entrepreneurship. 
Unfortunately, today in this country we have what is known as 
bureaucratic entrepreneurship. We all know what that is. That 
means that a bureaucrat sees how many more bureaucrats he can 
get under his supervision. That will mean that his salary and power 
will increase. Therefore, the entrepreneurship is one of developing 
larger and larger departments. We have a very well developed 
entrepreneurship orientation, ability, and skill level in that area. 
However, we do not have that same level of expertise, that same 
skill, that same fully developed attitude in the developing of 
entrepreneurship in business and the application of knowledge to 
produce new products and adapt to new processes in developing 
those products.
<P>
	Right down into the kindergarten level, all the way up through 
the universities, we need to develop this attitude, this orientation 
toward entrepreneurship. The Small Business Loans Act is directed 
precisely to that area. We must recognize that the Small Business 
Loans Act is not a new idea. It has been around since 1961. It has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15779"> 15779 </A></B>
<P>
been  amended many times. It was designed in the original instance 
to provide for innovation to our economy in Canada.
<P>
	I want to hearken back to a moment ago when we talked about 
developing entrepreneurship, the skill and so on. We now need to 
recognize that it is this legislation that initially was designed to do 
just that. We should look at some of the provisions of this particular 
piece of legislation and ask ourselves whether the new amendments 
will facilitate or will stand in the way of that kind of development.
<P>
	We all know that small business has as its major impediment to 
further growth and development, very often in its initial 
establishment, access to capital. There are two kinds of capital to 
which business requires access. One is equity capital, which 
establishes the machines, the facilities, and those kinds of things. 
The other is loan capital. There are two kinds of loan capital. 
Usually it is centred around operational capital, which allows the 
business to operate from one day to the next. We discovered in the 
last year that even though everybody says there is all kinds of 
capital available, we have story after story of business telling us 
that it is the access to capital that is its stumbling block. It is not 
getting the access it needs.
<P>
	I want to draw to the attention of the House some of the elements 
that came to our attention when we studied this problem in the 
industry committee.
<P>
	With the amendments that were implemented in 1992, the loans 
provided under the Small Business Loans Act increased 
dramatically. Between 1993 and 1994 the number of loans grew to 
42,500 from 13,000 in 1992. The new lending reached almost $2.5 
billion and averaged $58,500 per loan, from a previous average of 
$37,000 per loan.
<P>
	There was a sad note in the evidence that was heard before the 
committee. A 1988 study concluded that two-thirds of the loans 
would have been made even without the government guarantee, 
which at that point was at 90 per cent. Since the revisions, however, 
Mr. Al Cotton of the Toronto Dominion Bank told the committee 
that 75 per cent of the bank's small business loans would not have 
been made in the absence of the guarantee. Shortly after his 
presentation, Mr. Kluge of the Canadian Imperial Bank of 
Commerce stated that most SBLA lending would have been 
granted in the absence of the program, but that in certain high risk 
sectors, such as new restaurants, the guarantee was important.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	We were left with a dilemma. Here we had two bank officials 
from two of the major banks, one saying that the loans would not 
have been given without the guarantee of the loans act, another 
bank official saying that they would have been granted. It becomes 
a real dilemma. Did  this loan act really produce the kind of result 
desired or did it not?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Sure it did.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> My worthy opponent says of course it did. He 
comes from one of the banks that was not represented by those 
other two, so I suspect he would agree.
<P>
	The cost of administering the program exceeds two per cent of 
administration, which is another problem. At the present time the 
Small Business Loans Act tacks onto the loan a two per cent 
administration fee, which becomes part of the principal and can be 
amortized over the length of loan, or I suppose the individual can 
pay it off up front if he wishes to do so. In any event, the two per 
cent is not sufficient to cover the loss or the administration of the 
loan.
<P>
	The third point is institutional loans. Under this provision it 
suggests the loan level is rather high in this way of doing business 
between financial institutions and their various lenders. I want to 
draw the Haines-Riding study into this a little later in my remarks, 
when I will get into this in more detail.
<P>
	I now want to go on to the specific provisions of this act as it is 
before the House today. The first of these is the reduction of the 
government's liability from 90 per cent to 85 per cent. In other 
words, the loan guarantees are now no higher than 85 per cent of 
that loan. That is one provision.
<P>
	The second provision, which we should all pay very special 
attention to, says that future changes to the rate of the liability of 
government are transferred from Parliament to cabinet. This means 
that in the future the liability that will be incurred by this 
government and will rest upon the shoulders of every Canadian 
who pays taxes will be decided not by the people's representatives 
but by the cabinet. I think that is an abrogation of democratic 
responsibility. I want to take very strong exception to this. In fact I 
want to introduce right here the notion and the statement that the 
Reform Party will not support this bill on the basis of that provision 
alone. Unless an amendment is made to withdraw that provision 
and that transfer of power from the Parliament to the cabinet, we 
will oppose this bill, even if we would agree with everything else in 
the bill. We do not agree with everything else, but that is sufficient 
in my opinion to oppose the bill in its entirety.
<P>
	Why do I take such a strong view of this? This is a democratic 
country. This country is based on the principles of democracy, 
which means that the people in this House who are elected to 
represent the Canadian people have been elected to look after the 
best interests of those people who have elected us. That means we 
should represent them as honestly as we possibly can, and do so 
fairly, justly, and equitably. That is what I was elected to do.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15780"> 15780 </A></B>
<P>
	This kind of amendment takes away the right of 
parliamentarians to represent their people on the floor of this 
House. That is wrong. It is wrong in principle. The time has come 
for us to take very strong exception to this kind of amendment.
<P>
	We all know that within the platform, the philosophy, and the 
principles of the Reform Party of Canada we stand for precisely the 
ability to represent our people. We want more free votes in this 
House. We have had some examples of free votes in this House, 
and the government is to be commended for those few instances. 
However, the government is to be severely chastised for those 
moments when its members did exercise their free vote and were 
punished for doing so. That is a fault, a blemish on this 
government's record in terms of its democratic principles and the 
application of democratic decision making.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	We talk about a referendum. There certain instances when every 
person in Canada should exercise their right directly and 
immediately not only at the time of exercising a ballot in favour of 
a particular person but also in favour of major social, ethical or 
moral issues on which they feel very strongly and about which the 
majority should decide what the issue in Canada ought to be.
<P>
	One which has been well publicized is capital punishment. We 
go on from there as well. There is the other place, the Senate of 
Canada, and we believe there is also responsibility that it be 
democratized; that the individuals who sit in that chamber to 
provide and exercise sober second thought be elected and that they 
fairly and accurately represent the various regions of Canada so 
there can be fair representation not only by individuals but by the 
various regions of Canada as well.
<P>
	Therefore within that framework of deep philosophic orientation 
we oppose the provision in this bill which would amend the act in 
such a way that the power moves from the House of Commons, the 
Parliament of the country, to the cabinet.
<P>
	Another provision is the application of an annual fee of 1.25 per 
cent to the administration of a loan, the outstanding balance, paid 
by the lender. It is very interesting how this fee is to be 
administered. It is to be paid by the lender and the lender may not 
recover the cost of that 1.25 per cent except through an increase in 
interest rates.
<P>
	It is interesting what the act does. The earlier limit on the interest 
rate was 1.75 per cent above prime. The amendment proposed says 
the new limit is 3 per cent above prime. It does not take a 
mathematical genius to add 1.75 and 1.25 and come up with 3, 
which now means very clearly that the bank or any lending 
institution may increase its interest rates 3 per cent above prime 
and  thereby recover its full 1.25 per cent. That is what this 
provision is.
<P>
	Another provision provides for a claims processing fee. When 
we ask the various department officials how much that fee will be, 
when will it be applied, under what conditions will it apply, will it 
be a standard fee across any loan, will it make any difference, they 
say they do not really know because they have not yet decided 
whether they will apply such a fee.
<P>
	Why does the act have this provision in it? They might want to 
recover certain costs associated with claims. That is very 
interesting but it begs the question of what kinds of conditions must 
a lending institution meet in order to avoid being assessed a claims 
processing fee.
<P>
	There is absolutely no provision in the act that would suggest the 
parameters, the guidelines, the details under which a claims fee 
would be applied. It is dangerous when we have open ended 
legislation of that kind when nobody knows how much, nobody 
knows under what conditions, nobody knows under what 
guidelines it will be applied.
<P>
	I was absolutely astounded when I read this. When we got the 
briefing, it sounded very different. When I went back to the actual 
act I discovered that really the slant was quite different. I want to 
read this exactly as it is written. Section 4(1)(e.1): ``The minister 
may prescribe the terms and conditions on which a lender may 
release any security, including a personal guarantee, taken for the 
repayment of a business improvement loan''.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	We were told in no uncertain terms that this dealt with 
guarantees, the actual phrase being personal guarantees. I can see 
where a small businessman getting started who becomes a little bit 
desperate will actually provide a personal guarantee. He will say: 
``Here is my house and my personal effects. I will stand good on a 
personal basis for this part of the loan''. When half the loan is paid 
the lender says he will now take the personal guarantee away.
<P>
	That is only one small part. It includes the release of any 
securities, which includes anything else. It could be a facility, a 
building, equipment, land, a variety of things. If there is a loan 
outstanding of $250,000 and half of it is repaid, that is a $125,000 
liability. If at that point the lender can now release security, where 
is the security left for the balance of that loan? I can see the 
understanding that it goes to the personal guarantee because the 
building is probably worth the $125,000, but if the lender cannot 
take that off too and the act allows him to do that then I ask myself 
what kind of protection there is for the Government of Canada on 
the hook for the guarantee of 85 per cent of that loan.
<P>
	So much for a review of the particular provisions. There are 
some issues we should be aware of. I referred earlier to the 
Haines-Riding study from Carleton University in Ottawa. It makes 
some very interesting  observations. I think we should go back into 
history a little. The Small Business Loans Act up until this point 
had a ceiling of sales of $2 million; in other words, a business that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15781"> 15781 </A></B>
<P>
had sales of more than $2 million would not qualify for the SBLA 
loan. Under this act now that level is $5 million.
<P>
	The Haines-Riding study shows very clearly that businesses with 
sales of $2 million or less have a much lower failure rate when it 
comes to the repayment of loans than those with sales between $2 
million and $5 million. The differential between those loans is a 
failure rate increase of 14.7 per cent. That is pretty significant.
<P>
	We need to combine that with the increase in the amount of loans 
outstanding as well. In the past the maximum SBLA loan one could 
have was $150,000. That has now increased to $250,000, which 
means, although we cannot say for sure, if the size of the business 
and maximum loan has increased we can conclude the loss rate will 
increase proportionately. Therefore if it costs $100 million now on 
an annual basis to run this program what will it be under the new 
provisions? I think the answer is very obvious. It will be higher 
than it is today.
<P>
	That brings us into a very serious conundrum. On one hand we 
have an act that is supposed to build and encourage businesses. It 
will do that in a variety of cases. It should then generate more tax 
revenue and things of this nature which would then increase the 
economy of Canada and everything would roll along more 
smoothly than it did before.
<P>
	The maximum of the SBLA loan ceiling has now moved from $4 
billion to $12 billion, a threefold increase. If it now, under the $4 
billion ceiling, runs at $100 billion, what will it do under the $12 
billion? If the proportion remains constant it will also be a 
threefold increase. We cannot afford that.
<P>
	The national debt is somewhere around $560 billion, growing at 
about $1,000 per second. About $45 billion to $60 billion is paid 
out in interest, much of which is foreign currency denominated. 
With the Canadian dollar being where it is today, can anyone 
imagine what this is doing to our social programs? That is why we 
are in trouble with the health care system. That is why we are in 
trouble with transfer payments. That is why we are in trouble with 
welfare payments. That is what makes this kind of bill 
questionable.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	Yet people say they were told at the beginning that 80 per cent to 
85 per cent of the new jobs are created by small business. Right. 
Should we not encourage small business? Right. Should not our 
government programs to the greatest degree possible be 
self-financing? Right. This bill is supposed to do all those things.
<P>
	If it does that, then we can support that. However, we still want 
to go back to the earlier point I made about this  democracy. That is 
absolutely at the heart of this issue and we cannot, we dare not 
allow that to get in the way of implementing this bill.
<P>
	I want to address one final point, competition. I want to read a 
very extensive point made very effectively by our study on small 
business. We were told by Mr. Doug Robbins of Robbinex that 
financial institutions are increasingly using the Small Businesses 
Loans Act-get a load of this-to finance assets, for example cars 
and trucks, that are able to obtain financing without a government 
guarantee.
<P>
	Data provided by the Scotia Bank on its small business lending 
portfolio show that SBLA lending is more heavily concentrated in 
areas of transportation by as much as 25 per cent than the bank's 
total small business lending portfolio in which transportation and 
communication lending represents only 6 per cent. The 
representatives of Newport Credit and the Canadian Financing and 
Leasing Association, specializing in asset based financing, told the 
committee they are having difficulty competing with lenders who 
benefit from government guarantees.
<P>
	Since when has the government become that great and wonderful 
arbiter to determine winners and losers in the marketplace? The 
government has no business getting into this area. If a business 
cannot succeed in the marketplace it should not be there. That is the 
part that bothers me more than anything else in a bill of this kind, 
this orientation. We need to recognize this is not a simple, easy 
answer to our economic problems.
<P>
	The committee received conflicting views on the future of the 
Small Businesses Loans Act as well. It was suggested the act be 
expanded by extending it to working capital. Neither the Small 
Businesses Loans Act nor this bill does that. It was also suggested 
that it be restricted by focusing on rapidly growing business that 
enhances the country's knowledge base and generates skilled 
employment, which we already talked about.
<P>
	With increase lending comes increased taxpayer exposure. We 
have already dealt with that. This amendment, although it goes part 
of the way, does not go all the way. It should go further.
<P>
	The committee suggested we reduce the percentage of 
government guarantee, which has been done, reduce the percentage 
of assets that can be financed, and reduce the maximum loan 
amounts, which the bill does not do. In fact it goes in the opposite 
direction. It doubles the exposure that would have been happening 
under the act as it is now.
<P>
	The bill has numerous shortcomings like releasing securities, 
any kind of securities as well as personal guarantees. We need to be 
very clear and an amendment is needed in this area.
<P>
	This bill also increases the liability of government even though 
the minister stood up in the House and said the  bill, because it is a 
self-financing or a cost liquidating kind of a program, does not 
increase the liability of government. I dare suggest the experience 
will show that it does increase the liability of government. If it does 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15782"> 15782 </A></B>
<P>
not increase the liability of government then I ask the minister 
whether there is any need for a program of this kind.
<P>
	Let me emphasize once again that the most serious flaw in the 
bill is that it disenfranchises parliamentarians. It moves the 
authority to make decisions and obligations on behalf of the people 
of Canada from the House to the cabinet. That is wrong. 
Democracy must never be denied.
<P>
	I reiterate that unless that provision is removed from the bill we 
will oppose it.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-99, 
an act to amend the Small Business Loans Act and to share with the 
House the concerns and hopes of small business owners and 
managers throughout Guelph-Wellington.
<P>
	At this important time in Canadian history I remind all 
Canadians that it is the hope of small business people in 
Guelph-Wellington, their families and their employees that 
Canada remains united. They recognize the imperfections of our 
confederation, but they realize, as we have in the past, that we can 
continue to evolve to make our country always stronger. They are 
confident that a united Canada, one that includes Quebec as an 
active member of our nation, will continue to be regarded 
worldwide as the best country in the world in which to live.
<P>
	Bill C-99 is part of our ongoing effort to reduce the deficit, fulfil 
the promises we made to Canadians two years ago and provide the 
support that is necessary to enable small business to grow and to 
create jobs. I congratulate the Minister of Industry and the Minister 
of Finance who have directed and focused our efforts to strengthen 
small business in Canada. The Minister of Industry visited my 
community last year. He was welcomed by small business people 
who encouraged him to continue his initiative of providing support 
and assistance to them, so that they can continue to build a strong 
community in Guelph-Wellington and elsewhere.
<P>
	Small business people in Guelph-Wellington, when talking to 
me, remind me that they have hope in our future. They talk to me as 
women and men who have taken risks in order to build a life for 
themselves and their families. They are creating jobs in my 
community and in every riding across Canada. They look to us, the 
federal government, to assist them in that important responsibility.
<P>
	The Small Business Loan Act is part of our efforts. Since 1961 
more than 420,000 loans, totalling over $15.5 billion, have been 
made to small businesses. These loans  have helped small business 
gain access to capital for start-up, expansion and growth. The 
program's success lies in its ability to serve as an economic 
development tool and as an example of public sector and private 
sector co-operation.
<P>
	Guelph-Wellington recently hosted, through the efforts of 
small business leaders like Catherine Billings, Anne 
Redfearn-Grobbo, Richard Zinck and Valerie Poulton, Community 
Spirit '95, a small business expo, which brought together business 
people to exchange ideas, share expertise and celebrate the 
successes of small businesses in Wellington county. The message 
that I received at Community Spirit '95 and wherever I meet small 
business leaders is: We need government to get out of the way 
where it causes us unnecessary burden; to listen to us when we have 
ideas for our future and to provide the assistance necessary for us to 
weather uncertainty and to expand our resources when we want to 
create jobs and strengthen our achievements. The Small Business 
Loans Act program allows every small business in 
Guelph-Wellington whose revenues do not exceed $5 million 
annually to ask for that assistance.
<P>
	Small business people in my community understand the 
seriousness of our financial crisis. They know that deficit spending 
is not the way to sustain our economic future. They are concerned 
about taxation and they want the government to manage its money 
as well and as carefully as they manage their own money. They 
recognize the need to reduce expenditures and to refocus spending.
<P>
	The Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal visited 
Guelph this fall where he spoke to representatives of small business 
about the program review that will redesign government. They 
welcomed the change because they support our efforts to spend 
what we have and not to mortgage our future.
<P>
	Recently, the Small Business Loans Act program has suffered 
tremendous losses for the government. Assuming continuation of 
the historic losses that have occurred over the past few years, the 
annual program cost would increase by over $100 million. Clearly 
this is a threat to the future of the program. The potential cost of the 
program given these circumstances, and the government's need for 
deficit control required that the program be brought to full cost 
recovery.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	The federal government included an examination of the Small 
Business Loans Act in its program review process. During the 
months of October and November 1994 the review included 
extensive consultations with major stakeholders, representing 
lenders and those who borrow. As part of our efforts to encourage 
more participation by members of Parliament, the 
recommendations of the industry committee and the small business 
working committee 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15783"> 15783 </A></B>
<P>
were also taken into  account. All stakeholders supported the move 
to full cost recovery.
<P>
	Small business people in Guelph-Wellington know that in 
order to survive as a nation we will have to choose. They have told 
me that we can no longer afford the luxuries and excesses of the 
past. As they have had to do in their businesses, they have asked me 
to work for them to make decisions on what is important to us and 
for our future and to concentrate on what will make us strong again.
<P>
	They do that in their businesses each and every day and they 
welcome a federal government that from the day of its election in 
October 1993 does the very same in order to secure a strong future 
for this country.
<P>
	As part of our efforts we have introduced a new 1-1/4 per cent 
annual administration fee on each lender's average outstanding 
balance of the Small Business Loans Act made after March 31, 
1995. We have also announced that the maximum interest rate that 
a lender can charge under the program has been increased by 1-1/4 
per cent.
<P>
	Bill C-99 also includes changes which will complete the move to 
full cost recovery and improve the administration of the program. 
These changes will mean that the Small Business Loans Act will be 
better targeted toward small business which really needs its help. 
These changes go hand in hand with our efforts to improve access 
to loans to small business by our financial institutions. While we 
aim at cost recovery, our commitment to strengthening the future 
of small business in Canada is unchanged.
<P>
	Small business recognizes the need for co-operation. Each and 
every day in Guelph-Wellington small business leaders rely on 
distribution, transportation and communication in order to survive. 
They have called on me to bring a message to Ottawa. Let us work 
together: government, industry and labour to get the job done.
<P>
	In Guelph-Wellington we know the importance of listening and 
working together to build a stronger community. This summer, 
Wendi Bacon of the Royal Bank Business Centre brought me 
together again with the leaders of financial institutions throughout 
my riding. We discussed the concerns of small business people, 
their frustrations in obtaining capital and their suggestions for 
strengthening their relationship with the banks.
<P>
	Everyone recognized that there is more to be done. But it was 
also an opportunity to review what has happened in the past two 
years and to remind ourselves that we have met with some success.
<P>
	Also this summer I had the opportunity to meet with small 
business people, leaders like Phil Greenway of Danby Products and 
Dwayne Mott of Orbex Computer Systems who reminded me that 
they want deficit reduction and they demand that the government 
plan carefully, consult extensively and act responsibly.
<P>
	Community leaders like Michael Henry, general manager of the 
Guelph Chamber of Commerce, Ralph Macdonald of the 
Rockwood and Eramosa Township Business Association and Mike 
Lazarakos of the Guelph Small Business Association, bring 
together business and government in order to work out solutions 
and most important, to listen to one another in order that we 
improve and enhance small businesses in Guelph-Wellington.
<P>
	Small business leaders throughout Canada have told the 
government that the primary lending issue for them is access, not 
the cost of financing. We believe that by making the Small 
Business Loans Act self-sustaining, these changes will ensure that 
access will continue.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	In the past two years I have participated in the ground breaking 
of a new Purolator facility, welcomed the Minister of Industry as he 
visited Skyjack and Linamar, walked with the minister of 
agriculture as he toured Semex, visited countless businesses and 
congratulated our business leaders on their successes. 
Guelph-Wellington supports its businesses and it celebrates their 
successes.
<P>
	As a former small business manager I share the frustrations of 
individuals, couples and partners who have a dream and who work 
hard to establish that dream in a business of their own. I also share 
the fulfilment and know how enriching owning, operating and 
working in a small business can be.
<P>
	I am excited to tell small business owners, managers and 
employees that the federal government recognizes that it must 
create a better environment for jobs and growth in the small 
business sector.
<P>
	We have eased restrictions on internal trade, proving to the world 
and to ourselves that federalism works. Removing these barriers is 
good news to many of the businesses that sell products and provide 
services to other parts of Canada. This is welcome news to 
Sleeman's Brewery, which knows that various provincial liquor 
boards practise selective listing policies. Mackinnon Transport 
should welcome this initiative. It is aware that transportation 
regulations differ from province to province. D&amp;J Construction in 
my riding saw new opportunities because construction procedures 
are different from one province to another. Trodat Canada, Clear 
Choice Manufacturing and Autosparks are companies that have 
told me that our patchwork of regulation standards and various 
provincial laws are unacceptable to them and to their employees.
<P>
	We have also opened doors through exports. Canada is a major 
exporting nation. By forging partnerships with the provinces and 
working as Team Canada we have built a new approach to selling 
Canada to the world.
<P>
	Nipponia Export Limited of Puslinch is one example of this 
success. During a recent trip to Brazil it sold 200 cattle in a deal 
worth almost half a million dollars. The  University of Guelph 
re-signed an agreement with a university in Chile. Valcom Limited 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15784"> 15784 </A></B>
<P>
recently negotiated joint ventures and recruited distributors at 
Telecom 95.
<P>
	The message from the business community of 
Guelph-Wellington is loud and clear: we can compete, we can 
produce and we can succeed.
<P>
	Bill C-99 is not the sole solution to the concerns raised to me by 
my constituents. It is a part of our strategy to further our 
commitment to our future. It is legislation which fulfils promises, 
makes government more accountable through cost recovery and 
strengthens the relationship that exists between government and 
business.
<P>
	We have more to do. Together we must address the problems of 
the GST and we must eliminate the underground economy. I am 
proud to be working with union representatives in Wellington 
county to give suggestions to the Minister of Finance and the 
Minister of National Revenue to address an underground economy 
which costs us revenue and costs us jobs. The underground 
economy does no Canadian any good. With it we prolong the 
deficit and we prohibit Canadian men and women from their 
responsibility of providing for themselves and their families. At the 
same time the people of Guelph-Wellington look forward to the 
government fulfilling its promise to replace the GST. We will do 
that.
<P>
	We know that it will require all 10 provinces and the federal 
government to work out a solution to the GST which will make it 
fairer and simpler and ease the administrative burden on business. 
Again, my constituents have provided me with suggestions which I 
have been pleased to forward to the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The government remains strongly committed to small business 
as the main engine of economic growth in Canada. We have been 
told repeatedly and we are listening. The best that we can do for 
business, large and small, is to get the deficit under control. The 
changes that are included in this legislation are a step in the right 
direction. The user-pay system which is being adopted will mean 
that it is no longer a contributor to the government's deficit.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	The changes ensure that the Small Business Loans Act will 
continue to be an important public policy tool to foster the growth 
of small businesses in Canada.
<P>
	In Guelph-Wellington we like to celebrate our success. We 
believe we have a workforce that is second to none because we live 
in the best community in Canada. We know we can accomplish 
much when we all work together, stay positive, and keep focused. 
The enthusiasm evident throughout Guelph-Wellington is there 
because we want to succeed.
<P>
	Two years ago the people of Guelph-Wellington helped to elect 
a Liberal government with a mandate for  change. I say to my 
Quebec colleagues that the best anniversary present we can 
imagine is a united Canada committed to change, change that will 
result in jobs and growth for Guelph-Wellington and in all 295 
ridings in this great country. As part of that mandate, Bill C-99 
deserves our support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate having the opportunity today to talk about the 
Small Business Loans Act. Obviously as a government and as a 
party we believe the small business sector plays an important part 
in the economy.
<P>
	The last time statistics were compiled, in 1993, showed that 
911,700 businesses in this country had fewer than 100 employees, 
which is actually 99 per cent of the businesses that operate in 
Canada. So we can see the importance of the small business sector. 
In fact that number represents a 30 per cent increase in the number 
of small businesses in Canada over the previous 11 years. Not only 
is small business an important part of our economy, but it is an 
increasingly important part of our economy.
<P>
	These small businesses with fewer than 100 employees-some 
are micro-businesses, with between one and three 
employees-account for 44 per cent of the jobs in Canada. More 
important, small business accounts for the vast majority of the new 
jobs being created in this country today. As a government, we 
recognize that.
<P>
	We as a government understand that we need to assist the small 
business sector, that we need to create a climate, an environment 
within which the small business sector can operate successfully, so 
it is able to be profitable. By being profitable they are able to create 
employment, which is the bottom line. We want to ensure 
employment is created. Our government has done that in a number 
of ways. It has done it in terms of our fiscal policy. It has done it 
because we have addressed Canada's fiscal deficit and we have 
worked as a government to bring some economic order to this 
House.
<P>
	By the end of this fiscal year we will have come close to 
reducing the annual deficit by half. In the last budget the Minister 
of Finance had a plan that would see our expenditures reduced by 
19 per cent. The public service is being reduced by 14 per cent. We 
are bringing economic revitalization to this country and we are 
bringing some sanity to our economic house, but we are doing it in 
a way that recognizes that behind every expenditure line on the 
government's expenses there are real people, real Canadians. We 
are determined to do this economic exercise in a fair and equitable 
way for every Canadian.
<P>
	The second area we have worked in to create a favourable 
climate for the small business men and women of this country is on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15785"> 15785 </A></B>
<P>
the regulatory regime under which they have to operate. There is no 
question that if we overburden the small business men and women 
with regulation after regulation they spend more time doing  that 
than they do taking care of their business, creating wealth and jobs.
<P>
	Already this government has eliminated 250 regulations that 
have served their purpose and are no longer applicable, and we 
have amended another 300 plus. We are very cognizant of the need 
to refine our regulatory regime and we are working every day to 
make sure we are protecting the interests of Canadians where those 
interests need to be protected by regulation while at the same time 
making sure we do not do it in a manner that overburdens the small 
business sector.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	We come to the third component of our strategy for small 
business, which is the issue of access to capital. The Small 
Business Loans Act and the bill we have in front of us, Bill C-99, 
deal very much with the whole issue of access to capital.
<P>
	I, along with some colleagues here in the House, sit on the 
industry committee of the House of Commons. That committee has 
worked now for close to two years on this very issue of access to 
capital. We have worked with the private sector in this country, 
with the Canadian chartered banks and with others to try to ensure 
that they take measures that will ensure that there is increased 
capital to the small business sector. To some extent, we have met 
with some small successes.
<P>
	The banks looked at much of what we said and agreed that there 
needed to be a code of conduct that clearly outlined the relationship 
between the small business sector and the financial institutions. In 
effect, that code is now in place in all of the banks. It defines things 
like if a person is turned down for a loan they have to be told why. 
They have to be given the reason. They have to be told alternatives. 
It talks about when a loan is called and the amount of time that has 
to be given in order to do that. It is helping to take some of the 
surprises away. I was glad to see that was the recommendation of 
the industry committee and that the chartered banks followed that.
<P>
	A second thing they have done is put in place an alternative 
dispute resolution system, the ADR. Basically it is a mediation 
process. It gives small business men and women who have a 
relationship with a bank and who are not happy with what is 
happening with that relationship the ability to appeal what is going 
on to an independent panel. This is a positive step. It was long 
overdue. I was pleased to see that it was with the initiation again of 
this House through the industry committee that the banks are in fact 
doing that.
<P>
	We still have many challenges. One of the things that we know 
as parliamentarians is that in order to evaluate whether or not there 
is sufficient lending to the small business sector, whether there is 
indeed proper access to capital, we need to know exactly what is 
being lent and how much that is either increasing or decreasing. 
One of  the things we have worked on in the last four to six months 
with the chartered banks is in fact that they will provide statistics 
on how much they are lending. And that is not just a gross amount 
of how much they are lending, but broken down by region, by 
industry, and by a number of other factors, so that we as 
parliamentarians and representatives of the Canadian public, and in 
this particular case the small business community, can in fact tell 
whether or not small business is experiencing a credit crunch.
<P>
	One of the greatest difficulties we had in examining this issue in 
the last two years is we did not really have access to good statistics. 
We had a lot of anecdotal evidence, and when we called the banks 
they often said that was the exception rather than the rule. By 
insisting that we get these statistics, by insisting that this 
information be provided to us, we will have an opportunity to see 
not the exception to the rule but in fact what the rule is and whether 
in fact there is more capital out there available to the small business 
sector.
<P>
	Complementing the private sector and their lending to small 
business, the government also has a role to play. The bill we are 
talking about today, Bill C-99, is one of several components of the 
government's interaction with the small business community in 
terms of access to capital. We have the Business Development 
Bank, formerly the Federal Business Development Bank of 
Canada, which lends to small business, we have the business 
development corporation that used to be part of the human 
resources development department and now is part of the industry 
department, which is lending to small business in rural areas, and 
we have something that is a very important project, something 
called the Small Business Loans Act.
<P>
	I am probably one of the few if perhaps not the only member of 
this House who has actually used that program as a lender-not as 
a borrower but as a lender. I can say unequivocally that in the 20 
years during which I operated in a private financial institution, this 
program helped provide capital to the small business men and 
women of Canada. Indeed, there were incremental loans that 
happened as a result of the existence of this program. It was not 
simply a duplication. It was not simply providing loans that would 
have otherwise been made. It actually allowed for loans to be made 
under this guarantee program that otherwise would not have been 
able to take place.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	It is an important program. It can really help people in very 
meaningful ways. For instance, if you are a long-distance trucker 
and you want to buy your rig-they sometimes cost well over 
$100,000-this program will help finance that. It will finance that 
type of equipment up to $250,000. It will allow somebody to get 
into business who might not otherwise have been able to.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15786"> 15786 </A></B>
<P>
	If you are a retailer, one of the things you have to do when 
opening a retail shop is the leasehold improvements in the 
business. This program allows for financing of leasehold 
improvements. That is a tough thing to get financed in the private 
sector. Through the Small Business Loans Act, a lot of people who 
otherwise might not have been able to get the credit to do that, 
who otherwise might not have been able to open their shops, are 
able to. It is because of this program and the good this program 
is doing.
<P>
	If you are a manufacturer, ofen you have to go out there and buy 
the equipment. It might be a stamp machine, a conveyer belt, some 
sort of equipment. Again, this program can help that business do it.
<P>
	This is not, as one of the members of the Bloc mentioned before, 
a duplication of an existing program in Quebec, the Paillé program. 
It is not a duplication of that. That program provides credit up to 
$50,000. This program provides it up to $250,000. That program is 
for start-ups. The small business loan is for start-ups as well, but it 
also allows us to finance existing business expansion. That is an 
important source of new wealth creation, an important source of 
new job creation. Not only are we helping start-ups, but we are also 
helping existing businesses find capital for their expansions.
<P>
	In addition, the Small Business Loans Act has a longer 
amortization than the Quebec program. They have a relatively 
short amortization of three years, whereas under the Small 
Business Loans Act you can amortize up to ten years. For the small 
business person who is starting off with a new business or with an 
expansion, it is important to have that longer amortization so that 
their payments, at least in the beginning, can be relatively low and 
their cashflow can be reserved for expansion and to keep the 
company going in what usually are the most difficult years, either 
at the start-up or after they have just had an expansion.
<P>
	I want to talk a little about the cost of this program. I believe 
government has a role in creating an environment for small 
business. I believe government has a role in certain circumstances 
to assist directly, such as in the Small Business Loans Act. I also 
think it is important that we do this in a way that is revenue neutral, 
that recovers costs and is not going to place a large burden on the 
Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	We have seen this work. The Federal Business Development 
Bank, now the Business Development Bank of Canada, has for 
many years worked on a mandate of cost recovery. It has to 
structure its programs, its guarantees, its collateral, its fees, and its 
interest rates so that it recovers cost. It works, and it is proven that 
it works.
<P>
	This SBLA program now is moving along the same basis. It is 
going to be a cost-recovery program. There is always going to be a 
certain amount of loss that is going to be created with any loan 
program. If you lend money,  you are going to have a certain 
amount of loss. The objective as a prudent lender is to make sure 
there is a provision for that loss and there is the revenue to carry 
that.
<P>
	I know that one of the members opposite talked about the great 
liability that was going to be incurred by the government through 
this program. In a five-year timeframe this program is going from 
$4 billion to $12 billion. That is $8 billion more capital for the 
small business men and women of this country. That is important to 
remember. It is happening over five years.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	The potential liability is 10 per cent of $12 billion. To suggest 
that is the true liability of the government, that that is what is at 
risk, is like going to a chartered bank and saying that the risk is the 
total loan portfolio. Of course we do not say that. We do not 
suggest to any lender that the risk is the whole loan portfolio.
<P>
	What lenders do, what we are doing as a government and what 
the Department of Industry and the Minister of Industry are doing 
is figuring out through prudent assumptions that the loan loss 
history is likely to be based on historical data and on economic 
performance. It is the same thing the banks do. They make a loan 
loss provision and as a government we ensure that the revenue 
stream is sufficiently large enough to cover potential losses.
<P>
	In reality it is not a burden on taxpayers. It is a cost recovery 
program that ensures capital is provided to the small business 
sector.
<P>
	I will comment on a couple of things that were said about how 
we will go about recovering the costs. The program has always had 
a 2 per cent fee that is paid up front. It can either be paid in cash or 
it can be amortized over the length of the loan.
<P>
	In doing that examination and trying to ensure that it is a cost 
recovery program, it was determined that additional revenues 
would be required. Therefore a new fee was put on, an 
administration fee of 1.5 per cent.
<P>
	One of the members of the Reform Party was complaining that 
the administration fee was being passed through not as a direct fee 
but rather through the interest rate. A small business person will 
prefer that it happens that way because the fee will be paid on a 
declining balance, as opposed to the full amount at the time it was 
borrowed. In reality the fee will be less, because it is on a declining 
balance calculated through the interest rate, than if the 1.5 per cent 
was paid up front.
<P>
	The minister acted prudently and in a way where business people 
can have some control over their fee based on the speed at which 
they pay back the advance. That was a good way of doing it. The 
minister structured it so that the banks pay the administration fee. 
Then they have the option to collect it from their clients. I hope the  

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15787"> 15787 </A></B>
<P>
chartered banks, as part of their commitment to helping the small 
business sector, would absorb a part or all of that fee.
<P>
	When the plan was originally amended back in 1993 the 
maximum rate was 1.75 per cent, but the banks charged prime for 
the most part. They were anxious for the business. They went out 
there and they got it. Even though there was a maximum rate they 
did not charge it. They charged prime.
<P>
	Now that we have added another 1.25 per cent or 1.5 per cent to 
allow for the fee and put the maximum rate up to 3 per cent, I do 
not understand why all of a sudden it was not good enough to 
charge prime or prime plus a half or prime plus one. They seem to 
be jacking up the rates to the maximum. I do not think that is what 
they should be doing. They have to take care of their profits. They 
have to take care of their shareholders. However I believe they 
have a responsibility to the small business community, and one 
way they can show that is by absorbing a portion of the fee.
<P>
	The way they have structured the fee is appropriate. It allows for 
small business people to save some money through their declining 
balance.
<P>
	In summary, it is a good piece of legislation. It is an act that has 
been in place for many years. It has helped a lot of small 
businessmen and women. There are many businesses today. All we 
have to do is walk down Main Street in my hometown of 
Gravenhurst or any other community in my riding, and I dare say in 
any community in any member's riding, to see businesses 
operating today that would not be operating if this loan program 
did not exist. It does its job. It creates and helps small businesses. It 
creates and helps employment.
<P>
	Not only does it do that. With these amendments it will do it in a 
way that will not cost the taxpayers of Canada anything because it 
will be a cost recovery program. I applaud the Minister of Industry 
for the bill. I applaud the Minister of Industry for the changes. I 
know they will be good for Canada.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we all know that small businesses exist throughout 
Canada, both in rural and urban centres.
<P>
	In Atlantic Canada, small business is the backbone of the 
economy. It sustains the economy. The majority of small 
businesses, whether they are in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick or 
Quebec, is owned by local people employing young people and 
older people. The businesses have been there a long time, are part 
of the community and are sustainable.
<P>
	My question is for the hon. member from Parry 
Sound-Muskoka. From his experience in the lending side of 
financial institutions and his experience with the Small Business 
Loans Act, could he elaborate on the  value of small business to the 
Canadian economy to ensure the money stays in Canada for 
Canadians and provides a sustainable economy that supports our 
future?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try to be as brief as I can.
<P>
	The hon. member makes the excellent point that small 
businesses tend to create employment locally, tend to purchase 
locally and tend to form part of the local economy. The profits 
earned from those businesses are retained within the community as 
opposed to going elsewhere.
<P>
	As someone who was involved in economic development 
initiatives in a rural area, organizations would look for the big hit. 
They would look for the big 500 to 600 person plant to come in and 
create employment. Those days are long gone. That is just not in 
the cards any more, or if it is it is a rare occasion.
<P>
	We have to build the local economy one small business at a time, 
one job at a time, and this act provides an important tool to allow 
that to happen in rural communities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder (Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last summer I had the opportunity of driving 
around with the member for Parry Sound-Muskoka. We were on a 
little mission called the access to capital for small business task 
force.
<P>
	Over the past two years I have been here, I have seen that the 
federal government only has the capability to create the 
atmosphere for the creation and the enhancement of small business. 
We do not have the money any more to throw at jobs because of 
deficit reduction, et cetera. One thing we have done is establish the 
small business centre in Toronto to cut through the red tape.
<P>
	Bill C-99 is only one part of the overview. The Federal Business 
Development Bank and business development corporations play 
very important and crucial roles in the formation and enhancement 
of small business.
<P>
	Could the member give us any information on what is being 
done with them to improve that part of the overview?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will address a couple of examples 
the member mentioned. One is northern Ontario where we have a 
regional development fund called FEDNOR that is able to provide 
funding for small businesses.
<P>
	One way to be creative is to combine the money from FEDNOR 
with the money available from the Business Development Bank of 
Canada. If FEDNOR is able to provide funding to cover 
contingencies, for example losses of 5 per cent, the Business 
Development Bank of Canada can lend with a higher risk profile. 
We are looking at taking approximately $500,000 from  FEDNOR 
and levering that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15788"> 15788 </A></B>
<P>
through the Business Development Bank, or through a private 
financial institution, up to $20 million.
<P>
	Government has the ability to use some creative tools in the way 
it finances and uses some of our programs. It is the same with the 
Small Business Loans Act that we are talking about in Bill C-99. It 
can work in conjunction with other credit facilities provided by 
private lenders. The term credit can be covered by the Small 
Business Loans Act and the bank or the private institution can 
come along and be happy to provide an operating credit. In a lot of 
cases we work in conjunction with various programs.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I take 
this opportunity to congratulate the hon. member for Parry 
Sound-Muskoka for his efforts on the bill. As part of the industry 
committee and as part of various task forces, he has travelled 
widely in Canada to receive information from small businesses.
<P>
	Actual consultation with small businesses is an area that has 
been overlooked in the past. They do not have a large staff or a lot 
of money to spend carelessly. Every penny they spend in their 
budgets is very important to them.
<P>
	My question to the member concerns communication and 
information to small businesses once the bill is passed. It is very 
important that the consulting process and improvements continue 
to go forward. Getting the information out to the many small 
businesses around the country is very important. The member 
might want to comment on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the 
question because it makes an excellent point. Not only is it 
important to have the programming. It is also important that the 
small business sector knows the programming exists and how to 
use it.
<P>
	One initiative of the government, the Minister of Industry, is the 
single window approach to providing information so that instead of 
having to go to maybe five or six different offices to gather all the 
information, small business people can go to one location to talk to 
an individual and learn the various programming aspects they need 
to know to help their small businesses. There are many vehicles for 
doing that. It can be done through chambers of commerce. Most 
communities have a chamber of commerce. It can also be done 
through economic development offices.
<P>
	The idea of a single window approach to provide information to 
the small businessmen and women is one that we recognize as a 
government to be important and are working on to ensure it takes 
place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it has been a pleasure for me to participate in  the work of the 
Standing Committee on Industry. With a businesslike attitude 
committee members have gone about their work for the benefit of 
all Canadian small businesses and of assisting them in competing 
in the world economy of today.
<P>
	I was particularly appreciative of the comments of the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry regarding his 
concern for the amount of red tape, the paperwork and the 
difficulties with taxes faced by small businesses. It is with this kind 
of attitude we approach many of the difficulties our business 
people are facing with a view to assisting them to make our 
Canadian economy as competitive, as viable and as profitable as 
any in the world.
<P>
	Small business is the cornerstone of the Canadian economy 
today. Using a definition of small business being a concern with 
less than 100 employees, there are about a million small businesses 
registered in the country. This means that small business makes up 
nearly 99 per cent of all business enterprises in Canada. Small 
business accounts for about 60 per cent of the economy's private 
sector output. These are substantial figures.
<P>
	As well, small business entrepreneurs presently create eight out 
of ten new jobs. In a day when we depend on new ideas being 
translated into new jobs, and new products and new services being 
translated into a larger market share of our highly competitive 
business world, we do not need to argue the value of small business 
to the Canadian economy. Rather we need to learn how to 
encourage entrepreneurs to develop new ideas and new products.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	As a nation Canada has historically been highly creative. We 
have learned how necessary it is to adapt to both the economic and 
physical environments. However, we have been less successful in 
taking our ideas and inventions from the laboratories and 
basements of entrepreneurs and getting them into the national and 
international marketplace.
<P>
	It was extremely educational for me before I was even on the 
committee to attend some of the hearings and listen to the 
difficulties small business people were having in securing loans, 
securing the capital they needed to get their ideas and concerns off 
the ground. In some instances there were business people with 
many orders in their order books, ready to sell but with no money 
to work to produce the product. One very significant reason for this 
lack of success has been the shortage of loan capital, of equity 
capital, available to someone to take a well developed idea or an 
advanced product prototype and make it a commercially viable 
asset of the Canadian economy.
<P>
	So often we have heard stories of how someone had this great 
invention but after years of struggle to get it marketed they finally 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15789"> 15789 </A></B>
<P>
gave up and went to the United  States where there was capital, 
resources and an invitation waiting, all that was necessary to make 
it a marketable product. These are sad stories, sad because they tell 
of a loss to our country not only of the product, but more important, 
the loss of the people who took what they had and left.
<P>
	The Small Business Loans Act was an initiative by the federal 
government in 1961 to help remedy this situation. By and large this 
has been a successful intervention by the government. The Small 
Business Loans Act has provided a 90 per cent government 
guarantee to banks, credit unions and other lenders who make loans 
to small business people. Loans that are properly made and placed 
under the umbrella of this act will not be a write off to the lender if 
they are not repaid.
<P>
	The Small Business Loans Act guarantees loans made to small 
business interests that qualify. There is an interest by government 
for which I want to offer some congratulations in supporting this 
sector of our economy. Today about $6 billion in loans to small 
businesses is guaranteed in this manner. Under these proposed 
amendments to the act, the amount of money available with this 
government guarantee would substantially increase.
<P>
	However, in the real world where not everything works out or 
goes quite as, planned there are some aspects of the Small Business 
Loans Act that do need updating from past experience. There need 
to be corrections; there need to be some changes.
<P>
	The amendments brought forward in Bill C-99 are being 
proposed by the government. One of the problems the government 
faces is there is about a 5 per cent failure rate in these guaranteed 
loans. Estimates are that without some means of recovering these 
losses, this loan guarantee program could cost the government in 
the order of $100 million each year which would be an 
unacceptably high cost. To its credit, the government is proposing 
amendments to the act to rectify this problem.
<P>
	One amendment would reduce the size of the loan guarantee 
from 90 per cent to 85 per cent. In this move the government quite 
properly is telling the money lenders that they have to bear some of 
the risk in lending to small business enterprises. This should not 
make a significant difference in the willingness of lenders to make 
loans under the Small Business Loans Act for in many instances, 
lenders have already said that they are including fully secured loans 
under this act when it is hard to explain why this need is there.
<P>
	A second amendment which I support is the establishment of a 
1.25 per cent annual administration fee that can be passed on to the 
borrower in the interest rates that are applied. It has already been 
said that this would increase the premium on the interest rate to 
about 3 per cent, which is significant. After listening to people 
looking for capital, it seemed to me that more often it  was not the 
interest rate which was so important to them but the fundamental 
access to capital which they needed.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	It is my opinion that it is completely in order for the borrower to 
bear some of the cost of this guaranteed loan program. The 
borrower is perhaps the one who will benefit most from it. When 
the lenders are competing with one another for loans, the interest 
rate is always a negotiable matter. Therefore, when competition is 
keen and the lender really wants to get the money out into the 
marketplace, the borrower may get the benefit of a loan interest 
rate which is significantly lower. I do not have the same difficulty 
with this amendment as do some other members of the House.
<P>
	A third amendment which Bill C-99 would make to the Small 
Business Loans Act would allow a borrower who has repaid 
one-half or more of the loan to be released from the personal 
guarantee held by the lender. This would not leave the loan 
unsecured by any means. The collateral and physical assets held by 
the lender would remain in place until the loan was repaid.
<P>
	Often a loan is made to a partnership and over time the 
partnership may dissolve. In an instance such as this, where a 
former partner is no longer part of the business, there may not be a 
strong desire to stay and there also may be a serious financial need 
to free the guarantor of the burden which he has taken on. These 
amendments would conditionally allow that to happen. They would 
also allow a borrower in some way to separate his or her corporate 
and personal interests.
<P>
	My interest here is not to add more burden or more risk to the 
government. Far be it from that. However, with the withdrawal of 
the personal guarantee, the borrower is free, which allows more 
opportunity for the expansion of business and of commercial 
activity.
<P>
	There is an amendment regarding a claims processing fee which 
is troublesome for me in that it is poorly defined. How would it be 
implemented? When would it come into place? These amendments 
need careful attention and further revision before they can be 
supported.
<P>
	Bill C-99 has one essential flaw. The bill gives the Minister of 
Industry the power to make future regulation changes without the 
consent of Parliament. The Minister of Industry will argue that this 
transfer of power allows the department to act more expediently in 
response to the rapid rate changes of the financial markets.
<P>
	Parliament could transfer every policy change away from the 
elected members to senior bureaucrats and ultimately to cabinet 
ministers. Then we would not be called a democracy, would we? 
This trend by the Liberal government is a very serious challenge to 
the authority of Parliament.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15790"> 15790 </A></B>
<P>
	This portion of Bill C-99 must be amended to respect the rights 
of Canadians to have future regulatory changes soberly examined 
by their elected officials and not left in the hands of the executive 
or the bureaucrats. Without the amendment of this portion of the 
bill the Reform Party cannot give its support to this otherwise 
sound piece of legislation.
<P>
	There are over 4.2 million Canadians employed by small and 
medium size businesses in Canada. The Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business recently surveyed their membership on job 
creation. Catherine Swift, vice-president of the organization, 
recently claimed that small firms and new businesses are the ones 
which have created all the new jobs over the past couple of years. 
This is an accurate claim. In the 1980s, 85 per cent of new jobs 
were created by small and medium sized businesses. This trend is 
continuing to grow as more and more Canadians explore the 
possibility of starting their own businesses.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	The Liberals must make good on an election promise they made 
in their red book. They promised ``to focus on small and medium 
sized businesses because they can and must be the determining 
factor in turning around what has so far been a jobless recovery''. 
By creating a more efficient financing model for small businesses, 
the government is becoming more responsible for the development 
of small and medium sized businesses in Canada. The long term 
financing of these businesses becomes even more assured with 
these cost recovery amendments.
<P>
	The minister needs to amend Bill C-99 to give Parliament the 
right to make future regulation changes. Parliament must not give 
this power away. This is necessary because losing the right to make 
future changes could in the long run harm not only the democratic 
process but even the small business loans program itself.
<P>
	Members of Parliament are elected to examine programs such as 
this one in the interests of their constituents. To lose that ability 
would be inexcusable. I encourage the Minister of Industry to cease 
seeking such executive control. With this aspect of the bill 
eliminated, the small businesses of Canada can get to work and 
access a plan that is working well and could be improved on to 
make its viability assured even during these highly competitive 
times.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak on Bill C-99, the amendment to the Small 
Business Loans Act.
<P>
	The summary of the bill concerns me. The bill states: ``This 
enactment amends the Small Business Loans Act with the objective 
of moving the small business loans program to full cost recovery''. 
I thought that the whole concept of the Small Business Loans Act 
was for the government to try to provide some underlying 
guarantee  of picking winners and losers, because let us face it, it 
has been in that business for a long time, through grants, subsidies, 
contributions and giving away money by the millions and billions. 
As an aside, did you see my waste report where $11 billion in 
grants and contributions are given away by this government every 
year?
<P>
	Getting back to the bill, the concept of the Small Business Loans 
Act was to provide a guarantee to higher risk businesses that had 
the potential to generate jobs and economic growth. The 
government was prepared to underwrite that program to try to 
foster development. It is not a bad idea, although we Reformers 
always felt that a dollar in the hands of an investor was far better 
than a dollar channelled through a bureaucrat and back into the 
economy. Nonetheless, the government is now going to channel 
this money through the bureaucrat back into the economy on a full 
cost recovery basis. The first question which comes to mind is: 
Why are we doing this?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> That is not the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Bill C-99, an act to amend the Small Business 
Loans Act, is the one I am talking about. That is the bill that is on 
the agenda at the moment. My hon. colleague from the Liberal 
Party says that is not the bill. I am quoting right from the bill. Does 
he not know what we are talking about right now and what the bill 
says? The bill states ``small business loans program to full cost 
recovery''. Let us talk about this full cost recovery.
<P>
	The government has lots of power. It is going to establish an 
annual administration fee to collect money from the lenders, put it 
in a pocket and it is going to restrict the lenders from passing on the 
fee to the borrowers, except through interest rates. The government 
is going to say to lenders: ``We are going to charge you an 
administration fee of maybe 1 per cent or 2 per cent of the amount 
of money that you are lending out. You are prohibited from 
charging your borrower an administrative fee but you may include 
it as a mark-up on your interest rate''. Remember full cost 
recovery.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	The lenders will have to pay to the government 1 per cent or 2 
per cent of the total money they lend out. The government will take 
this pool of cash and reimburse the lenders who make bad choices 
because they are the ones who are going to collect the guarantee 
from the government.
<P>
	I scratch my head trying to figure out the logic because I cannot 
find any in this particular bill. It says that the government, by 
skimming money off the prudent, intelligent lenders who made 
intelligent, prudent investment decisions are required to pay a 
premium to the government so that it can build up a pool of cash to 
reimburse the lenders who made poor and irrational decisions. It 
does not make sense. We are penalizing good and competent 
lenders and subsidizing incompetent  lenders. The poor business-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15791"> 15791 </A></B>
<P>
man does not get one nickel's worth of a break because this is on a 
pooled cost recovery basis to the government.
<P>
	I cannot understand the logic. That is why the Reform Party says 
that a dollar in the hands of an investor, a businessman, an 
entrepreneur, a consumer, is far, far better than a dollar in the hands 
of a bureaucrat. The amendments to this act are living proof of the 
justification of Reform Party policy.
<P>
	I cannot understand the government which talks about creating 
jobs, jobs, jobs. I recall that was its slogan during the election. The 
Liberals were going to spend $6 billion on the infrastructure 
program. Let us take the money, channel it through bureaucrats, 
lend it out or give it away to try and create jobs. It did not work.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board appeared before the 
government operations committee trying to justify the 
infrastructure program. After spending $6 billion, by his own 
admission he has created 8,000 permanent jobs. That works out to 
$875,000 per job. He would have been far better off putting the 
money in the bank, taking the interest and giving it to the people, 
saying: ``Do not bother going to work'' because they would have 
had a lot more money. Ten per cent on $750,000 is $75,000 a year 
just by writing a cheque.
<P>
	This type of policy is no good. It is not going to generate 
economic growth. It is not going to do anything for the lender. It is 
not going to make the lender more willing to give money to the 
small businessman. It is not going to make the small businessman 
accept any more risk because the successful small businessman is 
now going to end up paying an insurance premium through the 
lender into the government's pocket so it can bail out the guy who 
does not make it. That is just another tax on the competent and the 
successful small businessman who is trying to create jobs, pick the 
country up and generate some economic growth so we have a 
chance of digging ourselves out of the economic morass that the 
Liberal government and the Tory government have put us into.
<P>
	The government talks about moving from this House and into 
cabinet the opportunity to make regulations. This is an affront to 
the powers of this House. We have seen a continuous and continual 
erosion of the powers we have in this House being passed over to 
the executive, to cabinet. Pretty soon the House will be an 
irrelevant debating society where we talk about these bills but have 
absolutely no control whatsoever over them.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	If we approve this bill as it is being proposed, we are passing all 
the authority to cabinet. What good is that? When will the bill 
come back for public debate? When will we be able to find out that 
this bill is not working, that it is not creating jobs, except 
bureaucratic jobs? When? That is why this type of bill must be 
opposed at every opportunity.
<P>
	As Reformers we believe in having accountability and 
responsibility. It is about time this Liberal government introduced 
some cost benefit analysis to tell us what in its opinion will be the 
outcome of the amendments it is proposing. How many jobs is it 
going to create in the civil service? How much is it going to cost the 
taxpayer? How many jobs will be created through this in the private 
sector? How much tax revenue will it produce? How many new 
jobs will it create in the small businesses that it intends to help?
<P>
	Conversely, is this actually going to shut down jobs in the private 
sector? That is going to happen as we find it detracts from the 
motivation of small businessmen to borrow money through the 
Small Business Loans Act. The whole concept is recognizing that 
there are opportunities. A chance has to be taken. A risk has to be 
taken.
<P>
	That risk is going to be avoided because the government says it 
does not have the money any more. It is going to skim the money 
off the successful entrepreneurs, channel it through the lenders 
back to use as write-offs on the bad loans and bad decisions. That is 
a dreadful decision.
<P>
	In the last decade small business has accounted for the largest 
share of the net new job creation in the country. It employs almost 
half the labour force. Small businesses create eight out of every ten 
new jobs in Canada. They do it because of entrepreneurial spirit, 
not channelling money through the bureaucracy back out in some 
complex formula that Liberal members want to bring into cabinet 
so they can change and modify it if they so desire.
<P>
	Give entrepreneurs freedom from rules and regulations. Give 
them freedom from red tape. Let them go out there and create jobs. 
By giving them the motivation and incentive to do so, 
unemployment will come down. New jobs will be created. 
Additional taxes will be paid without any tax increase. The deficit 
will come down. Our competitiveness will improve on the 
international stage. We will have all these things by getting the 
government out of the lives of small businessmen and women and 
not into it more at their expense.
<P>
	The Department of Public Works and Government Services has 
found that small companies accounted for 79 per cent of the 
suppliers to the federal government in 1993-94 fiscal year. At least 
we are glad to see that the federal government recognizes that small 
business provides products that compete with the best in the world 
and are worth buying for the Government of Canada.
<P>
	However, despite the excellent contribution small businesses 
make to the Canadian economy, the Liberals have not come 
through on their electoral promise to create a better environment 
for small business to work in.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15792"> 15792 </A></B>
<P>
	I heard some comments from the other side of the House. I am 
sure they were not too complimentary on our position but I hope 
my remarks will cause them to think about the spirit of the bill. 
I would love to talk to them afterward and find out how they can 
see the logic and benefits in here.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	These are the points I would like to make on this bill. I do not 
think that when it gets into committee and we hear witnesses-the 
banks that are going to be paying the fee to the government-that 
they will be complimentary. Some small businesses that use the 
program will be sceptical about why they should pay the premiums. 
Therefore, I hope the government will give some serious thought to 
redrafting the amendments to recognize that small business wants 
to provide the motivation.
<P>
	I agree with the idea that the government should be involved in 
creating an environment for small business to create jobs. That is 
great. But the underlying philosophy here is that the government 
wants to be seen doing that but with the small businessman's 
money. On that point, I totally and absolutely disagree.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
somewhat astounded by the discussion of the member for St. Albert 
about the aspect of guarantees somehow being circulatory moneys 
that small business has to pay in order to support these loans.
<P>
	Most of us understand the concept of bad debts. I understand the 
member is an accountant. We all understand that small businesses 
have accounts receivable and usually make provision for bad debt 
losses. Indeed, bad debt losses under the Small Business Loans Act 
have been very small. I think they average out at about 2 per cent.
<P>
	The member does not seem to understand that in order for the 
government to protect itself from bad debt losses it needs to find a 
method to recover a certain amount of cash flow from successful 
loans. This is no different from any other normal business 
operation. These are the things I thought the Reform Party would 
applaud the government for because it is taking a business 
approach to lending.
<P>
	The member does not seem to be able to understand the whole 
concept. It seems to elude him that somehow we are taking money 
from one pot and putting it into another at the behest of small 
business operators. Quite frankly, it is normal business practice and 
something for which the government should be applauded.
<P>
	The member talked about creating jobs. This program has been 
around for a considerable length of time. We are now fine tuning it, 
allowing it to expand. The jobs the member talks about being 
created by the small business environment, in fact, were assisted by 
this program. Some of the great jobs he spoke about which have 
increased  over the last number of years have been as a result of the 
small business loans program.
<P>
	The member also talked about infrastructure spending and how it 
is a terrible waste of government money. If we look at the public 
assets and the whole concept of why there is public administration 
in the country, it is to build certain public assets that for whatever 
reason businesses did not want to build, such as airports, roads, 
sewer systems, et cetera. The member does not seem to understand 
that is still a commitment of government in most places in the 
country and it does create jobs.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member whether he understands fully the 
concept of guarantees and of making provision for guarantees?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be glad to respond to the 
member who I understand is also an accountant.
<P>
	The point I am trying to make is that the small business 
community is being provided this guarantee courtesy of 
themselves. It will have to pay for the guarantee. The successful 
entrepreneur will pay higher interest rates to the bank, which will 
in turn pay a fee back to the federal government, which will use the 
pot of money collected to reimburse the lenders for the bad 
decisions they make or for the loans that go sour and the small 
businessman who does not make it. The successful businessman 
will pay a premium to underwrite the bad debts incurred by the 
lenders.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	This will no longer be an underwriting by the federal 
government. It states ``loans program to full cost recovery''. 
Therefore there will be no underwriting except a great paper war by 
the federal government. That is the point I am trying to object to. 
There is no guarantee by the federal government. It is only a 
guarantee to be paid by the guy who wins to pay the guy who loses.
<P>
	I know that up until now the federal government has picked up 
the tab for the losers who have not paid back their loans, and the 
winners have gone on to create jobs and build this economy. Now 
they will to be asked to do that with another chain around their legs 
as they try to climb up above high taxes, high interest rates which 
will be even higher now because they now have to pay the federal 
government, the high Canadian dollar and so on. How can we 
expect them to compete? That is the idiocy of this bill.
<P>
	Getting to the member's other point on infrastructure, of course 
taxes pay for infrastructure. Of course we need infrastructure. 
However, the promise at the last election was jobs, jobs, jobs 
through the infrastructure program. The President of the Treasury 
Board said: ``Six billion dollars netted us 8,000 permanent jobs''. 
That, by simple math, is $750,000 per job, which is far more 
expensive than any job costs in the private sector.
<P>

<B><A NAME="15793"> 15793 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was listening attentively to the 
member. I could not help but get frustrated when he kept referring 
to the small business men and women who failed as losers.
<P>
	I would like to know how the member would propose that the 
banks, which administer this program, would chose who would get 
these small business loans in a way that there would be an 
absolutely perfect track record? What special insight or ability to 
judge entrepreneurship, what special formula does the member 
have that would allow him to never make a mistake on judging a 
small business person's ability to absolutely be-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for St. Albert.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, again the hon. member really has 
not applied his mind to the subject matter at hand.
<P>
	Bankers incur losses and bad debts every year, billions worth. 
Their customers have to pay that through lower interest rates on 
deposits and higher interest rates on loans and they are required to 
make a profit in the meantime.
<P>
	Let us take two lenders. One is a prudent lender who can make 
solid investment decisions and the other is careless and reckless 
and invests money not nearly as wisely. The one who is prudent and 
careful and analyses the lending applications his or her losses will 
be less. He or she may still have losses but they will be less.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> How do you know?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Because they are prudent and more careful and 
analyse the applications. Their losses will be less. They will pay a 
premium and will have to charge the customers the premium, 
passing it on through the interest rates. The borrower will pay a 
higher rate. The money will flow into the government coffers.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	On the other side there is the reckless lender who is not too 
careful about the application he approves. His losses skyrocket. It 
will not cost the reckless lender any more money because he is 
reimbursed from the fund the government has. Now we are 
separating the risk and the reward because the prudent lender who 
analyses the applications will have lower losses, hence higher 
profits, and the reckless lender will not suffer any consequence of 
his recklessness with lending because he will be reimbursed by the 
successful entrepreneur who borrowed at a different bank.
<P>
	That is the whole point I am trying to make. We are just moving 
this money from the successful borrower through the lender into 
the government's pocket to subsidize and reimburse the lender who 
makes the bad decisions, who lends the money to the business that 
may fail. That is the point I am trying to make. It is fairly  clear, it 
is fairly simple and I hope the hon. member realizes that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try this 
one more time. The member talks about its being a simple concept. 
Indeed it is a very simple concept.
<P>
	In his hometown I am sure there must be an insurance broker 
who in his daily operations will have a provision for doubtful 
accounts. It is a fact in the course of doing business. That insurance 
broker will say: ``It is a normal operation that I will lose 2 per cent 
to 3 per cent of my accounts receivable every year. If I were so 
perfect as to have a 0 per cent, I would be a very unusual business; I 
would be a business that did not take any risk''. Small business is 
about taking a certain degree of risk.
<P>
	Those bad debt losses within that business are shared and borne 
by all the other customers by definition. Therefore there is nothing 
strange or unusual about the government's orientation to this and I 
am really quite surprised the member does not understand it.
<P>
	Have I made it any clearer for the member?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try to be brief and lucid. He 
used the example of an insurance broker. If the broker has 2 per 
cent or 3 per cent of his debts go bad which he has to account for, 
that is fine and he builds it into his margin. However, the point I am 
trying to make is why should he have to build into his margin an 
amount of money which is channelled through the government to 
reimburse his competitor across the street who may be reckless and 
have a 10 per cent bad debt situation? That makes no sense.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 5.53 p.m., the House will now 
proceed to the consideration of Private Members' Business.

	<B>Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-329, an act to provide for the recognition of the Canadian Horse 
as the national horse of Canada, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have my private 
member's Bill C-329 reach the floor of the House of Commons 
today. Unfortunately the bill has not been chosen as a votable item, 
however it certainly represents a part of our history which deserves 
to be celebrated.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to bring appropriate recognition to the 
Canadian horse, the official designation of the breed. I believe it is 
a symbol of Canadian heritage. I believe we should take every  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15794"> 15794 </A></B>
<P>
opportunity to celebrate those aspects of our history which make 
Canada unique.
<P>
	There are several precedents for the kind of recognition I have 
proposed for the Canadian horse. Some years ago Parliament 
passed a bill which designated the beaver as Canada's national 
animal. Recently we recognized hockey and lacrosse as our 
national sports. That kind of celebration of our heritage is neither 
frivolous nor unimportant. We need more symbols to add to the 
rich tapestry which is Canada's history.
<P>
	As we debate the bill today Canadians are watching with concern 
the debate taking place in Quebec which is so important to our 
future. When I introduced Bill C-329 I was well aware that the 
history of the Canadian horse began in New France, now the 
province of Quebec, and I believe if we embrace the goal of the bill 
it would make some small contribution to national unity.
<P>
	Alex Hayward, a Canadian horse owner who lives near North 
Gower, Ontario, brought to my attention the idea of giving the 
Canadian horse national status through a private member's bill.Mr. Hayward grew up with the Canadian horse and insists ``they 
can do everything but dance''.
<P>
	After researching this breed we did note in several documents 
that the Canadian horse was declared our national breed by 
Parliament on March 17, 1909. Unfortunately nowhere in the 
debates of Parliament could this be verified. Therefore I set out to 
bring some attention to a breed of horse which has worked our 
lands as far back as the 1600s.
<P>
	The introduction of the Canadian horse to Canada dates back to 
King Louis XIV of France in 1665. The horses were delivered to 
the governor of New France at Stadacona, now known as Quebec 
City. King Louis felt a knight should not be without a horse, and the 
horses were presented as noble gifts in order to keep his colonists 
happy.
<P>
	The exact breeding of this horse is unknown. It was not until 100 
years later that accurate breeding records were kept by horse 
breeders. However, historians believe that the blood lines are from 
the Arabian, Barb and Andalusian stocks. In 1667 and 1670 further 
shipments of this horse were received and their numbers reached 
12,000 strong by the year 1760.
<P>
	It has been noted that the Canadian horse was the first to clear 
Canadian soil. This versatile breed cleared, ploughed and 
cultivated the soil. In addition they were used as carriage, riding 
and race horses. This small, swift, rugged and strong horse seldom 
reaches 1,100 pounds and is from 14.3 to 15.2 hands high. 
Therefore the average Canadian horse would be about five feet 
high.
<P>
	As the years went on France was constantly at war and was 
unable to support its colony. For the next century and a half the 
horses in New France were bred and multiplied, with no outside 
blood lines changing the  breed. However, when the British arrived 
in the late 1700s they brought with them other breeds of horse. 
Upon arrival of the British many French settlers moved on to 
Manitoba and the United States and took their Canadian horses 
with them.
<P>
	The American civil war created great demand for cavalry 
mounts. The Canadian horse was the right size and was well known 
for its tough constitution. This made it well suited to the hardship 
and rigours of war. Exports from Canada increased greatly and 
prices were very high. Many horses were killed in the war and 
those that survived never returned to Canada. By the late 18th 
century these factors threatened the continuation of the Canadian 
horse and so action was taken then to preserve this fine breed.
<P>
	In 1885 a stud book was started to keep accurate records of the 
breed and in 1895 the Canadian Horse Breeders Association was 
formed. The federal ministry of agriculture maintained a breeding 
centre from 1913 until the second world war forced its closure in 
1940. The Canadian horse has supplied foundation stock to many 
breeds, in particular the Morgan and the Standardbred. It has been 
estimated that by 1850 half of the horses in Canada carried some 
trace of Canadian blood.
<P>
	In <I>The Canadian Horse</I> by Gladys Mackey Beattie the strength 
and endurance of the breed are well described. There are recorded 
instances of Canadian horses trotting from Quebec city to Montreal 
and from Montreal to Cornwall, stopping only when their drivers 
needed refreshment.
<P>
	Another example was noted in the <I>Breeders Gazette of Chicago</I> 
written in 1914: ``A wood merchant, owner of Canadian horse 
weighing approximately 1,050 pounds, harnessed it on the same 
pole beside another horse, 200 pounds heavier. The Canadian horse 
always kept its harness traces well stretched and never showed as 
much fatigue as its heavier mate. After two years of common work, 
the heavy horse died. Questioned on the cause of this death, the 
driver answered `It is the Canadian horse that made him die of 
overwork'. Another heavy horse teamed with the same Canadian 
horse died after a year and the Canadian was still in perfect 
condition''.
<P>
<B>(1800 )</B>
<P>
	We should also pay tribute to that small band of Canadian horse 
breeders past and present, without whom this important part of our 
heritage would have been lost. In this respect I would like to thank 
Alex Hayward and his friend, the late Don Prosperine, from 
Dunrobin, Ontario, which is in my riding of Lanark-Carleton. 
Those two gentlemen decided in 1978 to become partners in a 
project to breed the Canadian horse. They spent a year and a half 
searching in Quebec for suitable specimens. From their beginning 
with one stallion and two mares their stock increased to 28 
Canadians. Don Prosperine's son, Frank, continues the family 
tradition on his farm in Dunrobin where he has 18 Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15795"> 15795 </A></B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to thank those of my colleagues who have 
shown an interest in this part of our heritage and who are taking 
part in the debate today. I also want to thank the people from 
across Canada who wrote their member of Parliament in support 
of Bill C-329. Finally, congratulations to the Canadian Horse 
Breeders Association as it celebrates its centennial this year.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the hon. member for his words on the Canadian horse. From what I 
have read about this horse it seems like an outstanding candidate 
for the title of national horse of Canada.
<P>
	The hon. member has talked about the history of this animal: 
how it came from France; its ability to stand up in Canada's cold 
weather and the varied seasons; its strength and its intelligence. All 
of those things are wonderful. It is a lot like Canadians in that 
sense. For that reason I cannot say anything against the bill. I do 
not have a problem with the Canadian horse or even with the 
concept of having a national horse for Canada.
<P>
	However, I am wondering, when we are six days away from a 
referendum on the break-up of the country, why we are talking 
about these types of issues. It is an issue which the hon. member 
could handle in a member's statement or in a letter writing 
campaign. There are ways of handling these types of issues.
<P>
	Frankly, when we are bringing private members' business to the 
House of Commons, it should be a little more relevant to the 
national agenda. For crying out loud, in six days we are going to 
have a referendum about the break-up of the country. That is the 
type of thing members should be bringing to Private Members' 
Business to discuss. There is no reason in the world we could not 
have had a bill today regarding the devolution of powers and how 
that might affect Canada and the possibility that Quebec would 
remain in the country. There is absolutely no reason we could not 
have had that debate.
<P>
	All kinds of excellent legislation has come from private 
members. That is the type of thing we should see in this hour.
<P>
	We have a debt of some $560 billion and it is going up $90 
million a day. It will be going up more now that interest rates will 
be spiked as a result of all the uncertainty over the Quebec 
referendum. To me, that is the type of thing we should reserve this 
time for.
<P>
	Last night on television I saw that a transit worker was stabbed to 
death in Toronto. He was the first ever transit worker to be 
murdered in Toronto. This Ontario member could have brought 
forward legislation to deal with that type of thing.
<P>
	I truly do not want to denigrate what the hon. member has done. 
However, I believe that Private Members' Business should be set 
aside for things which are more germane to the public agenda in 
Canada. I know that  Canadians are outraged at some of the things 
which are going on and that nothing is being done. We cannot prod 
the government to do it, so let us prod private members to do it. Let 
us get them to bring forward the legislation.
<P>
	There are 97 or 98 government MPs from Ontario in the House. 
The hon. member brought forward a bill to make the Canadian 
horse the national horse of Canada. Fine. But a lot more essential 
legislation could have come forward to deal with the issues I have 
just talked about.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	Would it not be great if a Toronto MP, along with 19 or 20 other 
Toronto MPs, brought forward legislation to deal with crime. We 
could point to the example of what happened in Toronto the other 
night, where we saw that man stabbed to death on TV. It was 
outrageous. We have to do something about those types of things. 
We cannot continue like that.
<P>
	In small ways almost every day we are seeing the erosion of the 
rule of law, not the breakdown, but the erosion in a lot of ways. 
Some people are becoming so disrespectful for the rule of law. Let 
us have legislation to deal with that sort of thing.
<P>
	Another thing we could be dealing with today and it would help 
the hon. member and his cause, would be to see Parliament and 
individual parliamentarians bring forward legislation through 
Private Members' Business to free up MPs to vote the wishes of 
their constituents on certain pieces of legislation. There is no 
reason in the world that we could not have legislation like there is 
in Britain today. They can defeat their own government's bill 
without bringing down the government. In other words, there 
would be a motion of non-confidence after defeating a specific 
piece of legislation.
<P>
	Imagine how Canadians would feel about their House if that is 
what happened here. It would be astounding. It would be a 
revolution. People would have new confidence in this place. As 
politicians, I think members across the way would agree that we 
have a vested interest in doing what we can to improve the very 
poor reputation of politicians. That would go a long way to doing 
that.
<P>
	One thing we could bring forward is balanced budget legislation. 
The situation today is that we are going in the hole approximately 
$19 million a day. Every day that goes by we go into the hole a little 
further. To me that is absolutely immoral when we consider the 
effect it will have on our children.
<P>
	I have two boys back home; one is seven and one is eleven. 
Many members have young children. It is really immoral for us to 
be living today at their expense. We must move quickly if we are to 
be worthy of our title as parliamentarians to make sure that comes 
to an end. We have to quit spending them into poverty down the 
road.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15796"> 15796 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not want to talk for a long time. I want to say again that 
Private Members' Business should be set aside for very important 
issues, for issues that are important to the country as a whole.
<P>
	I appreciate the argument that this horse is part of our heritage. I 
also know and the member has noted that this horse was recognized 
by cabinet I believe in 1909. I would argue that because of the fact 
that the horse already has the title Canadian horse, because of its 
proud history, we have certainly already given it a lot of profile. I 
would argue that there are other ways, through statements under 
Standing Order 31, through a letter campaign to other MPs, 
through recognition by provincial legislatures and that kind of 
thing that we could make the point.
<P>
	I will conclude by thanking the hon. member for his initiative. I 
also encourage members across the way, in my own party and in the 
Bloc, to bring forward the best possible and most important 
legislation they can think of when they deem it appropriate to bring 
a bill forward through Private Members' Business.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the bill 
to provide for the recognition of the Canadian horse as the national 
horse of Canada affects many Quebecers and particularly breeders. 
It is therefore a pleasure for us to represent them by taking part in 
this debate.
<P>
	In perusing Bill C-329, we learn that the horse was sent by the 
King of France, was invaluable to settlers in their efforts to survive 
and prosper. We learn that the horse has a number of fine qualities, 
including strength, endurance, intelligence and good temper.
<P>
	We also learn that it was nearly lost at one point through 
interbreeding and casualties in war. Allow me to add a few points, 
because I believe it is important to understand the history of this 
exceptional animal and see how it developed.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	The very first horse to touch the soil in New France arrived in 
Quebec City on June 25, 1647. At that time it was called the 
Canadian horse, and there were no horses in this part of North 
America. The region's dense and broad forests effectively 
prevented crossbreeding with other types of horses. There was no 
possibility of interbreeding with the breeds of horse brought in by 
the English and by the Spaniards in the south.
<P>
	It was only after 1759 that export to the United States and 
crossbreeding with other types of horse became a possibility, and 
the numbers of the purebred Canadian horse began to decrease.
<P>
	Sometime around 1880, faced with the real threat of the breed's 
disappearance, people decided to act. Quebecers like François 
Pilote, Édouard Barnard and,  particularly, Dr. J.A. Couture, a 
veterinarian, decided to ensure the species' survival by selecting 
and breeding the best of the remaining horses. Dr. Couture, among 
others, gathered in a breed book all of the subjects combining the 
breed's distinctive characteristics to ensure their protection.
<P>
	Thus, through this brief history, we can see that the Canadian 
horse arrived and was bred in Quebec. Those who raised and 
trained them were the inhabitants of what would become Quebec. 
These same people took steps to ensure that this symbol of strength 
and pride would not disappear from our continent.
<P>
	In the light of these facts, it would be a good idea perhaps for any 
future recognition of this horse as the national horse to contain 
greater reference to Quebecers' contribution to its survival and 
conservation.
<P>
	Furthermore, since the government of Quebec is currently 
considering a similar request, it seems more in keeping with 
history that any recognition of this breed as a national emblem 
should come from the Quebec National Assembly rather than from 
the House of Commons.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to enter the debate on Bill C-329 to recognize the Canadian horse.
<P>
	I must admit I am not knowledgeable about horse breeding. One 
of my constituents brought the bill to my attention. As I read over 
the history of this horse in Canada, I realized it is part of our 
identity, part of our cultural history. The member from the Reform 
Party who went into great dissertation about the irrelevance of the 
legislation, I believe, misses the very important point that cultural 
identity is what makes a nation.
<P>
	Looking at the history of this horse, in 1665 it originally came 
from the royal stables of King Louis XIV. It was situated in New 
France. During that time the breed strengthened and became larger 
until 1759 at the time of the collapse of New France.
<P>
	It is interesting to study political economics. It is something I 
have always been fascinated with. There is always so much concern 
about what happened on the Plains of Abraham in revisiting our 
history of those days. If we were to study the history of New France 
prior to the Wolfe-Montcalm battles, we would discover an 
economy that was rampant with inflation, high debt and high 
unemployment. It is interesting that these are some of the very 
problems we have today.
<P>
	After the collapse of that economy, many French speaking 
people of New France left the province. They went to Manitoba.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	Do we see any similarities between some of these things and 
some of the debates that are happening in our  House today? The 
Canadian h orse typifies Canada itself, often struggling against 
tremendous forces of nature and social situations, sometimes 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15797"> 15797 </A></B>
<P>
becoming almost extinct, and from the brink of that extinction 
fighting back, becoming stronger, becoming more proficient.
<P>
	I often like to view art. The members of the Reform Party do not 
seem to have much interest in art. If we go to the National Gallery 
we will see a number of paintings there by Cornelius Krieghoff. 
Cornelius Krieghoff of course was not a Quebecer, but he painted at 
the time of New France. In those pictures you will constantly see 
the Canadian horse. That is very much part of our cultural identity. 
That is also why it is very important that this nation continue to 
exist, because we have something very special to protect. A horse 
clearly cannot run on three legs. The Canadian horse is not just part 
of Quebec; it is part of all of Canada.
<P>
	As a previous speaker has mentioned, there is quite a breeding 
operation not far from the Hill, in North Gower. When I read the 
background of this horse, that also rang a familiar bell with me, 
because the last time I went horseback riding was in North Gower.
<P>
	In conclusion, in looking at the struggles this horse has been 
through, it is very appropriate that he is called the Canadian horse. 
More important, it is incumbent upon us in this House to look at 
those things that make us a nation rather than those things that 
divide us.
<P>
	The struggle for Canada in this part of North America has not 
always been easy and has often been met by trials and tribulations 
and indeed death. Often our concern in this country was to protect 
ourselves from the Americans south of the border through wars and 
now even the consistency of cultural identity in Canada. We 
continue to resist the imposition of American culture in our society 
and we continue to strive for the dominance that is Canada's 
culture. This horse is a symbol of that.
<P>
	I am very happy to support this bill. I want to remind some of my 
colleagues in the House that we must always fight for a united 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder (Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is indeed a pleasure to have this opportunity 
to speak on the bill before the House by my colleague from 
Lanark-Carleton, Bill C-329, an act to recognize the Canadian 
horse as the national horse of Canada.
<P>
	The history of this breed is impressive. The Canadian horse was 
introduced into Canada in 1665, when the King of France sent 
horses from his own stables to the people in his North American 
colony. The breed thrived and multiplied in its new home from 145 
head in 1679 to over 5,000 in 1720, in that short period of time.
<P>
	The history of the Canadian horse is also the history of Canada's 
agricultural pioneers. These animals became an invaluable ally to 
the settlers in their efforts to survive and prosper in their new 
homes.
<P>
	I want to talk about this for a minute, because I found it very 
interesting. When the member from the third party was here he said 
we should be talking about more important things in the House 
right now. We have a motto on my farm back home. The motto is 
very simply this: mindful of the past, planning for the future. It 
goes to show members how important our history is to us in this 
country. If we have no past, we really do not have much to look 
forward to in the future.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	In these days of tractors and modern machinery, when a farmer 
goes out to plow his field he hops into a 100-plus horsepower 
tractor that is pulling anywhere from six to ten furrows behind him 
in an air conditioned cab. He is listening to the radio and the 
markets as he is doing his job. However, back in the days of the 
Canadian horse, a farmer went out and had a single furrow in front 
of him, the horse in front of him, the reins around his neck, two 
hands on the handles, and he went out plowing.
<P>
	Today, with the equipment we have we can plow 15 to 20 acres a 
day. Back then, a farmer plowing a field with a horse in front of 
him could do two acres a day. Members might be interested to 
know that for every acre he plowed behind a horse he had to walk 
10 miles. For the farmer to do two acres a day he would walk 20 
miles. I should be getting more exercise like this.
<P>
	The horse has always been there. I come from Grey County in 
Ontario. When the surveys of Grey County were first being done 
there were two surveys. One was called Rankin and the other was 
called Trainer. The distance from Owen Sound down to Hamilton is 
about 150 to 180 miles. When these gentlemen were setting out the 
surveys to lay out the townships and the roads and everything in the 
early 1800s, which does not seem all that long ago, the fields were 
not there. It was all covered with forests. These gentlemen came 
with backpacks and horses from Owen Sound. They worked their 
way down and set up food caches all the way through. They came 
from Hamilton and worked their way up so they could start to do 
these surveys. The surveys took quite a while.
<P>
	When the surveys were done, of course, there was still a forest to 
clean away so we could get into agriculture with open fields. The 
horse was there again. The farmers were cutting down trees and 
were using horses to pull those trees and stumps away.
<P>
	This summer I was up in Collingwood, which is part of my 
riding. They have a fair up there called the Great Northern 
Exhibition. They show horses up there. It is part of our heritage, 
our past. I watched and handed out trophies this year for the horse 
pulls. It is a very competitive atmosphere.
<P>
	In my own village of Holstein, we have a Santa Claus parade 
every year. One of the prerequisites to be in that parade is to have a 
horse-drawn float. There are  Mennonites and Old Order 
Mennonites in my area who use horse-drawn equipment, the horse 
and buggy, the democrat. Maybe the pages do not know what a 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15798"> 15798 </A></B>
<P>
democrat is. It is a long wagon affair with a number of seats in it, 
which a sizeable family can sit in. Some of these families have 
eight to ten kids, all behind the horse.
<P>
	In the Depression years our family lived on a farm. We had a 
large stand of timber on the farm and we sold wood. How did we 
get it to town? We hauled it with a horse. This was all part of 
agriculture.
<P>
	The Canadian horse is known for its strength and endurance. 
There have been a number of historical accounts of the horse's 
performance and ability to outperform animals of much greater 
size. I am talking about Belgians and Percherons, horses of that 
kind, which are sizeable horses when you get beside them. Never 
get stepped on by one. I did when I was a child.
<P>
	One story tells of a butcher who hooked his Canadian horse to a 
buggy and travelled 250 kilometres from Quebec City to Montreal 
in less than 12 hours, outracing the overnight steamer that was 
racing against him to collect an unpaid bill.
<P>
	There was another account from the <I>Breeder's Gazette</I> of 
Chicago in 1914. I think the hon. member touched on this, but I 
will say it again, because we have to show how good the Canadian 
horse is. It is not very often that we in this House beat our own 
drum on how good we are as Canadians. I think we should do it 
more often. The Canadian horse is a good example. We have a 
wood merchant who was the owner of a Canadian horse weighing 
approximately 1,050 pounds. He harnessed it to the same pull 
against another horse about 200 pounds heavier. The Canadian 
horse was always kept in its harness traces, well stretched and 
never showed as much fatigue as his heavier mate. After two years 
of common work the heavier horse died. ``The question on the 
cause of death'', the driver answered, ``is the Canadian horse made 
him die of overwork''.

<P>
	That goes to show how good this breed is that we are trying to 
recognize as something that is Canadian. Canada should be very 
proud too because as a united country we are number one in the 
world today. Again I have to stress the fact that my colleague from 
the third party seems to miss this point. I find it unfortunate that he 
and my Bloc colleagues they do not understand how good they 
have it right now.
<P>
	Despite its qualities the Canadian horse almost faced extinction 
through inbreeding and neglect. In 1886 a few admirers banded 
together to establish a breed registry or a stud book listing all the 
purebreds.
<P>
	In 1907 a second book was opened and the federal government 
department of agriculture funded a panel of judges to survey 
approximately 2,500 horses out of which only 969 were acceptable 
and registered as foundation  stock. That is how close we were to 
losing the Canadian horse.
<P>
	Between 1913 and 1981 the federal and Quebec governments 
launched programs to maintain the breed. However, in 1976 with 
only 383 Canadian horses left on record, once again the horse was 
destined to disappear. This is what the hon. member across was 
talking about, this resiliency of Canadians. We bounce back. We 
will bounce back. We always do bounce back. The Canadian horse 
is a good example of this.
<P>
	During the past 10 years there has been a resurgence of interest 
in the breed. People are rediscovering the little iron horse. Is that 
not a great way of describing a symbol of Canada, the little iron 
horse. It is a gentle hardworking breed, an intelligent, 
multi-purpose horse. There are breeders in my riding of 
Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe that have written to me to 
proudly describe these animals, which is one of the reasons I am 
here today supporting the member's bill.
<P>
	This bill provides us with an opportunity to celebrate this 
uniquely Canadian horse. We owe much to it for its hard work in 
developing this country and I encourage all the members to support 
this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise today to speak in favour of 
Bill C-329, an act to provide for the recognition of the Canadian 
horse as the national horse of Canada.
<P>
	Since their introduction into Canada in 1665, the ``little iron 
horses'' have served Canadians well. Not only were they used for 
driving and riding but they were also used for clearing land, 
cultivating and hauling. They may have begun their lives as 
pampered pets in the royal stables of King Louis XIV but once they 
were shipped to Canada they had to earn their keep.
<P>
	The early history of the Canadian horse in some ways resembles 
that of the colonists themselves. In her pictorial history of the 
Canadian horse, Gladys Mackey Beattie notes that due to natural 
selection, only the strongest managed to survive. The conditions 
under which they had to exist gave them endurance found in no 
other breed.
<P>
	Over time the horses became smaller in size than the original 
imports, but they were much more hardy, could thrive on meagre 
rations, trot tirelessly through mud or snow by day or night, 
matured at an early age and were long lived as well. Many stories 
are told of the strength and stamina of the little horses who could 
eat less but do more work than other horses almost twice their 
weight, and they could run. The record books of the 1800s are full 
of references to record times of the pacers and trotters descended 
from Canadian horses.

<P>
	The historian, Faillon, described the horse as ``small but robust, 
hocks of steel, thick mane floating in the wind, bright and lively 
eyes, pricking sensitive ears at the least noise, going along day or 
night with the same courage, wide awake beneath its harness, 
spirited, good, gentle, affectionate, following his road with finest 
instinct to come surely to his own stable''. What fitting attributes 
for a national symbol.
<P>
	There is also another reason to recognize this uniquely Canadian 
breed as our national horse, that is its need for protection and 
encouragement. Throughout history, despite its strength and 
stamina and sometimes because of it, this little horse has often 
been in real danger of extinction. After 1670, the last year that 
horses were shipped to Canada as gifts to nobility, the 40-odd 
horses in New France multiplied. Their numbers reached 5,200 by 
1720 and 12,000 by 1760. However when the British captured 
Quebec in 1759 the fortunes of the Canadian horse began to 
decline. British immigrants brought their own horses and bred 
them to the durable little Canadians, depleting the purebred stock.
<P>
	Many French Canadians packed up and moved away to 
Manitoba or the United States, taking their horses prized for their 
cross breeding qualities with them. From 1861 to 1865 thousands 
of Canadian horses were shipped to the U.S. to be used as cavalry 
mounts and pack horses during the American civil war. A great 
many died in the war and those that survived never returned to 
Canada.
<P>
	By the end of the 19th century only a small number of pure 
blooded Canadian horses were left. Despite breeding programs 
only 383 registered Canadian horses were on record as of 1976, and 
the future of the breed seemed pretty dark. Since the late 1970s 
determined Canadian horse lovers and breeders who believe it is a 
perfect all-purpose family horse have increased the numbers to the 
point where the breed is no longer in danger of disappearing.
<P>
	As gentle, relaxed and intelligent as they are, some breeders 
believe they will be in greater and greater demand for tourist 
activities from endurance trail rides to pulling visitors through the 
narrow streets of our oldest cities.
<P>
	However until now the horse that can ``do everything but dance'' 
has certainly not received the recognition and honour it deserves. 
The little iron horse was an integral part of the lives of Canadians 
more than 300 years ago, working alongside our first colonists and 
doubling as carriage horses for the family and race horses on 
Sundays and holidays.
<P>
	All in all it is what J. G. Rutherford, federal veterinary director 
and livestock commissioner, reportedly testified before a 
parliamentary committee in 1909 when he said that it was ``the best 
general purpose horse raised in Canada''.
<P>
	It is high time we recognize it as Canada's official national horse 
and I thank my hon. colleague from Lanark-Carleton for bringing 
it to the attention of the House.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There being no further members rising to 
speak on the matter, the time provided for the consideration of 
Private Members' Business has expired and the order is dropped 
from the Order Paper.
<P>
	It being 6.35 p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
2 p.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.35 p.m.)
