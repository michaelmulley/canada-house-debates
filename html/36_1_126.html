</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, today it is certainly a 
privilege for me to begin debate on Bill C-35. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially this bill contains amendments to Canada's 
anti-dumping and countervailing duty law, known as the Special 
Import Measures Act, or SIMA.  It responds directly to the 
recommendations contained in a 1996 parliamentary report on 
Canada's trade remedy system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments will fine-tune the law by rationalizing the 
investigative process, increasing transparency and procedural 
fairness, and in fact enhancing the system's ability to consider 
representations from various segments of Canadian business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also includes certain technical changes that clarify 
existing provisions and practices under SIMA and the Canadian 
International Trade Tribunal Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>SIMA is an important component of Canada's trade remedy 
legislation.  It authorizes the federal government to impose 
anti-dumping and countervailing duties to offset injury to 
domestic firms caused by foreign dumping and subsidies.  In this 
regard it implements Canada's rights and obligations under the 
World Trade Organization agreements on subsidies and 
anti-dumping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two federal government departments and one independent tribunal 
are directly involved under SIMA.  As actions taken under SIMA 
result in the imposition of duties on imported goods, the 
Minister of Finance is responsible for the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada and the Canadian International Trade Tribunal 
share responsibility for investigations under the law and Revenue 
Canada enforces anti-dumping and countervailing duties at the 
border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to international implications and negotiations, it 
is foreign affairs and finance which work together on trade 
remedy policy to co-ordinate Canada's import and export interests 
and develop our international trade negotiating positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before discussing the merits of Bill C-35, I would like to 
provide some background as to why these amendments are being 
proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a long history in the use of trade remedies.  In fact 
in 1904 Canada introduced the world's first anti-dumping 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then our trade remedy system has undergone various 
refinements due to changing economic conditions and the evolution 
of international trade rules.  These international rules are 
governed by the World Trade Organization, or the WTO, which sets 
out detailed rights and obligations of member countries in 
administering trade and remedy protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the imposition of anti-dumping or countervailing duties 
represents an exception from a country's WTO commitments not to 
raise tariffs and not to discriminate in its treatment of 
imports, the right to impose these special duties is carefully 
circumscribed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general, the Canadian SIMA system is comparable to the 
systems of other major users such as the United States and the 
European Union.  The WTO does, however, provide some latitude in 
the administration of trade remedy laws.  As a result, there are 
some variations between systems, largely reflecting differing 
legal cultures and economic circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are, of course, important domestic interests on both sides 
of the trade remedies equation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the key challenges associated with the Special Import 
Measures Act was to strike the right balance between the 
interests of industries seeking trade remedy action and the 
interests of consumers and other manufacturers who may be 
negatively affected by the imposition of anti-dumping or 
countervailing duties on imported goods. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, this law is intended to assist Canadian 
enterprises by offsetting the injurious economic effects 
resulting from dumping or underpricing practices of foreign 
exporters, or in the case of subsidies, to remedy the injurious 
effects of the subsidy practices of foreign governments. 
However, the downstream economic interests cannot be ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As markets operate increasingly on a global basis, market 
openness becomes a critical factor in attracting investment and 
maintaining the competitiveness of our domestic firms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian manufacturers often have to rely on imported inputs, 
for example, to meet specific quality and technical needs of 
their customers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the OECD, the operations of Canadian manufacturers 
rely more on imported inputs than their G-7 counterparts in the 
U.S., France, Germany, Japan and the U.K.  This reflects the 
relatively smaller size of the Canadian economy, as well as its 
high level of integration with the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given this, SIMA must represent a balancing act.  It must 
provide effective relief to Canadian firms injured by foreign 
dumping or subsidies while not imposing unnecessary or excessive 
burden on downstream producers or consumers.  This was the key 
challenge for lawmakers when SIMA was first developed in 1984 and 
it certainly remains the challenge today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Minister of Finance requested the House of Commons 
Standing Committees on Finance and Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade to jointly review SIMA in 1996, he noted that 
significant changes had taken place in the global trading 
environment since 1984 and that it was time to reassess whether 
the law continued to reflect the interests of Canadian producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two subcommittees were asked to undertake this review.  They 
heard from a broad range of interests, including domestic 
producers, importers, retailers, academics, trade practitioners 
and government officials.  These parties gave evidence and 
submitted proposals for changes based on their experience with 
the SIMA system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was based on these submissions and their deliberations that 
the subcommittees concluded in their report that Canada's trade 
remedy system under SIMA continues to respond to the needs of 
Canadian producers that seek protection under the law, while 
affording downstream producers and consumers an opportunity to 
have their interests considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also identified areas where improvements could be made to 
the system to make it more efficient and more responsive to 
Canada's economic needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally, the recommendations represented adjustments to the 
SIMA investigation process that allow the system to more 
adequately consider the views of various parties which have a 
stake in this law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be clear that it was for this reason that the 
government supported virtually all of the subcommittees' 
recommendations.  What we have before us today is Bill C-35, 
which essentially reflects the subcommittees' recommendations and 
the requirement that the subcommittees put forward in asking the 
government to review these recommendations and build them into 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are key changes in Bill C-35, the first being the 
rationalization of investigative functions of Revenue Canada and 
the Canadian International Trade Tribunal to better reflect their 
respective areas of expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second would enhance procedural fairness and transparency by 
bringing Revenue Canada's treatment of confidential information 
more in line with the tribunal's practice respecting the 
disclosure of confidential information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third would ensure that the tribunal, in its fact finding, 
would benefit more fully from expert evidence by permitting 
expert witnesses to play a more effective role in tribunal 
inquiries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth would establish new penalty provisions to deter any 
unauthorized disclosure or misuse of confidential information by 
legal counsel or expert witnesses in the context of SIMA 
investigations.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth would improve the provisions which allow the Deputy 
Minister of National Revenue to accept an undertaking from 
exporters to raise prices as an alternative to the imposition of 
anti-dumping duties and to ensure that all interested persons 
are afforded an opportunity to provide views when undertakings 
are being considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sixth would require the tribunal to cumulate the injurious 
effects of dumping or subsidizing from more than one country 
consistent with the single price effect in the Canadian market of 
such practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final change would clarify the conditions under which the 
tribunal can consider issues of broader public interest and the 
types of measures it may recommend in a public interest report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The discussions that took place in the recent parliamentary 
review of SIMA reflected the changes that have taken place in the 
structure of the Canadian economy since the law was established 
in 1984.  These changes will ensure that the Special Import 
Measures Act remains a strong trade instrument which truly 
protects Canadian producers injured by dumped or subsidized 
imports, while at the same time allowing an opportunity for other 
producers and consumers to have their interests considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It certainly introduces important changes to Canada's trade 
remedy system which take account of the interests of all 
stakeholders.  It is for the reasons that I have outlined that I 
would urge all of my colleagues to support its passage. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is unfortunate that the official opposition has to 
look at the existing trade world and support Bill C-35, updating 
the Special Import Measures Act and the Canadian International 
Trade Tribunal Act, although we believe that this government 
needs to give much greater and earlier consideration to the 
impact on Canadian consumers when it is weighing the merits of 
imposing countervailing duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all, the first principle of government is to protect the 
well-being of its Canadian citizens, which to me includes 
law-abiding Canadian companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I say unfortunate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long ago as 1904 Canada developed the world's first 
anti-dumping legislation.  Over the years since then Canada has 
evolved into one of the world's leading trading nations. Canada's 
trade legislation has been changed many times, including changes 
to the Special Import Measures Act, or SIMA, needed to implement 
the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Uruguay round of 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But after those piecemeal changes there has been no overall 
public review of the legislation to ensure that it still serves 
the needs of Canadian businesses and industry, as well as the 
needs of the Canadian consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been a couple of years since the finance minister asked 
two standing committees of this House, namely the Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade and also the 
Standing Committee on Finance, to review the Special Import 
Measures Act and make recommendations to the government regarding 
any changes needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although this was not my critic area during this period of time, 
I understand that fairly extensive joint hearings were held by 
subcommittees of both groups, which reported back to their 
committees.  The government has now acted on the committees' 
recommendations by bringing forward the legislation before us, 
namely Bill C-35. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the major interested parties which attended the hearings 
of the subcommittees were representatives of the steel industry, 
which has recently been subjected to major dumping by steel 
producers outside North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when large parts of the world are suffering major 
economic reversals, we can expect many nations to export whatever 
commodities they can, including steel, and to sell to countries 
like Canada and the U.S.A. in a desperate attempt to prop up 
their sagging economies at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the subcommittees' hearings Canadian steel producers 
wanted the Canadian government to get tough with American 
producers.  It is certainly within the power of the Canadian 
government to do so. 
It could make it more difficult and costly for U.S. importers to 
meet SIMA demands and it could get the Canadian international 
trade tribunal to find in favour more often of Canadian firms for 
example through making new rules or changing the emphasis and the 
interpretation of the existing rules.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question has to be raised as to who will benefit and who 
will be hurt.  If Canada moves toward tougher laws and stronger 
restrictions on international trade versus easing restrictions 
and working toward not only so-called free trade but, more 
important, fair trade , nobody can be certain which way our major 
trading partners will jump if Canada starts getting tougher with 
anti-dumping and anti-subsidy laws.  Would legislators be likely 
to recognize how counterproductive such measures could be?  Or 
would they, as appears to be happening today with the American 
states of Idaho, Montana, North and South Dakota and Minnesota, 
see such actions as an excuse to retaliate against this or that 
sector of the nearly $1 billion per day of trade between our two 
countries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that Canada is more dependent on exports than the U.S.A. 
it could be foolhardy to try to find out, creating what would 
amount to a head on collision between a logging truck and a 
motorcycle.  I do not need to spell out to my colleagues in the 
House which vehicle would represent Canada or the relative 
amounts of damage which Canada and U.S. economies could suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not an economist but I am very definitely a free trader. In 
the long run I believe it would be very effective to identify 
downstream U.S. users of Canadian imports to identify who gets 
hurt by U.S. anti-dumping and subsidy legislation.  Let us take 
for example the softwood lumber deal which was instrumental in 
raising U.S. housing prices.  The problem is that certain groups 
are very well organized and can mount a much more effective U.S. 
lobby effort than other groups can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Idaho, Montana, North and South Dakota and 
Minnesota if lower Canadian pork and beef prices at least partly 
due to our lower dollar were to save money for American consumers 
it is safe to bet in the real world that the American state 
governments and the American federal government would hear a lot 
more quickly and a lot louder from U.S. pork producers than from 
the U.S. consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation reveals another reason why it is unfortunate that 
we are here today with regard to Bill C-35. For more than a week 
now state governments across the northern U.S.A. have been using 
state troopers to stop transport trucks carrying live Canadian 
hogs and steers to U.S. markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first came to parliament in 1993 in my riding of 
Okanagan—Shuswap there were to the best of my recollection about 
five commercial hog producers around the community of Lumby 
alone.  Today I am sad to say the last one is closing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently television reporters have been pretty well making a 
joke out of the fact that hog growers in the province of Quebec 
are so desperate that they blockaded Highway 20 between Quebec 
City and Montreal with hay and a number of pigs in an effort to 
call attention to their plight and to get some help from their 
provincial government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the Fraser Valley in B.C. right across Canada to Quebec it 
is no light decision, it is no small or laughing matter when pork 
producers are shut down.  For one thing these folks are not just 
a bunch of good old boys in bib overalls chewing on a stick of 
hay.  Today's commercial hog barns involve quite major capital 
investments with a large size and computerized feeding and record 
keeping.  If you wanted to buy a couple of so-called piggies to 
raise in your small family farm you could drive your pick-up 
truck to one of those growers and he could take you along the 
cement floor pens where each age and weight from the little 
wieners right up to the finished hogs are grouped by themselves. 
He could tell you from his records exactly how much feed and 
other costs he has committed to each of those groups and what 
price he needs from you to cover the costs and to make a little 
profit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly today he can also tell you that for all his hard work he 
is no longer able to make any profit.  Therefore many hog 
producers are bringing all those animals to market weight and 
selling off their breeding stock and going out of business. 
Their one hope may be to order a big transport truck, load the 
live animals on board and ship them across the border into the 
United States where the higher U.S. dollar might offer our 
farmers some hope of saving their farms.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is going to leave Canada open to the same kind of charges. 
Bill C-35 was designed to allow us to charge non-Canadian 
businesses for dumping and selling the product in the country for 
less than it costs to produce.  Such charges are going to take 
time to investigate. Meanwhile Canada's only apparent choice will 
be to bring charges against the U.S.A. under dispute resolution 
mechanisms of NAFTA or the World Trade Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile what is happening to all those animals and the farmers 
who own them?  If those closely monitored hogs are brought to 
finished weight, their owners are going to have to lay out even 
more cash to keep paying for feed while the dispute drags on. Now 
the farmers are going to have to face bills from their transport 
companies because they cannot drive a truck for free, and even 
though many farmers have already achieved some virtual 
integration by raising the feed for the animals, they are not 
likely to own a transport truck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing to be learned from the situation is that the Canadian 
industry clearly has a major interest in helping U.S. consumers 
get better organized.  It is American consumers who could be the 
major beneficiary of cheaper Canadian commodities entering the 
American market, if we really do have free trade.  Perhaps the 
Canadian government has a role to play in helping to accurately 
inform consumers both in the U.S. and in Europe.  Certainly that 
would not be an unfair trade practice to tell the truth about 
Canadian products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the Canadian exports of forest products and the 
nasty role played by certain so-called environmental groups 
trying to destroy European markets for Canadian forest companies. 
These so-called environmental groups are subsidized by the 
Canadian government with tax dollars paid in part by the forest 
industry and its employees.  Despite our world leading expertise 
by many sectors of the Canadian economy, for example, forestry, 
mining, communications and aerospace, many times our federal 
government can act like babes in the woods over international 
trade deals.  If we are going to run with the so-called big dogs, 
we have to do more than just bark once in a while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, the federal government did not look down the road 
and accurately assess the implications if we stood up and 
challenged the U.S.A. on the softwood lumber deal, facing the 
worst case scenario and saying almost anything is likely better 
than this massive bureaucratic meddling in our multibillion 
softwood industry by a bunch of folks who are more at home dealing 
with chicken or egg marketing boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have literally millions of dollars in added costs for 
softwood lumber producers as they have to ensure such 
non-market related factors as their exports do not exceed 28% 
of their entire year quota in any one quarter.  This is 
regardless of the fact that we can face burning hot, dry summers 
like this summer where loggers were banned from the British 
Columbia forests for months due to the extreme fire hazards. 
Loggers can be banned from the bush for many weeks every spring 
because logging roads are so soft when the frost is coming out 
and the load restrictions have to be enforced.  The softwood 
lumber deal only applies to exports from four provinces so 
producers can move a plant to a neighbouring province and not be 
subject to any quota whatsoever. This is a bad deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the bill before us today both the SIMA and international 
trade tribunal will be amended in line with the recommendations 
produced after the joint committee hearings.  My colleagues in 
finance and international trade heard testimony from the 
departments, academics and industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to praise one important aspect in the legislation before 
us today.  It is the clarification of provisions on disclosing 
confidential information that is revealed in the course of 
investigations about dumping and subsidies and new penalties for 
making wrongful use of that information.  The kind of expert 
testimony which could be revealed in the course of these 
investigations could do major damage to the companies involved. 
It is critical for the information to be protected.  Trying to 
determine when bad trade practices have hurt existing Canadians 
producers or have prevented development of a Canadian industry 
can be extremely complex.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For an example, the city of Vernon where I have my riding office 
used to be the site of major canners of fruits and vegetables and 
also for the major production of jams and jellies.  This is no 
longer the case.  It would certainly be a major project trying to 
determine whether these industries died due to unfair 
international trade or because of unfair policies created by 
politicians from Ontario and Quebec who have stacked so much 
federal legislation against the interests of the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For another such example in the Okanagan Valley of British 
Columbia a lot of growers produce tree fruits.  American fruit 
growers are allowed to export into Canada certain fruits with 
some allowable residues of pesticides which Canadian fruit 
growers are not allowed to use at all.  Is that a fair trade 
practice?  I do not think so.  The tree fruit growers tell me 
nothing is being done to help them.  Should they blame the 
growers in the U.S.A. or should they blame Ottawa?  I do not have 
too much doubt as to who they should be blaming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the provincial and federal governments are now being 
pressed to provide subsidies to B.C. tree fruit growers.  Instead 
many of their problems are due to bad policies made right here in 
Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take another example of the pinewood nematode.  It is a 
little bug that lives in Canadian softwood and can be carried 
between trees by beetles.  Our climate is such that this pinewood 
nematode basically cannot multiply enough to kill any trees.  In 
the 1980s British Columbia was exporting in the vicinity of a 
billion dollars worth of softwood into the European market every 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suddenly several European nations, which by curious coincidence 
also produced softwood lumber, decided to start demanding that 
Canadian companies must kiln dry softwood lumber exported to 
Europe.  This added enough cost that our softwood exports to 
Europe now amount to less than $200,000 per year.  Every dollar 
of lost exports to the European market means fewer jobs in the 
Canadian forest industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleagues might believe that surely plant health 
constitutes reasonable grounds for making such a demand for kiln 
dried softwood, and I might agree with them but for a couple of 
facts.  First, the Canadian forestry industry has done the 
scientific investigations to prove that it is virtually 
impossible for the Canadian pinewood nematode to multiply and 
create any hazard in Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, and this is the catcher, European nations import 
softwood lumber green, which is to say not kiln dried, from parts 
of Europe that have been infested with the European pinewood 
nematode. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my mind and according to representation from the B.C. 
softwood lumber producers, this constitutes a non-tariff trade 
barrier which has been in place for several years.  However, 
rather than going to bat for the B.C. softwood lumber industry 
and pushing the complaint through the World Trade Organization, 
this government took absolutely no action until this summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, British Columbia's coastal lumber manufacturers, who 
have been the hardest hit in all of this by the recent economic 
downturn in Asia, are seeing layoffs that run as high as 50% of 
the forestry workforce in coastal communities.  When one combines 
those forestry layoffs with the destruction of the west coast 
fishing industry, also due mainly to the politics of this 
government which has done such outrageous things as close fish 
hatcheries inland in British Columbia, including one in my 
riding, while the American state of Alaska in particular has 
strongly supported and expanded its hatcheries, we have an entire 
region, west coast, which today is experiencing a major 
recession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sometimes have to wonder where the thought process is when we 
start doing things like this.  Does anybody here in Ottawa care 
that B.C. is in a recession?  Does anybody here even know?  Since 
parliament began sitting again this week where is the legislation 
this government has brought forward to assist British 
Columbia in its time of need? 
Have my hon. colleagues seen a piece of legislation that I 
missed?  No.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is totally irresponsible for the government to 
allow the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates to prop up our 
sagging dollar while B.C. is already in a recession rather than 
bite the bullet, cut taxes and pay down our enormous federal 
debt.  Instead, just like the APEC scandal, the Prime Minister 
washes his hands or again blames somebody else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government responsible for setting fiscal policy?  Of 
course it is, just like it is responsible for setting defence 
policy, for setting trade policy to be enacted through such 
legislation as we have here before us today.  Instead the Prime 
Minister shrugs the responsibility off on to the governor of the 
bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crazy reality of international trade in Canada today is that 
we must have legislation setting out the rules and procedures for 
anti-dumping and countervailing duty action.  We have to maintain 
federal departments which are supposed to determine when another 
country has a subsidy that does an injury to a Canadian company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If politicians and bureaucrats here in Ottawa were to look out 
into the real world they might recognize that this entire 
exercise, including Bill C-35, is almost like a sick little joke. 
What is an unfair trade practice?  Which is an injury to a 
Canadian business?  When is a subsidy a subsidy and when is it 
not a subsidy?  Is it a subsidy when American business can 
purchase gasoline for a trucking fleet at about half the cost of 
Canadian business?  Is it a subsidy when an American business can 
pay its employees less but have the employees end up with 
significantly more take home pay for several reasons, including 
that Canadians pay the highest personal income tax in the entire 
G-7 and that the policies of the Liberal government, added to the 
policies of the Mulroney government, have seen the value of the 
Canadian dollar falling against virtually all other major 
currencies in the world for many years?  Is that a subsidy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it a subsidy when an American business does not have to hire 
an extra accountant or an extra secretary to complete the GST 
returns or to handle the extra mountain of paperwork which is 
required by the unbelievable red tape that federal and provincial 
governments impose on anybody brave enough or foolhardy enough to 
try to operate a business in Canada today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it a subsidy when a mining company can know who is going to 
be its landlord for a given property in the U.S.A. but in British 
Columbia especially the federal government still has not 
successfully completed even one modern land claim?  Is it a 
subsidy that investors in British Columbia do not know who their 
landlord may or may not be because Ottawa cannot get land claims 
settled?  Is that a form of a subsidy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it a subsidy when an American company can pay its employees 
in American dollars whereas Canadian companies pay our employees 
in Canadian dollars?  I have to wonder about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can well remember when the Canadian dollar was valued well 
above the U.S. dollar.  Canada still has great natural resource 
riches.  We still have an educated and willing workforce.  The 
trouble is Canada now has suffered for many years under federal 
governments which believe they can spend us, using our own money, 
to riches rather than recognizing that we have a federal debt to 
GDP ratio that is second only to Italy among the G-7 nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it a subsidy when an American company pays its employees in 
American dollars?  It is a serious question, because Canada's 
high tech industries in particular, whose trained personnel may 
account for a majority of their capital, are finding it nearly 
impossible to get and to keep the well trained employees which 
are their single greatest assets right here in Canada.  Is it a 
subsidy?  We train them, they get them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of facing that basic economic problem I have received 
letters from high tech companies in Canada which now want the 
federal government to increase grants and subsidies to help our 
companies pay for the costs of research and development. 
They are struggling to survive, and this government can only 
treat the symptoms of an illness that threatens their very lives.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The policies of this government and the Mulroney government 
before it have raised our taxes so high and dropped our dollar so 
low that I understand both the current Prime Minister and his 
predecessor have been named business people of the year by 
several American states. The two of them together have instituted 
and followed policies which are hammering the last few nails into 
the coffins of many Canadian companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just look at my own personal field of mining.  Canada is 
losing market share of worldwide mining investments.  Is it 
unfair trade practices that account for that harm being done to 
Canadian mining companies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I have been alerted that the state of Alaska 
has asked the American government to request a hearing by the 
International Joint Commission, or IJC, of the Tulsequah chief 
mining project being advanced by the Canadian company Redfern 
Resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a project which has passed multimillion dollar 
environmental assessments by both the federal government and the 
Government of British Columbia.  If Ottawa agrees to ignore our 
own provincial and federal hearings in which the state of 
Alaska—and I want to make it clear that the state of Alaska had 
every opportunity to raise any concerns it had during these 
hearings and never did.  If Ottawa refuses to listen and goes 
ahead with putting a delay in place on this process too long for 
the investors to remain interested, will this constitute an 
unfair trade practice?  You bet it will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The state of Alaska does not have to subsidize its own mining 
companies in order to deal a death blow to a Canadian mining 
company.  It just has to ask this federal government to jump and 
wait for Ottawa to answer “Just how high would you like us to 
jump?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would such a request ever come before the Canadian International 
Trade Tribunal being amended by Bill C-35?  Not likely.  Canadian 
mining companies today not only have to cope with the falling 
commodity prices but they have to cope with the high cost of 
doing business in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will the Canadian International Trade Tribunal do about 
that problem?  I suspect nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past spring I was fortunate enough and had the pleasure to 
travel with my wife through the state of Oregon.  While down 
there, we met a number of business people, including mayors and 
councillors in different towns. They actually thought our Prime 
Minister was the best thing since sliced bread because we have 
driven so many investors to the state of Oregon and they have 
created so many jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example, I was in a little town out of Lincoln, Oregon.  I 
met with a couple of mayors from other communities.  Six new 
businesses in six months have been started by Canadians right out 
of British Columbia.  Six new businesses created 138 new jobs 
because they could not do it in their own country.  I have to 
wonder what is going on here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members can see that we are driving many investors and many jobs 
out of Canada.  I am in a difficult position here today because I 
am a strong supporter of free trade. But free trade has to be 
fair trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at the condition of the Canadian economy with our high 
taxes and our once proud Canadian dollar reduced to 66 cents U.S. 
I look around today and I see that not even one person blinks. We 
have come to accept it.  We have come to accept that maybe it 
will get worse before it gets better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have to be an extremely religious person with a firm 
belief in miracles to think that Canadian businesses today can 
compete fairly with their American counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Introducing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy laws are like putting 
on a little band-aid after cutting a major artery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to state very clearly that I do not believe the proper 
long term solution to these problems is to institute 
protectionist measures, including some of the very things put 
forward in this legislation which is before us today.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead I would like to call upon this government to change its 
high spending, high taxing ways.  It needs to institute profound 
changes to greatly shrink the size and cost of the federal 
government.  It should not just pay lip service by keeping highly 
placed Ottawa mandarins while laying off front line employees who 
provide the real services to the public, and not just cough up 
costly buyout packages only to hire the same people back on a 
contract basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only solution is to greatly reduce the number of things 
being done by the federal government.  Slash the red tape and use 
the savings to pay down the debt and reduce taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has also been my pleasure recently to talk to a number of 
students in my riding of Okanagan—Shuswap.  If members think 
some of the things I have said here today might be a little hard 
and a little harsh, I am serving warning to this House that when 
these young grade 11 and grade 12 students get out on the street 
and they have the time to vote, be worried of your jobs my 
friends because they do not think we have done a very good job at 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These students know there are no jobs out there for them.  We 
had just better be worried.  And remember that I said this.  The 
students are rejecting the image of cradle to grave coddling from 
government.  Students want the government out of their faces. 
They want jobs.  They want dependability.  They want some form of 
security.  And the government is not supplying it.  We can bet on 
that. Students are sick and tired of being over-governed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back to the sad fact of this whole matter of anti-dumping and 
anti-subsidies international trade regulations.  They cannot 
compensate for the grossly irresponsible behaviour of politicians 
whom the Canadian people elected and once trusted to put the best 
interests of the Canadian people first and foremost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with some concern that we will support Bill C-35. I will 
go back to what I said at the very beginning.  The government's 
first and foremost responsibility has to be to the Canadian 
public as a whole, to our law-abiding Canadian companies and to 
Canadian consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One day hopefully the Government of Canada will wake up and find 
out for a change that we were sent to this place to govern for 
the people and not to the people.  I await that day.

</I></B></P><P align=left>More seriously, I am pleased to speak today in the House to Bill 
C-35.  The purpose of this bill is to amend the Special Import 
Measures Act and the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A serious and exhaustive examination shows this to be a complex, 
technical bill. 
It is a very important bill because it will greatly simplify 
life for our companies, but particularly because it marks the 
first attempt by the government to tidy up a complex, technical 
bill, one which needs to be brought up to date quickly, because 
of the increasing number of free-trade agreements being 
negotiated with various countries and also because we now live 
in an era of globalization.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers, Canadians and the Bloc Quebecois have long been 
calling for less bureaucracy and more efficiency for our 
companies, especially those engaged in exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite certain reservations, my Bloc Quebecois colleagues and I 
will be voting in favour of Bill C-35.  We have noted these 
reservations in a report produced by the International Trade, 
Trade Disputes and Investment Subcommittee of the Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade, tabled in 
the House in December 1996.  Moreover, the government responded 
favourably to this report in a document tabled in the House on 
April 18, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is therefore in response to the report. Current 
legislation governs the imposition of antidumping and 
countervailing duties on dumped or subsidized goods where this 
dumping or subsidizing has or may have an injurious effect on 
producers in Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendments have also been made to some provisions of the 
Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act dealing with inquiries 
related to this injury in antidumping and countervailing duty 
cases. These amendments should hopefully improve the Canadian 
trade remedy system so that it will better take into account the 
new economic context and the evolution of international trade 
rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike our colleagues across the way, who changed their tune all 
of a sudden after they took office in 1993—just think of their 
anti-free trade rhetoric—we in the Bloc Quebecois have always 
been in favour of free trade. We can therefore only applaud any 
steps taken to help ensure businesses in Quebec and Canada are 
full participants in this globalization era, but in a 
well-structured context based on appropriate legislation. This is 
the intention behind Bill C-35. It contains marginal changes, 
which will nonetheless streamline the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An extensive review of the report has revealed a number of areas 
that we feel ought to be improved. Some of these changes have 
been included in the report. 
For example, the Bloc Quebecois succeeded in improving access to 
the investigation process for small and medium size producers 
through recommendation no. 2, which reads as follows: “The 
subcommittees recommend first of all that Revenue Canada take 
concrete steps to ensure that small and medium size Canadian 
producers have fair and equitable access to the recourses set 
out in the Special Import Measures Act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major industries, such as sugar, steel, aluminum or 
asbestos, are not the only ones that can make use of an act like 
the Special Measures Act.  As well, increasing numbers of small 
and medium size businesses and producers require easier access 
to these laws, these privileges, which are sometimes a bit 
complex for new exporters. 
Like the other parties, the Bloc Quebecois has tried to simplify 
access for small and medium size producers, as well as making 
other changes in connection with the way the Canadian 
International Trade Tribunal operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois also proposed that recommendation no. 10 make 
cumulation mandatory, when the tribunal is determining damages, 
and the government party agreed to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A section on avoidance was also included in the report, at our 
request. 
Finally, recommendation No. 12 reads as follows: “The 
subcommittees also recommend that section 76 of the Special 
Import Measures Act be amended, so as to compel the Canadian 
International Trade Tribunal to evaluate the cumulative adverse 
effects of dumping or subsidizing, during provisional reviews 
and at expiry”. That recommendation was improved following our 
representations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois succeeded in having major changes and 
improvements made. Unfortunately, several of our recommendations 
were rejected by the government, and it is regarding these that 
we disagree. A number of witnesses raised concerns when they 
appeared before the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Steel Producers Association was among those 
witnesses who were worried about certain provisions in the 
legislation. The Bloc Quebecois expressed these concerns in a 
dissenting opinion, during the review by the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go over the arguments put forward by the Canadian Steel 
Producers Association. The Bloc Quebecois agrees with the 
association, which is asking that Revenue Canada do not take 
into consideration the spontaneous presentations made by parties 
other than the complainant before an investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would mean that Revenue Canada would only take into account 
the information provided by the complainant, and would therefore 
not have to take unsolicited comments into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This seems reasonable to us, since it would only apply to the 
period preceding the opening of an investigation. Unfortunately, 
the government does not seem to care about our requests or those 
of such an important industry for the Quebec and Canadian 
economies as the steel industry. It rejected that proposal, 
which is therefore not reflected in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that the definition of material harm also poses a 
problem. The Bloc Quebecois is asking that a definition of 
“material harm” be included in the Special Import Measures Act. 
Such a definition, along with the criteria suggested in the 
current regulations, would clarify this important notion for 
everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another Bloc Quebecois proposal ignored in this bill concerns 
the future or retroactive method of imposing duties.  We want 
Revenue Canada to continue using the future method.  However, we 
would, in cases where prices or costs are likely to fluctuate 
significantly, like to have Revenue Canada authorized to use the 
retroactive duty imposition method.  This method would be used 
only exceptionally and only when Revenue Canada considered it 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois considers that Bill C-35 should not contain 
provision for the minimum duty.  We think it is premature to 
include the concept of a minimum duty in the Special Import 
Measures Act. 
We think the government should stop approving policies that 
reduce the protection afforded Quebec and Canadian businesses 
when our main trading partners are not doing the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade recommends including the concept of a minimum duty in 
section 45 of the legislation on public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you can see, the Bloc Quebecois worked very hard to improve 
the bill.  Nevertheless, certain conditions were not accepted. 
The Bloc Quebecois will, however, support Bill C-35.

the peaceful protesters gathered, charged with a fervent belief

against the regime.

ten. Since 1986 Newfoundland has lost 60,000 through

it is fair to say that Newfoundland has been literally decimated

<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in 1986, while the government was in opposition and 
the Conservative Party brought in legislation for the Public 
Complaints Commission, the current heritage minister said “I 
urge the government to make changes to allow the Public 
Complaints Commission to investigate beyond the RCMP”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Acting Prime Minister knows that the Public Complaints 
Commission cannot investigate the role of the PMO.  Can the 
minister tell the House if he will make changes so we can 
guarantee that the PMO, if it is to be investigated, can be 
investigated by the Public Complaints Commission? 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Public Complaints Commission has been in existence 
for some 12 years.  It has built up a very fine record of 
outstanding work looking into complaints that are brought before 
it.  I do not see any reason why one should assume that the 
Public Complaints Commission will not do everything necessary to 
thoroughly investigate the matters that are brought before it at 
the request of the student protesters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The student protesters want to see the Public Complaints 
Commission look into this matter.  Why does the hon. member try 
to undermine the work of the commission before it even begins? 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is nice for the Acting Prime Minister to say we 
are trying to undermine the Public Complaints Commission. In 1989 
when the Public Complaints Commission wanted to investigate 
Norman Inkster's role in a budget leak, it was this government 
that went all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada to keep the 
Public Complaints Commission from doing its job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Canadian public be assured that this government will 
allow the Public Complaints Commission to investigate the role of 
the PMO in the APEC affair? 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the value of the hon. member's question is shown by his 
assertion that this government was in office in 1989.  It was 
not.  We would have liked to have been, but we were not. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
ask the acting Prime Minister this question.  In 1989 there was 
an attempt to interfere on the part of the government of the day 
and shut down the ability of the Public Complaints Commission to 
do its job.  As a matter of fact, their position was that Mr. 
Inkster was no longer an employee of the RCMP, which is the 
assertion that I was making yesterday.  This board can only look 
into the affairs of people who are employees or agents of the 
RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister give us the assurance today that the Prime 
Minister and the Prime Minister's office will—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member talks about the government of the day. 
It was not this government.  I do not think that one should 
attempt to hold us in any way responsible for the position taken 
at that time by another government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to say that we want to see the commission do its 
work in an active and thorough manner.  That is what the chair of 
the commission said when she announced the inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us see the commission start its work and get on with its 
work.  If after its report is out—

it is another non-answer day in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now clear that the real reason the chief actuary for the 
Canada Pension Plan was fired was because Bernard Dussault would 
not compromise his independence.  Finance officials told the 
chief actuary that he should not answer information requests from 
the official opposition or the government of Ontario because of 
their politically sensitive nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why were the finance officials trying to compromise the chief 
actuary's independence?  Is that not the reason he was fired?

official opposition and the Government of Ontario asked some 
questions.  The finance officials indicated that the questions 
should not be answered through the chief actuary.  Is that not 
really the real reason why this individual was fired?  Own up. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International

very simple.  I refer to the press release of the superintendent 
of financial institutions: “This has been an entirely internal 
personnel matter at OSFI, and the decision to terminate Mr. 
Dussault was taken within OSFI.  Any suggestion to the contrary 
has no foundation in fact”.  That is the fact.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
connection with the “peppergate” affair, the government 
repeatedly told us all week that the RCMP public complaints 
commission will have all the answers to the questions we have 
been asking since the beginning of this affair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is the case, how can the Deputy Prime Minister explain 
the remarks made by his colleague, the hon. member for Vancouver 
Quadra, who stated that the public complaints commission would 
not disclose all that took place at the APEC summit? 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will check to make sure the hon. member was not misquoted, but 
as far as we are concerned, the commission is in a position to 
conduct an in-depth investigation into these incidents, and we 
expect the hearings to start as soon as possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, what 
the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra said is that the mandate of 
the RCMP commission would be limited to determining whether RCMP 
actions were in accordance with the law and whether the nature 
of these actions was appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, will the government give us every assurance that this 
commission will be able to get to the bottom of the events in 
Vancouver, including the Prime Minister's involvement? 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member's question is purely speculative and hypothetical, 
since the Prime Minister has not been asked to appear before the 
commission. We already know, however, that two senior officials 
in the Prime Minister's office are prepared to testify: senior 
secretary Jean Pelletier and former director of operations Jean 
Carle. This goes to show how open we plan to be with the 
commission. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
December 1997, the auditor general wrote the following about the 
RCMP commission, and I quote “The Commission needs to 
significantly improve the way it carries out public hearings, 
both by prescribing clear and precise terms of reference for 
each hearing and by providing its members with training in 
conducting hearings”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the commission unable to clarify its terms of reference and 
to properly hold hearings, how can the minister say to us that 
he can give us all the details of the sombre events in 
Vancouver? 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when 
the public hearings were announced, the chair of the commission, 
Ms. Heafey, said, and I quote “The commission has received 42 
complaints concerning the incidents that occurred on the campus 
of UBC.  I think a public hearing is the best way to guarantee 
the public that these complaints will be thoroughly, fairly and 
impartially examined”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, let's get 
serious.  Even the present government in opposition had doubts 
about the credibility of the RCMP complaints commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1986, the current Minister of Canadian Heritage, who is 
sitting opposite, said that the government of the time 
appreciated the work of the commission because it would help it 
get out of trouble.

commission because it has been in trouble for a week now? 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
since 1986, the commission has had a record of fine work—for 
some 12 years.  Furthermore, the work of this commission, 
created by Parliament, is non partisan and at arm's length from 
the government.  The chair has assured the public that the 
commission is prepared to do this sort of work, and we should 
wait for the hearings.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the

protests at APEC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The correspondence between UBC and the PMO clearly documents the 
extent of his involvement.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when will the leader of the NDP withdraw and apologize 
for the statement she made in the House yesterday, which was 
totally incorrect, that Jean Carle had declared that he had 
destroyed documents?  That is not correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of asking her question the first thing she should have 
done was got to her feet and apologized if she had any respect 
for the traditions of this House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
quite clear they do not want to hear the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the UBC president wrote to the Prime Minister complaining 
about PMO decisions to unreasonably restrict protesters, she got 
a letter from Jean Carle, a PMO staffer, and a phone call from 
the PMO's closest adviser, none other than Eddie Goldenberg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When is the Prime Minister going to stop denying his role in 
this APEC fiasco? 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the top watchdog of the employment insurance fund sent 
an e-mail to all of his buddy actuarials around the country 
defending the former actuary of the Canada pension plan and 
calling for EI premiums to be reduced: “The simple way to return 
the UI surplus would be to just drop premiums which would help to 
offset the rising CPP costs”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the minister of HRD tell us today whether the government 
is planning to fire the top expert of the EI fund for telling the 
truth the way it fired his colleague for the Canada pension plan?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International

$3.30.  We capped them at $3.07.  Since then we have had four 
consecutive reductions in the EI premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last budget they went from $2.90 down to $2.70. This 
represented a $1.4 billion decrease in EI premiums. We have had 
additional tax decreases.  In the last budget we began the

</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister has made it clear that he wants to spend 
the surplus EI fund.  There is absolutely no question about it. 
He wants new funding for new projects for the Liberal government

Will the government give those dollars back to the employees or 
is he going to fire the person who suggested that they go back to

all week long the finance minister has pompously claimed that he 
does not politically interfere in the work of the chief actuary 
of the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth of the matter is there was major political 
interference.  A special committee was established to deny 
requests for information if thought to be politically sensitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the finance minister allow his department to establish a 
special committee to gag the chief actuary?  Mr. Dussault 
objected to this political interference.  Is this not the real 
reason why he was fired?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International

superintendent of financial institutions has made it very clear 
that this was a difference of management styles within his own 
department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If what the hon. member is saying is that individual members in

like to complete your response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, just as I accede to your 
jurisdiction in the Chamber, this is what happened in this

supposed to be independent.  Finance officials wanted him to 
compromise that independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask again, and this time we would really like the answer, 
which has nothing to do with management styles, isn't the real

institutions: “Mr. Bernard Dussault at OSFI has been terminated. 
This action follows a long period of continued differences 
between Mr. Dussault and OSFI management.  These differences have 
been over issues of management style and do not in any way touch 
on the professional work of Mr. Dussault or his staff on any 
actuarial projections or opinions.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>SPECIAL IMPORT MEASURES ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK159">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-35, an 
act to amend the Special Import Measures Act and the Canadian 
International Trade Tribunal Act, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK160"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise to speak on behalf of the NDP with respect 
to Bill C-35, an act to amend the Special Import Measures Act, 
SIMA, and the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act, which is 
sometimes referred to as the CITTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position is one of opposition to this bill.  We support the 
bill insofar as it improves and clarifies SIMA.  SIMA remains one 
of the few mechanisms left that can effectively regulate trade 
and protect Canadian industry and jobs in our ongoing trade wars 
with the United States and in the increasingly liberalized global 
trading environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly we do not have to be reminded this week of the fact 
that in spite of the free trade agreement, the promise of which 
was that we would not have trade wars with the United States any 
more, we continue to have such trade wars. This week we see the 
American governors in the northern states violating the rule of 
law, violating these trade agreements and making it difficult for 
Canadian grain and other Canadian agricultural products to make 
it into the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where we find the locus of our opposition to this bill is in the 
measure to adopt the lesser duty provision.  We feel that to 
adopt the lesser duty provision at this time of global 
instability would be to weaken SIMA as a protection from unfair 
trade. Since the U.S. has not implemented such provisions, 
incorporating them at this time puts us at a further disadvantage 
with our major trading partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again we see a pattern that emerges time and time again in 
Canadian trade law and in Canadian trade policies.  Whenever 
there is some liberalization to be done or some weakening of a 
nation-state's ability to protect itself, Canada is always first 
to do so.  Canada is always eager to play the game, so eager that 
we leave ourselves vulnerable to other nations, in particular to 
the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how many times we have to learn this lesson.  How 
many times do we have to leave ourselves vulnerable to the fact 
that whenever the United States feels like it and when it suits 
its purposes, the United States has absolutely no respect for any 
agreement it enters into.  The United States is the last country 
to amend its laws in such a way as to conform to whatever other 
nations may be doing in order to liberalize trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again we have the government moving ahead of the United 
States.  The U.S. has not adopted this lesser duty provision, but 
no, we will be the eager ones.  We will be out there leading with 
our chin.  Go ahead, hit us again.  Teach us one more time 
because we Canadians are the unteachable when it comes to this 
kind of thing.  We love punishment.  We are the trade masochists 
of the world.  We just cannot get enough of being screwed around 
by other countries and being the first to hail it as some kind of 
testimony to our free trading spirit.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well this is a free trading spirit that the NDP has been 
critical of from the very beginning.  We are not against fair 
trade.  We are not against trade agreements that incorporate into 
them real, meaningful and enforceable protection for workers, for 
labour standards, for environmental regulations and for the 
continuing ability of governments to act in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we are against the kind of trade agreements and trade 
policies that this government has adopted over the years, 
particularly since 1993 when this Liberal government after its 
election in 1993 signed on to NAFTA, after it campaigned against 
the free trade agreement in 1988.  We have now seen the Liberal 
government become the most uncritical, simplistic, check your 
brains at the door cheerleaders for free trade agreements all 
over the world, whether it is signing on to NAFTA, the 
Canada-Chile free trade agreement, free trade with the Americas, 
the multilateral agreement on investment, or the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have become totally uncritical.  It is one thing to 
plead certain kinds of arguments but they do not even do that. 
They have just become completely uncritical.  They have become 
evangelists for the very thing that they deplored when they were 
in opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians have a right to feel utterly betrayed.  With 
respect to certain other parties, at least they have been much 
more upfront about their approach to these kinds of issues.  But 
not the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This certainly gives me an opportunity, in the context of 
debating a trade bill, to say that not only are we opposed to 
this bill, Bill C-35, we are opposed to the entire approach that 
the Liberal government has pursued with respect to trade. The 
most recent of course has been its pursuit of a multilateral 
agreement on investment which would include the investor state 
dispute settlement process.  This summer it was revealed to us 
just how inadequate it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the minister of trade a question in the House the other 
day referring to the fact that Ethyl Corporation had sued the 
Liberal government pursuant to chapter 11 of NAFTA in respect to 
the government's ban on MMT, a gasoline additive, and that the 
government had backed down from its position on MMT and not 
allowed that suit to be carried forward under NAFTA.  It was thus 
admitting, from our point of view, that it is not able under 
NAFTA to enact environmental legislation that particular 
corporations do not like, in this case Ethyl Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our view, the reason the government did not allow that case 
to go forward was because it did not want the fundamental flaw of 
NAFTA to be exposed.  Instead, it withdrew and made a settlement 
out of court with Ethyl for $13 million and hoped that maybe no 
one would notice.  The government tried to attribute its backing 
away from that to a dispute having to do with the internal trade 
agreement among the provinces.  Well that just will not wash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government was trying to do was to avoid revealing the 
flaw that is in NAFTA and the flaw that it wants to replicate 
over and over again, 29 times at the OECD if we were to get an 
MAI that included that same investor state dispute settlement 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I asked the minister that question in the House the other 
day, he got up and either because he does not understand NAFTA or 
he was trying to avoid the question, he said “Oh well this never 
even went to a NAFTA panel”.  I never said it went to a NAFTA 
panel.  I said it went to the investor state dispute settlement 
process.  Those are the words I used in the question.  Does the 
minister not even know about the investor state dispute 
settlement process?  Is he that stupid or was he trying to avoid 
the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that we have seen how insidious this 
investor state dispute settlement process is.  And this is a 
government that wants to replicate that at the OECD and in the 
MAI and presumably some day at the WTO in the form of a global 
agreement on investment that would enshrine this investor state 
dispute settlement process that gives corporations the status of 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to NAFTA, prior to the trade agreement that the Liberals 
betrayed their word on, the only way that trade dispute 
settlements could be dealt with was if the governments of 
particular countries decided to bring a certain matter to the 
level of dispute settlement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now corporations can do that on their own, thanks to the NAFTA, 
and would be able to do so much more often and from many more 
vantage points if the MAI were to be implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's trade policy is fundamentally flawed.  It is 
playing into the hands of those who would like to see the role of 
parliaments, of governments, of nation states and of citizens 
further and further devalued.  It is playing into the hands of 
those who would like to see the power of the multinational 
corporations increased beyond what it is already, and it is 
already at an unacceptable level.  The government does this all 
in the context of a trade policy which completely ignores human 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think I would have anticipated that I might be able to 
say this, but the Liberal government has made the Conservative 
government which preceded it look good on human rights.  The one 
place where that government was good on human rights, and I am 
willing to admit this, was with respect to fighting apartheid. 
Prime Minister Mulroney has rightly been given credit for the 
role that he played in that, along with other prime ministers 
going back to John Diefenbaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government, and not just in respect of APEC and the 
disgraceful events that took place there, in which we have every 
reason to believe that the Prime Minister and his staff were 
directly involved, has adopted a trade policy going right back to 
1993 which has basically said “Money first.  Exports first. 
Opportunities to invest in other countries first, regardless of 
what may be going on in that other country”.  In doing so it has 
not been reflecting the values of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of it being true, as the Liberals argue, that if we 
trade with these people they will become more like us, it seems 
that we are becoming more like them.  This is a legitimate 
concern, not just in the context of Canada, but in the context of 
globalization and the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once everybody gets into the WTO the democracies will be a 
minority at the table, in spite of the growth of democracy that 
we have seen in the world in recent years.  It is not too hard to 
imagine all these non-democratic delegations and leaders saying 
to the leaders of the democracies “Why do you put up with all of 
this?  Why do you allow things like elections and the wishes of 
the people and the well-being of your citizenry to get in the way 
of these agreements?  What is with you guys?  Be like us.  We do 
what we want to do, when we want to do it and to whom we want to 
do it.  We do so with the approval and the support of the global 
corporate sector because they love to take advantage of our weak 
labour laws.  They love to take advantage of our lack of 
environmental regulations.  They like to take advantage of our 
low taxes because we do not like to use public money to pay for 
health care and things like that.  They like to take advantage of 
all those things.  Why do you guys not do that?  Why do you not 
get with it?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact we have been getting with it.  We have been slowly, as a 
country, conforming to the model that the multinational corporate 
sector would like all countries to conform to:  a country in 
which there are lower and lower corporate taxes; a country in 
which there is a smaller and smaller public sector; a country in 
which more and more of what used to be done by the public sector 
is privatized; a country in which more and more workers who used 
to be covered by unemployment insurance are not covered by 
unemployment insurance.  The list goes on of the ways in which, 
since the adoption of the free trade agreement in 1988, we have 
slowly but surely begun to conform to this model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, that has happened with the collaboration of 
almost all the political parties and political traditions in this 
country, with the exception of the NDP.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this particularly to my colleagues in the Bloc who 
sometimes fancy themselves as social democrats.  They, more than 
anyone else, with the exception of the NDP, who think of 
themselves as social democrats, should have been on their toes as 
to what the effect these agreements would have, not just on 
Canada but on the ability of the government of Quebec, or any 
other government for that matter, to act in the interests of its 
own citizenry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to macro trade policy and with respect to Bill 
C-35, I thought I would put those few thoughts on the record. 
<P><A NAME="LINK161"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is rather enjoyable that I rise to speak to Bill C-35, an act to 
amend the Special Import Measures Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member of the New Democratic Party indicated, major 
changes have taken place in international trade since the Special 
Import Measures Act, SIMA, was passed in 1984.  The Canada-U.S. 
free trade agreement, the NAFTA and the WTO agreements are but a 
few of the major changes.  Quite frankly, it was the Progressive 
Conservative Party which recognized that globalization and global 
trade was absolutely necessary.  If Canada was to retain its high 
standard of living, it could only be done with rules of trade 
being set for our trading partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-35 is to reflect the changes that have 
occurred in international trade, especially relating to the 
anti-dumping measures which protect Canadian industries against 
potentially unfair practices by our trading partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 a special joint committee on the review of SIMA was 
struck between the Standing Committee on Finance and the Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade.  Both the 
Bloc and the Reform have written dissenting reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that the Reform Party's minority report states “We 
urged the government to resist the demand for getting tough 
measures with the Americans”.  I find that terribly ironic for 
the simple reason that we are now dealing with a very specific 
trade dispute in agriculture with the Americans.  That same 
party, which suggests it represents not only the west but 
agricultural producers, is saying not to go with Bill C-35 and, 
if we do, let us make sure it is not very tough on our American 
trading partners.  If this is true, the Reform Party must be 
suggesting that we do nothing about the situation affecting 
western Manitoba and South Dakota. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we would not have to get tough with Americans if this 
Liberal government had some influence with its American 
counterparts.  Trade is not a science, it is a relationship that 
has developed between our trading partners.  It makes sure that 
we have a good two-way line of communication.  It makes sure that 
we have relationships developed with those trading partners and 
the officials of those trading partners to recognize when there 
are problems and to resolve those problems without having to go 
to the NAFTA or the WTO.  That is obviously playing a bit of 
political hardball which, unfortunately, this government does not 
understand and does not know how to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ministry of Finance responded to the committee in April 
1997, accepting about 16 of the recommendations by proposing Bill 
C-35.  Changes to SIMA and the CITT act are intended to 
rationalize the investigative functions of Revenue Canada and the 
CITT to better reflect their respective areas of expertise.  That 
was a very good recommendation and it is a very good suggestion 
within the body of Bill C-35. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-35 will also allow expert witnesses to play a more 
effective role in tribunal inquiries.  Once again, that is a very 
positive way of developing trade defences within our systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-35 will also harmonize the way Revenue Canada and the 
CITT treat disclosure of confidential information. 
This is to enhance procedural fairness and transparency.  It is a 
very good proposal within Bill C-35.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As the fathers of the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement and the 
NAFTA, obviously our party is in agreement with the broad thrust 
of bringing SIMA up to date to reflect the current realities of 
international trade.  Since we know that dumping and 
subsidization are measures still used by foreign governments, we 
see that there is still a need for SIMA to protect Canadian 
industries from unfair practices by our trading partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have to ensure that laws such as SIMA are reviewed 
periodically to ensure they achieve the purposes for which they 
were passed.  Rapid developments in international trade can make 
these laws obsolete and counter-productive very quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically, we are happy that the government agreed to 
recommendation No. 2, which requests Revenue Canada to take 
concrete measures to ensure fair and equal access to the SIMA 
process by small and medium size Canadian producers.  This is 
extremely important as the majority of our economy and the jobs 
developed in this country are done by small and medium size 
businesses.  That will be implemented through improvements to 
administrative practices and I appreciate that in fact this bill 
speaks to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather interesting that we are discussing Bill C-35, 
changes to international trade and corrections to our defence 
mechanisms because today we are dealing with a very specific 
issue of trade in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agricultural products in western Canada amount to in excess of 
$10 billion per year for western Canadian producers and Canadian 
producers in general.  Currently we have a situation in western 
Canada where there are a number of northern states which are 
impacting Canadian trade going into the United States of America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very disappointed that the Reform Party in its dissenting 
report would say “Let us not get tough with our American trading 
partners; let us politically try to work this out”.  Obviously 
that has not happened because of the ineffective politics that 
have been practised by the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are currently non-tariff barriers that are being set up by 
some governors in the United States.  This can be dealt with in 
fashions other than going through the very lengthy process of 
the dispute mechanism, going to the WTO and the NAFTA, which the 
government has been waffling on for the last six months.  As of 
yesterday the minister responsible indicated, by patting himself 
on the back, that yes we have now filed with the WTO and the 
NAFTA.  The minister indicated that this would be a 10 to 15 day 
process.  That is not factual truth.  That simply gets the 
complaint to the table.  There is a long term process with this 
particular dispute mechanism and it could take months to resolve 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Western Canadian producers do not have months.  They have only 
days.  They sometimes have less than that in order to make sure 
their product gets to market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very disappointed that the rules which are already in place 
are not being upheld by our American trading partners.  But what 
it does speak of is the fact that we need rules.  It would be 
terrible if we did not have international trade rules which we 
could follow.  Sometimes people break rules.  Sometimes trading 
partners break rules, as has been identified over the last couple 
of months with the South Dakota situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need are rules.  Bill C-35 provides a substantial number 
of those rules on which we as Canadians can depend to protect not 
only our industries here in Canada, but our exports outside the 
boundaries of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to say that Canada has developed global trade. 
Unlike my colleague from the NDP who suggests that the NAFTA and 
the Canada-U.S. trade agreement were the worst things that ever 
happened, I would disagree with him.  Because we were not only a 
partner to those agreements but we were the authors of them, 
Canadians have a higher standard of living, with the exception of 
more taxes being paid to this particular government.  But I will 
not get into that particular area.

</I></B></P><P align=left>All of the dollars that are being generated seem to find 
themselves in the coffers of the federal government, which is not 
the best place to have them, but that is a debate for another 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 32 million to 35 million Canadians and we require 
international trading partners in order to sell what we produce 
outside our domestic marketplace.  There is no question that if 
it was not for the international marketplace we would not have 
what we have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if we are to open up the international marketplace 
there must be rules to that trade.  The rules to the trade must 
be very specific.  We have done a very good job with the NAFTA, 
the Canada-U.S. agreements and the WTO of setting the rules so 
that Canada will be the benefactor.  We have done it very well. 
I am very pleased to say that happened, in most cases, because of 
the previous Progressive Conservative government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must provide its business community with the tools it 
needs to face international competition.  Most important, our 
ultimate efforts should support the efforts to move forward, 
eventually making such trade remedy unnecessary.  It would be 
very nice if everybody followed the rules.  Ultimately, 
hopefully, all will follow the rules and this act will not be 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to continue trade negotiations with our partners.  The 
South Dakota trade dispute is one recent example which clearly 
shows there is a need for more work to be done in our trade 
relationships.  In 1999, with the WTO negotiations, we will have 
a window of opportunity to achieve trade success.  If the 
government develops a comprehensive plan and does not leave 
things to the last minute, as it did with Kyoto, success can be 
achieved if there is the political will to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This party supports the amendments put forward in Bill C-35 to 
amend the Special Import Measures Act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK162"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
before I start I would like to say that I will be sharing my time 
with my colleague from Surrey Central. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today to speak to Bill C-35, the Special Import Measures 
Act.  This morning my colleague from Okanagan—Shuswap made an 
excellent eloquent speech and I wholeheartedly support what he 
said.  He brought up excellent points on international trade and 
very eloquently showed the shortcomings and the shortfalls of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada as a nation is a willing and active participant in the 
increasing globalization of the world's economy.  Canadians have 
the education, innovation and motivation to prosper in the global 
economy.  There are literally hundreds of thousands of successful 
stories of Canadian participation in the world economy, whether 
in business, communication, the arts, science or technology. 
Canadian companies have made their mark on the world stage not 
with production and subsidization, but with brains and hard work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Participation in international trade has provided many positive 
benefits for our country.  However, we must also be vigilant. 
Trade disputes will inevitably occur.  They may be over fish 
quotas, computer parts or National Hockey League teams. 
Therefore, it is our job as legislators to ensure that protection 
mechanisms are in place when they are needed and only when they 
are needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Special Import Measures Act is one such protection for 
Canadian industry that is adversely affected by product dumping 
or subsidies.  Again I repeat, this act is protection for 
Canadian industry that is adversely affected by product dumping 
or subsidies.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the Special Import Measures Act is the principle legal 
instrument which allows Canadian companies to request and get 
anti-dumping and countervailing duties against imported goods 
which are found to be sold at too low a price or whose production 
is subsidized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada and the Canadian International Trade Tribunal are 
responsible for administering the system while Revenue Canada is 
responsible for policy and legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process is technical in nature but is essential to determine 
if there is a threat of material injury to the domestic industry. 
If an investigation determines that an injury has occurred trade 
remedy actions could be applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actions will include eliminating the dumping of goods by foreign 
exporters by introducing a duty or in trade remedies against a 
foreign government for unfairly subsidizing a product or 
commodity. The injury investigation is clearly the most critical 
component of this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under existing international rules authorities must determine if 
dumping or subsidization of goods has caused damage to a domestic 
industry of the importing country before duties can be imposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is at the preliminary stage where the investigation is most 
important.  Careful consideration must be given to all parties 
involved.  Therefore the appropriate balance must be maintained 
between the right of the industry to seek trade remedy projection 
and the rights of those who may be affected by such measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This must include the effects that any anti-dumping measure 
could have on downstream processors and on consumers. At present 
considerations are given to downstream repercussions after a 
final determination of injury by the Canadian International Trade 
Tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example of a recent case involving Gerber baby 
food.  The residual effects of the trade tribunal's decisions 
were not considered and the public interest was not protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>U.S. baby food manufacturer Gerber Canada says it will have to 
abandon the Canadian market because of the ruling by the Canadian 
International Trade Tribunal that forced the company to increase 
the selling price of jars of baby food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ruling has sparked an outcry from various public interest 
groups and concerned parents across the country.  A 60% increase 
in Gerber prices has effectively eliminated Gerber from the 
Canadian market and created a de facto monopoly for Heinz, a 
company which already holds 80% of the market share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This threat of a monopoly by Heinz has attracted the attention 
of the Competition Bureau with the aim of reversing the decision 
of the trade tribunal.  Clearly the system is not perfect. Often 
we cannot predict all the consequences of a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is crucial that we structure the process to ensure 
that the interests of downstream producers and the public 
interest are examined before any decisions are made if the 
effects could greatly harm an industry and have a negative impact 
on the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is intrinsically tied to the world economy. Participation 
in NAFTA and WTO and numerous trade agreements between individual 
nations ensure Canadian companies have a place to sell their 
goods and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, foreign countries look to Canada as a potential 
market for their goods and services.  This is healthy competition 
but as long as the rules are fair for all competitors.  When the 
rules are broken legislation like Bill C-35 must be in place to 
offer remedy to those harmed by unfair trade practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the proposed changes to the Special Import Measures 
Act introduced in this bill, but with some reservations. 
I support that the existing legislation and the proposed 
amendments to this bill abide by agreements already in place with 
the World Trade Organization anti-dumping and countervailing duty 
agreement.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre—Rosedale, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I compliment the member on his thorough comments on the 
bill.  It reflects very much the constructive way in which the 
members from his party participated in the discussions which we 
had on this matter before the trade committee when these 
proposals were originally being considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member was not a member of that committee but he may recall 
that his party, as was pointed out by the member for 
Brandon—Souris when he spoke earlier this morning, filed a 
dissenting report to the committee's report with respect to the 
bill outlining the recommendations made to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Curiously enough, the Reform Party's recommendations drew to the 
attention of the committee and thus to the House, when it was 
filed here with the House, the fact that when dealing with the 
United States it is important that we deal with it in a calm, 
measured and appropriate way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the subcommittee dissent the Reform Party pointed out that 
getting tough with the Americans could be a strategic error.  Its 
report states: “And since we rely so much more on exports than 
do the Americans, the damage to the entire economy in such a 
process of escalating SIMA type trade disputes could damage 
seriously the entire Canadian economy. Thus getting tough with 
the Americans would be a mistake. Rather we should work through 
proper channels.  We share this opinion and urge the government 
to resist the demand for using tough measures with the 
Americans”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was good about that is good about the process where we are 
dealing with the Americans today over transborder transfer of 
grain and meat into the United States. It is exactly the same 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is suggesting we work through proper channels. 
We use our legal remedies. We are not going to sit and be shouted 
at and told we have do something dramatic or crazy. That was the 
position of the Reform Party in that.  I suggest it should be its 
position today. What does the member think of that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not think we can 
deny the fact that our economy is tied very heavily to the United 
States and Mexico with NAFTA. I do not think the Reform Party was 
off track when we said we need a balanced approach when dealing 
with one of our most important trading partners.  There is 
nothing wrong with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it has to be fair on both sides.  We are saying we 
should not be tough on the U.S.  We do not trust the Liberal 
government.  It can be tough on this and destroy the good 
relationships we have.  What we are asking for is a balanced 
approach, a balanced view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is most critical.  They are our important partners.  We 
have to recognize that.  This is where most of our trade is. 
Therefore I do not think there is anything wrong with the 
dissenting report. 
<P><A NAME="LINK164"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central once again to 
support the amendments to Bill C-35, the Liberal government's 
proposal to amend the Special Import Measures Act, SIMA, and the 
Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act, CITTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>SIMA legislation governs procedures under which two types of 
duties are imposed on imported goods, anti-dumping and 
countervailing duties. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under world trading rules, every country is permitted to impose 
these duties on imported goods in two cases, if these goods are 
being dumped into their own country, or if the production of 
these goods is being subsidized in the country of export. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we proceed further into the debate, I want to explain 
that dumping occurs when goods are sold to importers in Canada at 
prices that are less than their selling price in the exporter's 
domestic market or at unprofitable prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Countervailing duties are a tax put on imports to offset the 
subsidy used to produce the good in the exporting country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read to the House an example from my own constituency. 
Last month Bed-Roc Industries scored a victory against an 
American competitor who was dumping tiles in British Columbia and 
Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bed-Roc Industries has been manufacturing in my constituency of 
Surrey Central for the last 10 years and suffered material injury 
when Custom Building Products imported and underpriced its 
wonderboard tile, damaging Bed-Roc's business. Bed-Roc was forced 
to cut prices and lost sales to maintain market share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The American company Custom Canada was charged with weighted 
average margins of dumping at 36% and Revenue Canada imposed 
duties for five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If dumping had taken place on its part in the first year when it 
started, Bed-Roc would have been out of business.  While I 
congratulate the management of Bed-Roc, I shall say thanks to 
SIMA and CITTA and NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chapter 19 of NAFTA, which contains virtually all the provisions 
of the free trade agreement, addresses at length restrictive 
trade practices including anti-dumping measures and anti-subsidy 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>SIMA passed into law in early 1984.  Since then, to comply with 
the new international obligations, this House has passed many 
statutory amendments to SIMA, mainly with respect to the 
definition of a subsidy and the determination of injury and the 
matter of establishing dumping margins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1984 SIMA had not been reviewed to determine whether it 
continues to meet the expectations of the Canadian business 
community or whether it is consistent with the international 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons subcommittees that studied SIMA recommended 
16 improvements and 64 technical amendments and corrections that 
we are debating in this bill today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have mentioned all this because the bill is fairly complex. 
Since time will not permit extensive debate on this issue, I will 
summarize the overall assessment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must provide the Canadian business community with the 
tools it needs to face international competition. To cope with 
dumping and subsidizing, SIMA and CITTA are essential 
instruments. Passage of the proposed amendments will make these 
tools really effective. Globalization and the nature of the 
complexities of international trade will force further reviews in 
the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition is satisfied with the proposed changes 
but would like to see the assessment of public interest brought 
in earlier in the process.  That is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any negative impact than an anti-dumping duty would have on 
downstream processors or on consumers is not considered until 
after an assessment has been rendered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A final determination of injury by the CITT and downstream 
repercussion of injury should be considered much earlier. For 
example, in the famous case of U.S. baby food manufacturer 
Gerber, it was charged with dumping baby food in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The resulting 60% increase in Gerber prices for the next five 
years has eliminated Gerber Canada Inc. from the Canadian market 
and caused the loss of all its customers to it almost sole rival 
H. J. Heinz Canada Ltd.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Heinz already had 80% of a $70 million a year market share and 
now enjoys almost a monopoly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision sparked an outcry from Canadian public interest 
groups, including the Canadian Pediatric Society and the College 
of Physicians and Surgeons.  If public interest had been 
considered prior to the duties being rendered, the parents who 
had been feeding their babies with the Gerber brand and who were 
satisfied with the suitability and taste of the food and found no 
allergic reaction would not have suffered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the consumers buying Gerber were not considered and 
they suffered injuries, even though the duty was imposed to 
protect them on the other hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In talking about countervailing duties, there is another side to 
the story.  The economy of British Columbia is in or near a 
recession.  The British Columbian government has imposed a 70% 
stumpage fee on softwood lumber.  The government has now created 
such a bureaucratic situation that the lumber industry is in 
trouble.  If the government reduces the stumpage fee, the 
Americans on the other side will think we are giving subsidies to 
the industry.  This will cause a problem because the rules and 
regulations are not laid out clearly. If the stumpage fee is 
reduced our industry suffers and if it is increased our industry 
also suffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian businesses and consumers are supportive of the measures 
we have to ensure that in the Canadian marketplace we have a 
level playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our federal government can and does take measures to ensure that 
the competition in our marketplace is conducted in a fair manner. 
However, there are other examples. In the salmon fishery, the 
agricultural industry and with dairy products the rules are not 
clearly laid on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Special Import Measures Act ensures fairness.  So far the 
Liberal government has acted like a blood sucking parasite on the 
thin skin of small and medium size businesses in our country. We 
just saw the largest tax hike in Canadian history, a 73% increase 
in CPP premiums.  Can anyone believe this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About 90% of jobs in this country are created by small 
businesses.  The government has to have a fair attitude and a 
fair marketing environment for our businesses to grow so they can 
create the jobs we need.  It is a good thing our Canadian firms 
have the means to lodge complaints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support a comprehensive effort to realign Canada's economic 
policies to be consistent with our international trade 
requirements.  As the official opposition, we can support this 
bill if it is amended.  We ask for one amendment only.  As the 
official opposition's international trade critic, the hon. member 
for Peace River, has said, we are satisfied with what the bill 
will accomplish but if we go one step further we on this side of 
the House will support, with amendment, the effort that Bill C-35 
represents in terms of meeting the expectations of Canadian 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are offering is an opportunity for the government to 
consider what we are asking for and we are looking forward to its 
co-operation at the committee stage so that this bill can be 
supported by the official opposition.  It is up to the Liberals. 
Our demand for a simple amendment along the lines that I have 
described is not unreasonable.  We shall see if the Liberals are 
willing to accommodate us so that we can contribute the best 
intentions to strongly support our small and medium size 
businesses.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As we talk about the Canada pension plan, we are involved with 
short term planning with the determination that there will not be 
long term planning.  We can understand why that is.  The 
government is in such a financial mess that it cannot look 
farther down the road than perhaps two or three years so we are 
stuck with a mess, planning from day to day how we might get out 
of that mess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the problems with the medical plan in Canada, largely as 
a result of not thinking and planning and preparing as we go down 
the way, thinking into the future.  We see this in the trade, as 
the hon. member talks about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Countries like China which have come out of terrible situations 
with large populations and an economy that was doing nothing for 
them have been able to plan, to put money in the bank, have trade 
surpluses and provide for the long term future for their 
citizens. It should be possible for a country such as Canada with 
the wealth of resources that we have had and have squandered to 
be able to do some long term planning as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commodities, the agricultural products, the mining, the 
petroleum, the wood, the forests have kept us in the secure 
position we have had up to the point we are at.  These have been 
our treasures, but these are no longer going to carry the weight 
for us in this modern technological age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am dismayed that there is no long term plan for the future of 
Canada.  We are going day to day and year to year.  I believe the 
government has a serious responsibility to begin planning in a 
way that protects the future of our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us are here for the benefit of our grandchildren, and 
yet we see such a small and limited future for our grandchildren 
in the scope of planning as it exists today.  I not only call on 
the government to begin thinking things through for the long term 
and not for the present day, but I also want to ask my colleague 
if in his estimation these changes that are being instituted are 
going to serve us well into the future, or is this just an 
immediate short term plan for the shortcomings of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is right when he talks about the mess the government has 
created. The other day we were debating the gun legislation.  The 
government is always focusing on the wrong thing.  It does not 
focus on the people who are killing people, it focuses on the 
people who are shooting ducks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is the APEC scandal about which we were talking 
in the House.  The government, the Prime Minister and the 
bureaucracies are focusing on the rights of brutal dictators and 
not on the rights of peaceful protesters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of examples where the government has focused 
wrongly, but in this case there are many examples, with 
globalization and the complexities of international trade, that 
things are changing in the world.  It is a very dynamic field we 
are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past there were some improvements needed, some where the 
government failed to address the issue at the time, some because 
of the change in the overall global business environment.  These 
changes were to be brought in, which they have been.  I am 
expecting the government to listen to the amendments by the 
official opposition this time so that we can make it effective.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak on this today.  I would 
like to say, as my other colleagues have said before me today, 
that the basic principle of the bill we do support. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain measures obviously have to be put into place.  The 
clearer it is and the more explicit it is, the better that bill 
will be.  It never hurts to reiterate to the government the one 
proviso which we have said at considerable length today to ensure 
that it understands exactly where our level of support is coming 
from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first came to Ottawa I said that I was not here to oppose 
for opposition sake.  I do not care about the statistics or how 
many we support, how many we reject, whether we support a 
government that we would ultimately like to replace.  If it 
writes good legislation I will be the first to congratulate it. 
If it writes legislation that I think has some merit but that 
could be made better, rather than criticize we will try to show 
alternatives to amend it so that the bill which is possibly 
supportable could be made better.  It could be something that we 
maybe are having a little trouble supporting which could be made 
into something which we could support.  It would still be its 
legislation.  It behoves the government to listen and carefully 
consider the amendments put in by the official opposition or 
another opposition parties.  The bottom line is to get good 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief thing we have asked for in this legislation is a 
measure that will take into consideration the downstream impact 
of what this bill might put into place. Something that we 
consider will show how it is going impact on industries in Canada 
and whether it is going to create a problem for some of those 
industries, and how is it going to impact on the consumer.  It 
may be extremely well intentioned to put some countervailing 
duties or tariffs in place in terms of the fairness of the 
concept of it because it thinks that, in the case of the Gerber 
baby situation, it needs to be dealt with.  It is irresponsible 
to put something like that into place before considering the 
impact on consumers.  That is a glowing example for the 
government to look at.  There are a lot of other examples out 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be relatively simple for the government to move an 
amendment or to accept our amendment to ensure that these 
concerns are dealt with.  I believe that all reasonable people, 
regardless of party, who look at this and give open minded 
consideration to our proposed amendments in this area will see 
the merit of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to deal with one other aspect of this.  We talk 
about downstream benefit, impact on people and other 
considerations with this legislation.  We also have to look at 
and balance the other side of this.  This is dealing with import, 
the Special Measures Import Act.  What about export? Whenever we 
start putting into place regulations dealing with how we are 
going to treat imported goods from other countries, we cannot do 
that unless we take a serious look at problems, regulations 
needed or regulations already in place that are oppressive when 
dealing with our exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the nature of my resource based riding, its proximity 
to the U.S. border and its absence of good transportation 
networks to other Canadian markets, the one I am most concerned 
about is the softwood lumber industry.  Prior to free trade and 
under free trade we have had one problem after another with 
exports of softwood lumber to the United States.  All kinds of 
outrageous claims have been made by the American administration. 
It claims we had subsidized our forest industry.  This is ironic 
as right now British Columbia, with our NDP government, has 
placed the cost of producing B.C. lumber among the highest in 
North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of that we still manage to stay competitive but the 
softwood lumber deal is killing us.  Every time the United 
States' lobby managed to get some kind of countervailing tariff 
in place against softwood lumber we appealed it through the 
process and we won.  We no sooner win then it comes out with 
another one in a different area for softwood lumber.  We would 
fight that one and we would win.  Still the threats kept coming. 
I will not say in its wisdom but finally the government, the 
bureaucratic system, decided that we should do something 
different. 
It was proposed to the government that we should go into the 
softwood lumber quota system.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had a lot of problems with the softwood lumber quota with 
a variety of different companies in my riding.  I have gone to 
the softwood lumber division of foreign affairs.  I have a pretty 
good sense of how this whole thing has come into play and how it 
works.  Those people have been quite candid with me and I 
appreciate that because they have to work with what they are 
given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the quota system came in they did not have the slightest 
idea how it was going to work.  Companies in my riding were told 
“we have no idea what your quota is going to be, just keep on 
shipping and keep track of everything, we will sort it out 
somewhere down the road and we will figure out how it is going to 
work”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell members how it works, terribly.  One company in my 
riding basically shut down.  People were shipping and using their 
number and softwood lumber could not even track it properly.  We 
played the greatest numbers game for a year and a half.  They 
operated from hand to mouth never knowing from one day to the 
next or one week or one month whether they were going to be able 
to sell anything they manufactured, whether they should even try 
to buy timber in order to turn into lumber because everything has 
to be done ahead.  The last thing you need is an inventory of 
logs if you cannot cut it into something you can sell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, it does you absolutely no good to win on the 
softwood lumber quota war and find out you do have quota but you 
do not have any logs because you did not dare put in the kind of 
financial outlay that was necessary in order to have the 
inventory when you did get it sorted out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We no sooner got sorted out with one company when another one, 
the biggest timber supplier and manufacturer in my riding, was 
told on each of three successive years that the quota it has will 
be held and it will not get any further cutbacks, and in each 
successive year it gets more cutbacks.  It is a big operation 
with three locations in my riding.  It has been told that the 
latest cutback that it was promised in the previous year would 
not happen is equivalent to the amount of output from its main 
centre operating in the riding.  That means the company would 
shut down the entire operation in one city in my riding.  It 
affects over 100 people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the kind of balance we need.  When we start talking 
about import acts we had better take a very serious look at our 
export requirements as well because they go hand in hand. I am 
not pointing fingers at any party but in the past Canada through 
successive governments and bureaucrats negotiates with the United 
States on bended knees.  That is not a Clinton joke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to start dealing with a little more strength. We have to 
start saying that there is a quid pro quo.  If you start doing 
unreasonable things with us we are going to make sure our act 
allows us to balance that out.  We cannot have deals where maybe 
it is good for one area or region of a country and we say we will 
let this in because it is good but we do not care what is 
happening in another part of the country.  Or we will balance it 
out by letting something good happen in that part of the country 
but which is maybe not good for the first region. That is not the 
way we should be working in this country.  There should be an 
open fairness.  The quote system does not provide that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way we have dealt with the United States prior to the 
softwood lumber quota does not do that.  I do not see how we can 
enter into a new act to lay out the rules so that all the people 
who export into Canada know exactly what the rules are and those 
rules are perfectly fair.  That is very utopian.  Why are we 
providing other countries like the United States with a clear set 
of rules saying what we will do and how it will work?  Then they 
can look at that and say now they know how to work the system but 
they also still get to turn the screws whenever they do not think 
something is quite right in coming into their country exported 
from Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have to come up with some way of saying this is what 
we are proposing to do but we have some problems with what you 
are doing to us and we have to resolve those first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember going down to the United States as part of the 
Standing Committee on Transport a few years ago.  One of the 
things we were talking about was the St. Lawrence navigation 
system into the great lakes, the locks, where we have this 
incredibly unbalanced system.  We end up paying the majority of 
the cost of operating the lock system into the great lakes even 
though the American shipping system gets 65% of the economic 
benefit of making use of it.  I believe that what is fair is we 
either at least split it or better still that we pay for it based 
on the economic advantage gained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a meeting with some of the American big boys in 
Washington, D.C. and their reaction was that is the way it has 
always been and that is the way it is going to be. What are you 
going to do about it, close it down? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think if somebody puts that type of bluff on the table we have 
to call them.  When I was having that conversation I was getting 
more and more irritated talking to this American good old boy. My 
response to him when he put that idiotic question to me was 
obviously we do not want to shut down the navigation system of 
the great lakes but obviously you do not want it shut down either 
because you are getting more advantage out of it than we are.  If 
you leave us no other alternative I guess we are going to have to 
look at that, and I walked away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we need to deal fairly with these other countries but we 
need to deal with a little more strength.  Internationally 
Canadians are known as those nice people who never raise their 
voice, those nice people who never argue, those nice people who 
when you hit them turn around so you can get a good shot at the 
other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am tired of that. So are my constituents and so are the 
employers in my riding who are hurt by some of these acts that we 
come out with without thinking of the full ramifications, and 
employees especially, the everyday constituents in my riding who 
are impacted by these things, whether import or export. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another part of my riding I have a tremendous agricultural 
area, the south Okanagan, and every year they fear the dumping of 
the American apple crop into the south end of my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we need things that lay out clear rules we are going to 
follow in terms of imports but by God we had better have some 
very clear rules that go hand in hand with these things dealing 
with our exports as well.  I do not think we can come in and put 
this all in place and say there, see how nice we are, don't you 
want to follow our example. They will say no because they never 
have in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we had better take a good hard look at this before we 
finalize it. By all means let us move on but let us do it 
cautiously.  Let us put the amendments that have been talked 
about today in place with proper consideration for people who are 
going to be impacted by anything we do as a result of this act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then let us stop before we make that final passage and start 
dealing with the export side of it as well because any time we 
are laying out all our cards and being incredibly fair to our 
competitors without the competitors showing some evidence of 
fairness and laying their cards out as well, we are dealing with 
a blind hand and, as any poker player knows, we will lose every 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust the Liberals will consider what is being said not to 
oppose them and not to run them down.  It is being said very 
seriously to ensure the legislation passed in this House, not the 
Liberal legislation, the legislation passed collectively in this 
House, is good legislation and that everybody who participated in 
it can feel satisfied.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my hon. colleague is touching on something peripherally 
which has bothered me for a long time.  I would like to ask him 
about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bearing in mind that we are the largest trading partner of the 
U.S. both ways, import and export, I would expect in the normal 
course of business affairs that we should have some influence 
down there but we do not seem to have much.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason is that we are so eager to play by the rules, to lie 
down and let people walk all over us.  Sure, we have these trade 
disputes and we win almost every time but the hearings go on and 
on and on.  We will win a dispute but they come back at us 
immediately on the same matter and do it all over again. In the 
meantime producers, employers and employees in this country are 
being crucified because we do not as a nation have the huge 
economic base to fall back on that the United States does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a situation right now in my riding and in neighbouring 
ridings.  Exporters of agricultural products are being subjected 
to what can only be described as harassment by the governments of 
the border states.  They are using state troopers to stop goods 
which have legally entered into the United States at the border 
crossings. We have complained.  We will go to NAFTA and the WTO. 
This will take weeks and months before it is resolved.  I think 
we will win but in the meantime there are people who are really 
hurting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if my colleague would give his opinion on my suggestion 
that when we are bitten we should bite back. Every week thousands 
of tonnes of American beef cross the border coming north into 
Ontario and Quebec.  Why do we not find a pretext similar to the 
ones that are being used by the governors of North Dakota and 
Montana and say “Sorry fellows, but the packages are the wrong 
colour.  We are not going to let that garbage into the country 
until you straighten up your act”.  I think we would find that 
the border problems on the other side of the country would very 
quickly be adjusted.  How does my colleague feel about that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a very good example by 
my colleague and I think it is one we do need to deal with.  The 
one thing I would caution when we do this is not to be subtle. 
Subtlety is a hallmark of Canadians.  We like to tiptoe around 
and are always afraid we will offend somebody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The example he gave is excellent.  But if we do that, make sure 
people understand exactly why we are doing it. Do not just simply 
do it and let them put two and two together and maybe come up 
with what we are up to.  Make it absolutely clear. Do this to us 
and here are the consequences.  We talk about that in the 
criminal justice system.  We talk about it with almost every 
example one can think of. It is consequence of action. Whenever 
something is done there will be a consequence for what is done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about it in our own lives.  Let us start talking about 
it with the Americans as well.  Let us say “Here is what we 
think is fair.  Here is what we are prepared to do.  But if you 
do not want to play by this rule, if you do not want to be fair, 
above board and completely open, then know now that if you start 
messing with us, we will retaliate.  We will not get carried away 
in doing it.  We will do it in the best Canadian tradition to try 
to do it in balance with what you do”.  But make sure they know 
we are going to do it.  If we lay that out, do not back down when 
the time comes.  Make sure they understand when they take an 
action, if it is an unfair action, there will be a consequence 
and we will indeed follow through on it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to congratulate and thank my hon. colleague for 
the speech he has given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a nation we have been facing serious economic difficulties 
for a long time.  It is interesting to hear how economic leaders 
in other parts of the country talk about Canada.  When they are 
asked what is wrong with our economic system in their eyes, they 
point to things that we talk about consistently in this place. 
They say first of all “Your debt is way too high”.  Second they 
say “Your taxes are way too high”.  Third they say “You have 
not had a plan for 25 years.  You do not know where you are 
going”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listen to my colleague talk about the softwood agreement, the 
quota system, a system that has affected mills in my 
constituency, particularly the newer mills but now even the large 
traditional mills are complaining about the difficulties of this 
agreement. It strikes me that here we are again in a situation. 
Two years ago when we were talking about this quota agreement and 
I was raising objections, I was being told this is the answer to 
our problem.  Clearly this is a matter where long term planning 
was not brought into effect. Less than two years after this 
agreement has come into force, our mills are in trouble with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the issue of long term planning that I am raising again, 
an issue that affects us in every sphere of this government's 
jurisdiction and rule.  Whether it is health care, whether it is 
our pensions, whether it is our trade policies and trade 
agreements, we lack a vision of the future which takes into 
account the needs of our children and our grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty now is that we have come to a point in the 
technological advance of the world where simply having forests 
that have not been harvested, mines that have not been opened up, 
oil wells that have not been drilled is not enough. We have to 
have a plan on the table.  We have to have a future in mind.  And 
we have to be able to direct our people and our companies in a 
way that they can take advantage of the opportunities that lead 
to that future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my hon. colleague see in this legislation the long term 
planning that is necessary to rationalize the agreements that 
they affect, or are we simply stumbling along from day to day as 
we have so frequently in the past?  Is this just another example 
of that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Mr. Speaker, indeed as my colleague implied 
in asking his question, there are serious implications in the 
lack of long term planning and long term vision in this 
particular bill.  As has been addressed on a number of occasions 
today during the debate, there is not proper consideration for 
the impact.  We look at the short term closely in impact on this 
but we do not look at the long term in terms of how it is going 
to affect other manufacturers, employers and producers in this 
country, how it is going to affect and impact on the consumer in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I cannot help but draw the comparison between this and 
the softwood lumber quota system.  When we talk in terms of a 
long term plan, I have spent a lot of time on this and in my 
opinion there was not even a short term plan in terms of the 
softwood lumber quota. When it came in it was as if the Americans 
said “Here is your overall quota.  Here is your total quota that 
we will allow to come into the United States under no fee, then 
under the low fee base and then under the upper fee base”.  They 
did not have the slightest idea as to how they were going to 
implement that, how they were going to monitor and track it, how 
they were going to assign it out.  It was something that they 
made up as they went along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular bill is not quite that bad.  I think we can fix 
some of the things in it but the problem is we have to fix them 
before we pass the bill.  We cannot keep making things up as we 
go along, trying to determine whether or not we have done enough, 
or gee, we have problem, so let us put another little fix in 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the legislation is passed it becomes much more difficult 
and onerous to try to impact further changes down the road.  The 
government should go nice and slow, make sure that it makes the 
amendments that make sense according to what it has been hearing, 
make sure that it has considered the things that we have said. 
Also I would ask that the government take a very serious look at 
the balance I mentioned, the need to make sure that not only do 
we have our import house in order but also to make sure that 
exports are dealt with so that we have balance between what we 
take in and what we export out and the rules which both sides are 
going to play by.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent to proceed 
as outlined by the chief government whip? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK169"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for his remarks earlier 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I listened to the concerns of the hon. member regarding 
certain issues on this debate, the hon. member questioned the 
issue of our trading situation with the cross-border crisis with 
North Dakota and some of the other states in the United States in 
terms of stopping our trucking operations going across with 
agricultural products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, one of the hon. members said that we should be 
taking very strong, very tough action.  I sat on the SIMA 
committee in the past.  The dissenting report said that we were 
going too strong with SIMA, that we should not be taking the 
tough action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member explain to this House the differences in 
approaches by two different members in his party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Mr. Speaker, each of us deals with the 
problems that affect our own ridings.  Of course we all work in 
concert with one another in a co-operative method not only within 
our own caucus but with those from other parties as well. If 
there are problems for Canadians, I do not really care if they 
are represented by Reform, by Liberals or by whomever.  I do 
think we need to talk and work that out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of tough action, yes, we do need to take tough action 
but not knee-jerk tough action.  The tough action we need to take 
needs to be planned out.  It needs to be done in such a way that 
it leads to the kind of outcome we are looking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tough action is necessary for that but not just fast reaction to 
an individual instant.  If we look at the overall problems we 
have with trade in and out of our country, if we sit down and 
plan where we are going and then determine how we will get there, 
we will have better trade relations across the border.  I think 
things will certainly be much fairer for Canadian manufacturers 
and also for Canadian consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I

There will be no questions or comments to that member and of 
course the question can be put at the termination of that 
10 minute period.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on Bill C-35.  I would like to 
thank my colleagues from the government and all members in the 
House today who have allowed me to speak for 10 minutes on Bill 
C-35 which is the Special Import Measures Act. This is an 
important bill.  It goes into some extremely important issues 
that are affecting my constituents in British Columbia and are 
affecting Canadians across this land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia has been particularly hard hit by the economic 
downturn the whole country has seen. Some people point 
legitimately to the Asian flu and others point to the Russian 
meltdown. Although those have had a contributory effect, there is 
much we can do within our own house to rectify the situation at 
least in part.  I would ask the government to please look into 
this.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the government's credit, it has actually employed something 
from Industry Canada that has improved the Small Business Loans 
Act.  It is going to provide small businesses with an added 
amount of capital which will enable them to restructure and work 
on their businesses and become more competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems is that the private sector is finding it 
increasingly difficult to actually work in today's environment. 
I am going to illustrate some of these areas and try to develop 
some solutions that exist and which we can use in this House.  We 
can gather together with other Canadians and even our provincial 
counterparts to employ them in the policy area to help the 
private sector employ more Canadians and become more competitive 
in an economic environment which is becoming increasingly more 
global and more competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first area which I alluded to yesterday was our high 
taxation rates.  The high taxation rates today when we compare 
them to the situation down south are quite traumatic.  An 
American two-earner family will take home 44% more in their 
pockets than a Canadian two-earner family.  That is a significant 
difference.  Also, the top marginal tax brackets make it very 
difficult for business people to invest in their businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some very interesting work has been done on surtaxes.  If we 
look at the many surtaxes that now exist in our country, those 
surtaxes significantly compromise people to invest in companies, 
hire more people and invest in the future of the country.  It is 
estimated that a $1 extra surtax would actually diminish 
productivity by about $64.  The reason is that taxing more at the 
top end or adding more taxes on to anybody actually decreases the 
amount of investment that goes into the private sector.  The 
behaviour of individuals is such that they work less and because 
they work less, less money is paid in taxes to come back to the 
public coffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do we have a decrease in competitiveness by taxing 
more, we also have a decrease in the ability of people to work 
harder and a diminishment of money that comes into the public 
coffers.  What does that do to the most disadvantaged people in 
our country?  With less money coming into the public coffers, 
less money is available for our social programs, for health care, 
education, pensions and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Conservative regime, I believe it was in 1992 when Mr. 
Mulroney actually decreased taxes for a short period of time and 
there was an actual increase in the amount of money going into 
the public coffers.  This would have provided governments with 
more money for programs necessary to help the most 
underprivileged in our country, to help our health care system 
and to provide for the educational framework our young people 
desperately need to become employable in the future. After that 
the Conservative government then taxed more which actually 
resulted in a decrease in money going into the public coffers. 
This is very significant and something we cannot ignore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other added factor of increasing taxes is that it actually 
drives our best and brightest to south of the border and to other 
countries.  It also drives Canadian companies to other countries. 
We have had a massive brain drain.  In my profession among 
physicians, some of our best specialists, particularly our 
orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons have gone south of border, 
two-thirds of our neurosurgeons and one-third of our orthopaedic 
surgeons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to have a gap in specialists in nephrology dealing 
with people with kidney problems.  We are going to lose about 40 
people from this country over the next 10 years.  This is a 
significant problem given the fact that more and more people are 
actually going to need specialist care for renal problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cause of this is the high taxation rates and the dampening 
effect of the egregious rules and regulations that we have which 
prevent the private sector from being as aggressive as it can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that is killing our private sector, if we 
speak to the business community, is the corporate surtaxes, the 
surtaxes that occur in specific businesses.  There is also the 
capital gains tax which is preventing them from being able to 
sell their businesses and properties and reinvest that money in 
their own companies. 
That is why a lot of companies are holding onto their assets. 
The corporate tax rate is a huge disincentive.  If they sell 
their assets the capital gains will be so high they will incur a 
loss.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The status quo with high taxes, and specifically with the capital 
gains tax on corporations, causes an inertia within the system 
that prevents companies from generating the finances to reinvest 
within their own companies.  The government should carefully look 
at removing those taxes.  It would benefit the people who are 
most disadvantaged in our society.  If companies cannot hire, 
people will be unemployed.  That causes a greater demand on our 
social programs and also, from a societal perspective, greater 
social problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could also create strategic alliances.  The Canadian Export 
Development Corporation has been very much an innovator in 
developing ideas of strategic partnerships.  I implore the 
government and companies to look at strategic alliances where 
companies that have different areas of specialty can work 
together to further a particular product.  That situation can even 
occur across borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A natural alliance would be the United States.  There are 
companies in the U.S. and Canada that have specialties in certain 
areas.  If they were to form strategic partnerships they could be 
a very aggressive tool and an effective marketer of their 
particular business abroad.  Since we live in an era of 
globalization, that would make Canada a more effective competitor 
internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Years ago I tried to take all the best ideas I could find from 
Canadians across the country and put them on my website.  The 
private sector could then extract the information and use it to 
their advantage.  I know there are members of the House who will 
be working very hard to stimulate companies in their ridings to 
be more effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we support Bill C-35, there are some amendments that 
could be made.  Examples have been put forth by my colleagues 
with respect to baby food.  Heinz got a monopoly because the 
public interest was not taken into consideration.  Those things 
must be carefully looked at when dealing with international trade 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has to deal with decreasing taxes in an effective 
manner, looking at innovative ways in which it can provide a 
lower tax rate for people in the lowest socioeconomic area.  If 
these things can be done we will be able to provide a better 
state of affairs for Canadians across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can also increase the foreign ownership maximum 
on RRSPs from 20% to 30%.  With the lack of confidence that 
Canadians have in the CPP, it would be very important and useful 
for the government to give Canadians the option of helping 
themselves by enabling them to increase the foreign ownership 
content of their RRSPs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from May 5, 1998 consideration of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK174"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to 
respond to the motion of the hon. member for Vancouver East 
regarding the Canada student loans program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by assuring the hon. member and the House that the 
government is always very much aware of the needs and problems of 
young Canadians pursuing post-secondary education.  It is this 
very concern that prompted the government to enter into 
consultations with the public, the provinces and the territories 
on ways to improve the system of providing loans to Canadians 
students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, last February's budget incorporated many of the 
recommendations of the report of the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development, measures which ensure Canadians have 
access to post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that developments affecting the student loans 
program have rendered the motion under discussion largely 
irrelevant.  Let me illustrate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion calls first of all for the reversal of the 
privatization of the Canada student loans program.  But the 
Canada student loans program has not been privatized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to 1995 the program provided financial assistance to 
students in the form of 100% government guaranteed loans from 
private sector lenders.  Lenders financed and distributed the 
loans to students and were responsible for collection.  There was 
little incentive for the lenders to police the loans, so the 
federal government ended up holding more than $1 billion in 
unpaid loans for which it had reimbursed the lenders under the 
guarantee provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 new financing arrangements were introduced which 
enhanced lender accountability and improved client service.  But 
these arrangements do not by any means constitute privatization. 
Governments, not the lenders, continue to determine student aid 
policy and the nature of the Canada student loans program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new risk-shared financing agreement, government 
payments against loan guarantees will decline from $382 million 
in 1996-97 to $67 million in 2000-2001.  Abandoning these 
arrangements, which I assume is the intent of the hon. member's 
motion, would cost Canadian taxpayers a great deal of money. 
Government payments against loan guarantees would increase.  We 
would lose the benefits of sharing the risk with the lenders and 
the government would have to pay penalties for breaking lender 
agreements before their expiry in the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next, the motion calls for the government to reject proposals 
for income contingent loan repayment.  There is no difficulty 
here since the government has already rejected proposals for 
income contingent repayment.  Students, lenders, the provinces, 
the territories, education organizations and groups made it 
clear that they do not consider income contingent repayment a 
viable option.  The repayment schedule would be too long and 
accumulated interest payments would be too onerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario is the only province that has shown any interest in 
income contingent repayment.  But while the federal government 
worked closely with Ontario to analyse various models of such a 
system, the government has also respected the view of the 
remaining provinces, territories and stakeholders. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lenders declined Ontario's invitation to implement a provincial 
income contingent repayment scheme for 1999.  What the federal 
government has done, however, is incorporated income sensitivity 
into the new interest relief program and debt reduction measures 
announced in the federal budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion calls upon the government to implement a federal 
student grant program.  Once again the Government of Canada has 
already done that.  Canada study grants are available for the 
following students:  high need part-time students; students with 
a permanent disability; female doctoral students in certain 
fields of study and, as announced in the recent budget, students 
with dependants who can demonstrate a financial need.  Canada 
study grants, totalling $145 million, will be available in 
1998-99. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the $2.5 billion Canadian millennium scholarship 
fund will provide an average of $3,000 each year, to a maximum of 
$15,000, to more than 100,000 low and middle income students for 
the next 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That leaves us with the consideration of the motion's last 
recommendation, accessibility as a new standard for 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this point I should emphasize that accessibility has been a 
fundamental principle of the Canada student loans program since 
its inception in 1964.  Indeed, the government's ongoing 
commitment to the principle of accessibility was clearly 
demonstrated in the 1998 budget.  A key element of that budget 
was the Canadian opportunities strategy which will help ensure 
that Canadians continue to have affordable access to 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is working toward harmonization of Canada 
student loans with provincial student loans.  Accessibility is 
one of the key principles of a harmonized student loan regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the federal government's interest in post-secondary 
education is shared with the provinces and the territories, the 
government carries out continuous consultations with student 
groups, educators, lenders, provincial governments and the 
territories.  Further developments in financing and ensuring 
accessibility to post-secondary education will involve all of 
these groups, as they have in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is pursuing a course that is in the 
best interests of students across the country.  They are our 
future.  Considered in the light of the work that has already 
been done, we must conclude that the motion of the hon. member 
for Vancouver East is irrelevant. 
<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to commend my NDP colleague for precipitating the discussion 
we have before us today.  The issue of students struggling with 
their debt loads is very crucial and an issue of great interest 
to many across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree that governments need to help students financially, but 
what is the best way?  I think that would be the crux or the nub 
of the difference on all sides of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My main contention this afternoon in the matter of the student 
debt problem will be that since both students and society benefit 
from education, both should contribute financially.  We need a 
balance here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Students cannot be without benefits because in this era in which 
we live an education is the path to a good income.  On the other 
hand, society also benefits because in the economy in which we 
live Canada cannot prosper without an educated workforce.  Hence 
the balance and hence both should be contributing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this particular NDP motion before us puts too much onus on 
society, letting students off the hook, while the Liberals put 
too much onus on students, letting society off the hook and 
without responsibility in this matter.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This NDP motion does not take seriously enough student 
responsibility in this.  It puts too much emphasis on grants. 
Money does not grow on trees.  The taxpayer pocket is not a 
bottomless pit.  I also want to emphasize the fact that Reform 
does advocate interest free student loans.  That is what we mean 
in this income contingent loan plan and program.  I will explain 
more of that later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, the Liberals are not taking seriously enough 
society's responsibility for educating students.  I will describe 
for members the Liberal approach and its effect on students.  As 
we know, the Liberals have made some massive cuts in transfers to 
the provinces.  This has led to tremendous problems with student 
debt.  Rather than restore funding for post-secondary education, 
the Liberals have brought in a number of measures that merely 
attempt to patch-up the mess they have made of many students' 
financial situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They prefer to help students in debt by means of tax relief on 
the interest portion of payments, interest relief extended to 
graduates if they go to the next step and need more help.  Before 
we have any applause from the opposite side of the House, I want 
members to know that this is going downhill from here.  It is a 
downward spiral and we finally get to the bottom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess the Liberals next stop-gap measure from there would be 
to provide an extended repayment period for those who need it. If 
that does not help then an extended interest period for 
individuals who continue to face financial difficulty.  Then they 
come again with cap in hand, on bended knee if maybe to have a 
reduction in the loan principal for individuals who still face 
financial difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures hardly represent a bold initiative to address the 
problem of student debt levels.  They do nothing to prevent 
students from falling off the cliff of financial disaster.  They 
merely attempt to cushion the impact when they do fall to the 
bottom.  It would be like having a sign around a treacherous 
corner, a curve with a cliff with a steep drop-off.  Instead of 
having warning signs or doing what can be done to prevent falls 
off the cliff, they have ambulances at the bottom of the cliff. 
They are reactive measures rather than proactive measures that 
provide a genuine solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal approach to student loans makes the following 
situation possible.  I reiterate the example of a student who 
gets a low paying job.  Now he is attempting to make payments on 
his student loan.  The tax relief on the interest portion of his 
payments does not help because he does not get his refund until 
after tax time.  In the meantime he cannot make the payments.  So 
he applies for interest relief.  He jumps through that 
bureaucratic hoop to qualify.  If he is still in trouble he must 
make another appearance to beg to have that payment period 
extended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that does not solve the problem then he can apply for an 
extended interest relief period.  Once again he goes cap in hand, 
on bended knee humiliated to beg for assistance with his 
education.  If problems persist he might qualify for a reduction 
in the loan principal. It is exactly this kind of situation that 
is repeated time and again across our country with students in 
respect to debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reveals the inadequacy of the Liberal approach with regard 
to student debt.  It keeps students in debt and offers assistance 
only after things have gone wrong.  Instead of repairing the 
leaky boat of funding for post-secondary education, the Liberals 
have offered a hodgepodge of measures to help students after the 
Titanic is already going down and students are up to their neck 
in water.  At that point they come in with these supposed 
solutions.  Rather than trying to help students from the outset 
so they can avoid a financial crisis, the Liberals approach 
appears to be that of assisting students after they find 
themselves in the middle of the crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like a brick wall set up by the Liberals that students 
have been trying to jump over.  Far too many have been breaking 
bones on the wall, unable to jump high enough.  The Liberal 
response is to have some doctors on hand on this side of the wall 
as they bounce back bruised, bleeding and broken.  They have them 
there to treat the injured.  But the Liberals say that under no 
circumstances should that wall be lowered so as to reduce the 
risk of injury in the first place.  Students are left to continue 
worrying, anxious about the matter and damaged and hurt over the 
course of their lifetime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform believes that it is administratively inefficient to help 
students in stages like that.  On the other hand, Reform's across 
the board proposal of interest free loans is what students would 
prefer. 
I could liken the approach of the Liberals in the matter of 
student loans and the recent changes even to a patient screaming 
from pain there in the corridor of the hospital.  The doctor kind 
of saunters in and he gives a little pain killer, just enough to 
take the edge off but there is still a lot of discomfort.  But 
the patient at least is not yelling any more, at least for a 
while. Then the doctor waits until the patient is screaming again 
before administering a little more painkiller again to take the 
edge off.  But there is still lots of discomfort.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is simply the doctor never really relieves the pain, 
just as the Liberal approach never really addresses the problem 
of student debt.  It just catches them one by one trying to 
soften the impact, as they fall off the cliff and crash, rather 
than setting up a program that prevents them from crashing in the 
first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform's principles with respect to education are fairly clear. 
I cite principle number six from our blue book: “The people of 
Canada are this country's most valuable resources and that the 
nurturing and development of human knowledge, skills and 
relationships are keys to full participation in the knowledge 
based service economy of the 21st century”.  In other words, 
people are the resource.  People are what counts here.  They are 
the most valuable resource we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the Reform Party said on October 21, 1994 in 
Commons debate: “One of the few areas where Reform does not 
advocate any spending reduction is in the area of financial 
support for post-secondary education. Post-secondary education as 
an investment in Canada's future is so important that we are 
prepared to make massive spending reductions in other areas, some 
focused government spending in areas like health, education and 
the basic social safety net”. We are prepared to do that in 
order to make and maintain the current levels of funding for 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that of all the things the government does, of all the 
money it spends, its one true investment in the future is its 
investment in the education and training of the young generation 
of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform has a balanced approach where both students and society 
contribute with federally funded income contingent loans.  There 
has been misunderstanding about what Reform means by income 
contingent loans, so I will read our policy statement: “The 
Reform Party believes that the federal government should 
institute a federally funded income contingent loan plan that is 
as near to being interest free to students as possible”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear about several things.  First, in the Reform 
Party policy the banks would not be the lenders.  I think that 
should make my colleague from the NDP happy.  Rather than the 
loans being through the banks and therefore making money off our 
students, the loans would be federally funded.  In our plan the 
student would be lent money and asked simply to pay back the same 
amount without interest over time at a pace in keeping with the 
graduate's income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That proposal then would solve the perceived problem brought 
forth by the Canadian Federation of Students. It said that in 
such an income contingent loans program, a misunderstanding of 
Reform's proposal, the flexibility of the payments geared to a 
graduate's income works against the student since graduates with 
lower incomes will by necessity repay their loans over a longer 
period of time and will be paying a great deal more in interest 
payments than those with high incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But if they are only paying toward the principal there is no 
interest. Benefits are extended longer based on that graduate's 
income and there is no downside to this. Because Reform would 
like to see students get interest free loans this problem would

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as always, 
it is a pleasure to rise in this House to speak to a number of 
issues of great importance to Quebeckers and Canadians alike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I read the motion of the member for Vancouver East, I 
realized there was no question of the member's good faith.  No 
indeed.  However, is she indeed talking about new national 
standards in her motion?  This goes right to the heart of the 
Quebec-Canada debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To most Quebeckers, federalists or sovereignists, the word 
national refers to Quebec and not Canada. 
Here, the reference to national standards, to most English 
Canadians in the rest of Canada, means Canadian standards for 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, this goes right to the heart of the Canada-Quebec 
dichotomy.  It indicates an obvious lack of understanding of 
Quebec, its reality, its values, and the will of all Quebeckers, 
federalist or sovereignist, to defend certain jurisdictions 
awarded Quebec in 1867, the main one being education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, we have had our own system of loans and grants for 
over 30 years.  This was one of the major achievements of the 
quiet revolution headed by the Liberal government of the time 
under Jean Lesage with the support of a few important ministers, 
including Georges-Émile Lapalme and, naturally, René Lévesque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's system of loans and bursaries works very well, and 
suits everyone. 
I can quote a figure in support of this: the average debt load 
for a university graduate in Canada is $25,000, whereas it is 
$11,000 in Quebec.  It is therefore easier for a Quebec student 
to graduate from a university in Quebec, find a job and repay 
his or her debt.  It is easier when the debt is smaller than 
that of a student completing university in English Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak from experience, having taken much of my higher 
education in Quebec, but having taken some of it in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, what the member is after, when we read between the 
lines to find her objective, is to have a Quebec system or 
equivalent throughout Canada, because the Quebec system works 
well.  It is efficient, inexpensive, fair and equitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recently had an example of national standards in education 
with the current Prime Minister's toy, a monument to his rule: 
the millennium scholarships. It was clear that in Quebec none of 
the stakeholders—young people, student federations, labour 
unions, universities and their presidents, political 
parties—were interested in these scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millennium scholarships are awarded partly on merit instead of 
being solely based on the needs of individual students. That is 
unfair because we know full well that students with less 
privileged backgrounds find it much harder to study because they 
must hold one, two or even three jobs, which of course 
interferes with studying and getting good grades in university. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most parties in this House, with the exception of the party 
opposite I believe, strive to avoid overlap. Education being a 
provincial jurisdiction, establishing national standards, that 
is federal standards applied in a provincial jurisdiction, would 
only result in more overlap, more spending and ultimately 
bureaucratic chaos that would benefit no one except the 
bureaucratic machine itself, which has a tendency to develop 
programs just to support itself and prosper.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier that, in putting this motion forward, the 
hon. member was not showing bad faith, far from it, but rather a 
misunderstanding of Quebec that is unfortunately endemic in 
Canada, as I myself experienced in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it always boils down to the same issue. Here we have 
two distinct societies sharing the same legal framework. The 
solution is very simple: each one should have sole jurisdiction 
over education and every other area in the public domain. That 
is what is called Quebec sovereignty. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth—Middlesex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on the occasion to debate the motion brought 
before the House by the hon. member for Vancouver East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is asking for substantial changes to the way the 
government supports post-secondary education.  With all due 
respect, I do not think the hon. member has done her homework 
before presenting her motion.  I will address her points 
individually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first point is proposed changes to the Canada student 
loans program.  The hon. member says the government should 
reverse the privatization of Canada student loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has stressed from day one that partnerships are 
the key to ensuring strong economic and social provisions that 
will serve Canadians. We still believe that. As for the Canadian 
student loans program, we can go back to its inception in 1964 
and find that the government of the day worked with private 
sector lenders to finance the Canadian student loans program. 
That is hardly a radical concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to 1995 the Canadian student loans program provided 
students with financial assistance in the form of 100% government 
guaranteed loans from private sector lenders.  These lenders 
financed and distributed the loans and were responsible for 
servicing and collecting them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In theory this seems like a good system but in practice there 
was little incentive for lenders to maintain loans in good 
standing, to prevent defaults or to provide quality service to 
students.  The result was a significant cost to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will recall that in the early part of this decade 
Canadian taxpayers insisted that we get our financial house in 
order, which we have done.  Part of that necessary and beneficial 
process was to negotiate new financing arrangements for the 
Canada student loans program, which we did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New arrangements were introduced in 1995.  Under these new 
arrangements lenders assume responsibility for servicing and 
collecting the loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In return for the risk of loans not being repaid, the Government 
of Canada pays lenders a premium of 5% of the loan's face value 
when it goes into repayment.  This is a much more favourable 
arrangement for Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before these new arrangements were implemented, the Government 
of Canada held over $1 billion in loans for which it had 
reimbursed lenders under the guaranteed loans provision, a rather 
costly situation and one that Canadians would no longer tolerate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member may ask how the system is an improvement. As a 
transition to risk shared system progresses, the cost of claims 
for guaranteeing loans will decrease dramatically while the cost 
of the risk premium will increase only moderately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, payments against loan guarantees are expected to 
decline from $382 million in the fiscal year 1996-97 to a more 
reasonable $67 million for the year 2000-2001. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1415"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT52"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT52"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1415

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But during the same period it is estimated that the risk premium 
will increase only from $200,000 in 1996-97, the year after risk 
sharing was implemented, to $73 million in the year 2000-2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to adopt the hon. member's motion and reverse this 
process the result would be forfeiture of the projected savings 
and there would be a significant increase in costs regarding 
claims for guaranteed loans.  Surely that is not what the hon. 
member wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has signed contracts with lenders. Changing these 
arrangements would mean breaking contracts or renegotiating them, 
both of which could prove very costly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's motion also calls on the government to reject 
proposals for income contingent loan repayment. If the hon. 
member had done even preliminary research she would know that 
after discussions with our provincial partners it was agreed that 
a system of income contingent loan repayment was not feasible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea of income contingent loan repayment came about 
following reforms to the Canadian student loans program and the 
coming into force of the Canadian Student Loans Financial 
Assistance Act in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1997 budget we again expressed our willingness to discuss 
the possibility of an income contingency repayment with 
interested provinces.  The bottom line is that only the province 
of Ontario expressed interest and potential lenders were, shall 
we say, less than enthusiastic about participating in such a 
scheme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario and the lenders have not been able to come to an 
agreement and the Ontario government said an ICR plan would not 
be introduced by the 1999 deadline it had set. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last November a national stakeholders working session on the 
Canada student loans program determined that an ICR scheme was 
not viable so the government has no intention of implementing an 
ICR system at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out, however, that the February 1998 federal budget is 
sensitive to a student borrower's income.  The budget announced a 
package of new measures, including interest relief changes and 
new grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, eligibility for interest relief is based on income. 
The 1998 budget increased the threshold for students to qualify 
for interest relief, extended the interest relief period over a 
longer period of time and introduced debt reduction measures to 
assist students in severe financial hardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Vancouver East is calling on the government 
to implement a federal student grant program.  Where was the hon. 
member during the budget speech debate?  Is she not aware of the 
Canada millennium scholarship fund and the Canada study grants? 
Both have been topics for discussion in this House on a number 
of occasions and both are student grant programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada millennium scholarship fund will start off with an 
endowment of $2.5 billion from the Government of Canada.  Over 10 
years scholarships will assist more than 100,000 low and middle 
income students annually.  Grants will average $3,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new Canada study grants for students with children and other 
dependants which came into effect on August 15 will help over 
25,000 students this year alone.  Other Canada study grants have 
been in effect for some time and include grants for certain 
female doctorate candidates, high need, part time students and 
students with permanent disabilities. The government is backing 
its commitment to Canada study grants with an allocation of $100 
million in the upcoming fiscal year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust these federal student grant programs will satisfy the 
hon. member who is also calling on the government to establish 
accessibility to a new national standard for post-secondary 
education. Again, accessibility has been a fundamental principle 
of the Canadian student loans program since its inception in 
1964. That is some record. Not only that, but both federal and 
provincial governments have stated that accessibility should be 
the key principle in any joint programs offering student loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also point out that since post-secondary is the responsibility 
of both federal and provincial governments, the Government of 
Canada cannot unilaterally declare a national standard, if that 
is what the hon. member is suggesting.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all hon. members to give the new provisions designed 
to help post-secondary students an opportunity and see how 
effective they will be.  It is far too early to start considering 
amendments to these programs, and for that reason I cannot 
support the hon. member's motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
on behalf of the residents of Waterloo—Wellington I am very 
pleased to speak on this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I share the member's concern for students and their 
ability to finance higher education, I do not see how the 
proposals presented here in this motion would produce a better 
system than the one we now have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the motion calls on the government to reverse the 
privatization of the Canada student loans program.  The 
implication is that we have changed from a publicly funded 
program to a private one, and yet the Canada student loans 
program has always been based on private capital.  That has not 
changed so there is nothing to reverse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The student loans program has been financed by private capital 
since it was first introduced in 1964.  There were some changes 
made to the program in 1995 but the objective was not to 
privatize the plan.  These changes were made in order to broaden 
risk sharing and to put more decision making into the hands of 
the private lenders.  The changes were designed to improve the 
way the plan operated, not to privatize it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the plan was first introduced in 1964 the federal 
government provided guarantees to private sector lenders who in 
turn financed and dispersed loans, but this system gave little 
incentive to private lenders to maintain their loans in good 
standing, to prevent defaults or to form a close service 
relationship with the borrower.  If the loans failed, the lender 
simply called in the guarantee from the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This resulted in significant extra costs for the federal 
government under the original program design.  In fact, by 1995 
when changes were made the Government of Canada held over $1 
billion in defaulted loans for which it had reimbursed lenders 
under the guarantee provisions of the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new risk sharing arrangement private lenders assume 
responsibility for both servicing and collecting the loans as 
well as dispersing them.  As its contribution to the risk sharing 
approach, the federal government pays private lenders a premium 
of 5% of the face value of the loans when they go into repayment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government estimates that this risk sharing approach will 
significantly reduce the cost of the student loan program without 
reducing the money available to students from private lenders. 
Thus we have brought the federal government and private lenders 
more closely together in a public-private sector risk sharing 
approach to achieve a reasonable balance between costs to the 
federal government and loan availability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of the motion asks us to reject proposals for 
income contingent loan repayment plans.  While it is true that 
the question of income contingent repayment plans was discussed 
with varying degrees of interest by other parties, including the 
provinces, discussions were broken off, and that is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada was alone with the Government of 
Ontario among the provinces in advocating this approach. The 
lenders and Ontario did not come to an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion proposes the implementation of a federal student 
grant program.  The Canada millennium fund will go a long way 
toward providing financial assistance to improve access to 
education and these scholarships are to be based on need and on 
merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This $2.5 billion program will provide scholarships averaging 
$3,000 each to cover over 100,000 low and middle income students 
each year.  Eligible individuals will be able to receive up to 
$15,000 over a maximum of four years toward undergraduate 
degrees, diplomas or certificates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget also recognized the changing demographics of our 
student population as more and more of them who have been in the 
workforce return to their studies to upgrade their skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget introduced a new Canada study grant for students with 
children or other dependants.  These grants came into effect 
August 1, 1998 and are expected to help over 25,000 students over 
the next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the Canada education savings grant to help 
families save for their education, and the Government of Canada 
will give a grant of 20% on the first $2,000 invested in a 
registered education savings plan.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion proposes the establishment of accessibility as a new 
standard for post-secondary education.  Accessibility can mean 
many things. In terms of program funding accessibility has been a 
fundamental principle of the Canada student loans program since 
it was introduced in 1964, and it remains so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the motion refers to accessibility to education we must 
remember there is a shared responsibility between the federal 
government and the provincial and territorial governments on 
matters related to higher education.  Traditionally the 
operations of an education system are seen as outside the federal 
area of responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any proposal to establish national standards for access to 
education would have to be considered within the wider and broad 
context of shared responsibility between the federal government 
and our provincial and territorial partners.  It could not be 
unilaterally imposed by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus we cannot support the motion for a number of reasons. 
First, the system has not been privatized as the motion implies. 
We have moved to a system of sharing the risks of the Canada 
student loans program with the private sector but we have not 
privatized the program.  Any moves to change a risk sharing 
arrangement would cause potential extra costs to the Government 
of Canada and would upset the existing program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Government of Canada has already committed $2.5 
billion to the Canada millennium scholarship fund which will 
provide students with financial support.  We do not believe it is 
prudent to add further to our grant programs at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, accessibility is already a fundamental principle of the 
Canada student loans program and will remain so.  Issues of 
accessibility to education in the operational sense are matters 
for discussion at the provincial and territorial government 
levels.  The Government of Canada believes in a partnership 
approach to policy development and has no intention of 
formulating and<I>or imposing any national accessibility standards 
in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not believe the proposals presented in the motion are 
necessary, nor would they improve the existing system in support 
of Canadian students.  While the government is always willing to 
listen as always to constructive advice and to make helpful 
changes, we are not persuaded in this instance that the actions 
proposed in this private member's motion will provide the kind of 
result needed.  It is for these reasons that I ask that we oppose 
the motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Liberal government has said in the throne Sseech and  the 
budget that it was a government for youth.  It even announced 
the millennium scholarship fund for students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before going any further, I must explain how this government is 
really helping today's young people.  First, the Liberal 
government has cut $1.5 billion from federal funding to 
education via transfer payments to the provinces.  Over the past 
ten years,  tuition fees have increased by 240%.  Last year, the 
increase nation-wide was 12%, seven times higher than the rise in 
the inflation rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average student debt load is $25,000, compared to the 1993 
level of $13,000 when the Liberals came in.  There are even 
students in my riding with debt loads of over $50,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Student bankruptcies among those with loans have also attained 
record levels, with a 700% increase since 1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the Liberal government, there is another factor 
contributing to the debt load of our young people:  poverty. 
This government continues to impoverish the parents of these 
young people who end up at the mercy of the banks to finance 
their post-secondary education.  We must not forget either the 
famous millennium fund, which is contributing to the debt load 
of thousands of young people throughout this fine country and 
will help 7% of the country's students.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the increased assistance to students announced in the 
throne speech and in the budget, the situation of thousands of 
students is in fact very sad.  The intent of the motion is to 
rectify this injustice, to underscore the hypocrisy of the 
Liberals and to clearly establish a link between the attempt to 
privatize post-secondary education and the heightened despair of 
the young at finding themselves unemployed, and some of them 
even in a state of poverty at the end of their studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal strategy has undermined public funding of 
post-secondary education to the point where it is now completely 
in the hands of the private sector.  With this motion, the New 
Democrats are continuing to try to force the Liberal government 
to acknowledge that students are critically in debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want the government to listen to what they are saying.  We 
want members to defend public education and say that stronger 
measures must be taken to reduce the student debt load. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must keep a close eye on the Liberal government.  One would 
want to think that the government actually cares for our young 
people, for the ones who will be running this country sometime in 
the near future, but let us not be mistaken.  The government is 
very clear:  profits first, students' future later, much later. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By introducing this motion today, the NDP wants to make it very 
clear that it resolutely defends our public education system. 
We in the NDP will not let the federal government forget the 
debts that students face and the crises these debts provoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of surveys were carried out in 1997.  In one survey 
done in the maritimes, high school students were asked why they 
were not going to university.  Forty per cent of them said they 
were not going on to university because they simply could not 
afford it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, the Liberal government gave financial institutions 
greater responsibility over financial assistance to students. 
Until then, although they were assessed by the banks, student 
loans were fully guaranteed by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last budget, the federal government announced another 
giant step towards privatization.  Buried deep within the budget 
legislation is a provision giving banks greater authority to 
turn down student loans.  This provision allows cabinet, outside 
of the scrutiny of the House, to decide which students do not 
deserve loans. The implications of this are staggering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of creating student loans programs or millennium funds, 
which duplicate existing scholarship programs and are of no 
assistance to students in need, we have on several occasions 
asked the government, and we will continue to do so, to take 
measures that will reduce student debts, rather than defer them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the time the millennium fund is established in the year 2000, 
$3.1 billion will have been cut from post-secondary education. At 
about $250 million a year for 10 years, the millennium fund will 
not even come close to compensating what we have lost as a 
result of this Liberal government's policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's motion calls on the government to promote public 
education and restore the $550 million that was cut from this 
year's budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP are asking the federal government to create, in 
co-operation with the provinces, a national grant program for 
first and second year students. We have had enough of the kind 
of unilateral actions we have seen in this House with regard to 
post-secondary education. The millennium fund was established 
without any consultations with the provinces and other 
stakeholders. It was an arbitrary measure that was taken by the 
government with no consultation and no information provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that a national grant program has to be established 
within the context of a new federalism in which the provinces 
are active participants. The federal government must take the 
lead in establishing accessibility as a new national standard. 
The issue of accessibility must be tied to the federal 
government's financial contribution and payments to the 
provinces. 
This is what we need to do in Canada, and what the Liberal 
government needs to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It must also be kept in mind that this is a fine country we live 
in, but there is something increasingly unfortunate happening to 
that fine country, as it becomes very clear that there are two 
systems of post-secondary education.  Perhaps, in fact, there is 
actually only one, a system for young people who can afford 
post-secondary education, or whose parents can.  This must stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too many young people are without access to post-secondary 
education, and this causes social problems, which result in 
additional costs to government and to the taxpayers of this 
country. 
Steps must be taken today to put an end to this vicious circle, 
which ends up costing the taxpayer very dearly and is highly 
unfair to families who need help if their children are to gain 
access to education, good jobs and success in life. 
Unfortunately, governments are continuing to present policies 
that are harmful to our young people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad to join the debate on the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea of post-secondary education has come up a number of 
times in the House.  To listen to the various parties one would 
think it was an issue of great concern but in actual fact the 
track record has been that the Liberal government has been 
cutting funding for post-secondary education in a significant way 
ever since it has had the power to do so. Since 1995, $1.5 
billion has been removed from federal funding to post-secondary 
education.  These are startling figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion as put forward by the member for Vancouver East tries 
to remedy the problem.  It tries to say something about access to 
funding for post-secondary education for the many students who 
need it and who are not getting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Virtually every study emphasizes the need for a highly skilled 
workforce and more education.  We are hearing the point made over 
and over again that grade 12 is not enough any more.  At least 
one post-secondary degree is needed to make it in the world of 
work today.  When the public schools act came into place in the 
1930s, grade 12 was adequate. That is why it was decided that it 
should be freely accessible to everyone who wanted it and needed 
it. Students were strongly encouraged to stay in school to at 
least get their grade 12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts have changed.  All the experts are telling us 15 years 
to 17 years of education is the minimum.  Although I understand 
why the motion was put forward and I believe in it, it does not 
go far enough.  Our caucus is calling for free tuition.  I 
believe that we should join the 27 countries in the world that 
already provide education free of charge to all the students who 
have hopes, ambitions or aspirations to join the workforce of the 
20th century with the tools that they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only 15% of students actually graduate; 15% of our youth are 
getting the education they need.  What we are hearing is that 
many more students would take part in post-secondary education 
were it not for the insurmountable barrier of access to 
affordable loans so that they can follow through with their 
dreams and ambitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a 1997 survey of high school students in the maritimes, 40% 
of the students interviewed not going to university said they 
were not going because they could not afford it.  They simply 
could not get the wherewithal to go to school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average student debt in the country is $25,000.  That is up 
from a $13,000 average since 1993 when the Liberals took power. 
The average debt in 1993 was $13,000; today the average debt is 
$25,000. It is not tolerable and it is inconsistent with what we 
know about the need for access to post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bankruptcies for students who are trying to pay off student 
loans are at record levels.  They have increased by 700% since 
1989.  The number of students who are struggling to repay student 
loans and have been forced into bankruptcy has increased 700% 
since 1989, figures that we should be shocked at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently 130,000 students are in default on student loans. This 
is not because of a lack of will or because they are charlatans 
or they are trying to defraud the system. 
Simply the structure of the system is such that it is not 
possible for them to get the education they need and make good on 
their loans.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to see why.  Over the last 10 years tuition fees have 
climbed by 240%.  When $1.5 billion in federal funding has been 
cut from post-secondary education, it is not hard to see why 
tuition fees had to go up. It is a natural consequence of 
starving our post-secondary institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going in the direction of whole costing our tuition to 
where all the cost of tuition would be borne by the student. It 
was never the idea when we embraced the idea of accessible 
post-secondary education for it to be to the point where tuition 
fees almost have to match the whole cost of education. It is 
completely 180 degrees opposite from what most Canadians would 
embrace.  This is the reason that we have to start looking at 
broadening the public schools act to include post-secondary 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe we could say that the first degree would be free of charge 
to students.  It sounds like a radical idea but we have to start 
seeding that idea today and then find a way to make it happen and 
bring it to fruition.  If we do not start talking about it now, 
it simply is not going to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point to the example of the country of Ireland, 
my homeland.  At a certain point in recent history, it was very 
slow to attract investment and have job opportunities for its 
young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason Ireland is enjoying a bit of an opportunity now and a 
bit of an increase in investment with high tech companies coming 
to that country is that it has the highest skilled workforce in 
terms of academic excellence in the world.  Even though Ireland 
had high levels of unemployment, it never sacrificed the idea of 
post-secondary education for its people. Ireland knew it was 
building the base that would eventually attract the type of 
business and the type of investment that would ultimately lead it 
out of the economic slump it was in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a real lesson to be learned there.  We may say that we 
have high unemployment and that we need transition from school to 
work for young people.  In actual fact, we need a more highly 
skilled workforce to where every student who has the ability can 
go forward as far as their ability will take them in a chosen 
field of study in post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion we are speaking to today, Motion No. 132, hopes to 
rectify this injustice but it is also really to highlight what 
can only be looked at as Liberal hypocrisy in this matter. To 
pretend that there is a real interest in post-secondary education 
and at the same time cut $1.5 billion out of funding for those 
institutions is such a glaring contradiction that more and more 
Canadians are starting to see how fundamentally wrong it is and 
how fundamentally wrong-headed it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is said that poverty is a consequence of poor education and 
also a cause of poor education.  We can bring this whole subject 
around to the issue of the war on poverty and the redistribution 
of wealth. One of the ways people who are stuck in the bottom 
echelons of the economic system can pull themselves up is to have 
the marketable skills that they need to go forward and follow 
their chosen field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that is the be all and end all. There are other 
aspects to post-secondary education.  The universities do not 
have a monopoly on providing the skills people need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a journeyman carpenter myself.  I like to think of 
apprenticeship as legitimate post-secondary education. I would 
like to see any student loans initiative broadened to include 
labour market training as well as the more traditional B.A., 
Bachelor of Education or Bachelor of Science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the institutions are in crisis through lack of 
funding.  They passed on that crisis to students.  It is students 
who are now in a crisis.  They need relief.  They need a remedy 
and they need some support. That is why this motion would take us 
at least one step in the way to providing some satisfaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Morrison):</B>  The time provided for 
the consideration of Private Members' Business having now 
expired, the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of 
precedence on the order paper.
