</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to take advantage of this opportunity to draw 
attention to the 25th birthday of the Toronto International Film 
Festival, which has just ended. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a long-standing tradition of celebrating homegrown 
and international talents in filmmaking in all parts of this 
country.  In Toronto, Montreal, Halifax and Vancouver, in cities 
across the country, our film festivals not only celebrate cinema, 
but bring the ides of the world to Canada and bring international 
audiences to Canadian films. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Founded in 1976, the Toronto International Film Festival has 
since become one of the most important film events in the world, 
featuring 329 films from 56 countries this year.  It is also the 
largest showcase for Canadian films with 25 features and 40 
shorts this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to salute those who have made the festival the 
success that it is, the organizers, the artists and creators 
without whom there could be no festivals and the knowledgeable 
and enthusiastic audiences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Please join me in wishing a happy 25th birthday to the Toronto 
International Film Festival.

professionals from Canada.  A 40% increase in salary and a 30% 
decrease in income tax proved irresistible to him.  I cannot 
fault him for his actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He would have liked to have maintained some ties here but if he 
does not sell his house and even close his bank account the 
Canadian tax collectors will regard him as legitimate prey no

place here for smart people with ambition.  Go elsewhere.  You 
are not welcome here”.  The Canada Customs and Revenue Agency

activity continues to boom in my riding.  There are lots of good 
news business stories in Brampton and Mississauga. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, Royal Laser Tech Corporation recently completed 
construction of a 136,000 square foot building at Airport Road 
and Williams Parkway.  It has invested $20 million in the 
building and its equipment. The project currently employs between 
50 and 60 people and that number is expected to rise up to 200 
within the next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this economic activity is due to the continued strength of 
the Canadian economy.  It has created hundreds of high paying 
jobs for workers living in my riding of 
Bramalea—Gore—Malton—Springdale and helps explain our very low 
unemployment rate.

with great pleasure that I advise you that Huron—Bruce is now 
home to the new Canadian Underwater Hockey Champions.  Indeed, 
Mr. Speaker, you heard me correctly, “underwater hockey”. After 
producing so many individuals that dominated the game on the ice, 
Huron—Bruce is branching out to claim supremacy under the water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From September 8 to 10, 12 players and 3 coaches from the 
Kincardine Poolsharks travelled to Quebec City to compete in the 
Canadian under 19 underwater hockey championships.  After the 10 
game round robin and best of three finals had concluded, this 
Kincardine team was left undefeated in all three medal games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate head coach Terry Brown and team 
captain Kyle Schilroth, along with all of the Poolsharks' coaches 
and players.  Once again Huron—Bruce managed to score the 
winning goal.

Speaker, it gives me great pleasure and pride to I stand here 
today to celebrate that Canada has won another gold medal at the 
Olympics in Sydney, Australia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sebastien Lareau of Boucherville, Quebec and Daniel Nestor of 
Toronto, Ontario, have performed the deed.  They have become our 
dragon slayers by defeating the Australian doubles Woodbridge and 
Woodforde, the woodies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This team of dedicated athletes who came together this year to 
represent Canada at the Olympic games defeated the Australians in 
very hard fought matches.  Both are accomplished tennis players. 
Daniel Nestor reached the finals at the world doubles 
championships in 1998.  Sebastien Lareau won the 1999 world 
doubles championship, a gold at the Pan-Am games in 1999 and the 
U.S. Open last year.  After losing to this same pair of 
Australians earlier this year at Wimbledon, they felt they had a 
score to settle, and settle it they did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure members will join with me in congratulating these fine 
gentlemen for this great victory and thank them for the honour 
this gold medal brings to Canada.

Mr. Speaker, today's news confirms that our record high 
population is due to immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six years ago the government voted down one of the Canadian 
Alliance's motions to test all immigrants for HIV.  The 
government has now had a change of heart.  Ironically the number 
of physicians needed to check for infectious disease has been 
reduced over the last five years from 44 to 22.  The auditor 
general has been hounding the department for the past 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister even assure Canadians that her testing plan 
will achieve results given the workload departmental physicians 
currently face?  Six years after our motion the government has 
finally realized that Canadian health and safety must be a 
priority of immigration policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time medical standards were looked at was in 1978. 
Protecting the health of Canadians would be the first priority of 
a Canadian Alliance government.

to pay tribute to 55 survivors of the Holocaust who are here on 
Parliament Hill today, survivors of the worst genocide of the 
20th century, and who alone understand that the unspeakable 
horrors of the Holocaust are too terrible to be believed but not 
too terrible to have happened.

today, “you are the true heroes of humanity.  You have not only 
witnessed and endured the worst of man's inhumanity to man, but 
you somehow found in the wellsprings of your own humanity the 
courage to go on, to rebuild your lives as you helped build your 
communities here in Canada.  You taught us the evils of racism 
and bigotry, and the dangers of silence in the face of evil; of 
the importance of remembrance and the remembrance to act; of the 
reminder that every human being is a universe, and whoever saves 
a single person it is as if they saved an entire universe”.

terrorist front organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioner wrote “In view of the timing and sponsorship,

Canada.  The United States state department lists FACT, which was 
the sponsor of the dinner that the minister attended, as a front 
organization for the Tamil tigers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These facts were included in the warning that was sent from our 
officials.  Yet both the Minister for International Cooperation

<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At the particular meeting a young woman stood up who had

how she wanted to be a success, how important Canada was to her, 
and how this was her country.

question is for the Prime Minister.  Seventy-five per cent of 
seasonal workers in New Brunswick earn less than $10,000 per 
year.  The Prime Minister knew that when he attacked those 
seasonal workers with his employment insurance changes in 1996. 
What has changed since then to cause him to swallow his policy? 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we knew we needed reforms because we were faced with a 
$42 billion deficit that his party had left us.  We had to do 
something and we made some reforms.  When we make reforms, 
sometimes we make changes.  Eventually we see the results of them 
and we adjust them.  That is what a moderate government that is 
flexible enough to adjust to the situation does.  It is exactly 
what we are doing with the changes in the EI laws.  I think the 
system has worked very well and the people will be very happy 
with the changes the minister will introduce on Monday.

full debate and a final vote on these employment insurance 
changes before parliament is dissolved?  If not, this is an empty

there were many innocent people at that supper on May 6 in

not.  He had warnings from departmental officials from many

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I have copies of over a dozen news articles with me 
that appeared across the country today and that I am prepared to 
table in the House.  In fact, yesterday afternoon one reporter 
read on live television the details of what will be contained in 
this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These media reports are not just that the government intends to 
introduce this legislation.  Rather, they contain very specific 
details about what will be in it, such as, to quote an article in 
today's Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>, the details that the legislation 
will: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Raise from $39,000 to $48,000 the income level at which benefits 
are clawed back from repeat EI users. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eliminate entirely the intensity rule, under which a frequent 
user's benefits dropped by one percentage point for every 20 
weeks of benefits claimed, from a maximum of 55 per cent of 
insurable earnings to a minimum of 50 per cent. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a unique problem in this or previous parliaments. In 
fact, several times in this parliament you have 
heard cases of privilege involving the leaking of information not 
yet tabled in the House to the media.  It happens with committee 
reports, with the budget and with legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind you, Mr. Speaker, of your ruling of March 
28, 2000, in which you found a prima facie case of privilege in 
the matter raised by the hon. member for London North Centre 
concerning the premature disclosure of a committee report to the 
media by the hon. member for Lakeland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Occasionally, draft copies of legislation are circulated among 
party critics as a courtesy in advance of tabling in the House of 
Commons.  As NDP critic for employment insurance, I attempted to 
obtain a draft copy of the legislation, but it was denied to me 
by the government House leader on the basis that it was secret 
until tabled in the House of Commons.  The minister herself also 
denied me a copy of that same legislation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is very important for my constituents. I have been 
working hard on this issue since I was elected to this place. I 
do not need to remind the House that my private member's Motion 
M-222, asking that the government take immediate action to 
restore employment insurance benefits to seasonal workers, was 
unanimously approved by the House on May 9. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to quote from Beauchesne's 
Parliamentary Rules and Forms, chapter 2(24): 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentary privilege is the sum of the peculiar rights enjoyed 
by each House collectively as a constituent part of the High 
Court of Parliament, and by members of each House individually, 
without which they could not discharge their functions and which 
exceed those possessed by other bodies or individuals. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This practice of leaking information to the media before it is 
made available to members should not be tolerated.  This House 
cannot function and members cannot discharge their duties if 
persons outside this place are accorded privileges not enjoyed by 
all members of this House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK128"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first, I want to say to the hon. 
member that I totally agree with him that it is inappropriate for 
this information to find itself in the newspaper.  That is the 
first proposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that he approached me personally yesterday and asked 
me to get an advance copy of the bill, to which I responded that 
a bill of course is cabinet secret until introduced in the House 
and therefore it would be a breach of the cabinet secrecy to 
offer him a copy of the bill unless it had been so decided by a 
decision of cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later yesterday afternoon the hon. member in question came back 
to me again and made the allegation that the bill was now in the 
possession of the media or that at least the contents of the bill 
were known to the media. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1510"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite obvious that he was correct at least in terms of the 
content of the bill, because the bill was in the media before I, 
as the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, had a 
copy myself.  I am not amused by this any more than the hon. 
member is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am stating the obvious here.  This is not something that I 
participated in and hopefully no one else in the House 
participated in this.  I am quite confident that no one who sits 
in the House participated in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be that as it may, the material, I must admit, found itself in 
the hands of the media.  It is almost 24 hours before the bill is 
to be introduced and some elements of the contents have been 
alleged to be in the media.  Tomorrow of course we will be able 
to compare the accuracy of the information in question. 
Certainly one does not have to be a genius to understand that 
there is a significant portion of it that is accurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, in regard to the notice I signed, it is not 
respective ministers who sign all the notices of motion, it is I 
as government House leader.  The notice I tabled yesterday of 
course describes a little of what the bill does, at least in its 
title form.  I had of course also given notice to the opposition 
House leaders of the fact that there was to be such a bill.  I 
actually gave notice at approximately 3.15 yesterday afternoon, 
and the table would know this, of the introduction of this bill, 
which is to take place no earlier than tomorrow.  It could take 
place later but it will not.  It is still our intention to 
introduce it tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summation, I want to indicate to the House that I do not 
believe there was any deliberate attempt on the part of any 
member of the House for this information to find itself in the 
media, however regrettable that may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of whether or not this constitutes a question of 
privilege based on the principle of a committee report, I do not 
think it does.  The issue of a committee report is a report of a 
committee of the House being available to someone other than a 
member of the House before the House has knowledge of it.  That 
is the principle behind it.  I am sure all hon. members are quite 
familiar with it.  This is not an issue of a report from the 
House.  The government could issue a draft bill when the House is 
not even sitting; that is perfectly legal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I made a commitment yesterday that this issue was 
cabinet confidential, which it was, and I am personally insulted 
at the fact that this document was made public before it was made 
available to the House, particularly when I personally refused to 
give it to a member of the House prior to its introduction.  It 
is my duty to refuse prior to a bill's introduction in any case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel just as much aggrieved as the hon. member.  I know the 
member has a very particular interest in the subject and has 
worked very hard on this issue.  I appreciate that.  We are all 
in agreement when something like this happens.  The fact that I 
may feel personally offended and the hon. member, having an 
interest in the issue, might be similarly offended, if not more, 
is of course of interest to all of us, but it is not the same in 
that it does not meet the threshold of the parallel of a 
committee report and I do not believe it is a case of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, I will do everything I can as a minister to ensure 
that bills that are to be introduced in the House and are not 
scheduled to be announced elsewhere before they reach the House 
are not announced before the House sees them first.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the words of the government House leader 
that he is aggrieved by what has apparently gone on here.  There 
is a problem with being aggrieved, even agreeing with the 
member's statement that a document that should have been tabled 
first in the House found its way to the media instead.  Once 
again members of the House are being treated as second class 
recipients of information instead of being the first to get the 
information.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with just being aggrieved and even agreeing that it 
is a bad thing is that nothing is ever done.  From the words I 
heard from the government House leader, nothing will be done. He 
might be offended.  He might think it is a bad deal.  He might 
wish it never happened, but because nothing is ever done, because 
neither the government House leader nor the Chair ever says “I 
have had it up to here with this systematic misuse and abuse of 
the House”, it will happen again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the Speaker to take this question very seriously.  The 
trouble is we all cluck our tongues and say “Yes, we should know 
first in the House and then in the media”.  However, because 
nothing happens, it is like a policeman standing on the sidelines 
with a sign saying “Please go slower”, and there goes another 
one speeding.  We have to intervene.  Failing to do that means 
just stay tuned because there will be more.

of privilege of my colleague.  Without a doubt, here we are in a 
matter that is very much in the news, coming to the conclusion 
that there has been a leak somehow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader regrets that this has happened, but 
I do not feel that regrets are enough. If there is a true desire 
to remedy the situation, if we want to ensure that nothing 
similar occurs later on,  there must be an investigation and it 
must be clearly determined whether the Minister of Human 
Resources Development or any other member of the government or of 
the House—although it cannot have been anyone from outside the 
government—was or was not responsible for a leak to the public. 
As a result, the journalists knew before we did, thus preventing 
intervention in the House at the appropriate time.

I want to add a few comments to what has already been said by the 
hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst and by other members who have 
intervened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the Chair to take this question very seriously.  It may 
be, as the government House leader argued, that the former 
judgment by the Chair with respect to the premature release of 
committee reports is not identical to what we are protesting 
here, but it is all in the same vein.  It all shows a similar 
contempt for the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these things, whether they are committee reports that are 
released before they are tabled in the House, or government 
legislation that is leaked to the media before it is tabled in 
the House, or anything in the same vein, it all erodes the 
ability of members of the House individually and collectively to 
do their jobs.  Mr. Speaker, you should regard it in the same 
spirit in which you regarded the release of committee reports 
before they were tabled in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader says he feels badly, and I believe 
him, but some responsibility has to be taken somewhere.  That is 
the point.  If nobody on the government side is to take 
responsibility then it is up to the Chair to assign 
responsibility for this, because clearly somebody somewhere in 
the Department of Human Resources Development gave it to the 
media.  I do not think anyone could claim anything else.  This is 
what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would make the argument that this is a parliamentary 
democracy.  We have responsible government.  The buck stops 
somewhere, and in this case the buck does not stop with the 
government House leader.  I believe he was a victim of the 
Machiavellian machinations of his own colleagues in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that somebody has to take responsibility, and in my 
judgment it is the Minister of Human Resources Development who 
should be held responsible.  It is her department.  She should be 
in here explaining what happened and why heads are rolling or why 
she is resigning or whatever the case may be.  It is her 
department or her ministry that has demonstrated this kind of 
contempt for parliament through the deliberate leak, unless 
somebody wants to get up and actually ask us to believe this was 
somehow an accident.  We are asked to believe an awful lot of 
things around here, but that would be a big one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that this is a deliberate strategy on 
the part of government members time after time after time, so 
that they get the lead on the story, so that their spin, so to 
speak, on the story is out there before other members of 
parliament and other parties get to comment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the place where public policy is announced, not in the 
back rooms where somebody slips somebody from the media a brown 
envelope, or across the way in the press gallery, or wherever it 
is of the many places.  Sometimes from hundreds of miles away 
ministers of the crown decide to make public policy 
announcements.  All of this tends toward the deterioration in the 
public mind of the importance of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge you to do whatever is in your power, Mr. Speaker, 
to chastise, assign responsibility, refer it to a committee, or 
whatever you see within your power to do, because someone has to 
do something about it.  We are doing what we can on the floor by 
appealing to you. 
<P><A NAME="LINK132"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this 
question of privilege.  I would very much attach my comments to 
those of the previous speakers on this side of the House, 
particularly the last speaker who you know and all members know 
has a long history in this institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He pointed out very clearly that an attempt has to be made by 
the Chair and all members to stop the practice of floating trial 
balloons prior to the proper tabling of legislation in the House. 
There is a long record of this occurring.  In the short time I 
have been in this place we have seen it happen time and time 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest as well there is very much an elevated sense of 
anticipation of a possible election, which adds to the political 
climate and the timeliness of having this information out there 
earlier.  As the whip for the New Democratic Party has pointed 
out, he made direct appeals to the government, and rightfully so, 
to have an opportunity to review the legislation as the critic in 
this regard, as did members of our party.  We were denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I would suggest it is cold comfort to have the outrage and 
the feigned indignation of the government House leader standing 
here and saying “It is a terrible thing.  I do not know how it 
happened.  We are very upset about it on this side of the House 
too, but c'est la vie”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Chair to keep in mind that in this instance there is a 
very important factor.  The evidence is not in. This matter 
should not be decided today by you, Mr. Speaker. There was a 
time, and the hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona will certainly 
recall, when it was very clear that if a leak such as this 
occurred there would be direct ministerial accountability, which 
adds to the democracy in this place, which adds to accountability 
and responsibility on the part of government.  That seems to no 
longer exist under this administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is but one source from which this information could have 
been leaked, and that is the government that drafted the 
legislation.  Obviously there has to be some form of 
accountability on the part of the department, on the part of the 
government, and on the part of the government House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evidence is not in.  We do not know the source of the leak. 
Yet we do not even hear the slightest indication from the 
government that it is willing to even make inquiries.  Has there 
been an inquiry?  Have the police been involved in how this 
information was leaked? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of information is of equal importance to a budget 
leak.  I would suggest we cannot diminish the importance of what 
has just happened in this place.  Again I marry myself to the 
remarks that have been made by other members of the opposition. 
It is incumbent upon the Chair to enforce some semblance of 
accountability when this type of information winds up in the 
hands of the media prior to the people who have been 
democratically elected having an opportunity to review this type 
of important legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge you, Mr. Speaker, to proceed with due diligence in this 
matter, not to react quickly to the request and the question of 
privilege that has been raised, and to make inquiries on what 
type of investigation has been made to discover the source of the 
leak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This cannot continue.  As has been pointed out, it continually 
diminishes and completely casts a pall over the importance of 
this place and the government if information is to be allowed to 
be leaked out in an unfettered way prior to any kind of 
examination in the House of Commons.  I know you will proceed 
with this charge very diligently, and I would urge you to do so 
post-haste.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Members will recall that this issue was 
raised a number of time in the last session of parliament.  As I 
recall, one of the members of the then Reform Party, now Canadian 
Alliance, admitted in the House that he did it to test the rules, 
and we had a debate here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard from the House leaders on the particular matter and 
I have been urged to take it seriously.  I do.  I had hoped that 
after we had the last discussion on this matter that we as 
parliamentarians would be able to keep our own house in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I direct my question to the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst. Is 
the hon. member alleging that the Minister of Human Resources 
Development leaked this paper herself?  Is that what the hon. 
member is alleging? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon:</B>  Yes, yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst can 
speak for himself.  I was addressing him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B>  Yes, Mr. Speaker, I can speak for myself. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is yes. In the present context, in today's context of 
uncertainty as to whether there will be an election or not, our 
battle against employment insurance and my travels across the 
country have led to a bill that will change the rules of 
employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament, I personally requested a copy of the 
bill.  I respect the government's decision that I cannot have 
one, but then I turn around and find the media discussing it. 
I say yes, the minister was aware. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member's response is yes. He said 
that the minister is responsible for leaking this information to 
the media. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very least we can do is this.  We have an allegation 
specifically against a minister, and I would like to hear what 
the minister has to say about the particular point.  When she is 
in the House and I am here, I will direct that.  Until I hear 
from her, I will hold in abeyance whatever decision I might be 
taking.  I will let it sit right there.  I think I have heard 
enough. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust hon. members are taking this seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will let this sit until a bit later.  We will take our time 
and get to the bottom of it.  I will listen to another question 
of privilege from the hon. member for Winnipeg South.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate your giving me the opportunity to speak to this 
matter.  I am speaking to a matter of privilege raised by the 
hon. member for Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize it is somewhat unusual to be speaking this long after 
the original point was raised, but I am deeply interested in the 
matter.  In a way it relates to some of the discussions that just 
took place on the previous matter of privilege. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not go through the history of it as that has already been 
put on record and the government has had a chance to speak to it, 
but I want to raise what I believe is one of those generic, 
organic understandings we have of what our democracy is all 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eugene Forsey, when he was called upon to describe it for the 
new online system here, talked about a responsible government 
with a cabinet responsible to the House of Commons and a House of 
Commons responsible to the people.  That is how we describe it 
too.  That is what we teach children in school.  That is how we 
understand it to be, that this is the place where citizen's 
rights are acted out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will contrast that with a comment contained within a report 
commissioned by the Privy Council Office that describes the 
Canadian House of Parliament as weak in most of its roles because 
of special Canadian factors that make the Canadian parliament 
especially weak, even in comparison with other parliaments based 
on the British Westminster parliamentary cabinet model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reference it in that way because for me one of the things that 
allows us to play our role as representatives of citizens and 
that allows citizens to hold their government responsible to them 
is their ability to access accurate information about the 
operations of government.  It seems to be a very fundamental 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We rely upon an impartial public service to serve the members of 
the House equitably and to provide information to them that is, 
dare I say, policy neutral, not designed to spin or shape the 
attitudes of members but to give them the facts upon which we can 
come to a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has brought forward information relating to a private 
member's bill.  It is information that related to this side of 
the House because it was information that was supplied to members 
on this side of the House about why they should not vote in 
favour of his particular bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two specific points.  In that information and in a 
document supplied to cabinet someone within the public service 
wrote that the privy commissioner believes Bill C-206 is a 
serious threat to the privacy of Canadians.  The member, being 
somewhat surprised at this, wrote to the privacy commissioner and 
asked: “Is serious threat to privacy an evaluation that can be 
directly attributed to you?”.  The privacy commissioner wrote 
back and said “No, neither my staff nor I have ever used that 
term”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have information supplied to cabinet and information supplied 
to members of the House because the same allegation is made in 
the documentation provided to members of House.  It would seem to 
be at odds with the very person it is attributed to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a chamber for debate and we are debating all the time. 
The information used in debates may be called into question by 
any one of us at any point in time, but there is a different bar 
to which I believe the public service needs to be held.  It is 
incumbent upon them to supply us with information that is not 
just kind of accurate but that fairly represents the situation 
with which they are confronted or to which they are asked to 
respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is that they also reference in this information 
a comment by the privacy commissioner in his annual report 
because he did have concerns about the bill.  While they 
highlight that, what is interesting is that they forget to 
highlight that he had concerns about several government bills 
that were passed by the House and received royal assent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have seen over the years is an erosion of the rights of 
members of the House.  They are not our rights.  They are the 
rights of Canadian citizens that we exercise on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just a final point.  In this documentation and in other 
things that have been written about access to information and 
privacy legislation there is the indication that the government 
has a process for this right now that it is being conducted by 
the public service in house.  I think that is wrong.  The review 
and the design of that legislation should be such that it is done 
by an all cabinet committee and in public.  It is wrong to do 
that in the privacy of back offices because it relates to 
reference of the rules that we play by here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge you to look at this issue very carefully, Mr. Speaker, as 
I am sure you will.  I urge you to take it one step beyond the 
narrow focus you would put on the interpretation of the points 
raised by the member and to look at the position that every 
member of the House is in when we try to carry out the functions 
we are here to carry out, which is to hold the government to 
account.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the comments of the member for Winnipeg 
South on this important issue.  I have a couple of points that I 
would ask the Chair to consider.  One is that public servants are 
asked on behalf of ministers to make judgments often.  They 
prepare briefing books and they make judgment calls all the time. 
I do not find that unusual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I do agree with is the observation of the member for 
Winnipeg South that the powers of individual parliamentarians and 
the respect that parliamentarians are held in are continually 
eroded.  The erosion of these rights is ongoing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should take this up with his caucus.  The 
Liberal Party has been in control of this place for the last 
seven years.  I agree there has been a steadily ongoing erosion 
of the rights and privileges of members of parliament, the esteem 
that the public would hold us in, and the things that Canadians 
expect of us.  All those things have been eroded.  To bring it 
forth here is good, I appreciate it, but he should also take it 
up with the Liberal caucus which has been in charge while all 
this has been happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly I would wonder if the member for Winnipeg South would 
table the documents from which he quoted.  He read snippets from 
them which I thought were interesting.  Perhaps if he could table 
those documents it would help all of us to make an evaluation. It 
would help you, Mr. Speaker, and it would help all 
parliamentarians to make an evaluation of whether or not it truly 
was a question of privilege.  We would like to see all the 
documents to get that information.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot,

documents had been tabled at the time I made the original 
interventions, with the exception of one additional document, a 
letter from the privacy commissioner to me that I would like to 
submit to you for your consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. member have consent of the 
House to submit this document? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I have heard all of the argument on this 
question of privilege.  I will now take all the information under

</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I want to make it clear that there have not been previous 
consultations. However, I wonder if I could add another item to 
the list.  It is simply this.  Tomorrow night's private members' 
hour is a motion in my name.  Could we agree that the vote be 
held over until next week at the choice of the House leaders or 
the whips and that the motion be deemed put as a part of the 
package before us on private members' business? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The point has been made.  Could we 
deal with the motion before the House first, and then perhaps the 
hon. member could ask for consent—I sense there is a general 
consensus—rather than clutter this motion with two things, 
because this deals with items currently on the order paper and 
the other deals with a vote tomorrow.  I am not trying to 
jeopardize the hon. member's chances but I sense there is consent 
for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know there were 
consultations on Motion M-210, substituting Mr. Clark for Mr. Brison 
because of the byelection.  As far as I know, that was the only 
consultation that took place.  That one I have no problem with 
because we have talked about it.  The other ones, I take it, are 
because of some changes in the parliamentary secretaries, but I 
have not seen that list.  Perhaps if the hon. member could send 
that list around we could have a look at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Could the Chair suggest that the 
parliamentary secretary consult with a couple of opposition 
members here, get agreement on the list and the suggestion by the 
hon. member from Kamloops and come back to the House in a few 
minutes?  Perhaps we could then clear it all up.  Would that be 
possible?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-14 has been thoroughly studied before the Standing

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members have heard in the House and in committee, the 
Norway House Cree nation in particular will benefit from Bill 
C-14.  Part 1 of the bill will affirm in law certain elements of 
the Norway House master implementation agreement which is now 
being implemented to bring about resolution of matters arising 
out of the northern flood agreement. Part 2 of Bill C-14 will 
also benefit Norway House, both as a treaty land entitlement band 
and by facilitating implementation of the reserve expansion 
commitments in the first nations master implementation agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me expand briefly on these two elements of the bill, after 
which I will comment on the strong messages of support that we 
have received for this legislation, heard primarily during the 
time that the committees had their meetings a while back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing really new in part 1 of Bill C-14. Parliament 
has already approved similar legislation for three other northern 
flood agreement bands:  the Split Lake Cree, the York Factory and 
the Nelson House first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are being asked to affirm in law is simply that 
compensation moneys and fee simple lands provided to Norway House 
under its master implementation agreement can be managed by the 
community in conjunction with the corporate trustee and outside 
the cumbersome restrictions currently in the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Important safeguards are there.  They are in place to ensure 
that the decisions made by the first nation council and the 
trustee are transparent, communicated to the community and are in 
its best interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 1 also gives effect in law to a locally administered and 
more effective approach to claims resolution than currently 
exists in the northern flood agreement itself.  This new 
community based approach will deal with the vast majority of 
claims arising out of both the NFA and the Norway House master 
implementation agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask hon. members to keep in mind that the Norway House master 
implementation agreement has been signed by the parties and that 
the implementation of the provisions of that agreement is 
currently under way.  However, there is a commitment in the 
document and in the agreement to facilitate certain of its 
provisions through legislation and the government is determined 
to fulfil that commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Giving the people of Norway House increased control over fee 
simple lands and compensation money provided to them under the 
MIA is an important step on the road to economic self-sufficiency 
and increased accountability.  It will help enhance community 
confidence and community pride.  In fact, it is already doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fred Muskego, a band councillor at Norway House, spoke about 
some of the benefits that have flowed under the master 
implementation agreement when he appeared before the Standing 
Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development in March 
1999.  I would like to quote briefly from his remarks to that 
committee: “We have addressed our recreational problems we have 
on the reserve.  We have a state of the art multiplex that was 
built because of the MIA.  We have recreation programs for the 
young people, and even some of the older people benefit from 
them.  We have had some housing come out of the MIA.  We have 
programs for our alcohol problems and social problems.  We have 
just put some money into the building of a church, a funeral home 
and meeting halls.  Out of these MIA proposals we have created 
about 105 jobs”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The items listed by the councillor are not the end of it.  I 
understand that settlement proceeds have been used for a 
recreation complex which includes facilities for bowling, curling 
and skating, as well as a community hall and restaurant.  I am 
also advised that in addition to the new homes and churches 
mentioned by the councillor, new projects approved by the 
community using settlement funds include day care, road 
improvements and other infrastructure improvement projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first nation has also acquired a fishing lodge, and in 
partnership with industry has acquired interests in mining 
exploration.  The first nation has also purchased some 500,000 
pounds of fishing quota on Lake Winnipeg, thus beginning to 
re-establish a role in the fishery of Lake Winnipeg, a status 
which was eroded with the original flooding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Economic development jobs, community infrastructure and social 
initiatives; these are all solid proof of actual advantages for 
people who require them and people to whom we have obligations, 
people who deserve their economic self-sufficiency.  They are 
proof that a proper balance of resources, accountability and 
local decision making can bring about positive and lasting change 
in first nations communities and more important in first nations 
lives.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The settlement moneys under the master implementation agreement 
are being put to good use and wise use by the community itself. 
It makes the decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Passing Bill C-14 will allow for all of the settlement proceeds 
to be managed in this way by that community.  Without the bill, 
some of the proceeds would fall to be administered under the 
Indian Act requiring the involvement of the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I alluded earlier to the fact that part 1 of the bill will also 
give effect to a locally administered process for resolving 
claims that arise under the Norway House master implementation 
agreement.  That local process has been operating for about two 
and a half years now.  It is proving to be a workable alternative 
to the cumbersome process that was in place under the northern 
flood agreement. Passing Bill C-14 will ensure that the local 
claims process continues to serve the individual claimants of 
Norway House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 2 of Bill C-14 does introduce some new concepts that 
parliament has not seen in other legislation, concepts that 
should nevertheless be supported by all members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal of part 2 is to facilitate the transfer of lands to 
reserve status in order that Canada's land related obligations 
arising from claim settlement agreements across Manitoba can be 
fulfilled in a timely manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that all members understand that a key component of a 
sound economic future for first nations is their land base.  This 
legislation will improve the process by which new reserves are 
created pursuant to claim settlement agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I alluded to earlier, these agreements include treaty land 
entitlements and certain elements of the master implementation 
agreements signed by four of the five northern flood agreement 
first nations.  As a first step in speeding up reserve expansions 
for all Manitoba first nations that have negotiated claim 
settlement agreements or that will do so in the near future, we 
need to get beyond the cumbersome process of obtaining an order 
in council to add lands to reserves. Canada already agreed to 
effect these reserve expansions when it signed the settlement 
agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to improve the way third party interests on those lands 
are accommodated.  The first nations have begun selecting their 
new lands.  Many of these lands have been selected for their 
economic development potential in areas such as forestry, mining, 
tourism, commercial buildings and farming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will continue to be further land selection activity of 
this kind under these agreements in the coming years.  Under the 
treaty land entitlement framework agreement which benefits 20 
Manitoba first nations, up to 450,000 hectares are to be set 
apart as reserve land over the next three to five years.  Seven 
other first nations have treaty land entitlement claims that 
could involve up to another 62,000 hectares of land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleagues have stated, the timely provision of these 
entitlement lands is needed to support claims implementation and 
the evolution of a vibrant on reserve economy.  The business 
ventures on existing and future land selections under these 
agreements will require the co-operation and partnership of third 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to give these first nations the flexibility to 
aggressively seek out lands that have economic development 
interests or potential while ensuring that the rights of existing 
landowners and title holders can be accommodated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what part 2 of the legislation is all about.  It 
contains a number of provisions that will achieve these goals, 
and they are very laudatory goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, part 2 will empower the Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development to set apart as reserves any of the land 
selected by Manitoba first nations under a claim settlement 
agreement, eliminating the need for an order in council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 2 of the bill will also allow for the finalization of 
agreements with third parties in a timely manner, which provides 
certainty and protection to all.  It establishes more effective 
mechanisms for accommodating third party interests identified in 
the reserve creation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically part 2 will allow Manitoba first nations to strike 
deals on third party interests as soon as a parcel of land is 
identified for reserve status. This will enable the first nations 
to accommodate different kinds of third party interests before 
land is officially added to a reserve, or to negotiate new rights 
that will come into effect upon reserve creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This latter aspect, negotiating new third party interests in 
addition to negotiating replacements of existing interests, is 
particularly noteworthy. As a result of this provision we will 
see first nations pursue emerging economic opportunities on their 
chosen lands immediately rather than experience the freeze on 
development which now occurs pending resolution of the land's 
status.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 2 of Bill C-14 is not creating any new entitlements for 
first nations or imposing any new obligations on governments or 
landowners.  It is simply making an existing process work better 
so that we speed up the implementation of the claims and 
facilitate first nations' use of their lands and resources to 
generate social and economic benefits for their community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already quoted from the remarks made by Fred Muskego, a 
band councillor for Norway House Cree nation.  He appeared before 
the committee on March 11, 1999. He expressed full support for 
Bill C-14, noting from his firsthand experience that the northern 
flood agreement was difficult to implement and that virtually 
every claim resulting from the agreement had been challenged and 
usually ended up in court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He stated very clearly on behalf of the entire council and 
community that Bill C-14 is in the “best interests” of the 
Norway House people. Why? Because the MIA makes the Norway House 
Cree the masters of their own destiny.  It lets the community 
decide how to spend its compensation moneys and makes the 
political leadership accountable.  Canadians want that and so do 
the first nations.  In his words, the MIA is an “avenue for the 
future of our children”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Manitoba Hydro, which is a party to the northern flood agreement 
and the master implementation agreement, was also represented 
before the committee.  Mr. Bettner, associate corporate counsel 
for the utility, had this to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From Manitoba Hydro's perspective, the [master implementation] 
agreement and this legislation provide a number of positive 
benefits for all parties.  First and foremost, it provides the 
parties with the opportunity to build a new and effective 
relationship by resolving issues which have, over the years, 
resulted in anger, mistrust, uncertainty, adversarial 
arbitration, and delays in delivering the compensation and 
benefits spoken to in the northern flood agreement.  It provides 
certainty for the past, the present and the future. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are strong words from a key partner in the process.  I 
remind hon. members that Manitoba Hydro has accepted additional 
responsibilities as a result of the master implementation 
agreement. The utility is eager to move forward even with those 
additional responsibilities in the partnership because it knows a 
new millennium and a new way is before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not end there.  Mr. Bettner also spoke in favour of part 
2 of Bill C-14, noting that it would allow Canada and the first 
nations to move and more effectively accommodate existing and 
potential third party interests in land.  He said before the 
committee: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 2 provides a relatively seamless framework for developers or 
other land users and will hopefully forestall the loss of 
opportunities where the need to resolve land use issues is an 
early and paramount consideration.  Part 2 will be a benefit to 
Manitoba Hydro in its ongoing dealings with first nations...in 
that it will provide the ability to resolve the ongoing land 
interests in a timely manner. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gord Hannon of the Manitoba Department of Justice also stated 
full provincial support for both parts of Bill C-14.  Mr. Hannon 
told the committee that a wide range of stakeholders were 
consulted on the treaty land entitlement framework agreement 
supported by part 2 of the legislation.  These included the 
mining and forestry industry, Manitoba Hydro and municipal 
governments. Mr. Hannon said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that there has been a high level of general 
consultation in Manitoba and, I hope and believe, a high level of 
understanding of the objectives in the framework agreement. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on at length about the many benefits of this bill and 
the support it has received in committee.  We have heard the 
arguments and there are always arguments pro and con.  The bill 
has been studied from all angles.  The validity of the Norway 
House master implementation agreement has even been confirmed by 
a court of law. Now it is time to move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By emulating proven federal legislation and by introducing 
useful new mechanisms, Bill C-14 will help Manitoba claim 
settlements accomplish their objectives quickly and effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If hon. members support the goals of this government set out in 
“Gathering Strength”, goals of honouring treaty land 
entitlements, of supporting strong communities and people, of 
building the capacity for economic self-sufficiency and of 
renewing Canada's relationship with aboriginal people, then I 
urge them to vote in favour of Bill C-14 so that it can be sent 
to the other place.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to address this bill again.  I want 
to speak on both parts of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice the insertion of the word “right” in the bill, which 
does not mean much in light of recent supreme court decisions. 
It was probably requested by Warren Allmand who is a former 
minister of Indian affairs with this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak about the process because process matters. 
The government seems to be under the impression that the end 
justifies the means, that the government can simply pass 
legislation to give legislative credibility to its actions and 
that it can hold a referendum after the fact to almost give 
credibility to a process that was quite flawed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a lot of people in from Norway House and other parts of 
Canada who had connections with Norway House and who were really 
unhappy with the process that they went through.  The result may 
have been inevitable but we had a lot of control over the process 
and it was not necessary to make a lot of people unhappy.  Too 
much information was given to those people in too little time and 
it was not given to them in a language that they understood very 
well.  They finally received a translation, if I remember 
correctly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were incentives given to vote for the legislation rather 
than voting for it based on its own merit.  There was a denial of 
the use of public broadcasting facilities located in the town. 
Many people mentioned that they were not happy with that.  That 
has created a great deal of bitterness in the community that will 
take years and years to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about the honour of the crown a great deal when we talk 
about Indian affairs.  In this case, the honour of the crown was 
somewhat tarnished by a process that these people had precious 
little control over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1977, which was 23 years ago, the government signed an 
open-ended flood agreement that this act was meant to replace. 
These people have waited 23 years for a resolution to what they 
felt was their right.  How did successive governments behave? 
They took a generation to deal with these issues.  Older people 
are probably long since gone from the community for whatever 
reason.  Young people grew up not knowing what they had had.  A 
situation like this is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has a record of making big open-ended 
promises like the NFA which is very poorly defined.  Then comes 
the reality check.  Then comes the time when people across Canada 
or the people in the communities say that this is not deliverable 
or that the government has not delivered what it was supposed to 
deliver.  It gets cut back, defined down and eventually gets to 
where it should have been right off the bat.  That is not 
acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Canadian Alliance proposes that land claims, treaties 
and other agreements should be affordable, that the process 
should be transparent and that it should be capable of being 
delivered, the government attacks.  The minister resorts to 
attacks on our party or personal attacks on the person who makes 
the criticism of the process.  That is either myself or members 
of my party, my colleagues, who are under attack simply because 
we are quite realistic about dealing with these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can think about a lot of things.  In the Marshall decision, 
the minister made some really irresponsible comments about 
lumber, oil and gas after the Marshall decision came down.  What 
was the result if it?  Burnt Church, which is the current crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the Lubicon building a sort of pretend reserve here to 
air their complaints and to publicize what they felt had gone 
wrong.  I do not know what the total answer is to the Lubicon, 
but I know that a number of years ago the leader of the 
opposition at the time, who is now our Prime Minister, made a big 
promise.  It was a promise he could not keep and probably had no 
intention of keeping.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who did the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
blame yesterday?  It was the Alberta government.  If the Prime 
Minister, who was official opposition leader at the time, did not 
bother to consult with other governments to find out what their 
stand was, that is hardly an excuse for the position of the 
Alberta government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To reflect on that type of action is ridiculous and it means 
that the honour of the crown was again tarnished.  It means 
making promises that cannot be kept or that there is no intention 
of keeping.  In the Lubicon, to say that I did not know is 
ridiculous.  They had telephones as far back as 1993.  That is 
some news for the Prime Minister in case he was not aware of 
that.  In Burnt Church big promises were made but there was no 
delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lack of policy and a lack of progress in delivering 
what little the Liberals have.  When they fail, bad manners is no 
excuse for action.  The crown has other responsibilities but one 
of the words we never hear when we hear about those things is 
honour of the crown.  Metaphorically speaking, people are always 
wrapping themselves in the flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, let us talk about the honour of the crown.  Does the 
crown not have an obligation to have honour ascribed to itself by 
fighting for freedom of speech and making sure that that happens? 
The people of the Cross Lake community were denied a voice on 
their own public radio system to broadcast their concerns with 
what was coming down.  Whether they were right or wrong, they had 
a right to a voice and to be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does honour of the crown not require that the government to 
protect the weakest people in our country, our children?  I refer 
to the Sharpe decision where the government sat on its hands for 
close to a year and did nothing about it.  The decision allowed 
child pornography to be in the hands of pedophiles.  Does the 
honour of the crown not require a strong defence force to protect 
its territories and its people?  Where did the honour of the 
crown go on that issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are always hearing about health care.  The government cutback 
health care funding then bragged that it brought it back to where 
it almost used to be.  Where was the honour of the crown? Where 
was the obligation to the people of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about reasonable tax levels?  Is the honour of the crown not 
impugned when tax levels are so bad that people are leaving the 
country, moving out from underneath the so-called protection of 
the crown and moving to other tax jurisdictions?  How about 
responsible government that listens to the people?  How about a 
working justice system that makes our streets safe through a 
parole system that works to protect people?  How about a case 
that I am very strong on, a right to life for the unborn?  I do 
not believe that the honour of the crown is much protected in 
many of these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell the government that I want to see it start 
talking about honour of the crown in many more areas than simply 
Indian affairs.  The honour of the crown can be protected when 
land claim negotiations have respect for existing private 
property rights.  Affordable and conclusive settlements would 
also protect the honour of the crown and would state where the 
government, particularly the Alliance government when it is 
elected, stood.  It would be open and honest and would not raise 
expectations beyond all reason to then cut them back for 20 or 30 
years until finally people gave up or were driven to desperation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will see that all stakeholders are involved in negotiations. 
That is an honourable thing to do.  We will protect the 
democratic rights and freedoms of individual aboriginals on 
reserves, including private property rights so that people are 
not driven off the reserves due to lack of housing, lack of money 
or no private property rights, and where people can protect their 
families. 
I remind the government that the honour of the crown requires 
that this government look after all citizens of this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak today at third reading of Bill C-14, an act respecting 
an agreement with the Norway House Cree Nation.  This is a bill 
that concerns the Norway House Cree but, like any bill having to 
do with aboriginals, there are implications in other areas, even 
in the immediate region to which this agreement will apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This part of northern Manitoba has undergone many ecological 
changes as a result of the introduction of dams, and the 
harnessing of major waterways in the region.  Other aboriginal 
communities have been affected by these changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I mention this is because later on I intend to give 
the background to the northern flood agreement.  I think it 
important to name the communities which already have agreements: 
York Factory, Nelson House, and Split Lake.  For these 
communities there were bills to give legal effect to the 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have the agreement with Norway House and that would leave 
Cross Lake, which would signal the completion of this 
hydroelectric project, with its disastrous impact on the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should not restrict my criticism to Hydro Manitoba because 
many detractors, some of them in English Canada, have pointed a 
finger at the James Bay agreement.  They told us that the 
ecological impact of the bill and the James Bay agreement in 
northern Quebec is terrible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having studied the files on Norway House and the other 
communities I have mentioned, I can respond to these detractors 
that we in Quebec have no need to feel guilty about what has 
happened in northern Quebec, when we compare it to the situation 
in northern Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In northern Manitoba, the Churchill River was re-routed to empty 
into the Nelson, in order to have a stronger flow.  A whole 
string of dams and other structures was built in order to 
harness the current to generate hydroelectric power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact in northern Manitoba was greater, judging by the 
figures we have before us: 2,134 square kilometres of land 
affected, 67 of those within the reserves. 
I would, moreover, remind hon. members that this bill also 
covers the aspect of the expansion of Manitoba's reserves, in 
order to save the honour of the crown and to be able to tell the 
aboriginal people “We flooded part of your land, but we are 
going to compensate you for it.  For every acre flooded we'll 
give you four elsewhere”.  This is more or less what the bill we 
are looking at today does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the Bloc Quebecois expressed the opinion on second 
reading that it might be worthwhile making this into two bills, 
one dealing with compensation and the other with the creation of 
reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been an ecological disaster and has had a direct 
negative impact on the aboriginal peoples' traditional way of 
life, including their hunting and fishing.  Also affected was 
their full enjoyment of their natural environment, something 
that is very important to them. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we consider the flooding that occurred in northern 
Manitoba, and are somewhat familiar with the aboriginal issue, 
we realize this has had a major impact on their way of life. 
Everyone knows that flooding affects the forests and that, after 
a while, this will give rise to considerable mercury in the 
waterways.  This necessarily creates a fishing problem, members 
will agree.  In this regard, I must say that we are no better 
than anyone else; in northern Quebec, we had mercury poisoning 
too, but not to the same degree as in northern Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Native commercial and recreational areas were also harmed, areas 
that they had traditionally occupied. 
Archaeologists are saying that the Cree, the nation affected, 
could have lived in this part of northern Manitoba for 10,000 
years.  This means long before the Europeans arrived in North 
America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, these people had a way of life, of fishing, of 
hunting and of enjoying themselves.  All of this has upset the 
traditional ways of doing things.  There are therefore fewer 
fish for the reasons I have just given. Many fish did not 
survive the flooding because of the high levels of mercury and 
those that did contained mercury and, accordingly, the native 
people were denied their traditional subsistence fishing 
practice, which is extremely important to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drinking water was also contaminated because, as I said earlier, 
about 67 square kilometres of land in these reserves were 
flooded. Artesian wells were contaminated and aboriginals 
experienced a lot of problems. In fact, the agreement signed at 
the time includes provisions stating that the government must 
provide drinking water to aboriginals, since they could no 
longer use the water found on their reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also became more risky to travel by boat because of the lower 
water level. It goes without saying that if we divert a river 
into a bigger one, the level of water in the first river will 
necessarily be lower, since the water is diverted into a bigger 
river. This also had an impact on the ice level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, when man plays with nature, it can sometimes be 
dangerous. 
Unfortunately, the first victims of that situation are the 
residents of Norway House and those living in the five 
communities to which I referred earlier. This even had an impact 
on Lake Winnipeg's water level. The result was that some 
reserves found themselves with a lot less water around their 
territory. This had a major impact on people living in northern 
Manitoba, particularly aboriginals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we are here today dealing with this bill—and I believe 
the Canadian Alliance member mentioned it earlier—is because it 
has been almost 23 years since the Manitoba northern flood 
agreement was signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say it was signed, but that is not entirely accurate.  At a 
certain point, the government agreed to let these five 
communities sit down and say “Listen, the bill before us will 
certainly have an impact on each of our communities and it would 
perhaps be a good idea to organize a round table so that, if we 
decide to move, we will do so together so that we can take into 
account the impact this bill will have on each of us in our 
individual reserves”.  This was the strategy for a number of 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With its policies on funding during negotiations, the government 
agreed to give money to the parties to the agreement so that 
they could work on their negotiations with the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government realized that it was creating a sort of common 
front.  People were working well together and at a certain point 
the government said it no longer wished to fund the northern 
flood agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason is very simple.  The government simply wanted to 
break down this common front.  It began to work on each of the 
communities.  The first was Split Lake, I think.  I recall that 
one of the first speeches I gave here in the House, during the 
last parliament, concerned Split Lake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government said “We are prepared to come to an agreement 
with you. 
This is how we want to settle the matter”.  Finally, it 
introduced a bill to give force of law to the agreement it had 
entered into with the people of Split Lake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where things started to get a bit touchy, because some 
aboriginal communities said “There is an agreement with Split 
Lake, but not with us.  Not that we absolutely insist on an 
agreement right away, but if work is begun that will have an 
impact on Split Lake and they get compensation from you, just 
think of the impact your project will have on us, to whom you 
are not yet giving any compensation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how the government managed to destroy the common front 
of the five communities.  It is a pity, because basically the 
government tried to settle with one community as cheaply as 
possible and now it wants to apply the same scenario to the 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is, moreover, one agreement that has not been dealt with, 
and that is the one with Cross Lake.  I have just been listening 
to the words of the former chair of the Standing Committee on 
Aboriginal and Northern Affairs, who was saying that she had 
heard many witnesses voice the opinion that it was very 
important for the bill concerning Norway House to be passed. 
Indeed it is, but there were others who came before the 
committee and said that some changes had to be made.  In fact, I 
tried to introduce some of those in the form of motions and 
amendments yesterday.  Unfortunately the House rejected them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will return to this point later, since I had just 10 minutes 
for all my motions of yesterday.  I feel that the matter of 
rights is extremely important.  It is, moreover, one of the 
reasons the Bloc Quebecois will not be able to support this 
bill, because the importance of these rights is not recognized 
formally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The community in Cross Lake, in fact, was the last native 
community to be covered by a bill. The bill concerning Norway 
House is currently before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not know when the Cross Lake people will 
arrive.  They certainly appeared before the committee, though. 
I was there. They said “Listen, this makes no sense.  There were 
incredible gaps in the bill.  We do not agree to your settling 
with these people and then leaving us on the sideline”.  That is 
the government's strategy.  That was the strategy from the 
outset.  They break a common front, try to settle for as little 
as possible and, if the last group demands too much, they are 
told “Listen, we are not going to settle with you, you are 
asking too much”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion they are not the ones asking too much. 
Perhaps the government took advantage of an opportunity, of its 
divide and conquer strategy, to arrange to isolate the people. 
Today, they have a hard time resisting on their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, I unfortunately did not get very far in my speech, 
because I had only 10 minutes, and the motions were grouped 
together.  I think it important, however, to take a few minutes 
on the question of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Cree of Quebec and the natives in Cross Lake came to tell us 
that it was important to have the bill provide somewhere that 
the ancestral and general rights of native people are not 
threatened by this bill and the agreement referred to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, there are a number of people who said “We can 
consider this a treaty and therefore it is covered by section 35 
of the Constitution of Canada, by the Constitution Act, 1982”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read an excellent article by Mel Smith, which explained how 
inclusion of section 35 within the Canadian constitution was 
negotiated.  It is an absolutely incredible story.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took place over the telephone. There has been pressure to add 
the term “existing” to “treaty” in section 35 of the Canadian 
constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, some people are telling us that this is covered under 
section 35 of the Canadian constitution, but, according to 
Mr. Smith and several experts, we still do not understand the 
full scope of section 35. It was not enough to say that it is 
covered under section 35 and that there is no need to be 
concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, we endorsed the view of aboriginal people who told 
us “If, as you say, it is already covered under section 35 of 
the constitution, then why do you not add the term right to 
the bill? You yourself are saying that it does not change 
anything”. Yesterday, the government rejected the amendments 
proposed by the Bloc Quebecois to that effect. It is important 
to explain why we insisted on the issue of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said yesterday at the beginning of my speech, when we tell 
someone “I have a right to do this”, it is certainly because 
there is a legal basis and some legislation somewhere. If there 
is legislation, some may say that it is flawed, that it does not 
go far enough, that there are grey areas. These people are free 
to appeal. This is regularly the case with aboriginal issues. 
I would be curious to know how many cases involving aboriginals 
are now held up before the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some laws give rights to aboriginals, but the Supreme Court of 
Canada has certainly gone the furthest with respect to 
aboriginal rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, I spoke about a number of decisions and their impact. 
I described the evolution of aboriginal rights.  I often 
criticized the government's failure to act.  In my view, it is 
clinging to an outdated piece of legislation, the Indian Act, 
which is over 120 years old.  It is trying to tell us that it 
will sort out the aboriginal issue today with a piece of 
legislation that has been around for 120 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not a legal counsel, but this must be one of the few 
instances when the government has decided to enforce such an 
ancient statute.  It is ridiculous.  This must be one of the 
only areas where this is being done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think, in the case of the economy where the banks 
and takeovers are concerned or any other sector that lawmakers 
are called upon to discuss, it would be acceptable for them to 
say that, in the context of the year 2000, the third millennium, 
they are going to continue to operate with statutes that go back 
120 years.  It is preposterous.  Naturally aboriginals are 
forced to turn to the courts for justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why it is important for them to talk about rights.  That 
is why things are getting out of hand, as they are in Burnt 
Church right now.  That is why aboriginals believe that it is 
important for the word right to appear in bills like this one. 
It is so that they will not be told that they have given up their 
ancestral rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been precedents, people who have paved the way in the 
courts for aboriginals. 
I think it important that we look at this, because it has an 
impact on the bill before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, I paid tribute to Frank Calder, a Nisga'a.  In my 
opinion he really paved the way in the courts for aboriginals. 
In 1973, the supreme court finally recognized the existence of 
aboriginal title.  Before that, it had never existed.  The 
federal and provincial governments believed that it was their 
prerogative to pass laws and that there was no special law for 
aboriginals— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> I am sorry but I have to 
interrupt the hon. member.  It is my duty pursuant to Standing 
Order 38 to inform the House that the questions to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for New Brunswick Southwest, Health; the hon. member for 
Vancouver East, Housing. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was speaking of the Calder 
decision, in which aboriginal title was recognized and for the 
first time it was said that “Yes, there is occupation, 
possession and use of ancestral lands, there is aboriginal 
title”.  That is what the supreme court decided in 1973. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, counsel for the Crown said “There cannot be 
aboriginal title because the royal proclamation of 1763 
contained specific provisions”.  There are specific provisions 
in the treaties and in the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court refuted those arguments and, in the Calder 
decision, stated that there was aboriginal right and aboriginal 
title without explaining what that title was.  It merely stated 
that there was one.  That had to wait for the Guérin decision, 
in which the supreme court stated in 1984 that land entitlement 
was special because of its inalienable character, that the 
government had a fiduciary obligation toward the aboriginal 
people, and that the honour of the crown was at stake.  This was 
stated in several supreme court judgments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Alliance colleague has just said the same: the honour of the 
crown is at stake each time a treaty is signed, and each time 
legislation is passed in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One important step had been taken.  It was stated not only that 
there was aboriginal title, but also that this was inalienable 
in character and that the government ought to commit to 
defending the aboriginal people because of its fiduciary role. 
Hon. members will understand that the government is often 
uncomfortable with its role of trustee, as in the case of Burnt 
Church. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, we have a government that is the trustee of the 
native people and that must defend them.  However, it runs over 
the canoes of the natives with its boats.  This is hard to 
reconcile.  The government is certainly going to say the 
resource has to be protected and so on.  There is no proof, 
however, that the resource is being threatened at Burnt Church. 
I can understand the natives in Burnt Church who are told when 
they fish “You are entitled to put 50 lobster traps in the 
water, but the white community next door is entitled to put in 
50,000.  For you, it is 50”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people are starting to say “Listen, we are not responsible 
for declining stocks of fish and lobster in Miramichi Bay”.  I 
understand the natives, and the government is still stuck on its 
role as trustee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988 it was the Paul decision.  It held that the aboriginal 
title was <I>sui generis</I>, that is 
the only one of its kind.  This was another step forward.  The 
native title, and it is starting to be defined, is not only 
inalienable; it is unique.  Previously there were naturally 
decisions recognizing that natives were here first and that they 
had specific rights because they were the first inhabitants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then came the Gladstone decision.  It went even further.  It 
provided that, when the government wants to impose a restriction 
on a native right, it must justify doing so clearly.  Obviously 
in the case of Burnt Church, the government cites resource 
protection. 
This claim is not fully justified, however. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not providing a specific study to show what 
size of catch is feasible during and after the fishing season. 
The government is not saying.  The decision in Gladstone went 
even further.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I can understand the aboriginals in Burnt Church. It 
would have been important to define the notion of right in the 
bill before us, but the government decided otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also the Delgamuukw decision in 1997, which went even 
further. Previous decisions always dealt with hunting and 
fishing issues. That ruling goes further by stating that the 
territory itself is included, that aboriginals who can prove 
long term occupation are entitled to more than hunting and 
fishing privileges. They have the power to decide on activities 
and to regulate them, including economic activities. This is 
where it goes a little further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile what is the government doing? It does not do 
anything. Yet the score, so to speak, is 50 to 0 for aboriginals in 
supreme court rulings. The definition of title continues to 
evolve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Delgamuukw decision goes beyond hunting and fishing. It 
states that aboriginals have the power to regulate things over 
their own territory. This includes forestry, mining and several 
other activities over their territory. Delgamuukw is yet another 
step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Delgamuukw decision brought about something rather 
disconcerting for white people. When white people reach an 
agreement they sign a contract such as a lease or some kind of 
convention, but the Delgamuukw decision provides that the oral 
tradition will have the same weight as historical documents. 
This goes quite far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certain conditions: “Aboriginals must prove that 
they have occupied the entire territory in question before the 
arrival of the British”.  In the case of the Cree, with their 
10,000 years of history, and the Micmac with their 10,000, I do 
not think this should be hard to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“The occupation must have physically taken place and have been 
substantially maintained”.  A number of court decisions have 
said this.  I do not think it is difficult to prove.  The Micmac 
are in eastern Canada and the Cree in the north.  Archaeologists 
and the best experts will tell you that they were there before 
us.  They had a political system, an economy, agreements with 
their neighbours.  I think that it is fairly simple to show that 
they occupied the lands, and that the occupation took place 
physically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“The group in question must have exclusive jurisdiction and 
control of the land”.  This is akin to sovereignty, control of 
one's land.  There is no doubt that the Cree have always 
controlled their land, and that the Micmac have always 
controlled theirs, before the arrival of the British and even of 
the Europeans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will understand the importance to them of having the 
word “right” in the bill.  Unfortunately the Liberal Party has 
decided otherwise and dismissed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to speak a bit about consultation because I see this 
as an incredible oversight in the bill.  As members know, this 
agreement was to have the approval of the community proper. 
What happened was incredible.  The government said “Here is the 
agreement”.  It agreed with the band council on the referendum 
question and that was what they asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to the government's expectations, they lost the 
referendum.  The people said no because on the issue of 
ancestral rights it was not enough.  The government changed its 
tack and said “I declare the referendum null and void”.  People 
wondered why it voided the referendum.  It was because it had 
lost by five votes.  The government said “It is because people 
who live off the reserve were registered as natives and voted. 
We do not think they should have voted”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They held a second referendum.  They told the people before they 
voted “We have a cheque for $1,000 waiting for each native 
person in the community”, if they vote favourably, of course.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When someone waves a personalized cheque at a person who is one 
of the poorest in Canada, just before the Christmas holidays on 
top of it, and says “If you vote, you will have this cheque”, it 
seems to me that there is a bit of a problem there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will understand that this is why we had a bit of a hard 
time when the Liberal Party said that our referendums in Quebec 
are not always democratic because of the way we hold them.  I do 
not think we have anything to learn from the federal government 
with examples like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the problem. 
People appeared before the committee to tell us that it was not 
right that everyone was promised $1,000 if the outcome of the 
referendum was in favour of the agreement.  It is like buying 
the results of a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will have to object to this, because I think 
that the government did not do its job.  The money has probably 
already been paid.  The compensation has probably already gone 
to people and been spent, but we must not keep being held 
hostage and told that this is an implementation act, that it has 
been decided and signed several years ago, and that, now, a bill 
is needed to give it force of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should go back to the drawing boards.  If it was 
wrong, it can pay what it paid before. 
And if there is a different outcome in a few years with the 
Norway House agreement in an unbiased and properly held 
referendum, then the government can pay again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is responsible for the terrible mess.  Not just 
the ecological mess I mentioned earlier, but the democratic mess 
as well.  It is responsible for consultations which consisted of 
promising people things and offering them a cheque for voting in 
favour. This is one of the primary reasons we cannot support 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of rights is a key one for us.  It was very important 
to have it included in the bill.  The government left it out and 
the members of the ruling party were all too quick yesterday to 
cast their vote showing that they thought it was not important. 
But it was indeed important for aboriginals. 
Perhaps not those of Norway House, because they were told that 
when it got passed there would be compensation. However, the 
others in the vicinity, for example the people in Cross Lake, 
which is next to them, will feel the impact of the decisions on 
this.  They are being backed into a corner, because they are 
being told that the others have settled.  That has an impact. 
If the democratic process that has been used is flawed, then 
things need to be started over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has decided to reject the entire matter of 
rights. We are not obliged to agree, now that there is something 
missing from the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the word right had been included, it would not have cost 
the federal government anything.  If, as the government says, it 
is protected under clause 35, I do not see why the term right 
could not have been added.  That would have not cost it 
anything.  But there is a whole other matter, the fact that it 
does not want to recognize aboriginal rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not want to recognize them, even if the courts have 
recently said that there are ancestral rights, and that there 
are specific rights connected to the fact that they were the 
first inhabitants of this continent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not reject the bill merely because of the matter 
of rights, but because the consultation process was very badly 
handled.  I want the federal government, the Liberal government, 
to know that they need not lecture us on democracy when we hold 
our own referendum, and hold it properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government made some promises at the time, saying 
“If you vote no, it is as if you were telling us yes, in favour 
of renewed federalism”.  We have seen what happened as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it has anything to teach us about democracy. 
Our referendums and our elections are always carried out 
properly. If people are told “You are going to get $1,000 if 
it passes” there is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these two fundamental reasons, we will have to vote 
against Bill C-14.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do 
want to say I am pleased that we are finally at this point in 
Bill C-14 of coming before the House.  Hopefully we will see it 
passed.  I do not think there is any question that there have 
been problems in the whole process.  I must say I am pleased that 
it is here today.  Hopefully before the House puts itself to rest 
for this parliament, we will be able to see the bill passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take this opportunity to talk about the bill but also to 
comment on why we are here today.  Canada's first nations people 
were robbed for generations of the natural process of cultural 
and social change.  They were robbed of economic opportunities 
because of government policies.  They were forced to give up 
their treaty rights to make a living and even forced to give up 
their treaty rights in order to fight for this country in the 
world wars, the Korean War and other conflicts Canada was 
involved in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how many Canadians know our true history.  How many 
Canadians know that when these first nations soldiers came back 
they were not given the same rewards as other Canadian soldiers? 
They were not allowed to vote.  They had lost their treaty 
rights. I wonder, do we share this shameful part of our history 
with the rest of the world? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On many occasions the government has had the opportunity to 
right the injustices toward aboriginal people, but no, aboriginal 
people must fight for every single right they have, and most 
often in the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill before us is no different.  We should not be under any 
false impressions as to why this bill is before us today.  In 
1977 the federal government signed an open-ended flood agreement 
with first nations negatively affected by the diversion of water 
for hydro development in Manitoba.  This agreement was to have 
meant great economic success for the first nations involved; it 
was their chance for future economic progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the record, Mr. Warren Allmand, the Indian affairs minister 
at the time, was part of the negotiation of the northern flood 
agreement.  When he appeared before the standing committee on 
this bill he commented that he saw this bill as a modern day 
treaty.  For those who are under any impression about how the 
negotiators felt about this bill, they should know that it was 
seen as a modern day treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we are here today with this new bill before us is 
that in the northern flood agreement the Government of Canada 
once again failed to follow through on an agreement they made. It 
was an agreement that would have meant benefits to the first 
nations involved, but year after year they kept the first nations 
people in the courts, fighting for everything in that agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who think, well, too bad, if it is not a given they 
should have to go out there and fight and prove that is what the 
agreement meant, let me remind the House, all Canadians and all 
those public service workers how pay equity was a right in this 
country and how for 15 years women in this country had to fight 
for the right to pay equity with the government, which did not 
want to follow through on the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just in case some people think it is only the aboriginal people 
out there who have a beef on the issue of the government 
following through on the agreement, it is not.  I want those 
people to recognize that this is not just an aboriginal issue. It 
is an issue of the fact of the government not following through 
on agreements that it should be following through on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of not following through on the northern flood 
agreement, yes, some first nations agreed to changes, because 
they knew if they were ever going to have any chance whatsoever 
they had better not rely on the federal Liberal government.  They 
had to do something else.  They were fighting for survival.  One 
after the other renegotiated so that they would have that 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years we often hear of big corporations doing that to 
the small guy.  If the corporations just keep them in the courts 
long enough they will never be able to afford to fight. 
Ultimately the big guy wins out in the end.  It is no different 
here.  The first nations people were backed into a corner and in 
order to survive they had to renegotiate.  Let us not be under 
any false impression of why they are here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the perspective of the bill, the Norway House First Nation 
has the right to make that decision.  They have done that.  They 
have agreed that the bill will give them an opportunity. 
Under no circumstances whatsoever do they intend that this bill 
should give up any of their treaty or inherent rights, none 
whatsoever.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do find it unconscionable that the government was not willing 
to ensure this within the bill, to put it in words that in no 
way, shape or form would the bill affect the treaty or inherent 
rights of the first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government tells us that it will not.  The Norway 
House first nation is willing to accept that and, because the 
bill affects them, for that reason we should support it.  I am 
not going to be someone who tells them what they should be doing. 
They have had that happen for too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been consultation.  The process was not perfect; I do 
not think there is any question about it.  We have heard comments 
about referendums not being held properly and about situations 
where people may have been paid off.  All those questions came to 
light in the committee hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was felt that the issues were dealt with, but the bottom line 
was that the first nation approved this.  The chief and council 
who were representative of that first nation were re-elected, for 
the most part.  I think that is an indication that the community 
supported the process.  Therefore we should be supporting it 
because it applies foremost to the Norway House first nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we should not lose sight of the fact that there is 
another first nation out there, the Cross Lake first nation. They 
are not giving in.  Quite frankly, they have every right not to 
give in.  The original agreement was signed.  Negotiators to that 
agreement acknowledged that it was seen as a modern-day treaty. 
They believe that this first agreement, the northern flood 
agreement, in itself is what is best for the Cross Lake first 
nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They deserve to not have to go to the courts time and time 
again.  They deserve to have the opportunity to have it settled 
once and for all.  I would hope that the Liberal government will 
not force another first nation into the situation we see 
throughout the country.  I would hope that we do not have to see 
violence being the answer in order for rights to be upheld. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government supports the bill, I would ask that it also 
support the rights of the other first nations to make their 
decisions, that it seriously negotiate a settlement on the 
northern flood agreement with the Cross Lake first nation and not 
play the big bad corporate government, holding off until Cross 
Lake first nation is forced into starvation, forced into 
receivership, forced into not being able to have houses or pay 
for the wonderful hydro project that was supposed to make 
everything better for them.  They cannot even afford the hydro. 
The rates are higher in northern Manitoba because they do not 
have as dense a population.  They pay higher rates than other 
areas.  It makes one wonder why they are not out there jumping 
screaming and praising the whole process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As much as I will be supporting the bill, I think Canadian 
people need to know we are in this situation because once again 
the Liberal government has failed to follow through on an 
agreement with first nations people.  It is time it changed that 
approach or this country will never ever be out of turmoil.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Bill C-14, an act respecting an agreement 
with the Norway House Cree Nation for the settlement of matters 
arising from the flooding of lands, and respecting the 
establishment of certain reserves in the province of Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to have detailed commentary on the bill.  However, 
due to time constraints, we realize that the passage of the bill 
is a lot more important to the principles involved than having 
our few words on the record.  We will be brief to make sure that 
the bill can be passed in a timely manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation speaks to two issues:  the Norway House Cree 
Nation's master implementation agreement resulting from the 
flooded lands, and the reserve establishment, particularly in 
reference to the Manitoba treaty land entitlement framework 
agreement of 1997.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, however, we are hardly impressed by the combination of 
these issues that the legislation represents.  The two main 
issues addressed in this bill are far too important to have them 
lumped together.  We certainly realize that the issues are 
related, but these issues should be addressed separately in order 
to provide each bill with the attention it deserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislation is not necessary for the implementation of this 
agreement since it is already going ahead.  Instead, this 
legislation is another step toward implementing the terms of the 
northern flood agreement and the federal government's obligations 
under the agreement with regard to the first nations that have 
signed implementation agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One advantage of this legislation should be the opportunity to 
move away from the the dispute resolution process to a more 
conciliatory form of negotiation and discussion.  This is 
something we would all welcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address the second part of this legislation, 
establishing reserves in the province of Manitoba.  Part 2 of 
this legislation is expected to assist in establishing reserves 
where an obligation exists in a current or future agreement to 
set aside land for this purpose.  Part 2 appears to be beneficial 
to the first nations by allowing them to take advantage of 
conditions on a timely basis and speeding up the process of 
reserve creation.  Because of that, as I mentioned, there are a 
number of intricate terms we would have liked to explore, 
happenings of the past that we would like to rehash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again because of time constraints, and although it would have 
been great to get all of that on the record, in doing so we would 
compromise the possibility of getting the legislation put 
through.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now faced with the following problem. We come here to 
pass legislation with full knowledge of the facts. Our speakers 
are usually well prepared to take part in the debates. In a 
democracy, the most basic rules of courtesy and decency require 
the government to advise us of the bills it wishes to put before 
the House. Never, in any parliament, would a government call a 
bill at the very last minute without advising anyone as is 
being done here right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we only have 10 minutes left for government orders, could 
we not agree to say that it is 5.30 p.m. Then, when the House 
leader asks to bring this bill back before the House, we can 
have a very objective and effective debate, gladly and with good 
humour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> With great glee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> We could resume consideration of the bill 
in the light of a strong debate. That is what I am asking for. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  As usual, the hon. 
House leader of the Bloc has suggested a very gentle means to get 
the Chair out of a bit of a problem.  The House leader is quite 
correct.  The House operates in a fashion that provides for 
fairness between all parties. The Chair thanks the hon. member 
very much for the suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the House give unanimous consent to the suggestion of the House 
leader of the Bloc Quebecois that the clock be seen as 5.30 p.m.? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. 
I just want to clarify something further to what the House 
leader of the Bloc said.  That is that we understood this bill 
would be coming forward on October 5 and we have now found out 
that the bill will be coming forward tomorrow.  Now, at about 22 
minutes after five, is the government planning on bringing report 
stage of this bill in for the second and third groupings? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would look like perhaps this Chamber does not know how to run 
the country when it is putting bills in here at the last moment. 
I see that the government House leader is here.  Maybe he could 
enlighten us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Actually, it is not 
so much a reflection on the Chamber as it is on the chair 
occupant who also is faced with the same dilemma. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House leader of the Bloc has suggested a very elegant means 
to get us through this, but obviously the government House leader 
should have an opportunity to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will forget the comments 
that were made by the last speaker, which is probably the best 
most of us could do at any time, and I will refer to the other 
comments that were made that were more enlightening, not that any 
of them could be less enlightening than the one that we just 
heard.  I would agree to call it 5.30 and to end this debate for 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a further point 
of order. 
The House leader has announced that I am not the House leader 
and I certainly do know my place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask, if by the good graces of this Chamber, we 
call it 5.30 now, six minutes early, when might we see Bill C-8 
come again, because I think it is important enough that it needs 
to be discussed now.  I do not think we are prepared to give 
unanimous consent to just send it off into the proverbial night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Actually, we will 
not get into this.  We have a suggestion on the floor to see the 
clock as 5.30 p.m. and that is what we will address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there unanimous consent to see the clock as 5.30 p.m.?

expiry of gun control legislation that is not proven effective

and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it has been a year and a half since we 
debated this bill and it seems the only way I can get three hours 
of debate on this common sense piece of legislation is by doing 
it one hour at a time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must once again deplore the fact that all private members' 
bills selected in the draw are not automatically declared votable 
items in this House.  I have been working on this bill, the 
firearms law sunset act, since 1994.  I first introduced a sunset 
clause as an amendment to Bill C-68 during the debate in the 
spring of 1995.  This bill was first introduced in the House as 
Bill C-351 on September 28, 1995, then Bill C-357 on December 2, 
1996 and again as Bill C-278 on December 7, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is most disappointing to put so much effort into a piece of 
legislation to have it die again and again after just one hour of 
debate and no vote.  This is a situation that must be rectified 
if we are ever going to have a chance of our constituents' 
legislative initiatives being given their rightful consideration 
in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time there is a shooting, either here or in the United 
States, there is a clamour from the Liberal anti-gun crowd for 
more gun control laws.  This despite the auditor general's 
warnings in his 1993 report that there was no statistical 
evidence to prove the previous set of gun control laws 
implemented by the Progressive Conservative government was 
working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need, what the people really want and what the Canadian 
Alliance Party promises to deliver is effective gun control laws. 
As we have seen with Bill C-68, the Firearms Act, tougher does 
not equal effective because it is only tougher on law-abiding 
responsible gun owners and totally ineffective at controlling the 
criminal use of guns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-409 would rectify the government oversight by 
implementing a process that would ensure that only gun law 
provisions that were proven to be effective by the auditor 
general would remain the law of the land.  People arguing against 
this bill will have to argue that they support gun control laws 
even if they do not work, no matter how much they cost and no 
matter that other measures might work better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not arguing that gun control laws are unnecessary, only 
that police time and resources should be spent on measures that 
get the best bang for our tax dollars.  That is exactly what Bill 
C-409 is designed to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides a five year sunset provision on all gun 
control measures, which means the measure would be automatically 
repealed unless the auditor general reported that it had been a 
successful and cost-effective measure to increase public safety 
and reduce violent crime involving the use of firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general's report would have to be considered by a 
committee representing broad interests in the firearms community 
and the committee report would be presented to and concurred in 
by the House or the sunset provision would take effective 
automatically at the end of five years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also provides safeguards to allow parliament the time 
necessary to make amendments to allow ineffective gun control 
measures to expire without affecting parts of the legislation 
that are effective at fighting firearms crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is the total opposite of the ill-conceived Bill C-68, 
the Firearms Act, passed into law on December 5, 1995 and 
prematurely brought into force on December 1, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what the auditor general would have uncovered if 
he had been conducting operational and financial audits of Bill 
C-68 since it was brought into force.  The auditor general would 
chastise the government for ignoring his 1993 recommendations by 
proceeding with the implementation of even more costly and 
complex gun control laws without first evaluating whether 
previous gun law control laws were working effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general would report that the justice department's 
polls on public support for the gun registry were biased because 
they failed to reveal to respondents the estimated cost and 
impact the legislation would have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general would have found that despite spending half 
a billion dollars on gun registry, biker gangs, bank robbers, 
homicidal and suicidal maniacs are still having no trouble 
getting their hands on firearms through the black market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general would have found that despite spending half 
a billion on the gun registry there has been no reduction in the 
number of firearms being smuggled into the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general would have also reported that the gun 
registry has had no effect whatsoever in reducing criminal use of 
firearms.  The number of armed robberies, the number of homicides 
or the number of suicides are not being reduced by this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general would have found that despite the fact that 
1,700 bureaucrats are working on the gun registry, there are 
fewer police on our streets today than were on our streets 30 
years ago when measured by the number of criminal incidents per 
officer. Statistics Canada put it very simply.  In 1962 there 
were 20 criminal incidents per police officer.  In 1997 there 
were 46 criminal incidents per police officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general would have found out that the Department of 
Justice's multimillion dollar television ads are grossly 
misleading because the ads say the only consequence for 
unlicensed gun owners will be that they will not be able to buy 
ammunition.  The truth is that unlicensed gun owners will become 
instant made in Ottawa criminals at the end of December and could 
be put into jail for up to five years.  We must think about that. 
That is very misleading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general would have found out that as of September 2, 
2000 the Department of Justice had only issued 286,000 firearms 
licences in the last 21 months, that is 13,630 per month, and 
that there was a backlog of 339,000 licence applications.  He 
would have also noted that it would take the Department of 
Justice more than 25 months to get rid of this backlog and 12 
more years to process the licences from the remaining 2 million 
gun owners, which is the government's estimate.  They have not 
even applied yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general would include in his report the justice 
minister's 1995 promise to parliament that the firearms registry 
would cost only $85 million to implement and run a deficit of 
only $2.2 million over five years.  The auditor general would 
then report that the actual cost over the five years was $325 
million and the deficit was not $2.2 million but $310 million. 
That is almost 150 times as much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general would go on to report that his sources in 
the justice department have provided documents that show the 
firearms registry budget for this fiscal year alone has already 
exceeded $260 million and will top $300 million before the end of 
March 2001, this year alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general would remind parliament that the justice 
minister promised user fees would cover the entire cost of the 
program, but as of August 11, 2000 the government had collected 
only $17,139,000 in user fees and owed refunds of approximately 
$1,234,000.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general would discount the Department of Justice 
statistics about the number of firearms licences refused and 
revoked and the legal gun sales blocked.  He would write that 
these results have been achieved because of better background 
checks and information management and had absolutely nothing to 
do with the registration of guns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He would also confirm earlier findings by the Privacy 
Commissioner of Canada that a large percentage of the blocked 
sales were as a result of incorrect information on 3.5 million 
Canadians in the RCMP infamous FIP, firearms interest police 
databank.  That is serious and is a violation of our rights as 
individual Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general's report would make the following key points 
with respect to blocked gun sales.  That is one of the 
government's claims for success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the government has had the means to achieve these kinds 
of results for the past 20 years with the old FAC, firearms 
acquisition certificate program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there would be no need to create a half billion dollar 
gun registry for rifles and shotguns to achieve these results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the auditor general would point out that all these 
hundreds of millions have blocked only the legal sale of 
firearms. Absolutely nothing has been done to stop anyone from 
buying firearms on the black market.  That is where the real 
problem is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general would report that the gun registry is 
riddled with errors and is absolutely no help to the police in 
fighting against real criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously this bill needs more time to be fully explained and 
debated by the members of the House.  At this point I would like 
to seek the unanimous consent of the House to have another hour 
of debate on this bill at future time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. member have the 
unanimous consent of the House to have another hour of debate at 
some future time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am really 
disappointed in that.  We have a common sense piece of 
legislation that asks the government to review the laws that it 
put in place way back in 1995 to see if they are effective.  What 
I hear the Liberal members saying is that they do not want to 
review their laws.  They do not want to check to see whether they 
are effective.  They are willing to spend hundreds of millions of 
dollars on something that will produce no cost effective 
measurable benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are talking about here.  I pointed out all of 
the things that the auditor general would have reviewed and would 
have found in his study on it.  What Liberal members are saying 
in effect is that they will put through laws whether they are 
effective or not.  They will not use those resources to put more 
police on the street.  They will spend it putting a piece of 
paper beside every gun in the country whether it makes sense or 
not.  That is what I hear them saying.  I hope all Canadians will 
take note that the Liberal government is willing to take money 
away from other areas where it could be used very effectively and 
plough it into this.  It will not review it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have 60,000 people a year who die as a result of cancer.  We 
spend about $16 million a year on research in that area.  We have 
spent close to $300 million this year alone on a gun registry 
that has no measurable benefit, will not save lives or do 
anything that will help Canadians.  If we were to put that money 
into cancer research, just think what that would accomplish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the choice the government has made.  It is not willing 
to let the auditor general review the legislation to see if it is 
effective.  It is not willing to see whether that money would be 
more effective in health care or in putting more police on the 
street than in a very bureaucratic, useless gun registry that by 
the way and in conclusion is one huge boondoggle.  The mess that 
is in Miramichi right now, the backlogs and the problems that are 
being faced by gun owners are horrific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members could read my e-mails for just one or two days, they 
too would realize that we have to review this and we should allow 
the auditor general to do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-409 proposes that we repeal the Firearms Act and indeed 
all gun control legislation in Canada without giving it a 
reasonable time to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Yorkton—Melville would propose sunsetting a 
complex piece of legislation and an important public safety 
initiative just one year after it is fully implemented.  In this 
scheme it would be impossible to accurately measure the 
comprehensive benefits of the firearms program.  For this reason 
the Minister of Justice is firmly opposed to Bill C-409. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Justice already has a plan to evaluate the 
program's success in achieving its objectives.  Bill C-409 
ignores the public safety accomplishments that have already been 
achieved by the Firearms Act even before implementation is 
complete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians can already see the positive impact of Bill C-68 and 
continue to strongly support the government's position.  The hon. 
member knows that more than 80% of Canadians support gun control 
and that the Supreme Court of Canada has unanimously found the 
Firearms Act to be both constitutional and directed to enhancing 
public safety.  It is perplexing that the member for 
Yorkton—Melville chooses to ignore the foregoing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about what the Firearms Act has already 
done for public safety.  The Minister of Justice is confident 
that within a reasonable time after the new firearms law has been 
fully implemented its effectiveness will be even more 
demonstrable.  However, the short timeframe proposed in Bill 
C-409 is simply unworkable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time ever the new law requires instant background 
checks before any firearms transfer can proceed.  As of the 
beginning of September of this year, over 4,352 potentially 
dangerous gun sales were sent to further investigations.  These 
cases included people with past or recent histories of violence, 
break and enter, theft, drug involvement, or people who were 
trying to acquire guns they were not licensed to purchase. 
Background checks are an important step in ensuring that 
potentially dangerous individuals do not have access to firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the kind of situation the new system was designed to 
control.  Every member of the House should share the goal of 
keeping firearms out of the hands of potentially dangerous 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost one million Canadians have complied with the licensing 
requirements.  To date more than 898 licence applications have 
been refused for public safety concerns.  Additionally, 1,217 
licences have been revoked for individuals deemed no longer 
eligible to hold a licence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the new system's capacity to more effectively 
check police and court records, the number of licence revocations 
is close to 20 times higher than the total of the previous five 
years.  In light of such information, even the hon. member for 
Yorkton—Melville cannot deny the value of the gun control 
provisions.  It is through results such as this that the Canadian 
public knows the new gun control program will make their homes 
and their communities as a whole much safer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The choices laid out today are clear.  If Bill C-409 were to 
become law and all Canadian gun laws were sunsetted, Canada would 
be left with no licensing, no registration, nothing.  The 
adoption of Bill C-409 would put lives at risk, and that is 
unacceptable. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when the rest of the world, in search of a better way 
to control firearms, turns to Canada as a world leader, the hon. 
member for Yorkton—Melville wants Canada to revoke the gun 
control legislation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, unlike members opposite, is committed to 
promoting a culture of safety and making Canada safer.  We have 
listened to the Canadian public.  Again and again Canadians tell 
us they support our firearms program.  Indeed a majority of 
Canadians surveyed in a poll released by the hon. member for 
Yorkton—Melville on the day of the tragic events at Columbine 
high school felt that, if I may quote, “ensuring that all rifles 
and shotguns are registered” is a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about specific parts of the bill.  The hon. member 
would have the auditor general and his office evaluate a complex 
piece of legislation and a major public safety program.  To meet 
the bill's timelines an evaluation would have to end before all 
the benefits of our program could be measured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I agree with the need to evaluate laws.  We heard months 
of testimony on gun control.  We listened to what Canadians told 
us.  We made sure the law would be effective.  We built in an 
assessment program.  We continue to streamline and improve the 
program and will continue to ensure the program meets the public 
safety objectives Canadians expect.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact remains, however, that when any new law comes into 
force we need to allow a certain amount of time before we can 
assess its impact and effectiveness.  Individuals need to adjust 
to new requirements.  Law enforcement agencies need to adjust to 
new responsibilities.  The judiciary needs time to consider the 
law's meaning and intent as cases are presented.  It takes more 
time than the hon. member's proposal would allow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Firearms Act is no different.  To assess its effect on 
public safety, on the incidence of violent crime, and on cost 
effectiveness, we have to allow time for the act to be fully 
implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should know that when the former Minister of 
Justice appeared before the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Legal Affairs he spoke about the evaluation process.  He stated 
that the Department of Justice would be monitoring experience 
with registration, licensing to determine what improvements could 
be made and making that information available to parliament and 
to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evaluation plan calls for assessments of the extent to which 
the operational elements of the Firearms Act, part III of the 
criminal code, and their associate programs have been implemented 
and whether their objectives are being achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me repeat again.  Bill C-409 is not realistic in its 
timeframes, and the Minister of Justice is opposed to it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate.  I commend 
the hon. member for Yorkton—Melville for bringing the bill 
forward and for his tireless pursuit of this issue.  I know he 
has put a great deal of effort and passion into bringing the bill 
before the Canadian people and getting some of the facts on the 
record, which are extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  Bill C-68 and the gun registry are not about 
effective gun control.  They are an ineffective, discriminatory, 
expensive attempt to sell the public on something they do not 
achieve, and that is public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very dismayed to hear the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Justice misstate the Supreme Court of Canada's 
interpretation of the gun challenge.  At no time did it endorse 
the particular legislation as having anything to do with public 
safety.  What it said is the government has the right to 
legislate in that area.  That is a subtle but extremely important 
difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-409 speaks about bringing some degree of accountability 
to the venture the government has undertaken.  What it calls for 
is an expiry or a sunset clause that would negate the legislation 
after five years if it was not cost effective.  That is all the 
hon. member is trying to do.  He is trying to bring about some 
element of accountability and cost effective examination or 
measure to increase public safety vis-à-vis a connection between 
legislation and a reduction in violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation was first brought forward in the heat and 
passion of and in the fallout from a terrible incident in 
Montreal.  The massacre at l'École Polytechnique is a black mark 
on Canadian history and will always be there, to the horror of 
Canadians.  However the legislative response that was drafted in 
the wake of that tragedy is not proportionate.  It does not 
respond to that type of incident.  That horrible crime was 
perpetrated by a mentally ill person who used a gun that was 
illegal in the first place.  The legislation has nothing to do 
with that.  It would have had no bearing on and would not have 
prevented such a tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party has always supported sensible gun control 
measures.  The legislation is not about gun control.  It is about 
bureaucratic red tape.  It is an intrusive piece of legislation. 
I apologize for using the word target, but it targets the wrong 
people.  Criminals are not participating and never will 
participate in this type of registry.  It targets duck hunters, 
target shooters, Olympic shooters, farmers, fishermen, and 
average Canadians who use a rifle for pest control or leisure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is not about public safety.  It is about 
criminalizing individuals who were participating in, enjoying and 
getting some degree of security out of a legitimate and rightful 
pursuit in their communities.  All of a sudden, if they refuse to 
participate, they will be criminalized.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the intangible results of the government's pursuit of the 
legislation will be felt in the criminal justice system in the 
frustration that will be felt by average citizens when called 
upon to do jury duty.  They will sit in the jury box and look 
with cynicism and antagonism toward the crown and the police who 
are prosecuting people for a reasonable and lawful pursuit.  This 
is one of those intangible factors that is again lost on the 
government and is obviously lost on the Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not recount the statistics and the figures with respect 
to the money and the number of bureaucrats and government 
employees who have been caught up in the pursuit of the giant 
propaganda effort that is taking place on the part of the 
government, but they are staggering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This now infamous Bill C-68, better known as the Firearms Act, 
has been implemented by the government and sold to the public on 
a false premise.  The public has been sold a bill of goods 
literally that this would somehow impact on violent crime and 
that it would somehow save lives and prevent violence.  Where is 
any evidence that this will somehow protect or save lives?  It 
does not exist.  This legislative response is completely off 
base, off target.  It was arrogantly, ineffectively and 
wastefully put in place to distract from the real issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police across the country are desperately in need of resources. 
They are desperately in need of support from the government, from 
the solicitor general and from the Department of Justice, and 
they are not getting it.  They tell us that resources are scarce 
and that they are using priority choices to decide where the 
money goes, yet they are pumping millions of dollars into the 
legislation while there is not enough money for overtime, for 
equipment or for training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police officers are being forced to do without.  They are being 
forced to deal with the ever complicated and ever increasing 
presence of organized crime and high tech crime.  There is no 
question that, on a rational basis and looking at this in terms 
of priorities, the money would be better spent elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put on record some of the recent statistics from 
Australia and Great Britain where they have pursued this type of 
registry in advance of the Canadian example.  Great Britain and 
Australia have both had disastrous results as a fallout from gun 
registry.  In Australia the gun ban that took place in 1996 
resulted in armed robberies increasing by 70% between 1996 and 
1998.  Unarmed robberies went up by 20% and attempted murders by 
300%.  Unlawful entry with intent to break and enter involving 
property rose by 30,000 cases in Australia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A study from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding the armed 
criminal, a survey of incarcerated felons, included in its 
results that 91% of those surveyed agreed that smart criminals 
would try to find out if a potential victim were armed before 
they decided to act.  Of those surveyed, 82% agreed that the gun 
laws only affect law-abiding citizens and therefore would enable 
criminals to know that most likely those they would prey on would 
be unarmed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gun registration has already failed terribly in the United 
Kingdom, as its overall violent crime rate increased 2.2%, with a 
19% overall increase in muggings since 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent policy conference of the Progressive Conservative Party 
in Quebec City reaffirmed its opposition to this specific part of 
the gun registry.  We have to be clear on this. This pertains to 
the registry of long guns.  The opposition has clearly stated its 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will always hear the government drone on about the opposition 
being opposed to gun control.  That is not the case.  We have had 
gun control in the country since the 1950s with respect to 
pistols, certain rifles and shotguns that were already deemed of 
an unlawful nature.  That is not the subject of this debate.  We 
are talking about shotguns and rifles that have been in use and 
have been in the possession of Canadians for hundreds of years, 
since the country began.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the Liberals proceeded with legislation on the unproven 
premise that a mandatory firearm registry would lead to a 
reduction in firearm related crime.  One of the false premises 
was to inflate the statistics.  For example, if a weapon was 
found at the scene of a crime or alleged crime, just present, not 
used or involved in the particular allegation of criminal 
activity, it would somehow be included as a firearms related 
crime.  It was completely duplicitous and misleading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first instance, long guns are rarely the weapon of 
choice, I would suggest, in premeditated criminal activity.  The 
Liberal government has aimed this law at a segment of the 
population that already acts responsibly and complies with 
reasonable, previously existing gun control measures.  So again, 
there is a false premise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gun registration will not prevent or even reduce most forms of 
violent crime.  It creates a false impression that having a 
little sticker or laser imprint on a gun will somehow prevent it 
from being used in a dangerous or unlawful fashion.  It is a 
completely false premise.  That little imprint or sticker will no 
more prevent that gun from firing than putting a bullet in the 
chamber; it is ridiculous to suggest otherwise.  The government 
has failed to provide any proof whatsoever that gun related crime 
will be reduced as a result of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned earlier, Australia and Great Britain have already 
proven that this type of legislation actually leads to an 
increase in violent crime.  The promises made by the former 
minister of justice that it would cost only $85 million have 
already been disproved.  We now know, as the hon. member for 
Yorkton—Melville quoted extensively, the costs that relate to 
this.  We are now nearing the half billion dollar mark with 
respect to the implementation of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that this legislation has already cost Canadians 
over $134 million and not a single gun has been registered to the 
extent that it is in a system that is up and operating.  The 
system has yet to be in effect.  I would suggest that the 
infrastructure in place at present could be used to enhance CPIC, 
to enhance the DNA data bank registry, to incorporate a system of 
registering sex offenders in the country.  That is the type of 
registry that we need, registering the criminals and not the 
guns.  This is where the effort should be and where the 
legislation should be pointed, not at registering an inanimate 
object and indicating to the public that somehow this will affect 
crime and somehow protect Canadians.  It is a false premise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I indicate clearly that we support the initiative that has been 
taken by my hon. friend and hope that Canadians will somehow 
grasp what is taking place in the country and reflect that in 
their vote in the coming election, because this legislation will 
not change until the government changes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the 
debate on Bill C-409, an act to provide for the expiry of gun 
control legislation that is not proven effective within five 
years of coming into force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak about this particularly because it is such 
an obstacle and a hindrance to the need for using guns in a 
legitimate way in a rural area such as the one I live in, in 
Cariboo—Chilcotin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that members here and many people in the city do not 
realize the need for a gun and the cost of not having a gun for 
some people.  I can tell many stories about people who have run 
into difficulty with wild animals.  I can tell the story of a man 
who was without a gun and was killed and eaten by a bear.  I can 
talk about parents who fear for their children who walk to school 
because in winter there are cougars patrolling the roads for cats 
and dogs and whatever else might satisfy their appetites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I speak about this I want to have a practical attitude to 
what I say, but I want to begin by complimenting the author of 
the bill, the member for Yorkton—Melville.  He and his staff 
have worked tirelessly for over five years to inform Canadians 
about the bad law and the enormous waste encompassed in Bill 
C-68.  I would like the member to know that his contribution in 
calling the government to account on this duplicitous legislation 
is appreciated by so many people in my riding and indeed by all 
of rural British Columbia.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that in the Ottawa <I>Sun</I>, Peter Worthington, editor 
emeritus, said yesterday of the hon. member for Yorkton—Melville 
that not much gets by him and that he sends out statistical 
findings “much as Johnny Appleseed was reputed to throw apple 
seeds into the wind and hope they would take root”.  He says 
that the member's website is a “treasure trove of facts and 
arguments” why the federal government's gun controls, started in 
the mid-70s and refined by the then gauche justice minister in 
1995, are “a costly, emotional and pointless boondoggle”.  I 
could go on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has now been five years since the passage of the infamous 
Bill C-68.  Each week we have seen increasing evidence that the 
new gun registry is only a white elephant, a large, cumbersome, 
costly structure that will do nothing to reduce crime.  In fact, 
it will do quite the opposite, as has already been reported by 
the statistics coming from Australia and Great Britain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why?  Because hundreds of millions of dollars are misspent as a 
result of Bill C-68 and when these dollars are misspent they 
cannot be spent where they need to be spent.  Once a dollar is 
gone, it is not there for use somewhere else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might say the same thing about the people involved in this. 
When I realized that about 400 RCMP officers alone are involved, 
I realized that when they are registering guns these people 
cannot be taking part in the activities that we normally expect 
policemen to be doing.  If these hundreds of millions of dollars 
were spent on new equipment for the RCMP or for hiring additional 
law enforcement officers, it would make a difference.  The 
taxpayer would get something back for the dollars invested.  This 
costly boondoggle, this gun registry, returns nothing and never 
will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know ministers and government are unwilling to admit their 
error unless they are apologizing for something someone else did 
some time earlier.  They are particularly unwilling to admit 
their error when money, hundreds of millions of dollars, has been 
wasted.  Today we have before us the solution, the opportunity 
for the minister and the government to save face and the 
opportunity for the opposition to demonstrate the value of 
intelligence, hard work and perseverance via a private member's 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The happy solution is in the bill before us today, Bill C-409. 
The bill would provide for a five year sunset provision on all 
gun legislation unless the auditor general finds that the 
legislation has been a successful and cost effective measure to 
increase public safety and reduce violent crime.  This makes 
perfect sense to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know something about what the auditor general does because I 
sit on the public accounts committee and meet regularly with his 
staff and with other members of that committee looking at 
government programs and departments.  The criteria that the 
Auditor General of Canada uses are, first, value for money spent, 
and second, if the money being spent is being used for what it 
was intended for, if the programs are doing what they were 
intended to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he were to look at the bill and find that, wonder of wonders, 
it is money well spent, good value, the program is doing exactly 
what it was intended to do and crime and accident rates are down, 
this would be a great bill and it would not be withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, if he found that it was the tremendous 
boondoggle that it has been turning out to be, if in fact it was 
not doing what it was intended to do, the auditor general would 
be able to submit his report and under the provisions of the bill 
the sunset clause would kick in and it would be withdrawn. There 
would be no loss of face because it would be the auditor general 
who would point out quite clearly that this has not been a bill 
that has done what it was intended to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The attractiveness of sunset legislation is that it forces 
bureaucracies to work to ensure that the regulations and measures 
pertaining to the legislation are cost effective.  If it is, the 
legislation can be renewed.  If not, the legislation is 
automatically appealed and everyone is better off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My view is that the new gun registry will fail in any cost 
benefit or cost effectiveness test.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If I and other Canadians are correct, the legislation will be 
repealed eventually and the waste of money will cease.  If we are 
wrong, we will sing the praises of the government for its 
foresight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-409 would be good legislation.  I appeal to all members 
of the House to look at the legislation.  At least give it an 
honest and fair look in a non-partisan way.  See its merit and 
support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have a couple of minutes left, I would also like to bring 
to the attention of the House the serious problem that our 
Liberal justice ministers have created for millions of legitimate 
gun owners across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>December 31 of this year is the deadline for obtaining the new 
possession only licence, or the possession and acquisition 
licence.  That is only two months away.  Those who do not have a 
valid possession licence at that time will be in violation of the 
law despite repeated attempts to comply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people I have asked for support who say they cannot 
because they are Liberals, but they have come to me as their 
member of parliament to ask for support.  What do they want? 
They want help to get through the bureaucratic process of getting 
their firearms registered and their licensing completed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One person told me that he was sitting at supper one evening 
when he got a call from a lady.  She said “You sent an 
application in with all those guns you want registered.  We need 
to know the length of the stock.  We need to have the numbers 
verified that are on it.  We need to know if the stock has been 
changed on another gun.  We need to know the length of the barrel 
on this gun.  We need to know why there is no model number on 
this gun”.  He looked and he said “In that instance there is no 
model on the gun”.  She said “We know that.  We know that gun 
never did have a model”.  When he laughed, she said “Are you 
laughing at me?”  He said “No, I am just laughing at the 
process we are going through”.  She said “I do not think I can 
talk to you any longer,” and she hung up on him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This same man has received calls in the evening and on Sundays 
to get his registrations completed.  It is a terrible 
bureaucratic mess.  And he still does not have his guns 
registered. That is the problem Canadians are facing.  I have 
written to the justice minister and asked her to solve the 
problem for this man and others but I have had no response. To 
the best of my knowledge neither have they. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents are reporting long delays in their dealings with 
the firearms centre in Miramichi, difficulty in getting through 
on the toll free lines and failure to get answers to their 
questions.  We understand that at the current rate of processing 
it will take several years to complete the registry and provide 
some assurance that the information is complete and accurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should not be placing citizens in a position of 
breaking the law when compliance is not possible because of 
bureaucratic complexity and delay.  I would ask the minister to 
come to her senses, extend the deadline for these licences by at 
least 12 months, and take seriously the provisions of Bill C-409.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to talk about Bill C-409 
put forward by the member for Yorkton—Melville, which is an act 
to provide for the expiry of gun control legislation that has not 
proven effective within five years of coming into force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to read some policy.  We believe there should be 
severe mandatory penalties for the criminal use of any weapon. We 
are committed to keeping guns out the hands of violent criminals 
as a necessary part of making our communities safer.  We will 
replace the current firearms law with a practical firearms 
control system that is cost effective and respects the rights of 
Canadians to own and use firearms responsibly.  This policy was 
approved in January at the national convention and was adopted on 
March 25. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I became a member of parliament in 1993 firearms 
regulations were in place from the previous administration which 
were to come into effect on January 1, 1994. 
For long guns, that included very specific storage provisions. I 
took those responsibilities very seriously and, prior to arriving 
here on January 1, 1994, I had my firearms in safe storage within 
my residence.  I was happy to do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a prevalent opinion among most firearm owners that 
there are a lot of acceptable and appropriate ways to regulate 
but by any objective test the registry that has been put into 
effect by Bill C-68 is a boondoggle and would not meet any 
objective test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislation and government operations are held accountable in 
two ways.  The first way is through the provision of information 
to the public and the other is accountability through such 
devices as the auditor general.  In the federal arena it operates 
through access to information requests, through the auditor 
general and through this place, if we can access what we need to 
access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the Canadian Firearms Centre, what we have in 
this legislation is one individual, the member for 
Yorkton—Melville, who has his hands full trying, through access to 
information, to access very necessary information to hold this 
whole exercise accountable.  He is fighting all the resources of 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a minister who brought this legislation in, the current 
Minister of Health.  We have the current Minister of Justice and 
all the apparatus of the Liberal government that is more than 
prepared to use its propaganda, its public relations and its 
pressure tactics on police organizations and the provinces when 
it is thought they are getting out of line.  We only have to look 
at the example in New Brunswick.  There are 250 jobs at stake at 
the firearms centre in Miramichi.  According to a briefing note 
from the Department of Justice, pressure has been put on the 
centre to go along with this registry or employees might be in 
danger of losing their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had a non-controversial handgun registry in effect since 
1934 at a cost of $2.5 million a year and requires only 30 
employees.  We now have well over 1,000 employees and $300 
million in costs this year alone.  The system is not cost 
effective.  There is no minister who wants to be in charge when 
the final accounting for the firearms registry boondoggle comes 
due. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I commend the hon. member for 
Yorkton—Melville for his bill, Bill C-409.  I am surprised, 
after having been here for seven years, that he is still 
sufficiently naive to believe that anybody over there cares or 
ever will care whether their laws are cost effective or not, but 
I give him A for trying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation that we are trying to get a sunset clause, 
namely Bill C-68, was based, as I recall very clearly, on public 
hysteria, prejudice, political expediency and on spurious, dare I 
even say duplicitous cost estimates; $85 million indeed. 
We said at the time that this was ridiculous.  We have been 
proven right in spades.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has already spent more than four times that 
amount of money and it is nowhere with the program. It has 
managed to corral I think 800,000, or maybe even by this time a 
million, gun owners who have come forward to apply for their 
licences or who have received their licences, either a POL or a 
PAL, but there are at least, by the government's own estimates, 
another 2 million owners out there.  Many people think there may 
be as many as 4 million.  The government has 1,700 people trying 
to process paper in Miramichi.  It is an impossible situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the old story of rolling the rock up the mountainside 
and it keeps rolling back down.  They will never get this done in 
time for the deadline and when that deadline passes we will have 
at least a couple of million Canadians who will be deemed, under 
the provisions of Bill C-68, to be instant criminals.  This is an 
absurdity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have only been here for seven years.  I suppose I am a bit of 
a greenhorn in this place, but I do not know of any single piece 
of legislation that has created the degree of public anger, 
mistrust and pure bloody minded rage at government that this 
legislation has caused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been on the books now for five years.  To this day I 
cannot walk down the street in the town of Swift Current, 
Saskatchewan, where I have my office, without somebody accosting 
me and asking me what we are going to do about this loony 
legislation.  It never dies.  This is an area that is suffering 
from a lot of other real major problems, but this is the burr 
under the saddle.  It is not good for government to have 
legislation that keeps a very large minority of the population in 
a constant state of agitation, and, believe me, they are 
agitated.  I would think that anyone who lives in a rural riding, 
regardless of their party, would be well aware of that fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary in his analysis mentioned a couple 
of things which I really must comment on.  He says that the 
background checks have been effective, and that people who should 
not have had guns have been denied the right to buy them because 
of these checks.  However, what he fails to mention is that there 
really is not any solid connection between the availability of 
the checks and the legislation that we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had background checks in this country for at least 20 
years that I am aware of and they did not have to pass this 
nonsense.  They did not have to bring in this bureaucratic 
monster in order to bring about something that was already there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary also stated that if Bill C-409 were 
to become law, all Canadian gun laws would be sunsetted and 
Canada would be left with no licensing and no registration. 
Well, if that is true, I can only assume that the hon. 
parliamentary secretary is saying that all of our gun laws are 
useless because Bill C-409 would only sunset gun control laws 
that the auditor general proved were not cost effective at 
achieving their stated objective of saving lives and reducing the 
criminal use of firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I have to ask:  Is the parliamentary secretary saying that 
all our gun laws, going all the way back to 1934, are not cost 
effective? 
That is a terribly broad statement to be making.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When the legislation was first debated back in 1994, we believed 
that the government should at that time have done some really 
serious studies, some scientific evaluation of what the 
legislation might entail, what it might result in and whether it 
would be beneficial, cost effective or not.  The government chose 
not to do that.  At the time there were a couple of very 
important academic studies that had been done, one in Canada in 
Vancouver and one in the United States in Florida, that 
strongly— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sorry to interrupt the hon. 
member for Cyprus Hills—Grasslands but his colleague, the hon. 
member for Yorkton—Melville, has a right of reply for five 
minutes at the end of the hour allocated to private members' 
business.  Since we have reached that point, I am obliged to 
interrupt the hon. member and allow his colleague to take the 
floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was watching the clock 
but forgot all about my poor colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sorry to do that, but I am sure 
he is glad to yield the floor to his colleague, the hon. member

<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too was so enthralled with what my 
colleague from Cyprus Hills—Grasslands was saying I had not 
noticed the clock either.  His remarks were probably better than 
what I will be making here in conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my introductory remarks I reported what the auditor general 
would have found if he had been able to look at Bill C-68, the 
Firearms Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My desire as a member of parliament is for all Canadians to 
scratch beneath the surface of the issues that face this country, 
to look at what really makes it tick and to see how things work, 
especially the legislation that is before the House, then they 
would understand what is actually happening.  This legislation 
affects all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general would scratch beneath the surface.  He would 
look to see whether this law is effective.  That is what I was 
asking.  In fact, should we not be doing this with more laws? It 
really begs the question. We spend hundreds of millions of 
dollars, I believe, on things that really bring no material 
benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most damning things that the auditor general would 
have found if he had been able to look at this would have been 
the deplorable fact that the gun registry has undermined 
community policing programs by treating more than three million 
law-abiding responsible firearms owners as criminal suspects. 
This is a key point.  The consequences of this law is a breakdown 
of trust between the police and the average citizen in thousands 
of municipalities across this land.  Everyone ought to take note 
of that.  That is one of the very negative things that is 
happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we would let the auditor general look at this he would go on 
for page after page documenting the most colossal political 
disasters and bureaucratic boondoggles in recent Canadian 
history.  He would conclude by recommending that the gun registry 
be scrapped and the money go to putting more police on street in 
the fight against organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-68 will guarantee that gun control laws are both costly 
and ineffective, whereas Bill C-409, which I am proposing, will 
guarantee that every gun control law has to be both successful 
and cost effective in saving lives and reducing the criminal use 
of firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members of parliament want gun control measures that reduce 
violent crime, they will support this bill.  If members of the 
House want gun control measures that improve public safety and 
save lives, they will support this bill.  Finally, if MPs want 
gun control measures that not only reduce violent crime involving 
firearms but want the most successful and most cost effective 
methods for achieving these goals, they will support this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year the government passes hundreds of new laws but seldom 
repeal any.  That is my point.  Maybe every bill passed by 
parliament should come with a built-in sunset clause which would 
automatically repeal any measure that is not working or is not 
cost effectively achieving its stated objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bureaucrats who depend on costly ineffective government programs 
for their jobs will hate this bill.  Ministers who are more 
intent on building empires and retaining their status at the 
cabinet table will hate this bill, but taxpayers who are footing 
the bill and the general public who have to pay through the nose 
for this bureaucratic bungling and inefficiency will love this 
bill, the firearms law sunset act.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Before this bill dies, I would like to respectfully request the 
unanimous consent of the House to send Bill C-409 to the Standing 
Committee on Justice for further review and consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In making that plea for unanimous consent to send it to the 
committee, I would like to point out that parliament was deceived 
when this was originally introduced.  The government said that 
the police supported gun registration.  The government should go 
back and check.  I have very close contact with the police 
association.  I know that in my province 91% of the RCMP oppose 
this bill.  I challenge the government to find out whether that 
is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It deceived parliament by saying that Canadian people supported 
gun registration.  Canadian people support effective gun control. 
They do not support hundreds of millions of dollars being wasted 
on a bureaucratic boondoggle.  We were deceived about the cost. 
We were told it was only going to be $85 million.  The cost 
overrun will be 10 or 20 times that amount and that is no 
exaggeration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told that the fees would cover the costs of the registry 
and that the deficit would be $2.2 million.  The deficit is 150 
times larger than that amount.  That is how parliament was 
deceived.  We were told that it would not take police off the 
street.  The police are calling for more resources and more 
people to work.  The money is not being used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope, Mr. Speaker, that you will ask for the unanimous consent 
of the House to have this bill sent to committee.

bill be referred to the justice and human rights committee?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on May 10 I put a question to the Minister of Health and 
I was not very impressed by his response.  My question had to do 
with the tainted drug issue in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the U.S. a drug called gentamicin sulfate was under question. 
That drug is used to treat severe infections such as blood 
poisoning and inflammation of the heart lining.  The drug is 
imported in the United States in bulk and there is contamination 
in the product.  I asked the minister what safeguards were taken 
in Canada to ensure the same thing did not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighty percent of the active ingredients in many of the generic 
drugs in the U.S. come from third world countries.  There is a 
quality issue involved here.  Some of these contaminated products 
work their way into drugs which are given to citizens of the 
United States.  At least 17 people died as a result of using 
gentamicin sulfate in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was shocked by the casual reply by the minister.  The minister 
said: “The manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products in 
Canada is done in accordance with exacting regulatory 
requirements to ensure the purity of product and safety of 
consumers”.  The minister did not go into the kind of detail 
that we would expect on an issue that could be serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On these generic drugs that are coming into Canada, what 
safeguards do we have?  How much do we know about the companies 
that are manufacturing them?  How many of these drugs come into 
Canada?  Is there any evidence at all, slight as it might be, 
that some of the products used in these drugs might be 
contaminated?  What kind of regulatory inspections do we use on 
facilities that manufacture these products in third world 
countries?  In other words, if it happened in the United States, 
why could it not happen here? 
I do not think we should have to go to the trouble of putting 
everything on the Order Paper.  I would think that the minister 
would understand that it could be a problem in this country.   We 
raised the alarm and we have to have some evidence from the 
government that it is not happening and that some kind of 
inspection process is being used.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these drugs are too powerful.  Some of them are not 
powerful enough.  Some of them are absolutely biologically 
contaminated because the inspection process in some 
third world countries is not being carried out to meet U.S. or 
Canadian standards.  Why is the situation in Canada any different 
from the situation in the United States?  If deaths resulted in 
the United States because of contamination in generic drugs, why 
could it not happen here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not expect a detailed report tonight from the minister 
because we have never got a detailed report in reference to any 
question put on the floor.  However, I am putting the ministry on 
alert that tomorrow I will be putting questions on the Order 
Paper so we can get a detailed response to what I think could be a 
problem in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the parliamentary secretary will respond tonight and we 
look forward to it.  However, we do not expect to get the kind of 
answers tonight that we would like.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in the House again today to call on the government to honour 
its stated commitment to provide decent housing for every 
Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During question period, on my first day back,  I asked the 
minister responsible for housing what the government intended to 
do at the meeting of Canada's housing ministers, the first 
meeting in five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 18, I was somewhat encouraged by the minister's 
response to that question.  He said that on that night and the 
next day they would be discussing how they could improve the 
situation and how they could give Canadians some relief and make 
sure that every Canadian had decent housing.  He said that he 
looked forward to the meeting in Fredericton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was somewhat encouraged to hear the minister's words, because 
it led me and many others to believe that finally the federal 
government was paying attention to this very critical issue 
facing millions of Canadians who are either homeless or one step 
away from being homeless.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister attended the meeting.  The following day I raised 
the matter in the House again and asked the finance minister, 
because it really comes down to a question of money, how he could 
feel so good about a massive revenue surplus of $12 billion that 
had accumulated in the past fiscal year when many Canadians were 
denied the basic necessities of life, the right to shelter and 
housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In following the meeting of first ministers I have to say that 
there was huge disappointment in the lack of response from the 
federal government.  I would like to quote from one of the most 
outspoken advocates for the development of a federal housing 
strategy, Mr. Michael Shapcott who represents the National 
Housing and Homelessness Network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was at the meeting in Fredericton with many other activists. 
In coming away from that meeting this is what he had to say: 
“The federal government had an historic opportunity this week to 
take leadership in ending Canada's nationwide housing crisis and 
homelessness disaster, and it fumbled the ball”.  He went on to 
say that there were high hopes that the minister would use the 
housing summit to take the next step and announce a federal 
housing initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal minister is reported as saying after the meeting 
that housing is a complex issue and there would need to be months 
of consultations with stakeholders.  These so-called 
consultations had already taken place a year earlier when the 
minister responsible for homelessness had travelled across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to tough questions from the media, the minister 
responsible for housing for the federal government admitted that 
the government had no new money for desperately needed social 
housing, no new programs to offer and no timetable for bringing 
in solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I again call upon the government to recognize the 
magnitude of the problem before us.  There is no question a 
crisis exists across the country which demands a national 
solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my open letter to the minister and the provincial housing 
ministers I called upon the ministers to acknowledge the 
magnitude of the problem and commit to a multi-level government 
strategy that incorporates the knowledge and expertise of our not 
for profit housing sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also called upon the minister to agree to a national housing 
strategy that focuses on a not for profit housing supply program. 
The government has not responded to this issue, and as a result 
there are still people who are homeless on the street tonight.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, affordable 
housing remains a serious concern of the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister responsible for housing met recently with his 
provincial and territorial counterparts to discuss housing issues 
and concerns, in particular the lack of affordable rental 
housing.  Ministers there agreed on a work plan which involves a 
research agenda and multi-sector consultations with stakeholders 
to discuss and formulate action plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that the private market cannot meet the housing 
needs of all Canadians.  That is why the Government of Canada 
spends approximately $1.9 billion annually addressing the housing 
needs of low income Canadians, including ongoing support for some 
640,000 low income Canadians receiving assistance to reduce their 
housing costs and to improve housing conditions for others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 2000 federal budget announced new affordable housing 
opportunities with the goods and services tax residential rental 
property rebate proposed for newly constructed, substantially 
renovated and converted residential rental accommodation.  As 
well, through the $2 billion new national municipal 
infrastructure program funding can be used for affordable 
housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Homelessness is also a serious issue that requires a 
comprehensive solution, with which the member agrees.  That 
extends beyond housing alone.  The Government of Canada has 
undertaken a range of measures including funding of the $753 
million federal strategy to address homelessness announced in 
December 1999.  Of this amount CMHC will spend $268 million 
expanding programs designed to repair and improve housing 
occupied by or intended to be occupied by low income people, 
including those at risk of homelessness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additional investments are being made in strategic initiatives 
for youth, urban aboriginal peoples and victims of family 
violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cornerstone of our investment toward helping the homeless is 
the $305 million supporting communities partnership initiative.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion to adjourn the House is now 
deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.45 p.m.)
