</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to say that it is a pleasure to stand in 
the House today to talk about Bill C-11, but unfortunately I do 
not feel that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important at this time to point out to Canadians 
the difference between fact and fiction as it relates to the Cape 
Breton Development Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the Prime Minister asked the Minister of Natural 
Resources at the time to return to cabinet with a privatization 
plan for Devco.  When we talked to the government and asked it 
about its plan with respect to the privatization of Devco in 
1998, it denied a plan existed.  It said that there was no plan 
and that it had not made a decision about privatizing Devco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, as you have said, we are today commissioned with 
the task of privatizing Devco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a resident of Cape Breton Island all my life, I was always 
brought up to believe that I lived in a wonderful country called 
Canada.  One of the reasons we lived in such a wonderful country 
was because it was a democratic society.  We had governments 
which were responsible for ensuring that all citizens were 
treated fairly and equitably and that it was the responsibility 
of the federal government to ensure that its policies did not 
have undue or harsh ramifications for the citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I question whether we live in a democratic society when we see 
what the federal government has done with respect to the Cape 
Breton Development Corporation, the miners, their families and 
the communities which will be affected drastically by this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members of the House have seen over the course of the last 
number of years delegation after delegation coming to Ottawa, 
miners' wives coming to Ottawa, pleading with officials of the 
government to recognize what this bill would do to them, their 
families, the future of their children and, more important, the 
future of their island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the government listen?  Of course not.  The government has 
refused to listen to every delegation which has come to 
Parliament Hill to voice their concerns about what the government 
was doing as it related to the Cape Breton Development 
Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, when Cape Bretoners were being represented by what some 
on the government side would tout as being one of the most 
powerful government members in the country, the government 
executed the plan to destroy Devco and in essence destroy the 
island.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government had decided to get out of the industry why was 
it not willing to sit down with the stakeholders, with the union, 
with the mayor and with the community and try to work out a 
solution that would guarantee that nobody would be adversely 
affected?  It did not do that.  It decided to continue meeting 
closed doors and making decisions based on only the facts it had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Day after day government members get up and talk about their 
responsibility and what they have done in terms of assisting the 
people in Cape Breton as it relates to Devco. Their own study in 
1995 told them what would happen economically and socially if 
they continued on with the plan to privatize Devco. Did they 
recognize those adverse effects?  Did the government want to sit 
down with the stakeholders to find a way to work out a solution? 
No.  It decided to do what it has done for a number of years 
which is to continue on its course of selling off Canada's assets 
to foreign investors.  Devco is no different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because I come from Cape Breton and having lived there all my 
life, it angers me to no end when I hear government members say 
that they are committed to Cape Breton, that they have sent money 
there for economic development and recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the amount of money that the federal government has sent 
to Cape Breton, why is Cape Breton's economy where it is right 
now?  Why have we ended up having the highest rate of 
unemployment in the country if the government is so committed to 
economic recovery? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer to those questions is that this government has never 
been committed to any kind of economic recovery as it relates to 
Cape Breton, and Cape Bretoners know that.  We in the House saw 
the drastic steps that the miners took in January of this year 
when they took over over one of the mines and went on a hunger 
strike.  It was because of what the government was doing and 
because it was not listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary or the minister will stand up later 
and tell us that the government consulted Cape Bretoners, that a 
panel went around Cape Breton Island and gave everybody the 
opportunity to voice their concerns and their issues. 
Interestingly enough, everybody on that panel had an affiliation 
to the Liberal Party.  Surprise, surprise.  There was a former 
senator on the panel.  One of those people on the panel was 
successful in obtaining over $300,000 through the millennium 
fund.  Another member was able to open a new FM radio station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members will say “There goes the member for Bras 
d'Or with her paranoia”.  No, that is reality and a fact on Cape 
Breton Island.  The government members know it and certainly Cape 
Bretoners know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue here is that there has been absolutely no consultation 
as it relates to what will happen to Cape Breton Island. 
Economically in Cape Breton right now our research shows that 
even to bring Cape Breton up to the mainland standards we will 
need approximately 14,000 jobs.  That is before Devco closes. 
That is before the steel plant closes.  What do we hear from the 
government members?  They say that they  have given us $68 
million.  By the way, they have already spent $7 million on a 
call centre that we all saw the Prime Minister come and announce 
to Cape Bretoners.  This is patronage at its best. One thing we 
do know about in Cape Breton is patronage.  We have seen it for 
an awful long time from the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the fact that the government arbitrarily made the decision 
in 1995 to get out of the industry, why did it not consult with 
Cape Bretoners? 
Why did it not consult with the unions?   Why did it not listen 
to the $500,000 study it commissioned from John T. Boyd, which 
told the government how to make it work?  The reality was that 
the government did not want it to work.  It did not want Devco to 
be viable.  It set in motion decisions, since 1995, that would 
ensure that it would not be viable.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What will Cape Bretoners be left with?  Today we await the 
arbitration to decide the fate of the miners and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sad day in this country when we have a government that 
is commissioned by the people to look after its citizens and we 
see the manipulation and games that have been played with the 
citizens of Cape Breton Island by the Liberal government.   What 
is it?   It is just proof that once again the Liberal government 
is phenomenal for its promises, but as Cape Bretoners have known 
for a very long time, it is also phenomenal at breaking them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
like the previous speaker, I want to say that it is a pleasure to 
rise today to speak to these motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud of the motions that have come forward but I think we 
need a bit of history on some of them and on Bill C-11. My 
colleague has given some of the history going back to 1995. 
However, it is important for members of the House to understand 
what these motions mean and what has happened to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members of the Liberal Party who do not know the history 
of the committee that reported on this bill should listen.  They 
should know the history and they should be ashamed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the government brought in time allocation the bill was 
sent to committee but not through the normal course of events. It 
was rammed through the committee to the point where the witnesses 
were given 24 hours notice to fly from Cape Breton to Ottawa 
during extended hours that the committee held, where the chairman 
ordered supper for the witnesses and the committee members, over 
a two day period, so they could say that they consulted.  It was 
a farce.  Yet, in good faith, the people of Cape Breton came 
forward to the committee.  The major of the regional municipality 
came.  Women from the Northside Futures Group came.  The unions 
came. Every one of those witnesses made recommendations to the 
committee.  Those recommendations from the witnesses formed the 
substance of the motions before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of those motions were brought to committee in another form. 
Despite the fact that these motions came from witnesses who will 
be directly affected in the communities where they live, the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources 
exercised his duty as whip, and up and down the line, when the 
motions were brought forward, most of them were defeated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see some members in the House today who I think have a social 
conscience.  I urge them to read those motions.  Not all of them 
are up for debate in this grouping, but they are as innocuous as 
ensuring that Cape Bretoners sit on the board of directors.  They 
were defeated by the government.  We have to wonder why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe there is a move afoot to ram this through before the 
next election so that the next Liberal standard bearer in Cape 
Breton does not have to answer or defend the actions of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is worse is that those witnesses were given a little bit of 
hope.  Cathy Baker, whose husband is a miner and who has been 
affected by this, gave up her 12-hour shift on short notice to 
come to Ottawa to plead with the government to keep certain 
sections in the act. 
One of the Liberal members on the committee said to her that her 
comments made him think differently about the bill.  The next day 
or the day after he voted against the very recommendations that 
she had put forward.  He was whipped into shape.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a certain irony here today.  This bill will undo the 
work of previous Liberal administrations: the Lester Pearson 
administration and the Pierre Trudeau administration involving 
Allan MacEachen, Romeo Leblanc and other Liberals who were 
considered left wing thinkers.  I know the Liberal members are 
tired of hearing me say that because it perhaps creates a twinge 
of conscience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The irony is that as the Prime Minister travels off to Berlin to 
deliver what many think is the left wing election platform of the 
Liberal Party, while he issues that statement in Berlin, here at 
home his government is undoing the very kind of Liberal policies 
for which this party was once so proud.  While he echoes a 
remnant of what might have been in Berlin, the actions of his 
Minister of Natural Resources and of his government speak far 
louder than those words.  When we compare that speech in Berlin 
with the legislation before the House today, it speaks of 
hypocrisy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has a choice.  He can give credence to his leader's 
comments in Berlin by withdrawing this bill or, at the very 
least, by accepting amendments that were put forward by the 
people of Cape Breton, or he can make his leader look like a 
hypocrite and pass the bill in this Chamber.  It will be an 
interesting contrast between that speech and this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now go directly to the motions that have been moved 
today. I will speak directly to Motion No. 2 which says that 
prior to the sale or disposal of all government assets, there 
should be a public inquiry into what this will mean for the 
economy on the island of Cape Breton.  That is not happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting reason that Motion No. 2 is an important motion 
is because the act that we are replacing mandated the government 
to assess what the economic impact would be as a result of the 
transition from a resource based economy to another one.  That 
was what the foresight was of the government of Lester Pearson. 
To give it teeth a section was put in the act that mandated the 
government to look at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What could possibly be wrong?   How could it be against public 
policy for a government to say that it understands the 
implications of this, that it is aware it will be selling off the 
assets of a crown corporation that is the major employer in a 
particular community, that it is aware that will mean massive 
layoffs and will have economic impacts, and that it will have a 
public inquiry and study it in order to find the best way to deal 
with it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>God knows in this House over 130 years we have had public 
inquiries into every possible subject.  When it comes to the 
lives and the economic consequences of a bill that will affect 
the lives of 100,000 people, which is the population of the 
regional municipality of Cape Breton, when it comes to examining 
what effects this bill will have on those people, there is no 
interest, no time and no money.  Perhaps the government can 
explain why it has no interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government members will say that they have given $68 million 
to Cape Breton for economic development to replace the Cape 
Breton Development Corporation.  The Minister of Heritage 
announced in the House the expenditure of $48 million toward the 
construction of a war museum.  I suppose we have been given the 
price of a new building in Ottawa as the impetus for future 
economic growth for an island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A contract was made between the Government of Canada and the 
people of Cape Breton.  That contract said that the government 
would assist the people of Cape Breton through a transition 
period.  Cape Bretoners understood that they would not be coal 
miners forever and ever.  They understood that times were 
changing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Cape Breton looked to the Government of Canada to 
help them, not to baby them, not to make them dependent, but to 
help them.  Is it wrong that they would turn to the government 
and ask for help as they made the transition?  The Government of 
Canada in 1967 said it recognized its role and responsibility. It 
made a covenant, but today the covenant has been broken.  Today 
there is a breach of faith and a breach of trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Cape Breton have always given to Canada when 
asked. We have always honoured our side of the confederation 
agreement.  I do not know that we can continue to make the same 
pledge because the covenant has been broken by the other partner 
and we have been left wanting.

<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I speak 
on Bill C-11, I must set the stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out quickly that, on January 28, 1999, the federal 
Minister of Natural Resources announced the closure of the 
Phalen coal mine and the privatization of the Prince mine, both 
of which are on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia and managed by 
the crown corporation Devco.  Some 1,700 miners worked for the 
corporation, and approximately 1,000 will end up unemployed in a 
region with an unemployment rate of 25% on occasion and even 
permanently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, the minister announced aid of $110 million to 
provide the miners with severance pay and early retirement 
packages and an additional investment of $68 million to boost 
the region's economy.  The Government of Nova Scotia also 
announced, last fall, that it would invest $12 million in the 
long term economic development of Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, some people are dissatisfied with the conditions of 
separation and the proposed severance pay totalling $110 
million.  Since February 1999, Devco employees have been putting 
pressure on the federal government to change its decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A committee of the Nova Scotia legislature comprising 
representatives of all parties called on the federal government 
on December 23 to improve the offers and increase the amount of 
money paid to the workers. 
According to this committee, approximately 230 miners with 25 
years of service or more are excluded from Devco's early 
retirement programs as they are currently defined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 2, 2000, exasperated miners declared a strike to 
protest the closing of the mine and to obtain better lump sum 
payments.  A few days later, they set up barricades in order to 
block delivery of coal to Nova Scotia's two generating stations. 
Some of them even went on a hunger strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After long deliberations between workers and representatives of 
the federal government and the mine, an agreement in principle 
was reached in mid January, and the barricades came down. 
Nevertheless, negotiations in camera appear not to be concluded 
yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Devco was established in 1967 by the Cape Breton Development 
Corporation Act. Its assets include the Prince and Phalen mines, 
the Donkin mine site, the corporation wharf and rail line, its 
coal processing plant and the related infrastructures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Devco being a crown corporation, the Financial Administration 
Act provides that it cannot dispose of all or substantially all 
of its assets, unless authorized by legislationaw. Therefore, 
the main objective of Bill C-11 is to allow Devco to dispose of 
its assets. It amends the Cape Breton Development Corporation 
Act to allow the private sector to acquire the corporation's 
assets, so that the government can exit the coal mining 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of clauses 2 to 4 is to allow Devco to sell its 
assets, before being dissolved on a day to be fixed by order in 
council. Clause 5 provides that the works and undertakings 
operated or carried on by Devco are for the general advantage of 
Canada. That clause is included in the act so that the Canada 
Labour Code can continue to apply. It should be noted that since 
Devco is a crown corporation, all the jurisdictional systems 
that apply to labour relations, occupational health and safety 
and labour standards have, since 1967, been governed by the 
Canada Labour Code.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill thus also provides for the continuation of the existing 
federal jurisdiction in these areas.  It is primarily the 
provisions of clause 5 which bother us, because they represent 
federal interference in provincial affairs.  There is nothing 
out of the ordinary about the rest of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 5 is contentious because the federal government indicates 
that the works and undertakings operated by the corporation, 
whether or not it is dissolved, will be works for the general 
advantage of Canada, thus allowing for the continuation of the 
federal legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By means of this clause, the federal government intends to 
continue the jurisdiction it had at the time, through Devco's 
status as a crown corporation. 
The federal government thus retains the right to legislate in 
the areas of labour relations, occupational safety and health, 
and labour standards, even after the corporation is dissolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it is the provincial legislation and labour code which 
should apply once the federal government pulls out of this 
industry and privatizes its assets.  The federal government is 
continuing its jurisdiction in these areas by invoking the 
declaratory power conferred on parliament by various sections of 
the Constitution Act, which allow it to extend its exclusive 
jurisdiction to works by declaring them to be for the advantage 
of Canada or of more than one province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, section 91 provides that it shall be lawful for the 
Queen, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and the 
House of Commons, to make laws for the peace, order and good 
government of Canada—that is what I said, the good government of 
Canada; and this was not written by the Bloc—in relation to all 
matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this act 
assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This section also sets out the matters under the exclusive 
legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada.  And 
subsection 91(29) gives the federal government exclusive 
jurisdiction when the classes, in this case the works, have been 
expressly excepted in the enumeration of the classes of subjects 
assigned exclusively to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 92 identifies the matters for which the provincial 
legislatures may exclusively make laws. 
Subsection 92(10) says that local works and undertakings are a 
provincial matter, with the exception of what is set out in 
paragraphs (<I>a</I>), (<I>b</I>) and (<I>c</I>).  Paragraph (<I>c</I>) provides that the 
works, although wholly situate within the province, are before 
or after their execution declared by the Parliament of Canada to 
be for the general advantage of Canada or for the advantage of 
two or more of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the Parliament of Canada may amend, indeed 
expand, the limits of its legislative jurisdiction with respect 
to works of a local nature declared to be of general interest to 
Canada.  Provincial approval is not required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The works so unilaterally declared are therefore removed from 
the application of provincial jurisdiction. 
The federal government has apparently used this type of power 
already close to 500 times.  The use of this declaratory power 
by the federal government in the case of the Cape Breton 
Development Corporation strikes us as abusive.  Why is the 
federal government pre-empting this jurisdiction?  Does it not 
believe that provincial legislation will be sufficient, once 
agreements have been signed between it and the workers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking quickly at the coal industry, it is of course very much 
on the way out.  It also has a considerable impact on the 
environment.  Those two arguments lead me to a degree of 
acceptance that the government should divest itself of this 
mine, mainly the fact that coal mining is not cost-effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one important element I must focus on: the matter of 
regional development.  I believe that the federal government has 
not done its job in this area. 
It is obvious that the government has invested huge sums of 
money since 1967. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have made a rapid calculation.  Since 1967, the budgetary 
estimates for the coal division of Devco, as well as for the 
industrial development and economic activities division in the 
past two years, i.e. 1998 and 1999, total $2,568,000.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take an average of 1,700 employees over 33 years, this 
represents an average of $45,775 per worker.  This is, of 
course, assuming that there were 1,700 workers for the 33 year 
period. Imagine what the federal government could have done with 
that money in developing Cape Breton?  Now there would be full 
employment there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has therefore failed to meet its 
responsibilities.  The federal government was incapable of 
getting the mine to make a profit and today it wants to 
privatize it.  Even the chairman of the corporation admits it is 
running up a deficit and will probably continue to do so.  What 
are the advantages for the government in selling the mine and in 
continuing to interfere in provincial responsibilities?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak to these amendments.  But as the member for 
Bras D'Or—Cape Breton said earlier, it is also a disappointment 
to speak to a number of these amendments because of the lack of 
co-operation from the government benches on this bill. It is also 
a disappointment that the government is not here to defend its 
actions and its Bill C-11 on the privatization of Devco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Some members are back in their ridings, but as the 
Speaker knows very well, it is against the rules of the House to 
refer to the presence or absence of members in the House and 
there are government members here to defend the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The deputy 
government whip is absolutely correct and I should have picked up 
on that myself.  As everyone knows, we do not refer to the 
presence or absence of other members.  As everyone knows, while 
members may or may not be in the House, there are many other 
obligations that take members out of the House on official 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it was not my intent to 
point that out.  It was my intent to involve the government in 
debate on this very important bill for the people of Cape Breton 
Island and Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of amendments have been put forward.  We have debated 
this in committee and we have gone through clause by clause. 
There are more amendments here.  Our party will be supporting 
some of them and some of them we will not be supporting.  What is 
important is that the debate occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly there has been a lack of debate on this issue.  There has 
been a lack of responsibility on behalf of the government. The 
government has refused to go to Cape Breton Island and hold 
public inquiries.  The committee has not travelled to Cape Breton 
Island to actually assess the situation on the ground in Cape 
Breton.  Many committee members have not been to the coal field, 
they have not seen the rail cars and they have not been to the 
mines.  The government has refused travel there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a mistake for the government when it is liquidating the 
assets and privatizing the company, a crown corporation, to try 
to do it in an aloof and hands off manner.  The government is 
going to put the bill through. It wants all parliamentarians to 
support it without looking at it too closely because it is just a 
matter of bookkeeping and let us move it through.  That type of 
attitude is what the government has been about for far too long, 
that type of irresponsible government and its refusal to deal 
with the issues.  A number of issues need to be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the amendments put forward in Group No. 1 by the member for 
Bras D'Or—Cape Breton and the member for Sydney—Victoria, there 
are couple that deserve to be looked at in a much closer manner 
and taken seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 12 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The by-law of the Corporation shall provide that if a person 
contracts any illness as a result of the person's employment by 
the Corporation, the person shall be entitled, for the remainder 
of the person's life, to the health insurance benefits that were 
provided as part of the terms and conditions of the person's 
employment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear members on the government benches at least 
explain to me, but explain to the entire House and to the miners 
in Cape Breton who have contracted serious illnesses working 
underground why that particular motion would not be supported by 
any responsible government in the country. 
I would like to hear the explanation of that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put forth a very similar motion at committee stage and it was 
voted down.  All the opposition parties supported it, and I 
suspect that all the opposition parties will support this one. 
Yet the government in its wisdom decided it does not have to deal 
with this issue.  If people contract an illness through work, a 
work related injury, they will be laid off and the medical 
insurance will not cover them or their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cape Breton Island is a area of economic hardship with 17% 
unemployment and higher.  Yet the government is satisfied that it 
does not have any further responsibility once it goes through 
with its privatization plan. I point out Motion No. 3 which says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Auditor General shall review the disposal of the 
Corporation's assets and all other activities related to the 
closing out of its affairs, and shall report to the House of 
Commons within six months of the disposal of the last of the 
Corporation's assets. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely that is a good amendment.  When we are liquidating assets 
and privatizing government or federal assets, to have the auditor 
general look at it and give a full accounting to the Parliament 
of Canada is responsible government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want want to hear what the Government of Canada has to say on 
this issue.  I want it to explain to me, because I do not 
understand its rationale or its line of thinking, why this should 
not occur.  Even more serious, I want it to explain to Canadians 
why this should not occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a government that is not responsible.  It does not have 
to have a full accounting of the business it is about to perform. 
Do Canadian taxpayers not need to know whether this is a good or 
bad thing?  Whatever anyone's position is on this issue, surely 
we have to be responsible and, more important, we have to be 
accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Sherbrooke just spoke about overlapping 
jurisdiction.  The federal government wants to continue to keep 
its hands in the works through the Canada Labour Code.  He made a 
very good point, a clear point.  He explained his position well. 
It is a point on which I want to hear the government's response. 
I have not heard it.  It has not articulated its vision for the 
future of Cape Breton Island.  It has not explained why federal 
jurisdiction should continue to apply in a provincial area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It cannot continue to govern from afar.  It is like trying to 
write a will that somehow tries to control everything from the 
grave.  It is a mistake for anyone to do that.  One should make a 
decision and move on.  The Government of Canada has to do exactly 
the same.  I go back to Motion No. 5 which says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a work or undertaking of the Corporation or any part thereof 
is transferred, by sale, lease, merger or otherwise, to another 
employer, the work or undertaking or the part thereof, as the 
case may be, shall continue to be a work or undertaking for the 
general advantage of Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a pretty sensible amendment.  The problem here is not 
with the amendments.  The problem has been with the government 
and its total refusal to take this issue and the Parliament of 
Canada seriously and to listen to amendments put forth by 
opposition members of parliament.  Surely we are not just here to 
waste our time.  Surely we are here to have reasonable, rationale 
and accountable debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone needs to understand that the government is insisting on 
pushing this legislation through parliament like it pushes every 
other piece of legislation through parliament.  It delays debate. 
It shortens debate.  It refuses to speak to the issues.  It 
refuses to present its own position on this very important issue. 
Opposition members are forced to bring motions from committee to 
parliament to have them debated.  We debate them at committee, 
and that debate is rushed by any stretch of the imagination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Sydney—Victoria had unlimited time to speak the 
other day.  He took that opportunity to speak in what I thought 
was a very rational manner for a limited period of time and 
discussed the issues fairly thoroughly.  Instead of that gaining 
some co-operation from the government, all it gained was to shut 
it down, move it on, not debate it and not discuss it. That type 
of government is wrong.  That is why we are debating this issue 
today and that is why we have a couple of other sets of 
amendments to debate.  I look forward to continuing that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to rise to speak to the amendments as well as to the 
essence of Bill C-11, an act to authorize the divestiture of the 
assets of the Cape Breton Development Corporation.  I am honoured 
to follow the two Cape Breton members of parliament who spoke so 
passionately to the issue.  I would like to try to follow in 
their footsteps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill the government will be carrying out its intention 
to privatize Devco.  As we know, the government has a passion for 
privatization.  It has an obsession for cutting loose some of the 
jewels in our crown, the actual treasures that we hold dear in 
this country.  It believes that Devco should be cut loose and in 
fact that Atlantic Canada should be cut loose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen this over and over from the government.  We have 
seen our health care system cut loose.  We have seen the 
government's commitment move from a 50% commitment to national 
medicare down to a 13% commitment.  We have seen our railways cut 
loose.  Now we have seen the CBC cut loose.  We have seen over 
$400 million removed from the CBC, our national broadcasting 
corporation.  We have seen 3,800 jobs disappear.  It is all with 
the assumption that somehow the private sector will take up the 
slack, and we know it will not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Devco the argument is the same, that the private sector 
will somehow do a better job.  This is a sort of ubiquitous 
mantra of the government.  I almost think government members 
repeat it on their treadmills when they are exercising or when 
they are going to sleep at night.  They may mutter cuts are the 
best policy; private sector good, public sector bad; corporations 
are always right.  Of course there is the continuing mantra that 
Cape Breton is a financial money pit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that not only is this last mantra a false one. 
It is also one that has been taken up by the official opposition, 
the Reform Party.  I guess the Reform Party has finally become an 
Ottawa insider, adopting the bureaucratic mantras in the same way 
as the frontbench opposite.  I want to bring some of those 
fallacies to the attention of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for everyone to note that Cape Breton has been 
producing coal for 300 years, long before Ottawa bureaucrats 
existed to criticize the enterprise.  The coal produced in Cape 
Breton fired the steamers which helped build the British Empire. 
They were critical components of industrial expansion in the 
early days of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contribution which Cape Breton coal made to our war efforts 
in both wars cannot be underestimated.  At the end of the second 
world war 17,000 Cape Breton workers kept the coal moving.  Like 
many other industries after the war, there were to be big changes 
in coal production, and there were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mines declined substantially and by 1965 they were ready for 
closure, which would have thrown 6,500 miners out of work. 
However the more progressive government of the day than the one 
that introduced Bill C-11 understood that allowing the collapse 
of the coal industry was against the public interest for two 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Pearson government understood that there was a viable 
economic need for coal production in Cape Breton to continue.  It 
is almost eerie how the setting up of Devco seemed to have 
foretold the oil crisis of the seventies.  Until Devco, power in 
Nova Scotia was produced by oil generating stations. 
If these stations had not changed to coal fired stations in the 
late sixties, the impact of the OPEC crisis would have decimated 
the Nova Scotia economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard both Liberals and Reformers whine about the money pit of 
Cape Breton requiring this drastic legislation.  However I never 
hear them talk about the billions saved by businesses and 
residents of Atlantic Canada because of cheap Cape Breton coal 
being used to create electricity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mantra continues:  Cape Breton's Devco should be cut loose; 
the private sector will do a better job; and the government will 
continue to offer call centre jobs to this beautiful island.  I 
say shame on the government's minimum wage commitments to Cape 
Breton and its people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I learned that the reprieve of local news shows at the 
CBC, which is another sock from the Liberals to maritimers and 
which I have already called a sham to get the government through 
the next election, is not what the government had taken credit 
for.  The national programs will get millions to produce a slick 
commercial free 30 minutes of national news.  They will get time 
to develop the ideas and will get the resources to do it right, 
an approach which local shows have always done well.  Due to the 
Liberal broken promises, the local shows have scant days to come 
up with the millions in cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  With the hon. member's agreement, it might 
be a good time to break your speech.  You still have five minutes

Two hundred and fifty Canadian soldiers will participate in the

through searing heat, thirst and sickness at the battle of

Dragoons and the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery held fast at the 
battle of Leliefontain despite many casualties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also an opportunity to commemorate the raising of Lord 
Strathcona's Horse, the Royal Canadians, in the year of 1900 just 
prior to their service in South Africa.  In fact the Musical Ride 
will be performed by horses and riders from the Strathcona 
Mounted Troop, an event rarely seen in eastern Canada.

thankfully go on to live happy and productive lives.

experienced pain and unease in their courageous battles against 
cancer.  However, if asked, I am sure that each would say that we 
must continue to develop new and improved methods of detection 
and treatment and to encourage research in this all important 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to say that on Sunday, June 4, the people of my

in cabinet to get a slap from the Liberals on the human resources 
committee.  The committee report urges the government to carve up 
HRDC just four years after the Prime Minister created it.  Listen 
to what the Minister of Foreign Affairs said about the 
amalgamation at that time: “I am really talking about getting 
the best use of taxpayers' money”.  The billion dollar bungle 
kind of puts that claim into a fresh light, does it not?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian

years ago that the government folded parts of five departments 
into one human resources development superministry.  The 
Liberals' committee report slams that decision and therefore 
slams the minister's track record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Billions of dollars have been spent on half-baked Liberal job 
creation schemes.  Friends of the Prime Minister and other

</I></B></P><P align=left>The department was put in place in 1993.  According to my

</I></B></P><P align=left>It would not matter how many pieces human resources is split 
into, the central problem is political interference.  The

her main concern was pleasing Liberals and friends of Liberals. 
No wonder.  She learned well from the Prime Minister. Her program 
has never been about creating jobs.  It was always about buying 
support.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

opposite is forgetting the multitude of roles that HRDC fulfils. 
He is forgetting about all the recipients of old age security, 
employment insurance and all the statutory programs that come 
under that particular ministry.  In so doing he is insulting the 
recipients, and all the workers of HRDC who are to be commended 
for their hard work in going through this barrage of criticism

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CBC management recently announced that all regional supper hour 
news programs will be cut to one-half hour in length.  The supper 
hour news program in Newfoundland called <I>Here and Now</I> is 
essentially the most successful in the country.  It has a market 
share of 64% and a viewing audience of 157,000.  How can the 
minister justify gutting that program and cutting the budget by 
40% down to $1.8 million? 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  It gives 
me an opportunity to thank hon. members on all sides of the House 
who expressed concerns to the board and the management of the CBC 
and caused them to overturn a decision which would have been 
disastrous. However, I do find it passing strange that the 
question comes from the hon. member whose party had a position in 
the last election of getting rid of <I>Here and Now</I>. 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
minister knows that is not true.  I am not looking for her 
thanks, I am looking for her action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>   Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>   Order, please.  I would ask the hon. member to 
please stay away from words such as “not true”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are looking for the 
minister's action on this, not her thanks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Here and Now</I> has a 64% market share and 157,000 viewers. 
This contrasts sharply with the Toronto equivalent which commands 
a mere 2% of the market and a paltry 36,000 viewers in that large 
city.  I can understand that the CBC might have to tighten up in 
markets where its programs are not widely popular, but how can 
the minister justify throwing out our baby with Toronto's bath 
water? 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the reference to relatives gives me an opportunity 
to say how much my mother-in-law, Stella Thorne, enjoys <I>Here 
and Now</I>.  She watches it every night and I hope she hasn't 
changed so she can watch me saying hi to my mother-in-law tonight 
on <I>Here and Now</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I do hope that some of the modernizations that 
are going to be brought forward by the CBC will include increased 
investments in regional productions in a number of areas.  I very 
much hope that the music and culture of Newfoundland and 
Labrador—something that the former leader of the PQ thinks does 
not exist—get a chance to be seen across the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans recently announced a 300% 
increase in the crab quota in eastern Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowing that the crab population fluctuates wildly, how can the

more than election strategy to me. 
<P><A NAME="LINK136"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lawrence D. O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the hon. 
member knows, the crab fishery in Atlantic Canada is a case of 
peaks and valleys.  In this particular case, we are very 
fortunate that we have a peak.  As a result, there has been a 
major increase in the quota.  We are very pleased with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As he has pointed out, this year the fishers in that particular 
area will see a $43 million fishery.  That is an increase of $30 
million.  As the fishery moves along from one year to the next 
things may change, but we are very pleased to have come up with 
this format.  It is a good one. 
<P><A NAME="LINK137"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, could 
he tell us what the potential cost will be of that $30 million? 
Increasing the crab quota by 300% will entice more fishermen to 
gear up, to increase their efforts and to put more boats on the 
water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the minister tell us what will happen to those fishers next 
year if the crab quota is significantly reduced?  Would the 
minister not have been wiser to err on the side of caution? 
<P><A NAME="LINK138"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lawrence D. O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the answer is 
quite simple.  The paramount issue with DFO is conservation.  We 
look at it from a scientific point of view and make changes 
accordingly.  We made a positive change this time.  If the stocks 
show a significant difference in biomass another year, it will be 
reflected under the conservation rules, as it applies to all 
fisheries.

AUTHORIZATION AND DISSOLUTION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK215">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-11, an act to 
authorize the divestiture of the assets of, and to dissolve, the 
Cape Breton Development Corporation, to amend the Cape Breton 
Development Corporation Act and to make consequential amendments 
to other acts, as reported (without amendment) from the 
committee; and of the motions in Group No. 1. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to finish my comments on Bill C-11, 
the federal government's legislation to divest itself of the 
assets of the Cape Breton Development Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my earlier remarks I was pleased to give some of the 
background of coal production in Cape Breton and the benefits 
which have been accrued by all Canadians from this production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, Cape Breton has been producing coal for 300 years, 
long before Ottawa bureaucrats existed to criticize the 
enterprise.  The coal produced in Cape Breton fired the steamers 
which helped build the British Empire.  They were critical 
components of industrial expansion in the early days of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contribution which Cape Breton coal made to our war efforts 
in both wars cannot be underestimated but unfortunately are 
underestimated.  I would say that the entire contribution of our 
Cape Breton coal industry has been underestimated by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard both the Liberals and the Reformers whine about the 
money pit of Cape Breton and why we require drastic legislation 
at this point.  However I have never heard them talk about the 
money saved by businesses and residents of Atlantic Canada 
because of cheap Cape Breton coal being used to create 
electricity.  I have not heard members opposite credit Devco with 
making $6 billion.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk a bit about that.  Bill C-11, as it is 
currently constructed, I believe would create a money pit in Cape 
Breton.  The bill could see 6,000 jobs lost in relatively small 
communities, 15,000 direct layoffs, with up to three times that 
many lost due to downward spinoffs.  The impact would be 
astounding.  Along with what I have already mentioned, we would 
see the loss of roughly $79 million per year in wages and 
salaries.  It would also mean the loss to Ottawa of roughly $28 
million a year in Canada pension plan, employment insurance and 
income tax contributions.  It would also mean a total estimated 
annual economic loss, direct and indirect, of as high as $300 
million for this region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I firmly believe that economically destroying a community is 
really what creates a money pit, not working to preserve it.  It 
not only fails to make economic sense, it fails to make moral 
sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There used to be an understanding that part of the public 
responsibility of government was to help Canadians and not just 
guard corporate rights in an unfettered marketplace, but not any 
more.  There used to be an appreciation and a respect for the 
importance of certain national institutions in this country, but 
obviously not any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I learned that the reprieve of local news shows at the 
CBC, which is another sock from the Liberals to Cape Bretoners 
and maritimers, and which I have already called a sham to get the 
government through the next election, is not even what the 
government has taken credit for.  The national programs will get 
millions to produce slick, commercial free, 30 minute national 
news programs.  They will have the time to develop the ideas and 
they will receive the resources to do it right, an approach which 
local shows should obviously receive as well.  However, due to 
the Liberals' brokerage compromise, the local shows have scant 
days to come up with millions in cuts in the local show cities, 
including Fredericton, Charlottetown, Halifax and St. John's, so 
that they can throw together a 24 minute broadcast with 6 minutes 
of commercials to reflect these communities to themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like Devco, the focus is on cutting a national institution which 
supports the regions.  This is the Liberals' approach to Atlantic 
Canada:  more for the centre and, quite frankly, screw the 
regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to revisit this government's minimum wage commitment 
to this beautiful people and this beautiful island.  I join with 
my colleagues in the NDP to demand revisions to Bill C-11 to 
respect the needs and the contributions of the people of Cape 
Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am sure my colleagues will all be very 
judicious in their choice of words in this debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak 
to the Devco bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there are many elements of the government that have a 
bias against the Canadian coal industry.  That is a very 
unfortunate circumstance.  It derives, to a fair degree, from an 
image problem.  There is a conceptual thought in many people's 
minds that somehow coal is dirty and that coal and greenhouse gas 
emissions are related.  That is a very unfortunate circumstance 
for this important resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the development of the bill from a 
parliamentary standpoint.  I met with department officials last 
year to receive a briefing on the bill, and I am not satisfied 
with the way the system works.  I realize that we are talking 
about Group No. 1 amendments, but one of the amendments today 
virtually mirrors an amendment I made at committee.  Therefore, 
it is a good amendment.  I thought that amendment would come from 
the government.  I refer to Motion No. 3, which is one of the 
amendments in Group No. 1. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I believed that was because I thought we had somewhat 
of a meeting of the minds when department officials and people 
like myself, who had political considerations, met for early 
discussions on the bill before it went to second reading.  I had 
the belief that an amendment would be forthcoming from the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That never happened.  Nothing changed and there was no 
bureaucratic follow-up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see this as something that is structurally wrong.  When there 
appears to be a legitimate opposition concern, particularly about 
expenditure controls or the way government disposes of assets, or 
about protecting taxpayer interests, we should not be put in a 
position as opposition members of bureaucratic convenience, 
indifference or political interference.  I do not know what to 
attribute it to. However, there is absolutely no follow-up on 
what appears to be a legitimate problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, none of that happened.  I certainly was not happy 
with that at committee.  I am once again not happy today.  What 
we have is the very same bill presented today which was presented 
last fall, and there has been absolutely no entertainment by the 
government to change a word in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the government is concerned about getting it through 
parliament before we recess.  However, it was the government 
which decided it did not want to bring the bill forward until 
very recently.  It has had the legislation, as we all know, for 
quite a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should not have been a surprise to me to go to committee this 
week to find that the opposition members from all parties were 
basically redundant from the standpoint that the government would 
not entertain a single change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tried to put myself in the shoes of a government member, 
protecting whatever the interest is that they believe they are 
protecting.  I could not determine why the government would not 
look seriously at a lot of the amendments and try to negotiate 
something with the opposition.  That simply is not the way this 
government likes to operate.  The process in many respects is 
very much a sham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not only apply to this bill.  However, it became very 
apparent to me that that was what was happening.  As there will 
be many people affected, as has been pointed out quite well by 
the member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, I do not think that is the 
way to do business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Group No. 1 amendments, I believe, are quite supportable for 
the most part, and we will be supporting them.  I want to talk 
about Motion No. 3 because that motion reflects the motion I put 
at committee.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the asset divestiture process this bill will suspend the 
Financial Administration Act.  From the government side, there is 
some logic to doing that because business confidentiality must be 
maintained, and if that act were fully in place that would be 
impossible.  We understood that concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also had a major concern, in that there has been a government 
divestiture of taxpayer assets.  There is a track record, a 
legacy, of political favouritism, political payoffs and other 
things because the proper arrangement was not in place to ensure 
it did not occur.  We have seen it in some of the Department of 
National Defence base divestitures and that sort of thing.  It is 
in everyone's interest to ensure that does not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is a strong attempt to have oversight by the auditor 
general, who is already the auditor for Devco, to ensure that the 
auditor general's report comes to parliament in a timely fashion. 
That would put the political masters on notice that they could 
not express this kind of favouritism to their friends without 
scrutiny on a timely basis.  If the scrutiny is too far down the 
road, it amounts to non-scrutiny because too much time has 
elapsed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a really useful amendment.  I hope we can convince the 
government to adopt it.  We could not convince it at committee. 
We could not convince it at the briefings before that.  Now we 
are at the last stage and we have an opportunity to do it at 
report stage.  I am very hopeful that the government will see 
this as reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government response is that this is redundant because it is 
already going to happen.  I do not think it is redundant.  Even 
in the very worst case if it were totally redundant, perhaps with 
a different timeframe, there is enough concern from all members 
of the opposition to warrant it.  As a taxpayer I would want more 
than government assurances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members should adopt Motion No. 3 and take another 
look at how they have treated the whole divestiture of assets. 
They will wear it if they do not take another look.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too am 
pleased, but not as pleased as I would like to be about taking 
part in this debate today because of the issue that is before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into the gist of my remarks, I would like to 
sincerely congratulate the two members of parliament from Cape 
Breton, the hon. member for Bras-d'Or—Cape Breton and the hon. 
member for Sydney—Victoria, who, in their remarks prior to 
question period, put the case for Devco very eloquently.  That 
deserves to be mentioned at the outset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it was the hon. member for Sydney—Victoria who also 
questioned the Prime Minister of this country trotting off to 
Berlin.  He may come back with a couple of broken arms from 
patting himself and his government on the back so much for the 
compassionate society we are supposed to be developing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must look at what happens in the regions of our country.  We 
heard in question period today what is happening with regard to 
toxic waste being dumped.  The toxic waste that is being allowed 
into Canada primarily comes from the United States.  There are 
tonnes and tonnes of it being dumped in the province of Quebec 
and in southwestern Ontario. 
We look at the situation in Cape Breton and the plight of the 
farmers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, we have to recognize that the Liberal majority 
government opposite has roughly two-thirds of its seats in one 
province.  We lack a national party with membership from most 
regions.  We know what Nova Scotians thought of the government in 
the 1997 election three years ago today.  They did not return one 
government member to the House of Commons.  I think there is a 
message in there.  I hope the government members opposite are 
listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the previous members, including the member for Dartmouth 
who spoke eloquently, I am not from that part of the world. If I 
may digress for 30 seconds, I want to talk about somebody who is 
from there, somebody I am privileged to call a friend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His name is John Francis Lofty MacMillan.  To picture this man, 
think of the song from the 1960s “Big Bad John”.  I think the 
words went “He stood six foot six and weighed 245”.  That will 
give an indication of Lofty MacMillan.  He was a mine worker from 
Judique in Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I knew him we were both involved with the Canadian Union of 
Public Employees.  Brother MacMillan used to be concerned about 
the timidity of the public sector as compared with the militancy 
of the United Mine Workers.  To inject some militancy and some 
backbone in the public sector in those days, he regularly told 
this story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the miners of Cape Breton went on strike, they would throw 
their lunch pails in the air.  His idea of taking a strike vote 
was if the lunch pails stayed up, they went back to work; if they 
came down, they went on strike.  According to Lofty MacMillan 
that is how they took strike votes in those days. The member for 
Winnipeg North Centre is saying that works for him.  I suspect 
that it would.  Mr. MacMillan and his colleagues were busy 
fighting the mine owners. However, for a number of decades now, 
the government has been involved.  That always makes life a 
little more interesting. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 was introduced to authorize the divestiture of the 
assets of, and to dissolve, the Cape Breton Development 
Corporation, to amend the Cape Breton Development Corporation 
Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enactment provides the necessary authority for the 
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the 
Cape Breton Development Corporation, and provides for the 
dissolution and winding up of the affairs of the corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the proposed legislation is to enable a private 
sector operator to acquire the mining assets of the corporation 
so that the federal government can exit the coal mining business 
in Cape Breton and to provide for the continuation of the 
existing jurisdictional regimes for labour relations, 
occupational safety and health, and labour standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP will propose that the bill be withdrawn and that the 
matter be referred to committee, for three main reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the unions representing Devco employees have taken the 
corporation to court for failure to meet its obligations under 
the legislation and seek to have clause 17(4)(<I>b</I>) included in any 
new legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, so that the committee can institute a process of full

order to offset the effects of possible privatization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the uncertainty created by the recent court decisions

</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning there have been some developments on the bill. As I 
understand it, and details are a bit uncertain at the moment, it 
appears that the arbitration board has been very critical of the 
way in which the government has acted heretofore.  We hope that 
it will look very seriously at the arbitrators' report today and 
take the necessary corrective steps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues from Sydney—Victoria and Bras D'Or—Cape Breton 
have been saying that the amendments we are proposing have been 
developed in very close consultation with the miners themselves, 
with the people of that region.  They know exactly what needs to 
be done and the converse, what has not been done, over the past 
number of years as the government took arbitrary steps without 
adequate consultation with the people themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We simply ask, will the government not agree with the amendments 
that have been developed by the miners and their families and 
indeed the leaders in and around Cape Breton? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other members have talked about the fact that coal has been 
mined for 300 years in Cape Breton and it is not because there is 
no coal left that we are in this predicament.  It is rather 
because of a government decision to get fine coal from other 
locations and countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns that we have is that the coal will now be 
coming from Colombia in South America. As I think you are aware, 
Mr. Speaker, and certainly our caucus members know what has been 
happening for the last number of years in Colombia.  I do not 
think there is any country, certainly not in this hemisphere and 
perhaps not anywhere in the world, where trade union leaders are 
more endangered by loss of life than they are in that country. 
As my colleague our labour critic is saying, they are being 
assassinated at an alarming rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are aware of a brother from Colombia that was in this country 
within the past month, who is now back there, and there have been 
two attempts on his life. We have made appeals to the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, because I presume he will be at the Organization 
of American States meetings this weekend in Windsor, Ontario, 
that there be adequate pressure put to ensure that this 
individual and other individuals are not subject to being 
assassinated, murdered, because of the actions of the Colombian 
government. We cannot say that strongly enough.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as 
has been pointed out by my colleagues, the representatives from 
Sydney—Victoria and Bras D'Or—Cape Breton and now the member 
for Palliser, members of our caucus, they have all made it 
abundantly clear that Bill C-11 constitutes a breach of a 
promise.  It constitutes a breach of trust.  It constitutes an 
abdication of responsibility.  Even more worrisome, it indicates 
a shift in policy that we find most disturbing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Halifax was indicating that somehow there is a 
prevailing attitude within the government that all things 
publicly run are bad and all things privately run are good.  It 
is some philosophical shift.  The government bought into the 
right-wing line that the government and the public sector are 
incapable of managing any enterprise and therefore it should be 
divested and put into the private sector which will somehow do a 
better job.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is worrisome, because when we look at why public 
institutions were generated and created, it was for the public 
good, the common good.  There was a vision larger than just the 
profitability of the corporation.  It served a purpose and 
function in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the history of Devco, the development 
corporation in Cape Breton, it was not just about coal mining. 
Devco went beyond coal mining.  People do not realize that it had 
a number of functions within the community and coal mining was 
just one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are really talking about today is the shutting down of 
the mines.  I ask the House to consider what good common sense it 
was to support the coal mining industry, which had a great long 
history in the area already, for the purposes of providing fuel 
to run the generating stations to provide electricity for the 
province of Nova Scotia.  If it was a corporation it would be 
called vertical integration. People are always saying that 
government should act more like business.  This was good business 
sense.  This was keeping the jobs in house, enjoying all the 
benefits as well as the actual product of generating electricity 
for the public at a reasonable rate.  This was common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people talk about Devco as being some kind of a money pit, 
a waste of money or too much money spent, they forget the 
benefit.  Yes, maybe hundreds of millions of dollars were 
invested, but there were billions of dollars worth of benefit 
extracted, not just in wages but in actual productivity and 
production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall, Devco may have been a net loser.  There may have been 
some enterprises which it tried and failed at, but the coal 
mining side of it was economically viable and served a valuable 
purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad the member for Palliser illustrated the folly in this 
line of thinking.  Now the thermal generating plants which 
generate electricity for Nova Scotia will have no option but to 
outsource for their coal.  Ironically, and we pointed out the 
tragedy of this, they are going to buy their coal from Colombia 
of all places.  Instead of looking after jobs in their home 
community of Cape Breton and allowing families to grow up with a 
decent standard of living, we are going to support the murderers 
in Colombia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know who we are buying our coal from there, but it is a 
corrupt place.  Working conditions are poor, wages are pathetic, 
and people who speak out to try and make it better are 
assassinated.  Is that who we want for a business partner to 
supply the generating stations of Nova Scotia?  It is absolutely 
tragic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The frustration I sense from the speakers today is overwhelming. 
We have people in our caucus who spent their lives representing 
the people of Cape Breton.  Now they have the privilege of doing 
that in the House of Commons and they have made passionate, 
compelling arguments to the government for years since they have 
been here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since June 1997 I have heard the members representing Cape 
Breton appeal to the government to find a satisfactory resolve to 
the economic development situation in Cape Breton.  Ironically, 
today there has been a bit of a breakthrough.  The much awaited 
arbitration case dealing with the outstanding issues finally came 
through.  It says exactly what the two members have been saying 
for three years.  They should be able to feel some sense of 
satisfaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why it took three years is anyone's guess.  I think there is a 
philosophical bent, a fundamental shift in policy on that side of 
the House of Commons which makes them unwilling or unable to 
listen to reason and logic to find a satisfactory resolve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 is so fundamentally flawed.  It indicates a failure to 
recognize the significance and the impact that the bill has on 
the community.  It constitutes a breach of trust and a breach of 
promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in the old days there was some sense of national vision, 
even from Liberal governments of the day.  There was some sense 
of national pride and national unity, and it becomes a unity 
issue with economic development.  There was a feeling that 
government has a role to play to stimulate the economy in areas 
where it is necessary in order to ensure that all Canadians enjoy 
a reasonable standard of living. In the richest and most powerful 
civilization in the history of the world, one would think we 
could at least devise a way that we could all share in the bounty 
of the country to enjoy a reasonable standard of living. The 
government has abandoned that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know specifically who the people were who did have some 
vision in those days.  I suppose they were the Allan J. 
MacEachens, the Walter Gordons, the Paul Martin Srs., the people 
who had some sort of a philosophy associated with pulling the 
country together instead of letting it drift apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have abandoned the attitude that government has any role to 
play and we are going to leave it up to the free hand of the 
market, to the Adam Smiths of the world. 
They will say that if we let the market prevail all will be well. 
All is not well because, fundamentally, capital has no 
conscience.  I have reminded the House of Commons of that simple 
fact before.  It is like a big dumb shark that gobbles up stuff 
and has no conscience, no vision, no thought and no sense of 
doing the right thing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government has the role of conscience of capital.  Somebody has 
to intervene and give these Liberals a conscience and a little 
more sense of purpose.  Frankly, without that there would be no 
regulations and no controls whatsoever.  This, unfortunately, is 
what has happened now in Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has abandoned Cape Breton.  It has traded off an 
economically viable enterprise for $68 million.  That is the 30 
pieces of silver it used to buy off the people of Cape Breton. 
Sixty-eight million dollars may sound like a lot of money but we 
need to put that in perspective given the surpluses, et cetera, 
that the government has now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI system alone is showing a surplus of $600 million a 
month.  That is the kind of money the government deals with. 
Sixty-eight million dollars is a paltry and trivial amount when 
we are talking about trying to replace the economic base of an 
entire island.  It does not even register on the map.  We find it 
offensive that the government thinks people are so gullible that 
they will be blinded by the flash of silver, the $68 million. It 
is almost insignificant statistically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton and the member for 
Sydney—Victoria thought they could salvage some satisfaction out 
of Bill C-11 by moving some very important amendments that we are 
debating here today.  I thought these were very thoughtful and 
very meaningful amendments because those members did what the 
government did not do.  They consulted with the stakeholders. 
They actually spoke to the miners and asked them what they needed 
and what they thought the shortcomings were in Bill C-11.  What a 
novel concept:  ask people what they need, ask the experts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government refused time and time again to hold public 
hearings.  It is going to take steps that will devastate a whole 
community but does not have the courage to defend its position in 
front of the very people these decisions affect.  Government 
members did not have the guts or the intestinal fortitude to talk 
to the people in Cape Breton, and that is cowardly.  The members 
of parliament who represent Cape Breton and that area spoke to 
the people and came forward with meaningful amendments, some of 
which are so common sense that it is inconceivable why the 
government would not deal with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the amendments wants to ensure that members of the new 
Devco board of directors are from Cape Breton.  The Liberals do 
not want to handicap themselves.  They might want to parachute in 
some patronage candidate from central Canada, no doubt from some 
place where they have friends and some elected representatives, 
instead of Cape Bretoners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another meaningful amendment would ensure that miners who became 
sick from working in the mine for 40 years and have black lung 
disease would be protected with some kind of long term extended 
health benefit.  After giving their lives to the industry and now 
having the government pull the rug out from under them, would it 
not be common decency to ensure extended health benefits for 
those miners?  No, the government will not entertain that idea 
either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This group of amendments seeks to make Bill C-11 less 
devastating.  I am disappointed that there has been no movement 
whatsoever from the government side.  Do those members not feel 
any responsibility or accountability for what they have done to 
Cape Breton?  I do not know.  I do not think they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret and lament the fact that Bill C-11 will probably pass 
unamended.  My prediction is that the government will wear that 
and pay the political price for many years to come. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today with regard to Bill C-11.  I will give 
a bit of history with regard to what is going on with Devco and 
what I have seen take place in Cape Breton since 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In late 1994 or the early part of 1995 I had the opportunity to 
go to Cape Breton to try to get an understanding of the concerns. 
I had the great opportunity of meeting with the miners, the union 
people and with business people.  I was also taken down through 
the mines.  I started to catch up a bit on what was taking place. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I knew about the money that had been put into Devco.  What I 
could not understand, particularly after being down there, was 
what happened to a large percentage of those funds.  I could see 
that the funds had not gone to the miners or even into the mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I began to dig a little more I came across the fact that the 
government had decided not to renew its contracts for exporting 
coal from some of the mines.  Although I am not a raving genius 
myself, I can understand that when a company gives up a segment 
of its market, particularly when it is competing on an 
international scale, it has just told its customers that it is no 
longer willing to produce the goods that they want.  Any sane 
thinking company would know that its customers would go somewhere 
else to find the market, but not the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government figured that it could bring them back any time it 
wanted to, but that was not the case.  Instead, the government 
decided to try to prove that this was not economically feasible. 
It went through a broad scope of deals and non-deals, promises 
and broken promises in order to achieve this.  In the meantime, 
it told the people of Cape Breton that it would look after their 
best interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government repeatedly told the people of Cape Breton that 
Devco would be there, that they should not to worry, that they 
should be happy and that the government would look after them. 
All the time it was planning on just closing the door without 
very much concern about what would happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The door closed and now we are left trying to clean this up and 
trying to make some sense out of this.  The government comes 
forward with Bill C-11.  Everybody from all parties of the House 
have gone through the bill carefully and some members have put 
forth a number of amendments.  The government has decided not to 
accept any of those amendments.  I cannot understand this.  We 
have members in the House who represent Cape Breton, who have 
been down there and know the people intimately, and yet their 
motions are not to be accepted by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been down there and have spoken with the people.  We 
have met with the business community, with labour and with 
management but not one of our motions has been accepted.  This 
does not show a willingness on behalf of the government, no 
matter what it says or professes in the House, to listen to the 
people of Canada no matter what region they are from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members like to stand in the House and say that this is an 
eastern problem or that is a western problem.  No, this is a 
Canadian problem.  Maybe it is about time government members made 
up their minds that they are here to represent all of Canada, not 
just pieces and segments here and there whenever they see fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this bill came before the House we were in a dilemma.  I 
may be hesitant sometimes in the way I speak, but when I went 
through the files on Devco and read between the lines—it is not 
there in black and white because the government will not let it 
be there in black and white—I had to  wonder who took the money 
out of Devco.  It was not the miners.  It is not laying there in 
an abundance of assets.  There are some assets there, yes, but 
what happened to most of the money?  How much went toward 
patronage appointments?  How much was never accounted for? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot seem to find the answers in the bill no matter how hard 
I look.  I have to wonder what Devco was all about.  It certainly 
was not to help Cape Bretoners.  Maybe it helped a select few, 
but certainly not the Cape Bretoners themselves.  When we see the 
mess that is there now, we think of the money that has been put 
into Devco and what has been accomplished.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of our people have talked to the union.  We have talked to 
the miners who have worked in the mines for years, some of whom 
are two months or a year short of retirement.  They will get no 
funds out of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is this passionate Liberal Party?  Where are the members 
who hammered on our doors just before the last election and said 
“I am here to help you. I am here to listen to your problems and 
I am here to help fix them.  Please elect me again”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the next election those members will get the same message in 
Cape Breton as they will get in our constituency in British 
Columbia, “Get out of here.  We are sick and tired of listening 
to what you say you are going to do and then having to live with 
what you actually do”.  Cape Breton has found out the tough way, 
and it is really a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I go through the motions, I see one that I wanted in the 
bill. Motion No. 14 reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>17. The Corporation shall adopt all reasonable measures to 
reduce, to the fullest extent possible, any economic hardship or 
unemployment that may result from the closing of any coal mine 
operated by the Corporation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals turned this motion down.  What is so unreasonable 
about that motion?  All it asks is for the government to do its 
job, and it has refused to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I want to say that this government has a lot to be 
ashamed of today and I hope it realizes this soon. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, once again I rise to talk about Bill C-11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly I concur with what has been said already by my 
colleagues in this House, both within my party and within the 
NDP, although our objective on the bill is somewhat different 
from the NDP because we support the idea of privatizing Devco. It 
only makes sense to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last 30 years this government and the Conservative 
government have certainly proven that Devco was created for 
political purposes, existed for political purposes and appears is 
going to die for a political purpose, which is really 
unfortunate.  What is going on here is such a tragedy.  What the 
government appears to be preparing to do is immoral. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked to you before, Mr. Speaker, and I will say it again in 
the House; what the Liberals are doing to Cape Breton is just as 
horrendous as what the Trudeau Liberals did to Alberta under the 
national energy program.  I would understand if Cape Bretoners 
rose up in screaming protest to what is happening.  If Cape 
Bretoners and Atlantic Canadians never again in Canadian history 
voted for a Liberal candidate I could certainly understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a history of mining in Cape Breton that goes back 
hundreds of years.  We have some of the best mining expertise in 
the world in Cape Breton.  We have hundreds of millions of tonnes 
of coal in the ground in Cape Breton.  We have a market in Nova 
Scotia for all the coal that Cape Breton miners can produce for 
Nova Scotia power.  We have management capability in Cape Breton 
that wanted to bid on the assets of Devco and wanted to operate 
the mines, the wash plant and all the rest of the assets for the 
benefit of Cape Bretoners and Nova Scotians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government, it would appear, is denying them that 
opportunity without even a fair hearing.  That makes no sense to 
me and it again smacks of the same kind of mismanagement, 
corruption and patronage that has dogged Devco for the last 30 
years.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tried to get into those issues in committee.  I tried to 
expose some examples of the patronage and mismanagement that went 
on.  The president and chairman of the board of directors of 
Devco was quoted in a local Nova Scotia newspaper on how terrible 
the management of Devco had been and how that was the reason 
Devco could never be profitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that coal mining in Cape Breton can be profitable, 
but certain conditions have to be met before that is possible. 
The government does not appear to be allowing those conditions to 
be put in place.  To preserve Devco as a crown corporation and to 
preserve the system imposed on the coal mining industry in Cape 
Breton would never be profitable.  It would never survive without 
the ongoing billions of dollars of subsidies that have been 
poured into it.  They would have to continue to be poured in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Devco were privatized and not saddled with the liability of 
the successor rights of the existing union contracts today, or 
the huge liability going all the way back to the Dominion Steel 
and Coal Company which succeeded Devco, and if a private company 
could buy the assets of Devco and operate it without those 
liabilities and without the huge environmental liability that has 
accumulated over the years, which everybody has been trying to 
ignore, coal mining could be profitable in Cape Breton.  It could 
do much for the economy.  It could employ miners.  It could be a 
wonderful opportunity for Cape Bretoners to control their own 
destinies, to have jobs and benefits, and to carry on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will not allow that to happen because then Cape 
Bretoners and Atlantic Canadians would be independent.  They 
would not have the strings attached that they would have by 
shutting down Devco, putting in a call centre and perhaps 
creating hairdressers like they did in the TAGS program.  Those 
programs always have strings attached.  There is always a 
political payback for those kinds of programs if the government 
puts them in place.  That is what the government is trying to 
maintain in Atlantic Canada.  That is such a shame because I 
think there are real opportunities here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not support a few of the amendments in the three groups. 
The NDP has reintroduced at report stage debate the amendments we 
introduced in committee.  We will support them as we will support 
the NDP amendments to ensure that there is some local 
representation on the board of Devco and on the pensioners 
administration board.  Why would anybody not be willing to do 
that?  It only makes perfect sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only amendments we will not support are the ones dealing 
with successor rights under the union contracts.  If the 
government has not already guaranteed, and I think it has, those 
successor rights guarantee that whoever buys the Devco assets 
will never operate the mines, or at least not operate them for 
any length of time, and will therefore shut them down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is pretty obvious that the government has refused in 
committee or in debate to indicate whether or not there was any 
requirement in the conditions of sale of Devco that whoever buys 
it would have to operate the mines even for one day.  I suspect 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was in Cape Breton the miners that work underground in 
the Prince Mine told me that the real reason there is such a rush 
on the bill is that they are working on a particular coal face in 
the mine.  Instead of preparing another coal face at the same 
time so that when that one is mined out they have the next face 
to move to and continue, there is no preparation for another coal 
face. 
This indicates to me that there is no intention, once the current 
coal face is mined out, to continue operating the mine.  They 
could not, if they wanted to, without that forward thinking.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at some of the yearly financial statements of the 
corporation we see no long term plan to operate any of the mines 
in the Devco corporation.  Certainly there is no capital 
investment, maintenance or upkeep of the assets.  It can be seen 
as plain as day that it is heading for a dead end and will be 
shut down.  It is being strangled to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no wonder that the people of Cape Breton, the NDP, our 
party and the Conservative Party are suspicious. This whole issue 
is shrouded in a veil of secrecy under the guise of commercial 
confidentiality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I asked the minister in committee if Canadians would ever 
know the terms and conditions of the sale, he assured us that 
once the sale had gone through and the bill had passed he would 
have no problem disclosing the terms and conditions of the sale, 
until one of his minions leaned over and whispered in his ear 
that it would not be possible, that the terms and conditions of 
the sale would have to remain secret forever, that they could 
never be exposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would everyone involved not become extremely suspicious of 
what is going on?  A very valuable asset is on the auction block, 
and that is the contract with Nova Scotia Power.  Clearly that is 
what is being bid on.  As far as anyone in Cape Breton knows and 
as far as anyone here knows, and I guess only the government 
knows for sure, any local bids have not even been considered in 
the sale.  The bids being considered are foreign bids, American 
bids, assuming the coal is to come from offshore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the transport minister was asked a question about the mess 
in the airline industry, he stood in the House to say that is a 
small price to pay for a Canadian solution.  There is a price to 
pay for a Canadian solution in Cape Breton, and we should pay it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the 
comments of previous speakers.  A number of times I wondered 
whether I should intervene and either bring the discussion and 
comments back to the amendments we are looking at or challenge 
some of the numerous points that I think were outrageous and, at 
the very kindest, totally exaggerated.  I decided I would not do 
that and would encourage those who are interested— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  If I look over on the government side I find that we do 
not have a quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the count having been taken:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We have a quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I resisted the 
temptation to respond to every point.  Some good points were made 
but quite a large number of them were exaggerations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be that as it may, I encourage those outside the Chamber who are 
interested in the facts to read the various public documents that 
relate to Bill C-11 and the proposed sale of the federal coal 
assets in Cape Breton.  I would also have them refer to the 
committee proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will briefly deal with some of the amendments.  I will not try 
to deal with all the amendments in Group No. 1.  Motion No. 1 
refers to the Government of Nova Scotia.  I am not aware that 
Nova Scotia has expressed any interest with reference to this 
proposed amendment. 
In any event I do not think it would be helpful to put in place 
measures that would preclude a future owner of the coal 
operations from government interference at that time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to all these amendments, the government will not be 
supporting any of them.  For the most part they are in many cases 
redundant, such as Motion No. 3 which refers to the auditor 
general.  The auditor general is Devco's auditor.  The Devco 
board is responsible for reporting to parliament every year. 
Therefore I doubt there are concerns over disclosure which have 
much if any substance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With reference to Motions Nos. 4 and 5, I believe they refer to 
undertakings to the general advantage of Canada.  Those measures 
are already taken care of in the bill as it stands.  Indeed they 
would also be redundant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Motion No. 2 in terms of a public inquiry, 
notwithstanding comments made earlier there have been extensive 
consultations over the years.  It has been studied enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude my comments on the first group of amendments. 
Let me just add, though, that I respect the views of members on 
Bill C-11.  It is a tough thing to do, but we on this side 
believe it is best for Cape Breton to allow the coal industry to 
get on.  We believe the communities and the people of Cape Breton 
are up to the future and will do well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise at this time to comment on Bill C-206 which makes extensive 
amendments to the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to take a moment to comment on the 
remarkable effort my colleague the member for 
Wentworth—Burlington has put into producing his Bill C-206. Many 
of us consider it to be an accomplishment to produce a private 
member's bill that contains one or two clauses.  The member for 
Wentworth—Burlington has met many administrative hurdles.  He 
has tenaciously persevered, which perseverance has brought us to 
this debate today. Bill C-206 contains almost 35 clauses. Overall 
it proposes a major overhaul to the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I would like to speak about the importance of the Access 
to Information Act and its role in promoting government openness 
and transparency.  Without a right of access enshrined in a piece 
of legislation, all talk about government transparency is, in the 
final analysis, somewhat hollow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to make some general remarks on the bill itself.  My 
position is that there are certain concepts expressed in the 
Access to Information Act that we should be extremely careful 
about revising.  That is, whatever reform of the act is carried 
out, it must, I believe, respect certain ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One idea relates to personal information.  First, the residents 
of Canada are obliged to give the government all kinds of 
personal information about themselves.  This is referred to as 
the collection of personal information.  Next, the government is 
obliged to use in specific and limited ways the personal 
information of Canadians that it has collected.  The Access to 
Information Act also permits and governs disclosure of that 
information.  Right now I wish to focus on disclosure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Disclosure is probably the most potentially controversial aspect 
of dealing with personal information.  Government must be careful 
when it changes the rules in a way which increases the government 
disclosure of personal information.  What is at stake is 
Canadians' confidence in their government and their willingness 
to provide the government their personal information.  For this 
reason I encourage the members of the House and the committee 
that will be examining Bill C-206 to pay great heed to the 
question of when, under the Access to Information Act, personal 
information gets released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-206 would require the disclosure of information held by 
the government after 30 years.  The Government of Canada is 
concerned that automatic disclosure of personal information the 
government has held for 30 years could lead to an infringement of 
an individual's right to privacy under the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individuals expect their confidentiality to be maintained when 
they provide government with their personal information. 
Canadians may fear that Bill C-206 would lead to an erosion of 
their right to expect privacy and confidentiality from their 
government.  Let me give an example.  Income tax returns contain 
a lot of private and personal information that should be 
continued to be protected.  No one would want his or her income 
tax information to be accessible at any time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privacy commissioner has also expressed his concerns about 
the impact the bill would have on the privacy of individuals and 
on the confidentiality of personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue of great importance is what approach to take to 
confidential commercial information.  As I mentioned in relation 
to personal information, businesses in Canada are obliged in a 
number of circumstances to give the government various types of 
highly confidential commercial information.  It has been pointed 
out that if we reduce the level of protection on valuable 
confidential commercial information, then I am afraid that 
businesses may begin to think that the risk involved and the cost 
of doing business in Canada is too high. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give you a concrete example. If I had a business and 
thought that, in order to get the government to approve a new 
product, I would have to let my competitors have access to 
confidential business information, I would certainly be 
reluctant to give that information to the government. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a theme running through my comments and it is this.  I 
am entirely in favour of trying to increase government openness. 
Indeed, I hope that this issue will be properly addressed by 
whatever reform of the Access to Information Act goes forward. At 
the same time we should remember that letting the sun shine in on 
government operations, which is good, is not the same thing as 
letting out people's personal information or businesses' 
confidential information.  The question of disclosure is 
extremely sensitive and should not be undertaken without careful 
consideration and consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we should bear in mind that there is more than one 
solution for dealing with a piece of legislation that may no 
longer be working quite as well as it should be.  We tend to 
think automatically that a statute must be fixed by making 
amendments to it. 
In fact, the way a statute works can be fixed by improving how it 
is applied and administered.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting that improvements in the application and 
administration of the access act would be the whole answer. 
However, I wish to suggest to the House that we not rush into 
amending the act before we are certain that this fairly drastic 
course of action is what is truly needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to reform the act, surely it should not be 
undertaken without first conducting broad public consultations to 
allow all those who have an interest and a stake in this 
legislation to express their views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament's information watchdog, the information commissioner, 
made this very suggestion when he appeared before the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights last November.  He stated 
that proposals for access reform should be formed by a variety of 
perspectives and that it would be preferable for consultations to 
be conducted on a broad scale, allowing all stakeholders to have 
a say.  I certainly agree with this view.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener—Waterloo, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on behalf of the hon. member for 
Wentworth—Burlington, the author and sponsor of Bill C-206, an 
act to amend the Access to Information Act.  Normally the member 
would be speaking himself at this time, but as it is the third 
hour of debate on this bill, and as the member spoke during the 
first hour of debate, he is not allowed under our standing orders 
to speak today.  Therefore, I will reflect the thoughts of the 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much has happened between the first hour of debate and this 
final one, a mere two days before Bill C-206 comes before the 
House for its second reading vote.  During the first hour when 
the member for Wentworth—Burlington described his bill there was 
optimism and excitement.  After 13 years of failed attempts, at 
last a bill was going forward that would substantially reform the 
Access to Information Act, the legislation that was intended to 
guarantee the right of Canadians to those government documents 
they should be entitled to see, but that over the years has 
become more an instrument of secrecy than of disclosure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For over a decade the public, the media, members of parliament, 
parliamentary committees and the former information commissioner 
himself have clamoured for the overhaul of the act, but never has 
any government come near to presenting legislation that answered 
the urgent calls for reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An impasse arose from the fact that it has been impossible to 
get consensus on how to amend the Access to Information Act from 
all the ministries of government that would be affected.  Added 
to this was the problem that the justice department writes all 
government legislation and, being comprised principally of 
lawyers, naturally tends to think in terms of increasing 
confidentiality and secrecy rather than of increasing openness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After three years of trying to get the justice minister to 
undertake reform to the Access to Information Act, the member for 
Wentworth—Burlington undertook to write appropriate legislation 
himself.  As a former journalist, author and now politician, he 
was uniquely qualified to undertake this task and, with the help 
of expert legislative counsel, Bill C-264, now Bill C-206, was 
presented to the House in October 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reforms proposed in Bill C-206 were sweeping, but almost all 
of them were taken from the recommendations of the parliamentary 
committee that proposed improvements to the access law, or from 
the 1993-94 report of the Access to Information 
Commissioner—almost all of them, save for the very first 
amendment, which proposed that the name of the Access to 
Information Act be changed to the open government act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the very beginning the member for Wentworth—Burlington 
tried to make it clear to opposition parties and the government 
alike that he would listen and act on all concerns and criticisms 
expressed about Bill C-206.  He has never pretended it to be a 
perfect bill and has asked only that it go through second reading 
to committee where witnesses can identify its flaws, propose 
improvements, answer concerns and amend it wherever necessary. 
In other words, the member for Wentworth—Burlington only asked 
that Bill C-206 go through the same legislative process as any 
other bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition MPs in their speeches to Bill C-206 have raised 
legitimate concerns, one of the more important being that they 
are afraid to give government institutions the power to consider 
multiple requests frivolous. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT43"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT43"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1335

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular amendment was an attempt to address a problem 
identified by the information commissioner in one of his reports, 
but if Bill C-206 deals poorly with this issue or, worse yet, if 
the amendment gives power to the government that is not intended, 
then it should be changed or struck from the bill at report 
stage.  The member for Wentworth—Burlington would support any 
such change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has said repeatedly the same thing to government, and 
for two years received favourable comment from officials in 
various ministries and active help from justice department 
officials, leading to a revised and more polished version of Bill 
C-206, and even encouragement from cabinet ministers, notably the 
justice minister and the foreign affairs minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, it was with surprise and some dismay that the member for 
Wentworth—Burlington was called to a meeting this past Monday 
before the Deputy Prime Minister, the justice minister, the 
treasury board president and the government House leader to be 
confronted with accusations that Bill C-206 contains major flaws. 
Even though he was given no advance notice of criticisms, the 
member gave full answer then and in writing by noon the next day. 
Meanwhile, the justice minister undertook to provide a full 
analysis of all that was supposedly wrong with Bill C-206. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Wednesday the government announced to Liberal members of 
parliament that it would not support Bill C-206.  On Thursday, 
that is, yesterday afternoon, the member for 
Wentworth—Burlington received the justice department critique of 
Bill C-206 and a formal letter rejecting Bill C-206 from the 
Deputy Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too bad that the justice minister has to rely on staff who 
could produce a document so inept as that which attempted to 
demolish Bill C-206.  They could not even get the clauses under 
discussion correct, or cover them all, or find merit in any that 
increased openness, no matter how minor.  Their criticism of 
clause 26 in Bill C-206 is completely wrong.  This clause would 
extend protection of memoranda to cabinet, not diminish it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arguments in the Deputy Prime Minister's letter had more 
substance, but none were sufficiently compelling to warrant 
killing the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is a vote at second reading all about anyway?  It seeks 
agreement in principle, that is all.  All legislation is regarded 
as requiring close examination, correction and improvement after 
second reading.  If this process is not successful, then a bill 
is killed at third reading, but not at second reading before it 
has had public airing before committee, not at second reading 
when all that is being sought is agreement in principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the principle?  The first amendment of Bill C-206 would 
rename the legislation to the open government act.  The second 
amendment would establish that it is the government's duty to 
release as much information as it reasonably can to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister vote in principle against such a bill? 
Will the Minister of Justice or the Deputy Prime Minister? 
Cabinet always has the option of killing the bill at third 
reading or in the Senate, but to oppose such a bill at birth? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the member for Wentworth—Burlington has indeed failed 
to be sufficiently accommodating.  The one single area of Bill 
C-206 that he has said he will not budge on is the amendment that 
would bring crown corporations like the CBC, Canada Post and the 
National Capital Commission under the legislation.  Crown 
corporations spend billions of taxpayer dollars.  They should and 
must be subject to better public scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely that is not cabinet's reason for opposing Bill C-206. 
Surely cabinet should want debate on how to make all government 
more open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us first came to this place in 1993.  The hon. member 
for Wentworth—Burlington has certainly been a man of parliament, 
a man of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is being proposed in Bill C-206 would help every member of 
parliament to do their job.  It would also help make transparent 
the workings of government to all Canadians.

notice from the hon. member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge that he is 
unable to move his motion during private members' hour on Monday, 
June 5, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has not been possible to arrange an exchange of positions in

Government Orders will begin at 11 a.m.

<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to address Bill C-206, an act to amend the Access to Information 
Act and to make amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That bill faced many obstacles before reaching second reading 
stage. I will show you how this bumpy ride finally made the Bloc 
Quebecois withdraw its support for this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to reaffirm the importance of access to 
information in a democratic society. It can be said without 
exaggeration that the rules governing access to information are 
a pillar of our democratic system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, without these rules, there can be no transparency in the 
public administration. 
If unable to count on concrete standards that would provide them 
with access to the documents being held by the government, the 
public would in fact be deprived of its power of review, which 
is essential to the democratic health of any society. This power 
of review arises out of a fundamental right that belongs to each 
of us: the right to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scandal around HRDC funding is a clear example of just how 
important that right to know is.  This scandalous episode 
reminds us that it is essential to have a clear picture of what 
government is doing, so that public funds do not serve any 
private interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the total absence of government co-operation in this area, 
the public has had to rely on the Access to Information Act to 
try to discover where the Transitional Jobs Fund money has gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, the Bloc Quebecois was able to use access to 
information to discover some major flaws in the Canada 
Information Office tendering process.  We discovered, in fact, 
that the CIO had awarded hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
contracts without any call for tenders since June 4, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is, for example, questionable to say the least that this 
body, the principal mandate of which is to promote federal 
propaganda, has awarded a $25,000 contract to a former Liberal 
candidate without calling for tenders.  Thanks to access to 
information, we were able to obtain, and provide to our fellow 
citizens, the disconcerting details on the Liberal government's 
administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must, however, be recognized that the effectiveness of the 
Access to Information Act is not absolute.  A formidable 
bureaucratic culture continues to thwart the desire of the 
public to discover more about the practices of their government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Information Commissioner of Canada, John Reid, spoke on this 
matter the last time he appeared before the Standing Committee 
on Human Resources Development and the Status of Persons with 
Disabilities.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right of access, which I and many others view as one of the 
cornerstones of our democratic process and one of the best tools 
available to ensure responsible government, only has meaning in 
a regime where information is professionally managed. All too 
often, and in a growing percentage of cases, it is proving 
virtually impossible for departments to locate all records 
responsive to a specific subject matter. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, it is not enough to hope that passing the Access to 
Information Act will lead to transparency, properly implementing 
it is necessary as well.  For this to happen, the public service 
must promptly and efficiently respond to requests for access to 
information. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a special report tabled in this House on Tuesday, the 
information commissioner evaluated the performance of eight 
departments in terms of their response time to requests for 
access to information.  Once again, the commissioner's 
examination revealed that a number of departments fall far short 
in terms of speed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No fewer than six departments, in fact, got an “F” on their 
response time.  These dubious results illustrate just how far 
our institutions are away from developing the effectiveness 
required in properly applying the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, by tabling Bill C-206, the hon. member for 
Wentworth—Burlington seemingly tried to correct certain flaws in 
the Access to Information Act. As we know, the hon. member had 
already alerted the members of this House to the need for 
substantially reviewing the content of that act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 23, 1997, the hon. member had introduced another 
bill, Bill C-264, which received the support of a fair number of 
members. However, later on, the hon. member drastically changed 
the content of his bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 11, 1998, resorting to the politics of stealth, the 
original text of Bill C-264 was replaced with a different one. 
The bill was then reintroduced during the second session, on 
October 14, 1999, as it stood when the House prorogued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill originally called C-264 and amended on June 11, 1998, 
thus became Bill C-206 when the House resumed sitting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated in my introduction, that unusual process, to say 
the least, resulted in the Bloc Quebecois withdrawing its 
support. It must be understood that, while several Bloc 
Quebecois members initially supported the original version of 
Bill C-264, the situation is totally different in the case of 
the version now called Bill C-206. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a serious gap between these two versions. As evidence 
of that, one simply has to look at some of the new provisions 
that were quietly included in the June 11, 1998 version of the 
bill. The masterpiece of that sham is now found in clause 9 of 
Bill C-206. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, these amendments have to do with the terminology used in 
clause 14 of the bill. 
Under this first amendment, the head of a government institution 
could refuse to disclose records containing information having 
to do with federal-provincial relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So it was that on a fine day in June, 1998, the expression 
“federal-provincial negotiations” used until then in Bill C-264 
became “federal-provincial relations”. This change in 
terminology is not insignificant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, clause 14 of the bill provides for an important 
exception to the right of access to information.  By 
substituting a term as generic as “relations” for a more 
specific term such as “negotiations”, the scope of the exception 
is broadened considerably. 
According to the Bloc Quebecois, this is a fundamental change, 
because it would have the effect of excluding an entire range of 
records to which the public is entitled to have access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the new exception in clause 14.1, an exception not 
contained in the original version of Bill C-264, is quite simply 
unacceptable.  For the benefit of members of the House, I will 
read this exception: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The head of a government institution may refuse to disclose any 
record requested under this Act that contains information on 
plans, strategies or tactics relating to the possible secession 
of a part of Canada, including information held or collected for 
the purpose of developing those plans, strategies or tactics. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever the member for Wentworth—Burlington may say, this 
proposal is just plain antidemocratic.  How can we keep citizens 
in the dark about information dealing with the possible exercise 
of democracy by a people?  The supreme court has recognized that 
accession to sovereignty is a completely legitimate and highly 
democratic project.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have a right to know how the federal government 
intends to proceed regarding such a fundamental right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 11, 1998, Bill C-206 lost all credibility. Access to 
information, which is the core element of democracy for 
citizens, cannot be used as a tool to stop the democratic will 
of a people. The hon. member should know that it is ill-advised 
to follow the Privy Council's recommendations when it comes to 
democracy. History tells us that this bastion of federal 
arrogance is not very inclined to promote the development of 
democratic values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons, members will understand that the Bloc 
Quebecois does not support Bill C-206 and will strongly oppose 
its passing. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  There was some misunderstanding earlier and I would like 
to report to the House that discussions have taken place between 
all parties and the member for Wentworth—Burlington concerning 
the taking of the division on Bill C-206, scheduled at the 
conclusion of Private Members' Business today.  I believe you 
would find consent for the following: 
<A NAME="LINK244">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, at the conclusion of today's debate on Bill C-206, all 
questions necessary to dispose of the motion be deemed put and if 
a recorded division is requested it be deferred until Tuesday, 
June 6, at the expiry of the time provided for Government Orders. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The House will 
accept a request for unanimous consent at any time.  Just to be 
certain, we now have a request for unanimous consent to reverse 
an earlier unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I 
need clarification.  Perhaps I did not hear right again because I 
am getting old and deaf.  Can we say the question is deemed put 
if in fact a division is requested?  It seems to me that is 
contradictory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We are doing it in 
two steps.  We would put the question on the motion to the House. 
If it is accepted or rejected on division, that would be the end 
of it.  If a recorded division is demanded, the recorded division 
would be deferred until the end of Government Orders next week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in that case I believe it is 
redundant since that is done automatically on a Friday, is it 
not, or am I wrong? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We will put the 
question.  If the member for Elk Island chooses to say no, that 
is his prerogative.  Whether or not it is redundant, this is the 
suggestion being put by the deputy government whip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will do it in two phases.  Does the House give its unanimous 
consent for the deputy government whip to move the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is it the pleasure 
of the House to adopt the motion as presented by the deputy 
government whip? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(Motion agreed to) 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The next question is 
on second reading of Bill C-206.  Is it the pleasure of the House 
to adopt the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  All those in favour 
of the motion will please say yea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Yea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  All those opposed 
will please say nay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Nay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  In my opinion the 
nays have it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And more than five members having risen:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Pursuant to order 
made earlier today the recorded division is deferred until 
Tuesday, June 6, at the expiry of the time provided for 
Government Orders.
