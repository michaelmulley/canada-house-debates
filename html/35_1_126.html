	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I am now ready to rule on the 
question of privilege raised by the hon. member for Red Deer on 
November 15, 1994 concerning media disclosure of portions of 
the content of the report of the Special Joint Committee 
Reviewing Canada's Foreign Policy prior to the report's 
presentation to the House.
<P>
	I would like to thank the hon. member for bringing this matter 
to the attention of the House and the hon. member for Kingston 
and the Islands for his intervention.

	I wish to state at the outset that I view such matters very 
seriously, and I expect all members to do the same. The work of 
committees is very important and can only be successful if 
members can function knowing that their deliberations in the 
preparation of their reports can be kept confidential until 
presented in the House. All those involved in committee activity 
must know that they, along with the members of the committee, 
bear the responsibility to ensure that such committee matters are 
kept confidential.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If our parliamentary system is to work efficiently and 
effectively committee members must be able to function 
without the fear that the fruits of their investigations will be 
disseminated to the public before they have been finalized and 
before the House has had an opportunity to see the product of 
their labours. This is why committee reports are confidential 
until tabled and why to break this confidentiality is a breach of 
privilege. This is not a new problem and as the hon. member for 
Red Deer noted I have commented on it in this session.
<P>
	The hon. member quite rightly pointed out referring to 
citation 877(1) of Beauchesne's sixth edition that the premature 
disclosure of a committee report constitutes a breach of 
privilege.
<P>
	This unauthorized release of committee information is indeed 
a contempt of Parliament. I must therefore commend the hon. 
member for having respected our traditions by refraining from 
commenting on the report before it was presented to the House. 
However now that the report has been tabled the member will 
have opportunities both inside and outside the House to explain 
his party's views on the contents of the report and to correct any 
misconceptions which may have been formed by the member's 
silence.
<P>
<B>(1005) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The member has also cited section (2) of Beauchesne citation 
877 which notes that for a question of privilege to be <I>prima facie</I> 
in these circumstances, it must be more specific that a blanket 
accusation against the publication of a confidential document by 
the press. This citation is based on an extensive ruling given by 
Speaker Jerome on June 23, 1977 at pages 1203 to 1210 of the 
<I>Journals</I>.
<P>
	I appreciate the hon. member's attempt to tie his argument to 
this portion of the citation. However, in carefully reading 
Speaker Jerome's ruling, it is clear that the point he was trying to 
make, and this is important for us today, was that it is necessary 
to look at our conduct in this matter. This, I feel, can only be 
done if specific allegations are raised about the conduct of a 
specific individual or group of individuals, as the Speaker ruled 
in 1977. Indeed, when similar matters have come before the 
House in recent years, most notably in 1987 and 1988, the 
practice has been to pursue the issue only when a specific 
individual can be cited.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In 1987 it was alleged that a member revealed information 
about in camera committee proceedings. The committee in 
question reviewed the matter and upon its reporting to the House 
the Speaker found the incident to be a prima facie question of 
privilege. The matter was referred to the then Standing 
Committee on Elections, Privileges and Procedure for 
examination.
<P>
	The 1988 case involved the leaking of information to the 
media concerning a draft report of the Standing Committee on 
Finance. An unnamed employee of the member was found to 
have released the information but the issue was resolved by 
members of the committee who brought the matter to the 
attention of the House by way of a question of privilege. At that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7972"> 7972 </A></B>
<P>
time Speaker Fraser ruled that the issue had been dealt with by 
the committee  and there was therefore not a prima facie 
question of privilege.
<P>
	This said, as the hon. member for Red Deer has not made 
allegations against any particular individual I must state that at 
this time I am unable to accept this matter as a prima facie 
question of privilege. We are nonetheless faced with a very 
serious matter, for leaks of committee reports are not to be 
treated lightly.
<P>
	As all members are aware the Speaker is loath to intervene in 
committee matters. Difficulties arising in committee are 
traditionally brought to the attention of the House by way of a 
report from the committee. In circumstances similar to those 
currently before us a standing committee might decide to 
examine the matter of a breach of confidentiality and make a 
report to the House.
<P>
	The matter before us however is quite different for here we are 
dealing with a special joint committee which has tabled its final 
report. It has traditionally been interpreted that once a special 
committee tables its final report the committee ceases to exist.
<P>
	As I stated earlier, while I do not find that there is a prima 
facie question of privilege, the seriousness of a leak of 
confidential committee information should not go 
unchallenged. Should the House consent to have the question of 
premature disclosure of the committee report examined, there is 
nothing to prevent the House from doing so by way of a special 
order of reference to a committee.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The matter of confidentiality is one of great importance to the 
House and I remind all members of their responsibility to ensure 
that confidential proceedings and reports of committees remain 
so.

	The House resumed from November 17 consideration of the 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very glad to be speaking on social security review and 
particularly on the unemployment program.
<P>
	Before I do that I would like to say that the social security 
review is very timely for Canadians. It is very important for 
government and for all members of Parliament to look at it. Too 
often governments bring in programs or legislation which 
become obsolete and do not reflect the realities as some of our 
social security programs do, but do not get examined with the 
promptness they should.
<P>
	I am glad we are looking at the whole social security program 
for a variety of reasons. One is that some programs were brought 
in some 40 years ago. The economic realities have changed. The 
family structure has changed. The social circumstances have 
changed and our fiscal situation has changed. The global 
economy in terms of the types of jobs out there has changed. The 
demands on our business communities have changed. All of 
those changes result in the type of social security program we 
need that will take us into the next century and which will take 
into consideration the new realities we face.
<P>
	The social security review is very timely. It is important that 
Canadians are participating in ensuring the type of programs we 
come up with will be sustainable, affordable and effective. With 
the input of Canadians and other members of Parliament we will 
be able to put together that type of program.
<P>
	For now I am pleased to have the opportunity to explain the 
government's idea for renewal of our unemployment insurance 
program presented in the recent supplementary paper on UI. I 
am sure hon. members appreciate it is a key component in the 
reform of our social security system. The UI program has served 
us well, but because of the structural changes to the economy 
there are now numerous situations in which the program no 
longer does what it was originally intended to do.
<P>
	The UI program was created to provide workers with 
temporary income support between jobs, but the program no 
longer adequately addresses the changing nature of 
employment. Today many workers use it to supplement their 
income. That was not and is not its purpose. Workers and 
employers finance UI through their contributions.
<P>
	It is simply costing too much. For example in 1980 the 
program cost $4.4 billion. Last year it cost $19.7 billion. We 
cannot allow this escalation in UI costs to continue. The 
government is proposing that we spend more wisely. Often some 
people think that sometimes the more money thrown at a 
program, the better the program gets. We realize that what we 
have to do is spend more smartly and wisely. Our emphasis is to 
shift UI funds from income support to investing in helping 
people obtain jobs and become self-reliant.
<P>
	Some hon. members will ask about the seasonal workers. 
Seasonal workers make up about 40 per cent of UI clients and as 
much as 60 per cent of frequent claimants. Government 
recognizes it must address their specific circumstances and we 
are doing that.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development has 
established a working group on seasonal workers and UI. It is 
consulting with other stakeholders to come up with innovative 
ways to address the needs of seasonal industries. That includes 
reducing their frequent dependency on the UI program.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7973"> 7973 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	We know people need experience in the workplace. Therefore, 
to help people gain the experience and training required to keep 
a job, the government is testing new approaches such as 
community projects that offer work experience or earning 
supplements or assistance to entrepreneurs who wish to start 
their own businesses. The reason for that is quite 
straightforward. The government's top priority is to ensure a 
climate for continuing job creation.
<P>
	In the past year there have been 275,000 new jobs created. We 
want to keep the momentum going. One way of doing that will 
be through the reduced premium rates that will result from UI 
reform.
<P>
	As hon. members know, in 1995 we have already announced a 
premium reduction from 3.07 to 3.00. Estimates indicate that 
this reduction will help create or preserve jobs. We are 
proposing to keep moving in that direction.
<P>
	Another idea presented in the discussion paper regarding UI 
eligibility is the possibility of income testing, but this would 
apply only to people who use UI frequently.
<P>
	We need to use our limited resources to help those most in 
need. I wonder if hon. members realize that in 1991, 18 per cent 
of frequent claimants had incomes of over $50,000. An 
additional 28 per cent had family incomes ranging from $30,000 
to $50,000. The benefits received by frequent claimants go 
beyond insurance. They are more like supplementary income. 
The system can no longer support this misuse of funds.
<P>
	Some hon. members have expressed understandable concern 
about the effects of UI reform in Atlantic Canada. Atlantic 
Canadians are a proud people and we have to take measures to 
help them generate economic and social renewal. That is not just 
the government's opinion. Last year an Environics poll 
indicated that 60 per cent of all Atlantic residents acknowledged 
that the current UI program acts as a disincentive to finding 
work. Not only that but the Atlantic premiers stated that easy 
access to unemployment insurance benefits has created an 
economic malaise in the region.
<P>
	The strategy the government is recommending for Atlantic 
Canada is consistent with our general approach for the rest of the 
country and that is to invest in people through employment 
development services. This is the positive approach that will 
help Atlantic Canadians to get and keep satisfying jobs.
<P>
	Because of the changing nature of employment that I spoke of 
earlier, we no longer have any choice but to respond to the 
growth of non-standard work. I am referring to part timers, the 
self-employed, temporary workers and people with multiple 
jobs. Last year more than 60 per cent of all new jobs were part 
time. Many of those workers were not fully covered or not 
covered at all. We must address their needs.
<P>
	We are currently experimenting with initiatives such as 
earning supplements and consolidation of hours for UI 
insurability. The government is determined to find effective 
solutions to help all Canadians move toward long lasting 
self-sufficiency.
<P>
	As well, concerns have been expressed that employment 
development services will be too costly to offer to everyone who 
might want to use them. However, everything is not going to 
happen at once. We can meet the needs of some people through 
less expensive programs. I am thinking of such measures as 
wage subsidies, earning supplementation and assistance in 
searching for a job. Training capacity will be expanded 
gradually and eventually everyone interested will have access to 
employment development services.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	UI reform is not going to happen overnight. First we have to 
gather input from all Canadians on this process. The Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development is currently 
travelling across Canada listening to the views of a wide variety 
of Canadians. The committee will be reporting its findings and 
we will have to evaluate the various ideas to determine what is 
feasible and what is the best way to structure a new program.
<P>
	Having done all that, major changes to the UI system would be 
phased in over a number of years. Everyone affected would have 
adequate time to adjust. The exact timing might use the three 
and five rule. That means if changes are implemented in 1995 
the new program would not be fully operational until 1998. The 
timeframe will depend on the complexities of the changes.
<P>
	The key to successful reform of our unemployment insurance 
program will be to strike an appropriate balance between UIC's 
role as a temporary income support and its broader social role, to 
redistribute income and address narrowing regional disparities.
<P>
	The government will take an approach that is mindful of just 
how significant UI is in many provinces and in the lives of many 
people. We will not pull support from under anyone and leave 
him or her high and dry. But we will devise and implement a 
more flexible system, one that encourages adjustment and 
generates a climate for job creation and growth, a system that 
helps people to help themselves become self-supporting and 
contributing members of Canadian society.
<P>
	I invite all hon. colleagues to join the government in this 
crucial undertaking.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7974"> 7974 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the comments of the hon. member about 
the future of the UI system and the review of social policy. I 
thank him for his comments.
<P>
	I have a couple of questions for him. He mentioned near the 
end of his presentation that the role of UI is to redistribute 
wealth and be a tool of regional development. Could he clarify if 
that should be the role of UI or whether it should really be an 
insurance type program for the temporary loss of employment? I 
personally do not see it as a tool to redistribute wealth, nor is it a 
particularly effective tool for regional development.
<P>
	I would bring to his attention the figures which came out last 
week. They pointed out that the dollars contributed to the UI 
program and the ones paid out of the program in British 
Columbia are almost a one to one ratio. In Alberta they get short 
changed considerably. I think they get 76 cents paid back for 
every dollar they contribute. In the Atlantic provinces it is as 
high as five to one. Right now UI is being used as a tool to 
redistribute wealth. I wonder if the member wants that to 
continue? Does he think that is a valid role?
<P>
	Could he also tell me if he thinks the qualification period for 
UI should be standardized across the country? Should it be the 
same in the member's riding as it in Chicoutimi or Gander? 
Should there be a standardized qualification period?
<P>
	If he could answer those few questions for me for 
clarification, I would appreciate it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member for 
Fraser Valley East for taking an interest in this. I have often 
visited his riding, which has many farming communities, and I 
know many people in his riding. I know his area has a particular 
interest in this review, because there are many seasonal workers 
in his riding.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	Let me try to address his two questions, first of all in terms of 
the broader goals of redistribution involved.
<P>
	We want standards right across the nation. We do not want 
tremendous poverty in one province and tremendous wealth in 
another province. We want to be able to deal with the regional 
disparity. We want to make sure that where help is needed to 
create employment, to develop better employment programs, 
that we respond as a nation, that we respond to areas that are 
having greater economic difficulty than those with economic 
prosperity.
<P>
	That is what makes this country so great, that we want to deal 
with those issues. We want to deal with the regional disparities 
that exist across the country. We do not want to say that if a 
certain part of the country has a much lower standard of living 
than other parts that we do not really care. That is not what this is 
all about. As a country we must care for Canadians no matter 
where  they live and ensure that we have basic standards right 
across the country, including employment opportunities.
<P>
	In terms of the requirements for stamps to collect UIC, this 
must be looked at once again. Different areas of the country have 
different needs and those regional needs reflect the UI reform 
program. Just as in the hon. member's riding there are different 
needs, we have to look at the needs of seasonal workers and 
respond to them as well. One of the ways we can respond, as 
stated in our discussion paper, is to have a two tier program, a 
basic insurance program and an adjustment insurance program. 
Those people who use UI more frequently perhaps should be 
treated differently in terms of the premiums or of the benefits 
they receive, as opposed to those who have the basic insurance 
program.
<P>
	I hope that deals somewhat with the questions of the hon. 
member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to congratulate the member for Vancouver South for his 
informative remarks.
<P>
	I also want to take this moment to thank the member for York 
North who in his capacity as the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister for Human Resources Development is criss-crossing 
this great country visiting in ridings at the invitation of members 
of Parliament and listening to the people, hearing from groups 
and organizations on the subject of this important social security 
review.
<P>
	When in Hamilton just a couple of weeks ago to hear from 
Hamiltonians on this social security review, the member for 
York North and I heard from a dozen organizations, groups and 
individuals at the beautiful Hamilton Art Gallery. We repeatedly 
asked the question at the end of their representations: Is the 
status quo acceptable? In each and every case the answer we got 
back was no, it was not, no matter what organization, no matter 
what individual spoke.
<P>
	There does need to be change. Our current programs, while 
necessary, are not effective. They are outdated and simply not 
working, not doing the job they were intended to do.
<P>
	I want to ask the member for Vancouver South if this has been 
his experience when he has heard from the people, groups and 
organizations in his riding and across the country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> I want to thank the hon. member for his 
question. Canadians I have talked to across the country 
recognize the need for change. They recognize there has to be a 
change made in the social security programs because they see 
that 450,000 parents are on single parent social assistance, and 
90 per cent of them are women. That is a problem we have to 
deal with.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7975"> 7975 </A></B>
<P>
	What does that say for the children? We have to deal with the 
situation. One child of every five children grows up in poverty. 
That is a problem we have to deal with. Mahatma Gandhi once 
said that poverty is the worst type of violence against an 
individual.
<P>
	We have to deal with those issues under the social security 
programs. We know they are not working well because some of 
these problems would not exist if they were working. Our 
expenses on social assistance have continued to go up.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	We have to look at why. We cannot just spend money. We have 
to get at the root of the problem and ensure that people have the 
training and the skills. We must take away the disincentives that 
stop them from getting gainful employment, that stop them from 
getting into the workforce. For example, we need more day care 
facilities so that we give people a path, a way to get out of the 
cycle of dependency, making them independent and self-reliant.
<P>
	That is what social security reform is all about. It is giving 
those people an opportunity to be gainfully employed. We must 
tear down the barriers that stop them from seeking gainful 
employment and take away the disincentives so that they do 
have an opportunity. They want to work. They are not interested 
in staying on social assistance. The system does not let them 
come back.
<P>
	Those are the things that Canadians are looking for. 
Canadians are telling us yes, we need to change the system and 
we need to look at the way we do things because there is a better 
way. That is what we are searching for.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for a very good question.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will share 
my time with a colleague from the Bloc Quebecois; after that, all 
the speakers for the Bloc will do the same.
<P>
	For several days now, I have been hearing the arguments put 
forward by the proponents of the social security reform 
presented by the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
We are told that, in Canada, we need to reform social security. It 
is obvious that no matter what the field, the status quo is usually 
not acceptable. Society changes, ideas evolve. We must always 
look at the results of a given situation and see if it can be 
improved.
<P>
	You can be sure that a Bloc Quebecois member who, with a 
sovereignist agenda, is proposing a radical reform of the 
geopolitical situation in Canada, is not going to oppose change. 
Obviously not.
<P>
	Therefore, by definition, Bloc members do not object to a 
review or a reform of Canadian social programs. However, what 
we particularly question is the underlying ideology as well as 
the motives for the reform.
<P>
	A reform aimed at improving the system? Perfect! We could 
not agree more. But a reform to impose a new way of life, a 
reform aimed at cutting government expenditures in a 
roundabout way at the expense of the poorest members of 
society, we say no to that.
<P>
	Let us look at the ideological nature of the reform presented to 
us. As you know, for the past 10 to 15 years, in the Western 
World, we have witnessed the revival of the old neo-liberalism, 
that is to say, the rule of the market, the law of the jungle, so to 
speak. We were told that individuals must take care of 
themselves and be responsible for themselves. If they get rich, it 
is to their credit; if they are poor, well, it is their own fault. This 
ideology was dominant during the 19th century.
<P>
	Throughout the 20th century, people who pondered the fate of 
the poorest members of society as well as workers who 
organized, took issue over this type of society. They fought to 
obtain rights. These rights were hard won, they were not vested 
rights. People fought for better wages and living conditions, and 
for adequate social security against illness, accidents, old age 
and unemployment.
<P>
	In my view, the bill before us today calls into question these 
hard won social rights, the social model that has existed in 
Western Europe and Canada for fifty years now.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	The first attack on the social framework created in recent 
decades took place in Britain fifteen years ago. That country 
dismantled its social security system.
<P>
	Those in favour of the move told us that the British economy 
would only benefit. Fifteen years later, this is not immediately 
apparent. What we see is more poverty and people with less 
social security. What we do not see are newspaper articles 
telling us that economists, businessmen and politicians from 
around the world are flocking to Britain to study the 
extraordinary success of the British model.
<P>
	Fifteen years later, there is some doubt about the results. What 
is certain, however, is that the very people who needed social 
security are less well off than they were fifteen years ago.
<P>
	What I personally see behind this reform is the trend in 
Western society, driven by the new neo-liberal ideology, to 
question social security systems. When I look at the documents 
published in support of the reform, I see detailed analyses, 
statistical and economic arguments, and a highly developed 
theoretical framework. This is not the kind of thing that can be 
done within six, four or two months. I suggest that this is the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7976"> 7976 </A></B>
<P>
kind of reform Ms. Campbell would have proposed if she had 
won the last  election. The same philosophy underpins the whole 
reform effort.
<P>
	Another reason why I do not find the government's intentions 
very credible, although some members seem sincere in 
defending the system, is that this reform is based on the premise 
that government expenditures must be cut.
<P>
	We are told that Canada's debt is enormous. Everyone agrees, 
but when we look at the debt, we must think in terms of assets 
and liabilities. On the liabilities side, we are told that our debt is 
getting larger every second, every minute, every day. True, but 
what about our national wealth? We are told that the debt now 
amounts to 100 per cent of GDP. According to some economists, 
our national wealth adds up to 900 per cent of GDP. This means 
that Canada's economy as a whole is comprised of both debts 
and assets. We have different kinds of debts.
<P>
	Our debt includes not only the Prime Minister's limo and cook 
but also infrastructure, educational, health and investment 
expenditures. Any businessman will tell you that a loan taken 
out for investment purposes generates wealth down the line; it is 
not the same as money borrowed to pay for groceries.
<P>
	Those who invoke the national debt to justify all the cutbacks, 
to justify all kinds of measures that will ultimately hurt the less 
fortunate in our society, should at some point be honest enough 
to show us the whole picture.
<P>
	If they had told us that they would undertake a reform and if, 
after consultations with Parliament and with Canadians, they 
realized that the same amount should be spent on social security 
in Canada, I think that it would have been easier for me to agree 
that something must be done, that we would have been more 
willing to review the situation in Canada. But that is not what 
happened.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	The Minister of Finance told us that $7, $8 or $9 billion had to 
be cut from all social programs. I have started consulting 
Canadians in my riding. I sent the paper on the reform to 200 
people who are interested in social issues and I scheduled 
meetings where we can discuss exactly what is going on with 
this reform. If you tell people at the beginning, ``We are 
consulting you but you should know at the start that we must 
make deep cuts in social security spending'', people will then 
ask if they are really being consulted and whether the decision 
has not already been made.
<P>
	To conclude, I will say something about unemployment 
insurance. I read the document on unemployment insurance 
which says that we should move from unemployment insurance 
to employment insurance. But I have the feeling that a 
qualitative analysis of the system was done. I do not have much 
time, but I will try to talk about my two concerns at the end of 
my speech. The first thing is that I feel we accept the high 
unemployment rate. The unemployed and unemployment are 
seen as a problem, but we do not  realize that the problem is not 
unemployment and the unemployed; it is employment.
<P>
	I wish that the documents which the Liberal government 
presented to us showed this concern for employment in Canada. 
I would like to see commissions of inquiry travelling around to 
talk about jobs with Canadians and not just about cuts, 
difficulties and debts. We must take a positive attitude to this 
whole question of social security and realize that if people work, 
they pay taxes, and the country can distribute this tax revenue 
throughout society, especially to the most disadvantaged 
people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank the hon. member for his speech.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is as much as I will try this morning. I'm working on it 
and it will come along, I'm sure.
<P>
	I would like to comment on two or three points that the 
member raised. I have not heard in the House for some time if 
ever phrases such as the neo-conservative outlook and so on. I 
thought a lot of those comments had gone with the demise of the 
NDP. I had hoped that a lot of those phrases had gone into the 
past.
<P>
	There are two or three things I would like him to comment on. 
One is that we should not worry so much about the debt, that the 
debt and deficit are not a serious concern. He feels it is like a 
businessman who is investing in the future. I would point out to 
him first of all that no businessman is afraid of borrowing but a 
businessman is frequently afraid of borrowing year after year 
because of the inevitability of what that means. It means he will 
go broke.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member to comment on how long he 
thinks it is good to borrow, if he thinks we should continue to go 
in debt indefinitely or whether there should be an end in sight.
<P>
	Second, as an example of what will happen if we do not 
control this debt and deficit, I ask him to look at today's <I>Globe 
and Mail</I>. There is an article about the fact that Ontario is now 
being forced to search out niche markets to sell its bonds. This 
year it has gone to a 40-year bond option because no one will 
buy the 30-year bond. It is looking for tiny markets, tiny being 
$800 million this year, niche markets where it can sell more 
bonds. It is having trouble selling its bonds which means it is 
having trouble financing its debt.
<P>
	Every year that goes by that we continually go in debt makes it 
difficult to the point at which our wealthiest or at least our 
biggest province is now having to search out niche markets to 
sell bonds. I find that incredible.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7977"> 7977 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to comment on how long he 
thinks a country, province, or any organization should continue 
to go in debt and why he thinks that Canada, Quebec or any 
region is immune from market forces, in other words the forces 
which say it is going to be increasingly hard to finance that debt.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments and his question. Obviously, everyone is affected by 
market forces. However, when you are in debt, you usually try to 
figure out why. The last thing you cut is the money required for 
children and needy members of the family.
<P>
	Instead, you start by not going out as much and by cutting into 
the least useful expenditures. I do not think that the federal 
government has done that. When we first came to the House of 
Commons we asked for a review of all public spending, but this 
was not done. We were told that the standing committees could 
conduct such an exercise. A year later, it has become obvious 
that these committees will not do that.
<P>
	The federal government must first tighten its belt, before 
telling Canadians to do so. If the Prime Minister starts taking a 
taxi or a bus to get to work, then I might say that efforts are being 
made at every level of the government administration to reduce 
spending. However, as long as the Prime Minister has a cook 
costing taxpayers $50,000 a year, as well as a limousine, 
bodyguards, a residence and a very nice office, the federal 
government should take a close look at the situation before 
trying to make cuts and deprive Canadians of the basics.
<P>
	If the government does conduct a review of its spending, then 
it will have the necessary credibility to make cuts and suggest 
new ways of doing things. Until then, the government and those 
who propose reforms have very little credibility.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I see the member for 
Nepean rising. Just as a matter of explanation, Bloc members 
have indicated that they were splitting their time so there will be 
two speakers from the official opposition.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, upon opening the Green Paper, entitled <I>Improving 
Social Security in Canada</I>, I read the following, and I quote: 
``Canada's social security programs are envied throughout the 
world. They have helped make life better for generations of 
Canadians. But they have not kept pace with a changing world, 
and now many Canadians are falling through the cracks. Too 
many people find themselves having to use Unemployment 
Insurance time and time again. And they stay unemployed too 
long. Too many people are stuck on  social assistance. Too many 
of our children live in poverty''.
<P>
	The Green Paper goes on to say that last year, 13 per cent of all 
unemployed Canadians had been out of work for a year or more. 
Furthermore, and I quote: ``Our employment programs do not do 
enough to help the unemployed adjust to change and find new 
jobs. One in five Canadian children is growing up poor''. The 
Green Paper is full of such statements that point to the failure of 
federal social security programs.
<P>
	When the federal government tabled its reform package, 
which was supposed to be a Liberal masterpiece, one would have 
expected, first of all, that it would take a responsible approach 
by identifying real problems that create poverty, so as to provide 
the appropriate solutions. Second, that the federal government 
would protect the most vulnerable members of our society and 
concentrate on job creation. Third, that the federal Liberals 
would take advantage of this opportunity to demonstrate that 
federalism works, by reacting favourably and positively to the 
broad consensus in Quebec on manpower training.
<P>
	Unfortunately, they did not. As usual, the Liberal federal 
government introduced a centralist Green Paper that blithely 
encroaches on areas of provincial jurisdiction and, on top of 
that, aims to reduce the deficit at the expense of the most 
vulnerable in our society. Since my time is limited, I will touch 
briefly on three aspects of particular concern to me: 
unemployment insurance, post-secondary education and child 
tax benefits.
<P>
	The Green Paper on social security reform admits that job 
programs have failed to deliver. These programs are often 
poorly adapted and easily abused, according to the Green Paper.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	The federal government is therefore proposing various 
options for unemployment insurance reform. A proposal to 
reduce the amount of unemployment insurance benefits for 
low-income individuals would, according to the Quebec 
Minister responsible for Income Security, put an additional 
40,000 Quebec households on welfare.
<P>
	The federal government's proposal to raise the number of 
weeks required to establish eligibility for the Unemployment 
Insurance Program from 12 to 14 would cost the Quebec 
Treasury close to $28 million and cause an additional 3,275 
households to join the ranks of those already dependent on 
Quebec's income security program.
<P>
	A second proposal concerning unemployment insurance 
would create two classes of unemployed: frequent claimants and 
occasional claimants. Frequent claimants are people who claim 
unemployment insurance benefits three times within five years. 
The minister's Green Paper even considers them on a par with 
people who abuse the system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7978"> 7978 </A></B>
<P>
	This is what the document says, and I quote: ``The program is 
easily abused. Some workers and employers plan their work 
schedules around the UI program-alternating employment 
with UI benefits as a way of life. As a result, workers and 
employers in some industries subsidize those in other industries 
who use UI regularly''.
<P>
	Some new terms have been added, such as adjustment 
insurance, which is intended for frequent UI claimants. It states 
that while these benefits might be lower than basic coverage, 
more support would be provided to recipients to find work.
<P>
	What a novel idea, Mr. Speaker! The Quebec minister 
responsible for income security described this measure as 
despicable. To reduce benefits paid to workers, using as an 
excuse the fact that, in return, they will be trained for jobs that 
do not exist anyway, that is beyond all understanding. We all 
know that, in regions where the economy depends on seasonal 
activity, we do not need training programs that lead to 
non-employment, but a radical restructuring of the economy.
<P>
	What makes these proposals even less acceptable is the very 
fact that the very job development program, or JDP, put in place 
by the federal government has undergone major cuts over the 
past two years. In Rimouski for example, the JDP budget was 
reduced by 30 per cent in two years, from $1,275,000 to 
$790,000, in spite of the fact that the rate of unemployment 
remained high and relatively the same in the Lower St. 
Lawrence region.
<P>
	In sum, the federal government is penalizing seasonal 
workers and has once again failed to seize a golden opportunity 
to demonstrate that federalism could be profitable.
<P>
	For the sake of the 800,000 Quebecers who are out of work, 
with respect to unemployment and manpower, the government 
could have acted on the motion that was carried unanimously at 
the Quebec National Assembly on April 14, requesting that Mr. 
Jean Chrétien and the federal Liberal government respect the 
unanimous consensus on the need for Quebec to have exclusive 
jurisdiction over manpower training.
<P>
	It would be too easy to make Canada work. In its 
Machiavellian plan, the government decided instead to lead the 
people to believe that the big bad separatists are to blame for all 
our problems. It does not show, but the government is actually 
increasing overlap and duplication, which is unacceptable in 
times of fiscal restraint, especially as the major part of the 
proposed reform represents federal encroachment on a 
provincial jurisdiction. Unemployment benefits are being cut 
while the public service grows and the number of disputes 
between the two levels of government increases.
<P>
	There are approximately 150 manpower training programs 
run by about 10 Quebec and federal government departments. 
Some of these programs often have several components. So how 
can we expect  unemployed people from Montreal, Rimouski or 
Hull to sort out this mess?
<P>
	The government is not doing much better for our 
post-secondary institutions, since it proposes replacing cash 
transfer payments with a new student loan program.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	This decision by the federal government would leave the 
Quebec government with a $300-million shortfall, which would 
have to be made up elsewhere.
<P>
	The main consequence of this proposal would be a major hike 
in tuition fees. The rector of McGill University did not hesitate 
to say that his institution's tuition fees could reach up to $8,000 
a year. It goes without saying that this measure would restrict 
access to higher education, especially among the poor.
<P>
	As far as child benefits are concerned, the government 
admitted its failure by reminding us that one child in five, in 
Canada, lives in poverty. To address this problem, the green 
paper suggests among other things redirecting middle-class 
family benefits to less fortunate families. This measure-it 
must be reiterated-encroaches on an area of provincial 
jurisdiction. It also thrusts into poverty middle-class families 
forced to shoulder an excessive part of the deficit burden.
<P>
	All that the government has put on the table so far to reduce 
the deficit spares the rich and is designed to impoverish the 
Canadian middle class and to bring misery to those of us already 
living in poverty. This, in due time, will be remembered by 
everyone.
<P>
	What the Minister of Human Resources Development 
proposes is not a matter of reform but of shovelling part of the 
federal deficit into the provinces' back yards.
<P>
	So I leave the last word to Pierre Graveline, who in <I>Le Devoir</I> 
on October 20 summarized the goals pursued by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development in his reform of social 
programs thus: ``The Axworthy reform pursues two 
contradictory objectives at the same time: maintain and 
strengthen Ottawa's presence everywhere without giving an 
inch to Quebec, while significantly reducing social spending in 
order to slow the alarming growth in the federal debt''.
<P>
	Therefore, you will understand that, like my colleagues, I 
oppose the minister's motion, which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-take note of the progress made to date on the government's forthcoming 
reform of social security programs and of the views expressed by Canadians

	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, earlier this year 
the Minister of Transport announced his intention to destaff 35 
B.C. lighthouses. A massive protest prompted the minister to 
announce pubic consultations with mariners in British 
Columbia prior to any final decision to destaff. However a 
consultant hired by the government, Mr. Norman Mathews, a 
former secretary general of the International Association for 
Lighthouse Authority, has recently made comments in the press 
in advance of the public meetings that destaffing lighthouses is a 
done deal.
<P>
	Given Mr. Mathews' statements the people of British 
Columbia, and I am sure all people of Canada, want to know why 
the minister would perpetrate this sham of consultation when his 
department has already received its marching orders.
<P>
	This appearance of public consultation is both expensive and 
cruel. It raises hopes in the hearts of many that manned 
lighthouses will be maintained and it is costly.

grandparents can offer the unconditional love and understanding 
our children and grandchildren need.
<P>

children because they are our country's most valuable resource 
and because children matter.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday of this week Metis people across 
Canada held ceremonies to recognize the 109th anniversary of 
the hanging of Louis Riel for treason. Unfortunately Riel has 
been portrayed as either a traitor or a madman. In fact he was a 
founder of Manitoba, a member of the House, and a teacher who 
fought racism and unsympathetic authorities as he championed 
the cause of human rights.
<P>
	Riel fought hard for Metis rights and worked to voice the 
concerns of early western Canadians. He was a man who 
inspired and carried Metis dreams in 1885 and refused to 
abandon his people. In doing so he gave all aboriginal people the 
will to push forth and fight for their dreams and beliefs.
<P>
	This week is a good opportunity for Canadians and members 
of the House to remember all of the Metis and aboriginal people 
who have made the country a better place to live. Louis Riel and 
the other great Indian leaders such as Chief Poundmaker and 
Chief Big Bear died for what they believed in and passed on a 
proud legacy which continues to be carried by the Metis and 
aboriginal people today.

	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Essex-Kent, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
month marks the 50th anniversary of the death of Jack Miner, 
Canada's greatest naturalist. Jack Miner is best known as the 
founder of the Jack Miner Sanctuary near Kingsville, Ontario.
<P>
	Jack was an incredible person who was honoured by kings, 
queens, presidents and prime ministers for his great work in 
conservation. Jack was a very practical man who planted trees, 
not for a shady resting place for his retirement but for the 
appreciation and benefit of future generations.
<P>
	He banded the legs of thousands of Canada geese to identify 
their North American flyways. By placing a line of scripture on 
the band he used these legions of geese to spread the gospel 
throughout North America.
<P>
	To make certain this sanctuary would not be burdened by 
taxpayers, Jack Miner spent years lecturing about nature around 
the world. He set up a perpetual trust fund to pay for the 
operation of the Jack Miner Foundation.
<P>
	Jack Miner's family, Manley, Jasper, Kirk, and Cheryl have 
dedicated their lives to carry on the great tradition of Jack 
Miner.

	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the decision to eliminate shore based [stevedoring 
positions] on the Marine Atlantic ferries makes no sense 
whatsoever. Dozens of full time workers and replacement crew 
in the Port aux Basques area alone will lose their jobs. It will 
hurt the local economy at the worst possible time.
<P>
	This issue is of great concern to everyone for another reason. 
There is fear that if the plan goes ahead the safety of the public 
will be compromised for the sake of efficiency.
<P>
	There is a real need for Marine Atlantic to take another look at 
the issue to see the logic of keeping the [stevedoring position] at 
those ports including Port aux Basques and North Sydney where 
it has served so well for so many years.

afternoon the Minister of Human Resources Development 
challenged the student protesters to sit down and present their 
ideas.
<P>
	In my riding of Edmonton-Strathcona four different 
university groups requested to speak before the human 
resources committee and were originally turned down. These 
groups found out late yesterday that they would be appearing 
before the committee and would be receiving only 15 minutes 
each to present their arguments. I wonder how much time has 
been allocated to each of the 165 organizations whose noses are 
still in the public trough as they received almost $4 million in 
intervening funding.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	It seems clear to me that the Liberals are following the 
previous government's actions of talking to whom they wish and 
then having the audacity to call it public consultations. 
Canadians are not stupid. If the Liberals continue this shameful 
display they too will be able to hold their caucus meetings in a 
telephone booth just like the Tories.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of National 
Defence. Despite the constructive offer from the mayor of 
Saint-Jean that was announced this week, the federal 
government insists on closing the Collège militaire royal de 
Saint-Jean, on the grounds that it would save $23 million 
annually by making the RMC in Kingston a bilingual institution 
that would welcome francophone officer cadets.
<P>
	How can the minister maintain that he will save $23 million 
annually by closing the Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean, 
considering that very substantial additional spending will be 
required to help the RMC in Kingston make the necessary 
adjustments to accommodate students transferred from 
Saint-Jean and hire additional staff?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member does not have full possession of the facts.
<P>
	There were a number of expenses that were authorized by the 
previous government a couple of years ago for construction to 
start in 1995 for improvements to the Royal Military College in 
Kingston. Those are proceeding.
<P>
	With respect to the accommodation of students that will be 
required as a result of the closing of Royal Roads and CMR, 
there will only be minor modifications required with respect to 
the additional facilities at Kingston. Some of the provisions can 
be met by using existing military facilities and barracks at 
Kingston.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister should give us the details we have 
requested for over a year.
<P>
	Why does he refuse to admit that the so-called savings of $23 
million exist only in his own mind and is just a gross 
exaggeration by the government to justify its rash decision to 
close the Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean, a decision that 
was rushed through at the very last minute before the budget?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, again it was 
not a decision that was taken at the last minute. The closing of 
the two military colleges was something that was planned in 
preparation for us to meet our red book requirement to reduce 
military spending at the beginning of the year 1994-95. We have 
been through those arguments before.
<P>
	However, as far as the $23 million is concerned in terms of 
savings that is absolute, that is fixed. I would ask the hon. 
member to consult with his colleague, the member for Roberval, 
who came to the standing committee on defence and veterans 
affairs and questioned very precisely officials of the Department 
of National Defence and I believe got a full accounting.
<P>
	There is no fudging of figures. The $23 million in savings 
from CMR is real.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we asked the hon. member for Roberval about this, and 
the answers he was given lead to conclusions that are entirely 
different from those produced by the minister. He knows 
perfectly well that the decision made before the budget was to 
close the colleges in Saint-Jean and Victoria. The decision had 
been made.
<P>
	The minister also knows perfectly well that Quebec has only 
13 per cent of Canada's military infrastructures and that they 
decided to close CMR because at the last minute, they realized 
they needed an excuse that would satisfy English Canada, and 
that excuse was closing the CMR. The decision was not based on 
financial considerations but was merely a face-saving gesture. 
That is the real reason.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
I am not prepared to discuss the reasons that led to the closing of 
the CMR. We have made statements in the House on other 
occasions, and I think our position is quite clear.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have to say that much of what the hon. member asserts in this 
particular matter is absolutely false. We are not going to revisit 
the fact that the budget last year called for a certain reduction in 
expenditures in defence. It called for the closing of the two 
colleges. Those two colleges will close.
<P>
	What is really the issue and something that he should be 
concerned about is that the former Government of Quebec 
signed a deal that would meet the Department of National 
Defence's needs, the Government of Canada's needs, and also 
assist in the transformation of CMR into a civilian institution. 
The Government of Quebec is refusing to honour that deal.

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is also for the Minister of National 
Defence.
<P>
	Following disturbing revelations by major Barry Armstrong, 
senior medical officer of the unit several members of which 
were charged with the murder and torture of Somalian civilians, 
the Minister of National Defence announced yesterday a civilian 
public inquiry. Most of the decisions handed down so far have 
been appealed and the inquiry will take place after the appeals 
are heard.
<P>
	Does the Minister of National Defence intend to vest this 
inquiry with the same powers as a regular commission of 
inquiry, in particular subpoena and search powers, and the 
power to send officers with a warrant to obtain all relevant 
documents wherever they may be?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think 
it is appropriate for me to go further in the interests of ensuring 
the cause of justice be served by giving any more details about 
the inquiry that I announced yesterday. It will be an inquiry held 
under the auspices of the National Defence Act. It will be fully 
public. It will be totally civilian, including the chair. Members 
of the previous inquiry will be invited to participate in some 
particular way.
<P>
	As to the powers of that inquiry and the terms of reference, 
those will be drafted in the next couple of months. What I have 
to worry about and what the hon. member should worry about is 
the timing of such an inquiry. As legislators we cannot do 
anything that would serve to undermine the judicial process now 
under way.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, can the minister assure that this inquiry will also get to 
the bottom of things regarding the behaviour of several other 
soldiers belonging to the second commando of the Petawawa 
airborne regiment, and in particular the behaviour of 
high-ranking officers who supposedly allowed a group called 
the ``Rebels'' to fly a flag symbolizing white supremacy, for 
several months, on the Petawawa base, with complete impunity?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the inquiry will deal with all the aspects of the deployment of 
our forces in Somalia and all the activities of the airborne 
regiment. This is what I said we would do and I stand by that 
decision.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I bring to the attention of the House a very serious 
matter. This week the drunken and cocaine defence arguments 
acquitted a person charged with a serious crime once again since 
the Supreme Court ruled that intoxication could be used as a 
defence in any crime.
<P>
	Will the government commit to introducing a bill promptly in 
order to deal with this critical inadequacy in the law?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's concern in this 
question. It is a concern to all of us in this House of Commons.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has stated on occasion his concern on 
the matter. He has released a discussion paper which will seek 
the opinions of people right across the country up until February 
28, at which point he will then do what he has to do and what 
needs to be done as quickly as possible to correct this deficiency.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Canadians' nerves are fraying over this matter. The 
parliamentary secretary refers to a discussion paper, but in 
reality we should snap to some common sense in this place and 
do something.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice knows that under the common law 
judges are guided by previous decisions in similar cases. 
Criminals are on to this scam, realizing that they can get drunk 
or shoot up before or even after a crime if they are clever enough 
and be acquitted.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	Once again, will the minister commit today to a date before 
Christmas by which he will introduce legislation closing this 
loophole in the Criminal Code so that this travesty of justice can 
be stopped?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, of the groups in this country that have spoken to the 
Minister of Justice, almost completely all of them have stated 
that the Minister of Justice must proceed cautiously on this 
point. They want a good law to come from this consultation. 
They do not want something thrown out that is not going to be 
appropriate under these circumstances. The Minister of Justice 
is taking this very seriously and he is going to come forward 
with this law. It is going to be a suitable one.
<P>
	I would also say to the hon. member that two of these cases are 
under appeal and there is a very strong possibility that there 
could be a change in the decision on appeal.

Mr. Speaker, if this government was really taking this matter 
seriously it would move with much more speed than it is.
<P>
	There is no excuse for delay. The minister acted with amazing 
speed to eliminate the cultural defence. We applaud that, but he 
is dragging his feet over the drunken defence. One has to wonder 
about his commitment to eliminating this defence.
<P>
	Why does the Minister of Justice refuse to stop this madness 
today? Why does he not get in step with Canadians and place this 
item ahead of his own pet agenda of sexual orientation and gun 
control legislation?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, </B><B>Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I do not think in the history of this country have we 
had a Minister of Justice that has moved on so many subjects as 
quickly as this Minister of Justice.
<P>
	The Daviault case was decided. The decision was released by 
the Supreme Court of Canada on September 30. The Minister of 
Justice has been working on this question. He brought forward 
the discussion paper and we want a good result. We want to hear 
the opinion of Canadians. We do not want a knee-jerk reaction. 
That is not what Canadians want and that is not what Canadians 
deserve.

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, recent information regarding the Canadian 
frigate program reveals that Unisys GSG, a company 
responsible for integrating the defence department's electronic 
systems, proved unable to meet the requirements of the 
department. It was learned that the Canadian Navy will not have 
the necessary systems to train its technicians, and yet taxpayers 
will still have to pay a $90 million bill. Instead of getting tough, 
the Department of National Defence chose to sack its own team 
of auditors who had brought the problem with Unisys to light.
<P>
	How can the minister explain that he chose to disband his 
team of auditors, who were responsible for monitoring Unisys's 
work, instead of taking the appropriate action against a company 
which, obviously, is not even able to meet its contractual 
obligations to the Canadian government?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the 
problems that we have with project management, which was 
involved in the development of the Canadian patrol frigates and 
has been the problem in the development of other armed forces 
equipment, is that often the expenditures that ultimately are 
incurred are  much greater than originally anticipated because 
new technologies are being developed.
<P>
	Unisys is a company based in Montreal that has done some 
outstanding work over the years and is in the vanguard of 
development of high technology integrated systems within this 
country. I would hope that as a member of Parliament and also 
one that represents a constituency in Quebec the hon. member 
would not want to denigrate in any way the good work that is 
done by that company.
<P>
	With respect to the specific question on the Canadian patrol 
frigates, yes, there obviously were some teething problems. 
There were some cost overruns. These have been accommodated 
with negotiation between the company and the crown. As far as 
we are concerned the frigates now are fully operational. There 
may be the odd problem that surfaced because of the new 
technologies, but I do not think the member should be unduly 
worried.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, now that we know that the minister has not 
yet replaced his team of auditors, how can he explain that his 
department kept on making payments to Unisys GSG, even 
though he knew that this company was unable to deliver the 
products ordered by his department?
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, again I am 
shocked at the tone of this question that denigrates an 
outstanding Canadian high technology company and one that is 
based in the province of Quebec. I would like the hon. member 
to explain that to his constituents in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	The fact is that Unisys is meeting its obligations. Where there 
may be some problems in terms of expenditures or some minor 
modifications that have to be made to the systems that are 
integrated within the Canadian patrol frigates, those are being 
addressed in the normal way.

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley,

which could prevent the release of dangerous offenders like 
Budreo. However, the government says it will not support Bill 
C-240 because it may be against the charter rights of sexual 
predators like Budreo.

force concerning high risk offenders. It is presently examining 
effective ways to deal with these offenders. A report will be

<P>
	I should also add that the Solicitor General also rendered

Speaker, my question if for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	The case of the Canadian patrol frigates demonstrates that the 
government paid for products which were never delivered or 
which did not meet the requirements of the department. We have 
learned that of the 37 applications of the combat training system 
which were to be designed by Unisys GSG, only one has been 
delivered.
<P>
	How can the minister explain that he paid Unisys for a 
complete combat training system and is getting only one of the 
37 applications requested?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, again I am 
surprised at the line of questioning in terms of criticizing the 
work of this company.
<P>
	I explained to the hon. member's colleague earlier that when 
one develops new high technology systems inevitably problems 
will occur in the development, especially when dealing with 
integrated high tech systems.
<P>
	The requirements made by the CPF program from Unisys had 
some problems in development. They have since been resolved 
or are in the process of being resolved. I fail to see why the hon. 
member continues to persist in trying to undermine not only the 
integrity of this company, but the fact that the Canadian patrol 
frigate is the best of its class in the world.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr.

is incapable of managing its large capital programs?
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the one 
positive thing I can say is that we announced in the budget that in 
the future we would be moving to the acquisition of off the shelf 
products in military procurement as much as we could. This 
means that the teething problems caused by research and 
development in high technology equipment for the armed forces 
will be borne by a commercial manufacturer. Such equipment 
that we would buy would be commercial but would have a 
military application.
<P>
	Hopefully in the future we can get away from some of the 
problems the hon. member has described. It is interesting to note 
that the special committee on defence policy also recommended 
that the government pursue this line of acquisition more 
vigorously.

rights of farmers to control their own industry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and

has to do with marketing systems in western Canada. Obviously 
the government believes in democracy.

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7987"> 7987 </A></B>
<P>
	With respect to the issue of marketing systems, as the hon. 
member knows, that is a subject upon which different farmers in 
western Canada hold profoundly different opinions. There has 
been a variety of meetings, rallies and demonstrations on the 
subject on both sides of the issue.
<P>
	That is why I have undertaken to provide the opportunity for a 
very thorough forum through these winter months. Farmers 
from the different points of view on the issue will have a full 
opportunity to discuss that matter in an open, logical, objective 
fashion and not with the excesses of rhetoric that we hear from 
the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister obviously has a funny way of showing his 
belief in democracy.
<P>
	This is another classic case of Liberal democracy. Farmers in 
western Canada have developed a new special crops act. Yet the 
Canadian Grain Commission has ordered seed cleaning and 
special crop elevator operators to pay up to $20,000 in licensing 
and bonding fees or get shut down by the law.
<P>
	If the minister believes in democracy, when will he get his 
bureaucrats under control and get them working for farmers? 
Why will he not immediately introduce new special crops 
legislation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> The simple reason, Mr. Speaker, that the 
decision with respect to special crops takes some time is that 
there are a good many farmers in western Canada who disagree 
with the proposals that have been advanced.
<P>
	It is important to thoroughly analyse all of the various options

one of the level of protection that ought to be provided under the 
law to ensure that farmers have security in dealing with special 
crops dealers. That is the issue we are examining among other 
technical ones having to do with special crops.

structure be put in place and not one that is too onerous upon 
farmers or upon the industry.

	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	The chambers of commerce in several regions of Quebec have 
accused Air Canada and Canadian International of conspiring to 
eliminate competition in the regions. These companies are 
allegedly fixing higher prices for area service in order to 
subsidize international flights, where the competition is fierce.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Transport agree that the staggering 
increase in airfare since 1988 is killing our regional economies 
and that it shows that deregulation is ineffective in stimulating 
competition in the airline industry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member raises some very important questions.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	Allegations of a conspiracy by airlines to fix prices and so 
forth raise some very thorny questions, and I would like to 
emphasize that if those who are concerned about this problem 
are really looking for answers and want to look into the matter 
more thoroughly, they should exercise their right to express 
their concerns to the National Transportation Agency, in 
addition to perhaps consulting the Competition Act.
<P>
	The allegations made are serious ones, and I believe that the 
airlines and all those involved in the sector have the right to see 
these allegations made and directed to the right quarter. If an 
investigation is necessary, then one should be held, in order to 
shed some light on the question raised by the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
given that these questions are indeed very sensitive, thorny to 
use the minister's word, does he intend to look into the 
allegations made by the Quebec chambers of commerce and ask 
the competition bureau to conduct an investigation into the 
allegations of collusion, for we are talking about allegations of 
collusion, an extremely serious charge, between the major 
airline carriers and their subsidiaries in order to eliminate 
regional competition?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I repeat my concern for the rights of companies and the 
shareholders of those companies to have an opportunity to deal 
with the issues raised by the hon. member.
<P>
	There is a competition bureau as well as the National 
Transportation Agency. I would think that members of the 
opposition would understand why a minister of the crown would 
be very hesitant to consider directing those agencies. They are 
quasi-judicial agencies of which we have heard a great deal 
from the opposition over the past few weeks.
<P>
	If there is a legitimate grievance that reflects the concerns 
raised by the hon. member, the chambers of commerce or 
interested citizens should direct their complaints and the 
allegations that have been referred to by the hon. member 
directly to the competition bureau and/or the National 
Transportation Agency. They can be dealt with by those 
quasi-judicial agencies

	<B>Mr. Jim Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the President of the Treasury Board. It has 
to do with highway 416 in eastern Ontario.
<P>
	The current Ontario government's lack of commitment to 
eastern Ontario was never better illustrated than the recent 
suggestion of a user pay highway from the 401 into the nation's 
capital. The federal government's commitment to this project on 
a shared cost basis is well known and I applaud the minister for 
condemning outright the idea of a toll road.
<P>
	With no interest in financing the toll road, what alternative for 
getting the project moving is the minister exploring at this time?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the need for this highway and I also know 
of the vigorous effort put forward by the member for 
Leeds-Grenville in this endeavour.
<P>
	I therefore suggested to the provincial government in the 
springtime that we fund it under the Canada-Ontario 
infrastructure works program. It did not respond to that and did 
not put in an application. In fact the provincial government 
indicated a reluctance.
<P>
	In the summertime I suggested a strategic transportation 
improvement program as another way it might be able to rework 
some priorities to help fund this. That is a shared program as 
well. The only response came back just a few weeks ago in terms 
of the proposition of tolls. If the province of Ontario is going to 
do this by tolls we are not interested in getting into the funding. I 
also wonder whether it even meets the province's criteria for 
what would qualify as a toll road.
<P>
	I would be quite happy and in fact would like to meet with the 
new minister of transport in Ontario to further explore the 
infrastructure works program and the strategic transportation 
improvement program for funding of this necessary project.

	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food.
<P>
	Recent polls and rallies have shown that farmers want an 
elected board of directors to run the Canadian Wheat  Board. 
What action is the minister prepared to take to give farmers their 
wish to have an elected board instead of an appointed one?
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure that very interesting 
proposition is one of the ideas that will be discussed during the 
winter in the forum we are conducting with respect to marketing 
systems in western Canada, particularly the operations of the 
Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	Other marketing agencies around the world could be 
examined as models for their precedential value in corporate 
governance, matters relating to marketing systems.
<P>
	It is an idea that a number of farmers have suggested. In some 
studies conducted previously four or five years ago the idea was 
advanced as an alternative in terms of corporate governance. It 
is an idea I am sure farmers will want to explore very thoroughly 
and I am determined to provide them with the opportunity to do 
that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a supplementary question for the minister. Farmers 
know what they want and it is time to listen to their demands.
<P>
	Why will the minister never listen to farmers' wishes or input 
but continually gives his ear to special interest groups no matter 
what farmers' concerns are?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I probably spend the majority 
of my time as minister of agriculture listening very carefully to 
farmers.
<P>
	From time to time they are represented by their official 
organizations. On other occasions and very valuably, individual 
farmers take the opportunity to raise concerns with me either in 
person, by mail or in public meetings of various kinds.
<P>
	The input from farmers is the most valuable advice that a 
minister of agriculture can receive. It is important to note the 
distinction between the valid and legitimate advice and opinion 
that is offered by farmers and the sometimes rather twisted point 
of view one hears from the Reform Party.

	On October 28, the Official Opposition called the minister's

maintenance control system for aircraft owned by Royal

<P>

does the minister not agree that this carrier's maintenance 
control program is totally inadequate? And can he tell us what 
steps were taken to remedy the situation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, when the issue was raised, as the hon. member pointed 
out, we looked into the matter. There were indeed deficiencies in 
the control system. There were problems and these were 
corrected.
<P>
	I want to reassure my hon. colleague that not only was the 
situation looked into, but that appropriate corrective action was 
taken and the company now operates within the regulations 
issued by Transport Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, can the minister tell this House whether the control 
measures contemplated include surprise inspections by his 
department. Should carriers that pose a risk not be placed under 
the direct supervision of Transport Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, this whole issue of safety is a very important one. It is 
the primary responsibility of the Department of Transport. I can 
assure my hon. colleague that we will continue to exercise all 
due diligence to ensure that all air carriers abide by the existing 
regulations.

western farmers less capable, less deserving?

<P>
	Why does the minister of agriculture absolutely refuse to 
permit western farmers to elect their wheat board directors?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I point out to the hon. member 
that it was a previous Liberal government that provided the first 
electoral process with respect to the Canadian Wheat Board, that 
is the election of the advisory committee.
<P>
	As far as future changes that might take place within the 
corporate government structure is concerned, it is a subject on 
which farmers will be having discussions this winter. I will be 
very interested to hear the varying points of view from farmers 
on that particular approach to corporate governance.
<P>
	One of the technical matters that the hon. member should bear 
in mind concerning the difference between the Canadian Wheat 
Board and the Ontario Wheat Producers Marketing Board is that 
under the Canadian Wheat Board system we have the provision 
under federal legislation for government financial guarantees 
concerning initial payments. That obviously is a substantial 
financial distinction between the operations of the two boards 
and indicates why in some circumstances the methods of 
corporate governance might well be different.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
really stupid. Too much time and too little action.
<P>
	The question is, democracy or dictatorship? That is the 
question. Do we have a democracy or are we going to continue 
with this dictatorship?
<P>
	Is the minister going to continue to deny farmers democracy 
and continue with this present dictatorship?

	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and

	It is important to make intelligent, thoughtful decisions after 
everyone, in a fully democratic manner, has had an opportunity 
to discuss the matter and state their points of view, rather than 
pre-empting all of the discussion and simply opting for a 
proposal put forward by a political party that has already made

for the Minister of Transport. The Quebec City bridge has been 
designated a historic monument by the American Society of 
Civil Engineers and is one of the finest engineering structures in 
Canada. This bridge, which was built between 1900 and 1919, 
now needs major repairs which, according to experts, would cost 
$45 million over a six-year period.

between the two shores of the St. Lawrence at Quebec City and 
its historic and tourist potential for that region, does the minister 
not think that this bridge should undergo major repairs and that 
the work should start as soon as possible?
<P>

with a rail privatization contract, a government construction

justifies denying any Canadian the right of due process?
<P>

approach the Reform Party takes to taxing Canadian taxpayers

they are dealing with some of the questions they bring up here

<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and

the question is overlooking the impact of the soon to be

particularly the new World Trade Organization which brings to 
bear some important disciplines in the world on the use of export 
subsidies.
<P>
	We will insist that other countries around the world adhere to 
their obligations under the new GATT. That will mean for

time in a long time have to bring down some of its export 
subsidies such as the export enhancement program.
<P>
	While we expect every other country in the world to abide by 
their obligations, Canada must abide by those same obligations. 
Within the terms of the new GATT agreement a portion of the 
Western Grain Transportation Act is defined as an export 
subsidy. In those circumstances we can do one of two things. We 
can either change the Western Grain Transportation Act so it no

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What effect did the late signing of the Aboriginal Fishing Agreements in 
British Columbia have on the Department of Fisheries and Oceans enforcement 
of the Agreements and fisheries regulations in 1994?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B> While negotiations on agreements with aboriginal groups 
for management of aboriginal salmon fishing were in many 
cases protracted, leading to delays in signing of agreements, 
these delays had little impact on the enforcement of agreements 
and fisheries regulations. Procedures and protocols for 
managing aboriginal fisheries had been developed under the 
aboriginal

<HR>
<B><A NAME="7994"> 7994 </A></B>
<P>
fisheries strategy in previous years. These procedures were not 
in dispute, allowing both the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans and the aboriginal groups to proceed with planning for 
management and enforcement while negotiations on allocation 
numbers were ongoing.
<P>
	All aboriginal salmon fisheries were licensed under the 
communal licence regulations with the licences reflecting 
established management procedures. In many cases aboriginal 
groups were able to prepare for and participate in management 
of the fishery through bridge funding arrangements even while 
negotiations were ongoing. In some cases, uncertainty as to final 
levels of funding to be established through negotiations did 
curtail aboriginal participation in the management of the 
fishery.
<P>
	The department is currently reviewing all enforcement 
concerns recently raised. The purpose is to identify program 
weaknesses and develop solutions to prevent reoccurrence. As 
well, the minister has set up an independent review board to 
examine all factors related to the management of Fraser River 
sockeye stocks. The board is to provide its final report to the 
minister by January 31, 1995 including recommendations for 
corrective action.
<P>
Question No. 89-<B>Mr. Fillion:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Is the Department of Fisheries and Oceans planning to rebuild the wharf in 
L'Anse Saint-Jean in the riding of Chicoutimi, to re-evaluate this project in 
fiscal year 1995-96 and to begin negotiations with the municipality of L'Anse 
Saint-Jean?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B> The Government of Canada has been aware of the 
municipality's interest in rebuilding the wharf at L'Anse 
St-Jean since the fire of August 22, 1992. Since that time, the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) has been discussing 
the situation with the municipality.
<P>
	In 1993/94 and 1994/95, DFO approved expenditures 
totalling $300K for the pre-engineering studies, and for the 
plans and specifications for the reconstruction of the wharf. This 
was done to facilitate the wharf's reconstruction, should funds 
become available. At that time the government could not make a 
commitment to proceed with the work.
<P>
	Public Works and Government Services Canada's recent 
technical assessment and planning documents indicate that the 
demolition of the outer end of the wharf and its reconstruction 
and the renovations to the remaining portion of the wharf will 
cost an estimated $2 million.
<P>
	In light of the current climate of fiscal restraint, competing 
demands for funds to carry out repair and reconstruction 
projects at federally owned harbours across Canada cannot all 
be accommodated within the limited budget for the small craft 
harbours program. Under the current program review, 
government is seriously questioning whether we can continue to 
spend diminishing funds or operate improved or reconstructed 
recreational harbours at the expense of doing essential repairs at 
commercial fishing harbours. DFO has assigned a higher 
priority to repair projects at commercial fishing harbours than to 
recreational harbours and this leaves no funds for large 
recreational projects. As a consequence, DFO is unable to make 
a  commitment to rebuilding the wharf at L'Anse St-Jean at this 
time, and it is unlikely that this situation will change in 1995/96.
<P>
	DFO is prepared to co-operate should other interests provide 
the funds necessary to reconstruct the wharf.
<P>
Question No. 90-<B>Mr. Fillion:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Will the post offices in the riding of Chicoutimi be reorganized and if so, 
how and what effect will this have on employment and the quality of customer 
service?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> Starting on February 13, 1995, 
Canada Post will improve collection and delivery in the riding 
of Chicoutimi by introducing motorized mail courier service to 
the area. Also, letter carrier operations currently located at the 
Chicoutimi Racine and Chicoutimi Nord facilities as well as 
mail processing operations currently located at the Chicoutimi 
CTC will be consolidated into a new facility at 1939 Des Sapins 
Street in Chicoutimi. Retail customers will not be 
inconvenienced, as CPC products and services will continue to 
be availabe in the Chicoutimi Nord and Chicoutimi Racine 
establishments.
<P>
	Though CPC employees will be transferred to the new 
facility, there will be no job loss associated with this 
rationalization.
<P>
	The project will result in better postal service for the region, 
as Canada Post introduces a modern collection and delivery 
system well adapted to the future needs of its customers.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to speak in the House today on social security reform. I 
will direct my comments specifically to the unemployment 
insurance aspect of it and how the proposed changes will affect 
women and families.
<P>
	This debate takes place at a critical time in the history of 
Canada's social programs. The Minister of Human Resources 
Development launched the social security reform debate in the 
House last January. At that time he challenged Canadians to 
define what effective social programs would look like in a world 
shaped by the economic and social trends we see around us 
today.
<P>
	During the following months the Minister of Human 
Resources Development and the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development have both heard the same things from a 
large number of Canadians. Quite simply our social programs 
are losing the confidence of the people who pay taxes. They see 
the inconsistencies and the gaps.
<P>
	Like every member of the House I have received numerous 
letters and phone calls on the topic. The polls say it. Our mail 
says it. Canadians are not satisfied with the status quo. They 
know that a more effective and a more cost effective social 
safety net is not just possible; it is necessary. That is why the 
government released the discussion paper on social security 
reform on October 5.
<P>
	We want a debate for all Canadians. One element of the debate 
is fairness. Canadians clearly reject the idea that we should have 
a slash and burn approach to social programs. They just want 
them to work better. They want the money and services to meet 
the greatest needs with the greatest impact.
<P>
	Certainly unemployment insurance was not meant to create 
the cycle of dependency that has developed in too many 
communities for too many workers. A large and growing share 
of people who get UI are frequent claimants. Thirty-eight per 
cent have made three claims in five years. With the best of 
intentions we have allowed the system to develop into one that 
encourages low skilled, seasonal and temporary work in high 
unemployment regions. It does little to encourage people to 
improve their skills and their options.
<P>
	A place where that is certainly the case is in the 
unemployment insurance area. To hear some of the comments in 
the House on the topic one could conclude that UI is about to be 
destroyed in some fiendish plot driven by the titans of high 
finance. One could conclude that the government is bound and 
determined to roll back the gains that women have made in the 
labour force over the past generation. One could conclude that 
we are determined to make poor families suffer. Nothing could 
be further from the truth.
<P>
	I want to concentrate my remarks today on how the green 
paper proposals on UI relate to the needs and the realities of 
women and families in Canada. UI has been serving Canadian 
workers for over 50 years. For most employees it works as it was 
intended to. It is insurance to tide them over the time between 
jobs.
<P>
	The labour market has changed greatly since 1942 when the 
first claim was filed. Now people do not just lose one job and 
move on to another. Structural change in our economy means 
that people may not just move between jobs; they may move 
between industries or communities. UI was not designed to deal 
with that type of situation.
<P>
	In contrast, as hon. members will recall, is the second option 
of a system of employment insurance. Within it there could be 
basic insurance that would work in the way UI does now. People 
who make a UI claim only infrequently would see no real 
change. People who need the help with the special benefits such 
as maternity, parental, adoption, or sickness benefits would still 
be able to get that help.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	At a time when we are asking how we can invest funds to make 
people employable across all social programs we have to ask the 
same questions about UI. The discussion paper lays out two 
different approaches we could take to address the fact that some 
people need far more help than UI can give them through income 
support alone.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7996"> 7996 </A></B>
<P>
	The first is simply tightening the status quo. Higher eligibility 
rules, shorter duration of benefits and lower weekly benefits are 
all options. The only problem is that it does little to address the 
needs for more active labour force programs. It nibbles at the 
edges of the program without really challenging the big 
questions surrounding UI.
<P>
	People who make relatively frequent use of UI would move 
into the adjustment insurance category. For these people there 
would be a greater emphasis on help to find the skills to get and 
keep better longer term work. The government recognizes that 
some industries are seasonal and that some communities have 
little work in parts of the year. That is why we are open to ways 
to make this approach work well.
<P>
	Some critics have raised the idea that people who might be 
eligible for adjustment insurance could have their benefits set 
on the basis of family income. This has been opposed by some 
people as a giant step back for women. Before any more interest 
groups howl about this let us again look at the facts.
<P>
	First, very few women would be affected by this proposal if it 
actually came to pass. Women account for only about one-third 
of all frequent claimants. The program is good for about seven 
out of ten women. Adjustment insurance would not matter. Their 
needs would be met by the basic insurance program.
<P>
	Second, women would still have good access to the special 
benefits under the system. A study states that women account 
for 59 per cent of all sickness claims. We know they account for 
the maternity claims. We can guess that they probably account 
for the majority of claims raised for adoptions and parental 
benefits. There would be no change for the vast majority of 
women who call on UI for help. It will still be there to help them.
<P>
	Where the debate exists is over a proposal that would base 
adjustment insurance benefits in part on family earnings. Third, 
low income people would get the full benefit. A sliding scale 
would lower the benefits for people with higher incomes. 
Immediately some protested this might undermine the 
self-esteem of a woman or it might undermine her financial 
independence. I disagree with that statement.
<P>
	In 1991, 18 per cent of frequent claimants had annual incomes 
of over $50,000. A further 28 per cent had family incomes of 
between $30,000 and $50,000. Frankly the image one gets is that 
UI for these people is a regular top-up to family income and not 
a protection against hardship. Canadians have the right to ask if 
this is the best way to spend their dollars. I suspect that 
Canadians will agree that it is not. They will agree that these 
people claim the money because of a feeling of entitlement, not 
need. UI is not a publicly subsidized savings account.
<P>
	The prospect is that by focusing attention on people most in 
need whose work patterns are the most marginal we can help 
them break out of a cycle of dependence. The premiers of the 
Atlantic provinces agree. Economic analyses agree. Canadians 
agree. The old pattern of 10:42 simply does not work. The 
answer is not to cut people off and say sink or swim. The answer 
is to get programs and services in place to help.
<P>
	Women will benefit from this approach. The idea is to put 
more emphasis on employment development services of all 
kinds: counselling, job search skills and work experience 
training. The idea is to move money from less important places 
to more important places.
<P>
	Among the proposals in the green paper was one that raised 
the question of improving UI coverage for part time and 
seasonal workers. Most of the people who would benefit from it 
are women. Twenty-eight per cent of women workers are in part 
time jobs whereas only ten per cent of men are. The ideas we 
have suggested could directly address the needs of those women 
better than the status quo.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	Many women need the kinds of programs social security 
reform will make available. Let us take the example of single 
mothers. Almost 60 per cent of lone parent families with 
children under 18 live on low incomes and 95.9 per cent of 
single parent mother led families live below the poverty line. 
They often lack support services such as child care that would 
help them get back to work. Those on social assistance often 
find that the value of support services like dental care are much 
greater than what they can earn with the limited skills they may 
have.
<P>
	The government has embarked on a series of experiments with 
the provinces to explore better ways of helping these mothers 
get back into the workforce. We now have a pilot project in 
Manitoba that will provide 4,000 lone parents on welfare with 
employment skills and support. The program is called ``Taking 
Charge''. It is specifically to help those people do just that, to 
take charge of their lives.
<P>
	We will continue to solicit the ideas and views of Canadians. I 
am glad to see that the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development has attracted not only many 
submissions but substantial attention in the media. The issue is 
very important. It deserves a full debate. That is why the 
government has provided financial resources to 19 women's 
organizations to enable them to participate in the consultative 
process.
<P>
	Many times we in the House hear different people ask why we 
are providing financial resources to organizations so that they 
can attack the government. This is a case where we are providing 
financial resources to women's organizations not to attack the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7997"> 7997 </A></B>
<P>
government but to give us the ideas we need to provide help for 
women.
<P>
	Our current set of programs were designed at a time when 
most people needed relatively few skills to get and keep a job. 
What they picked up in school and on the job was usually enough 
to build a lifetime of earnings. People needed financial help 
between jobs. Others needed support if they could not work at all 
due to disability or family commitments. The old system was 
based on a stable world with stable skills and stable jobs for the 
vast majority of working people.
<P>
	I would like to refer to my own case. My husband and I raised 
five children who have all been in the workforce for a few years. 
They were all able to complete university and get jobs. They are 
now contributing citizens. Not one of them has ever collected a 
day's UI in their lives. That is not the way it is today. Times have 
changed. Students coming out of university are having a very 
difficult time and we have to address that problem.
<P>
	Our support for programs like New Brunswick Works in New 
Brunswick and Job Link in Ontario and the Northwest 
Territories is investing in people and is helping us find better 
ways to help the most disadvantaged, to help their children 
break the welfare cycle and to have self-esteem at work. Social 
security reform can help women and their families far better 
than any of the patchwork programs we now have in place.
<P>
	In the end the value to women of social security reform is 
much the same as it is for men. At the centre of any social 
security network lies a guiding principle. In a time of constant 
change that principle must be employability. Real security for 
Canadians comes from the ability to get and keep a job. Our 
programs must reflect the fact that this is more complex now 
than it was in the past. That is true for both men and women.
<P>
	We cannot stop changes; we can help people provide the skills 
and supports to meet the realities of change. From letters I have 
seen and the people to whom I have spoken, that is all most 
people are asking for. Social security reform addresses 
important questions that affect women and all Canadians. It 
points to a new approach to working, to learning and to security. 
Everyone can benefit from that.
<P>
	My speech today has been narrow in its focus because I have 
specifically dealt with women and UI and how the changes we 
are talking about in our social security reform will affect them. 
The whole package of social security reform is broad and will 
affect all Canadians. I felt this particular aspect was so 
important that I wanted to focus and narrow in on specifically UI 
and women's issues and I was pleased to do so.

<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member said earlier that her children never had to rely 
on UI benefits. This is great, but it is not the case for us. Our 
mothers and fathers have a lot of heart. Still, many children 
claim UI benefits not because they want to, but because they 
have to.
<P>
	The government will create two classes of unemployed. One 
for those who occasionally claim UI benefits, like once every 
five years, and the other for those who do so almost annually.
<P>
	Where I come from, around November, workers have to claim 
UI benefits again, because they are out of work. They are 
jobless.
<P>
	I worked for the agency and for other organizations to 
generate work. Back home, a great number of people do their 
utmost to create jobs, not only through programs but in the field. 
People in my region are extremely disappointed by the 
minister's reform. They know that they have no choice but to 
rely on UI benefits every year. Yet, the new reform provides for 
cuts in those benefits as well as for more work weeks, something 
which is impossible in the Gaspe Peninsula.
<P>
	We asked, among other things, that the Eastern Quebec 
Development Plan for forestry workers be extended. We made 
representations. This morning I made a statement pursuant to 
Standing Order 31. This is cumbersome. The government does 
not understand. It does not understand that, in the Gaspe 
Peninsula, the Lower St. Lawrence region and the riding of 
Matapédia-Matane, the issues are not necessarily the same as 
in Toronto or Calgary.
<P>
	The hon. member told us that her children never had to rely on 
UI benefits. I congratulate her and her children, but I also tell 
her that the situation is not the same for everyone. I hope she 
will realize that.
<P>
	I want to make another point. If tuition fees go up, a very large 
number of students from the Gaspe, Matapédia-Matane and 
Lower St. Lawrence regions will not be able to attend university. 
In my region, the university is located in Rimouski and not every 
subject is taught there. Consequently, some students have to go 
to Laval university, in Quebec City, or to Montreal, thus 
incurring extra costs. If they go home once a month, they have to 
pay for their transportation costs and also spend extra money on 
food and lodging. If, on top of that, tuition fees are increased, as 
many as half the student population in my region may not be 
able to go on. Even today, the total number of those who can 
afford to attend university is lower than elsewhere. Therefore, 
my region is adversely affected by this measure.
<P>
	If the hon. member cares about those who live in rural and 
remote areas and who will not be able to go to university because 
of that reform, what would she tell the unemployed in my region 
who want to work but cannot find jobs? I would appreciate an 
answer on these two issues.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Nepean will have 
as much time as her colleague had to give her answer.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gaffney:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Matapédia-Matane for his question.
<P>
	I hope in mentioning my children that I did not create a wrong 
impression with the member for Matapédia-Matane because 
that was not the intent of my mentioning them.
<P>
	I was making a comparison of young people coming out of 
university, high school or college a few years ago and obtaining 
a job and today. If they had a certificate or diploma from a 
university it was almost a guarantee that they could get a job. It 
was much easier. That is gone. It is no longer in effect. Young 
people graduating today who might have a masters or PhD still 
have to spend two years looking for a job. The situation has 
changed.
<P>
	My children were raised in a very fortunate time in the history 
of Canada, They were able to access a job immediately. They 
were fortunate they did not have to go into the UI system and 
that money was able to stay there for those who needed it. It was 
not necessary for them to participate in a government program 
that was there to benefit those who could not find work.
<P>
	I have a great deal of sympathy for the people who live in an 
environment or in a territory of Canada, such as the member 
lives, where their work is seasonal and it is very difficult for 
them to find work for 12 months of the year.
<P>
	These are the types of reforms we are talking about in the 
human resources development program. They are specifically to 
deal with the people who live in the member's region, and in the 
Atlantic region or in the northern part of Canada where work is 
seasonal.
<P>
	This is part of the consultation process. They will be 
consulting with the people in Quebec and asking how this 
program suits its needs. That is a major portion of the 
consultation program and is what is so important. We are not just 
saying that what is suitable for my riding of Nepean, Ontario is 
suitable for the member's riding in the province of Quebec. 
Every riding is different and that is what is very unique about 
Canada. We are very unique not only in each province but as we 
move from region to region. This is what the program of reforms 
is trying to address, again through the consultation process.
<P>
	Some students will not be able to afford to go to university if 
the tuition rates are raised. As Mr. Axworthy said on the steps of 
Parliament Hill the other day, he is not putting less money into 
education, he is putting more money into education. He is trying 
to ensure that students who do not have a university in their 
town-as my children did, as students in the member's area who 
have to travel to Rimouski to go to university-that funds are in 
place so they can go. The students of wealthy  families should 
have a responsibility to support those in less wealthy families 
who are from less wealthy regions.
<P>
	I firmly believe we are headed in the right direction. 
Obviously the consultation process is going to prove us wrong if 
we are wrong or prove us right if we are right. We are there and 
we are very much prepared to listen.
<P>
	I thank you very much, deputy, for your two very good 
questions.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would ask hon. members 
to please not refer to each other by name. Members of the House 
are to be referred to either by the member for <I>x</I> or the minister 
for <I>y</I>.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I very much enjoyed the comments of the member for 
Nepean. She got into a narrow realm, as she explained, of 
unemployment and women.
<P>
	I enjoyed as much the question from the member for 
Matapédia-Matane because he expresses, as a representative 
of a totally different part of the country, the particular concerns 
of that area. That is the value of the House of Commons. We 
must listen to one another. I hope the process will go forward 
with the review committee as they tour Canada and pick up all of 
these comments, all of which are valid. If we are to tackle the 
enormous problem of the debt and the deficit year by year, we 
badly need a review of the social spending that we are 
undertaking.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	A leaked government memo indicates a need to reduce social 
spending by $7.5 billion. This demonstrates that even the 
Liberals realize the necessity of cutting in this area.
<P>
	A quick look at where the government spends its money will 
show why we need to cut in the area of social spending. But 
unlike the member for Nepean who took a narrow view I, as the 
first Reform Party speaker on this subject today, would like to 
take an overview of the whole situation to set the scene.
<P>
	We have a debt of roughly $540 billion at the federal level. 
Our deficit spending at this time is running at about $40 billion 
per year. This means we are getting ever deeper and deeper into 
debt. At the same time government spending annually is roughly 
$160 billion. One-quarter of that annual spending, roughly $40 
billion, $39.4 billion goes to interest payments. This amount 
cannot be altered or reduced until we balance the budget. Think 
of it again, and I address this to the public in Canada, $40 billion 
a year alone in interest payments on our debt.
<P>
	Another quarter of our annual spending, just over $40 billion, 
goes for government services. This includes the armed forces, 
foreign affairs, the RCM police, subsidies to business, 
multiculturalism, bilingualism, Parliament, the civil service 
among others. These areas must be drastically cut before we 
touch social programs. However, even if we cut this roughly 25 
per cent of our spending  to the bone, we can only save $8 billion 
to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7999"> 7999 </A></B>
<P>
$10 billion a year. The mathematics is there. It is just not enough 
to balance the budget.
<P>
	The remainder of government spending, $79 billion, consists 
of transfers to the provinces and social programs. This spending 
has to be reduced by $12 billion to $17 billion if we hope to 
balance the budget in a number of years. That is an awfully big 
reduction.
<P>
	Let us now look to see what the government is going to do to 
help address the whole problem. The finance minister brought 
down a lacklustre budget earlier this year. Not only were there 
few cuts but spending actually increased. Each day, as we are all 
aware, the government is spending $110 million more than it is 
taking in from revenues. We cannot go on doing that.
<P>
	Despite these facts, however, the finance minister defended 
this weak fiscal plan and stated the government will have no 
problem in meeting its debt reduction target of 3 per cent of the 
gross domestic product as promised in the red ink book. The 
finance minister now admits his projections may be off and 
earlier this month informed the finance committee that cuts 
totalling more than $9 billion would have to be made over the 
next two years.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	It is encouraging to see that the finance minister is finally 
beginning to realize the gravity of the situation. I suspect he is 
being pummelled by this country's financial institutions saying: 
``Minister, look at the reality''. We have yet to see the finance 
minister's actions come close to matching his words.
<P>
	Similarly, we must look at what action the minister of human 
resources has taken to tackle his share of the problem. His is a 
big share of the problem, no question.
<P>
	For more than a year now we have waited for his social policy 
review paper. Instead of the action promised in the red ink book, 
all we have had until last month has been foot dragging. Given 
his reluctance to release the paper before the Quebec provincial 
election on September 12 it is surprising the minister even 
released the paper in advance of the promised Quebec 
referendum, but he did. This type of blatant politicking only 
serves to exacerbate the problem because it delays the move 
toward a badly needed solution.
<P>
	Be that as it may we finally have the review paper. Looking at 
it however, what do we really have? So far that paper is nothing 
more than an eclectic grab-bag of reworked Liberal programs 
from the 1960s and 1970s along with a continuation of some 
Tory proposals.
<P>
	The minister also denies that this process has anything to do 
with budget cuts. Well it surely has and it must. I do not think 
Canadians are fooled by this attempt to sugarcoat the truth. In 
fact, some Canadians might find the minister's sales pitch 
somewhat insulting.
<P>
	We all know what the problem is. The real question is: How do 
we solve it? We solve it collectively in an open and honest way 
while ensuring that those really in need do not suffer. We must 
protect the people who need our help.
<P>
	We have to eliminate the deficit by carefully reviewing all of 
the government spending including sacred cows like official 
languages and multiculturalism. Every time we mention that in 
this House we get bombarded that they cannot be touched. Well 
the time has come when we have to touch them and examine 
them in detail. We must ask ourselves if we are getting value for 
every dollar we spend and whether we can live without the 
program.
<P>
	The process has to be done objectively and fairly treating all 
provinces alike and all individuals with compassion. Once we 
eliminate deficit spending we can begin to chip away at the debt. 
Only through this method can we ensure the continued viability 
of Canada's valued social programs. In the meantime it is 
obvious some cuts are needed in social spending but the big 
question of the day is where to cut.
<P>
	We have heard a dissertation on unemployment insurance. 
Last year the program cost Canadians $20 billion. The 
minister's review paper talks about making this a two tier 
system, or simply making it harder to be eligible for benefits. I 
suggest that both of these proposals are nothing more than a 
continuation of Tory policies.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	The unemployment insurance system must be returned to a 
true insurance plan. It must eliminate regional differences in 
qualifying periods, benefits and non-insurance components. 
This area alone could save roughly $5 billion.
<P>
	The Canada assistance plan helps the provinces fund welfare 
programs at an annual cost of $8 billion. The government 
suggests this program be made more flexible to allow provinces 
to experiment. This may help the provinces. It may help to 
prevent some of the abuses of the welfare system but we are still 
going to be spending the same amount.
<P>
	It may be better to cut much of this spending in favour of a 
new child tax credit which could be targeted at low income 
households. As I said earlier this whole process has to target 
those who absolutely need the help. We cannot afford to 
continue with the past approach of universality. In any event the 
new child tax credit would not only ensure the money gets to 
those who need it most, but it could also produce savings in the 
area of three to five billion dollars.
<P>
	In the area of education the government is proposing a system 
in which RRSPs could be used to pay for tuition. Many years ago 
there was a registered education savings plan. This was 
eliminated when it was found to be ineffective. Therefore why 
does the government continue to believe that a failed program 
from the past can work today?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8000"> 8000 </A></B>
<P>
	Instead of giving money directly to students and not through 
increased loans as the review paper suggests, how about doing it 
through a voucher system? That has been discussed in this 
House. It has merit and really should be looked at.
<P>
	It would ensure that money is spent on education rather than 
just going into provincial general revenue funds. It would make 
post-secondary institutions more accountable and receptive to 
the changing needs of students and the job market. The savings 
would not be great but a more efficient use of current resources 
would be ensured. Education is an area we have to protect to the 
maximum degree possible.
<P>
	The review paper does not talk about reforming health care. 
Health care costs Canadians over $70 billion each year of which 
the federal government pays about $15 billion one way or 
another. The health system is increasingly overburdened.
<P>
	Reform stated during the 1993 election campaign that it 
would maintain transfer payments for health care at current 
levels. The medicare system in Canada is something I think 
every Canadian says we must have. It is of highest priority for 
protection. What do we have to do then? We have to experiment 
with ways to get more bang for our buck out of the health 
system.
<P>
	This would mean allowing provinces more freedom to design 
their own health initiatives based on their own needs. The 
provinces are close to it. They are the ones who have to deliver 
the services. Let them make more decisions. While it is 
important in the health system for national standards to apply, 
those standards should not be so rigid as to disallow provincial 
experimentation, such as private clinics.
<P>
	The Liberals decry this type of thinking claiming it will create 
a two tiered system, which is already a fact in Canada. Why do 
the Liberals think that is so terrible in the area of health yet they 
proclaim it as a possible saviour for unemployment insurance? 
This is an example of the type of double talk the government is 
becoming famous for.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	I have only begun to touch on the many programs in Canada's 
social safety net and we have already identified about $9 billion 
in potential annual savings. I have also attempted to ensure that 
those who are truly in need of help are not adversely affected.
<P>
	It is possible to save money in this area by carefully targeting 
where the money goes and rethinking the way we deliver these 
services. I hope the government has listened and continues to 
listen when my Reform colleagues add their valuable input over 
the remaining hours of this debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak in the House 
today.
<P>
	Six weeks ago the Minister of Human Resources 
Development released a discussion paper on social security in 
Canada in order to engender a lively debate across this country 
about what kind of social security system we want in the future. 
A debate should be based on facts not rumours and scare stories 
so let us make sure we all understand those facts.
<P>
	We have created an excellent and highly accessible 
post-secondary education system in Canada but it is 
increasingly under pressure. Resources for everything are tight 
and there is a growing need for more access to the system. Our 
challenge is to ensure that we maintain and improve the system 
and broaden access.
<P>
	First, why broaden access? Because there are three million 
people already in the workforce who want to improve and 
upgrade their skills in order to keep jobs. More and more people 
should be getting a post-secondary education. Of the new jobs 
created during the last three years 17 per cent went to people 
with university education. There were 19 per cent fewer jobs for 
those with less than high school.
<P>
	Governments do not have any more money to pay for 
education. In fact most governments have less money to spend. 
The federal government is not proposing that we cut $2.6 billion 
out of the system as some people would suggest. Our proposal 
will put more in the system as I will explain.
<P>
	Let us look at how education is paid for. Students pay about 
one-fifth of the costs of their college or university education 
through tuition fees. More than half of the students graduate 
without borrowing money or by borrowing very small amounts. 
Taxpayers pay about four-fifths or 80 per cent of the cost of 
post-secondary education, whether or not they personally 
benefit. That is a lot more than in most countries where students 
pay a larger share of tuition costs in recognition of the fact that 
they earn higher salaries and wages during their working 
lifetime.
<P>
	Provincial governments are responsible for education, but the 
federal government pays half the costs for colleges and 
universities, about $8 billion a year. This currently includes $3.5 
billion in tax points that allow the provinces to collect taxes for 
colleges and universities and $2.6 billion in transfers to 
provinces in cash. There is an additional $2 billion, mostly in 
support to university research and the cost of student loans 
through the Canada student loans program.
<P>
	The $3.5 billion in tax points will always be there and it will 
keep growing. The tax points contribution will grow by an 
estimated $2 billion over the next decade, replacing the cash 
portion that will run out over the next 10 years.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8001"> 8001 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	Under the present system the cash will run out in about 10 
years. Without extra government money it is likely that tuition 
fees will keep rising. That is why the government is considering 
an alternative, taking some of that cash before it disappears and 
using it to set up a permanent expanded student aid program. 
This would provide as much as $2 billion extra in student loans 
each year.
<P>
	Under such a scheme the total amount of federal contributions 
to post-secondary education would increase by more than $10 
billion over the next 10 years. Instead of leaving the system as it 
is now, which would put the federal government contribution at 
a total of about $60 billion over 10 years, it would be about $70 
billion.
<P>
	A new kind of student loans program would make it easier to 
finance education, not just for traditional students but for older 
Canadians who want to go back to school but do not qualify for 
student loans now. More people would be able to go to college or 
university. College and university fees could rise but it seems 
like a reasonable investment given the fact that university 
graduates' lifetime earnings will be 40 per cent higher than if 
they had not made that investment. That is about one-quarter 
million dollars more.
<P>
	In addition if we were to make the replacement of student 
loans contingent on earnings after graduation, students would 
have a guarantee that their investment in learning will not 
burden them with impossible loan payments.
<P>
	These are the ideas we have put forward for discussion. 
Canadians will have an opportunity to respond. They can fill out 
the work book which we have available for all Canadians to have 
their say on the reform of social programs. The booklet is 
available in postal outlets, Canada Employment Centres, 
YM-YWCAs and many grocery stores or by calling the toll free 
1-800 number.
<P>
	Social security reform affects all Canadians. The government 
encourages open debate to find the best solutions to take us into 
the next century.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I am pleased to rise today and 
speak on the social reform issue, which I believe will be of great 
significance during the coming months for a number of reasons.
<P>
	I would like to take a moment to demonstrate that the Liberal 
government is facing an unsurmountable problem, trying 
desperately as it has been for the past year to defend the 
Constitution. I am referring of course to the federal system as we 
know it, this system that the Prime Minister described as 
profitable federalism over a decade ago.
<P>
	In fact, this profitable federalism that we keep hearing about 
without ever seeing any results, this much-vaunted profitable 
federalism has no room left to move because it is throwing 
everything in reverse as we will see later. And there are only two 
ways out the deadlock for the federal system: to tax the 
middle-class to excess or cut social services.
<P>
	This is the context in which I think the social reform proposals 
before us must be seen. While the previous government, a 
Conservative government, became famous mainly for 
increasing the tax load of middle-income earners, the present 
Liberal government seems to want to make a name for itself with 
social service cuts affecting first and foremost the less affluent.
<P>
	All of this boils down to what was described as the vicious 
circle in which the Canadian economy is trapped. You start by 
overtaxing middle-income earners, thereby reducing their 
buying power which in turn forces them to change their 
consumer habits and definitely buy less. This results in fewer 
jobs and higher unemployment. The low-income population is 
growing at the expense of the middle-income one. The decline 
in employment causes the government's tax revenues to drop as 
well.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Similarly, since unemployment and social assistance costs are 
going up, the government must spend more. The deficit is 
growing every day, while the government's manoeuvring room 
is getting narrower.
<P>
	Faced with this situation, the well-off often transfer their 
assets to other countries before it melts away here. Again, this 
eliminates jobs, raises the unemployment rate, cuts government 
revenue and increases public spending, which in turn narrows 
the government's room to manoeuvre.
<P>
	To address the problem, the government has decided to reduce 
its services. In this regard, this government is not so different 
from the former Conservative government, since its proposed 
social reform reflects the philosophy behind the various UI 
reform initiatives put forward by the Tories when they were in 
power. To be convinced of this, one only has to look at the main 
elements of this reform. First of all, the government has created 
two classes of unemployed: the occasional UI claimants and the 
frequent claimants. We may well ask ourselves if the workers 
now benefiting from the infrastructure program put in place by 
the government last year will become frequent or occasional 
claimants when they lose their short-term jobs.
<P>
	Since it creates these two classes of unemployed people, the 
government also creates two classes of benefits: basic insurance 
and adjustment insurance, as it is called. Basic insurance is for 
occasional claimants. It is pretty much the same as the present 
system which the government finds inadequate. In the second 
case, adjustment insurance, the government perpetuates the 
vicious circle of the Canadian economy which I mentioned 
earlier.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8002"> 8002 </A></B>
<P>
	In fact, the reform of social programs which the government 
has presented to us provides no real policy to stimulate 
employment. So one may well ask what claimants of adjustment 
insurance can adjust to.
<P>
	To deal with this situation, the government intends to require 
frequent claimants to do community work or take training 
courses in order to qualify for benefits. We see how ridiculous 
the situation is, because these are bandaid solutions. Once these 
unemployed people have completed their community work to 
which the Department of Human Resources Development will 
assign them, they will all return to unemployment as even more 
frequently unemployed, since in the mean time the government 
will have provided nothing to stimulate employment.
<P>
	So we go from one vicious circle to another, making the 
unemployed pay for this government's lack of initiative when it 
comes to job creation. However, this little game is just fine in 
the context of the vicious circle prevailing in Canada. First, the 
government no longer has any margin. Consequently, it forces 
the unemployed to participate in new employment expansion 
and development programs. So as to lower their production 
costs, companies use these programs to hire workers whose 
salaries are lower, and therefore competitive with those already 
being paid.
<P>
	Consequently, in the medium term, well-paying jobs become 
more and more rare, thus reducing even more the purchasing 
power of the middle class. Since employment income tends to 
diminish, it results in lower tax revenue for the government, 
which then has even less of a margin. The result is that the 
government must make new cuts in services to meet its budget 
goals. And the vicious circle starts all over again for the 
Canadian economy.
<P>
	The introduction of this social program reform by the Liberals 
only confirms what the majority of Quebec voters figured out 
last year: To vote for the Liberals or the Conservatives was just 
the same. The Conservatives overtaxed the middle class, while 
the Liberals will cut aid to the poor. At least one Liberal MP, the 
hon. member for York South-Weston, recognized this when he 
said that, during the ten years that the Liberals formed the 
Official Opposition, they accused the Conservatives of reducing 
the deficit on the back of the poor, but that they were now doing 
the same thing.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	It is useless to vote for a party that supports a constitutional 
framework that is dragging us down into bankruptcy. The 
problem is that all this is being done at the expense of the 
vulnerable in our society. The rich are never affected by these 
reforms. To illustrate my point, I may refer to a letter sent 
recently by a Liberal member, the hon. member for 
Gander-Grand Falls, to the Minister of Finance. In this letter, 
which was published in the media either yesterday or today, the 
hon. member said, and this was to the Minister of Finance, that 
he was  particularly upset about the shocking and immoral 
deductions allowed as entertainment expenses, for instance, the 
purchase of $200 bottles of wine, cruises, escort services, and so 
forth. What is the hon. member for Gander-Grand Falls 
actually saying?
<P>
	Every year, one of my neighbours in my riding, Mr. Tremblay, 
has one or two corn roasts for his friends. He buys corn, of 
course, some wine and some cake, and he entertains his guests. 
Of course, Mr. Tremblay does this at his own expense. 
Meanwhile, large corporations entertain their guests, serving 
cocktails, petits fours and champagne, and that is tax deductible. 
Who is paying? Mr. Tremblay, through his taxes. So Mr. 
Tremblay is paying for everyone. That is why corn is expensive, 
and that is why it is so expensive to be poor.
<P>
	In his letter, the hon. member for Gander-Grand Falls 
estimated that amounts spent on wine, petits fours and 
champagne were costing the government $200 million.
<P>
	The hon. member, who did some research at Revenue Canada, 
also pointed out that forward averaging of taxes by companies 
now amounted to nearly $40 billion. Forward averaging refers to 
amounts that are payable but may be spread over subsequent 
returns. Nearly 1,200 companies recorded profits of at least $1 
million without paying a cent of income tax, according to the 
hon. member. In concluding, he said more or less the following: 
As the minister can see, the $9 billion he is looking for could be 
found by collecting the taxes that should have been paid by 
companies on their profits.
<P>
	I agree with the hon. member of the Reform Party. I think that 
before cutting social services, we should first get the money that 
is out there so that we have some degree of social justice. Where 
are we heading, politically speaking? I am sorry to put it this 
way, but I really think we are starting to look like a banana 
republic. A banana republic is not a republic where people pick 
bananas. It is a republic where the people who pick the bananas 
do not grow them. This means a republic with only two classes: 
the poor and the rich. The rich always get richer and the poor get 
poorer. If this proposal is passed, as it will be within the next few 
months, we will witness the undeniable signs of 
``bananization''. Obviously, we cannot support this reform 
package.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to my colleague's remarks with great 
attention, particularly his comments about social services 
reform in the context of federalism.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8003"> 8003 </A></B>
<P>
	We are all agreed, in the House and in the country at large, that 
the previous government, because it concentrated so much on 
constitutional issues, left our house in a state of great disorder 
not only in the accumulation of debt but also in failing to address 
these very crucial problems of social security reform.
<P>
	I would like to suggest to the member opposite that we now 
have exactly the same situation. We have another leader in 
Canada pushing a constitutional agenda which will take us away 
from the focus on necessary reforms involving social services 
and reducing the debt. I suggest to the member that person is Mr. 
Jacques Parizeau. I wonder how he can explain that Mr. Parizeau 
is not directing us away from where we should really be looking, 
that is looking after Canadians, finding jobs and increasing the 
benefits in the economy.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that we will indeed have 
to pay increasing attention to the Constitution in the months to 
come. Sadly, this problem could have been resolved a while 
back, if only the Charlottetown agreements had been passed. We 
know what happened to these agreements that put at end to the 
negotiations between Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	Quebec said no to the agreements, and so did Canada. This 
means that very soon the people of Quebec will have to choose 
between taking Canada such as it is and building a new country 
in Quebec. We have been expressing this need of ours for greater 
self-reliance to the rest of Canada for 125 years, and no effort 
was spared during these 125 years. But apparently, no one can 
find a solution to this problem.
<P>
	The only solution that seems fair to us consists in building a 
country in Quebec and letting Canada develop as it pleases, 
according to its own interests. Basically, Canadians would 
decide what they want to do and how they want to do it, while we 
would do the exact same thing in Quebec.
<P>
	As for employment development, let me tell my hon. 
colleague that it is not by making massive cuts on the backs of 
welfare recipients that you boost job creation. I think that, with 
or without Quebec, a comprehensive tax reform is 
required-and I firmly believe this-in Canada. Unfortunately, 
if this is not done, Canada, with or without Quebec, will face 
huge difficulties in the years to come, because the low and 
middle-income class will get poorer and poorer. The Prime 
Minister himself once said that $1 million knows no language 
barriers and moves quickly. Some people will move their assets 
out of Canada and we will go through very hard times.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think the terminology I heard was bananas, and that is 
absolutely right. Bananas, I repeat it.
<P>
	I read a little quote: ``A strong economy is the essence of a 
strong society. My government will focus on a jobs and growth 
agenda. We will work with all our partners, provincial 
governments, business, labour, voluntary groups and individual 
Canadians''. That is a quote from the Prime Minister of Canada.
<P>
	I could carry it on a little further by referring to the opening of 
the green paper: ``My commitment is to listen and to work with 
all Canadians, different governments, groups, organizations, so 
that we can develop in partnership a framework that makes 
sense, is effective and is founded on basic Canadian values of 
compassion and justice. And I invite you to join in the 
discussion and debate''.
<P>
	The point is that the green paper tabled by the minister is a 
consultation paper. The minister has pleaded with with the party 
across the way in the opposition to participate. There certainly 
are some alternatives laid forth in the green paper. At the same 
time the minister has been very open time and time again: if 
there is a better suggestion, a better idea, a better alternative, 
come forward with it. He is open to discussion; he is open to 
points of view on this subject matter.
<P>
	As a matter of fact he has gone out of his way to invite all 
Canadians to participate. It is important to people from the 
province of Quebec. It is important to people from the province 
of New Brunswick. Indeed it is important for all Canadians. This 
is your opportunity, members of the opposition party, to focus 
on citizens in the province of Quebec and have them come 
forward.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Why is the approach not to get these points of view across to 
the minister? I know he is open to them.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before recognizing the member, I 
would ask all members to put their remarks through the Chair. It 
is designed to keep the pressure down in here; it is not just 
because we have to have everything addressed to the people who 
occupy the chair.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, we have examined closely the 
famous green paper and we have made comments up to now. We 
believe essentially that the minister focuses mainly on social 
program reform. In doing so, he forces people to consider this 
reform. He starts by saying that the problem in Canada comes 
from small and medium-income people and that this is where 
savings can be made because the problems come from that 
group.
<P>
	Besides, the Prime Minister himself did not hesitate to refer to 
these people as beer-drinking couch potatoes. What we say is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8004"> 8004 </A></B>
<P>
that there is indeed a problem in Canada and whether Quebec 
stays or not, Canada will have to go  through a complete 
overhaul of its taxation system but the reform must start at the 
top. We must start with those who use these expenditures for 
their own benefit, those who pay no income tax. Billions of 
dollars are involved here.
<P>
	I quoted earlier the Liberal member for Gander-Grand Falls 
who has studied the matter, as did many others. I believe we are 
open to discussion. As we have been saying since we came here, 
we should open the books to Canadians, not only the third 
chapter, not the first, all the books. We agree with that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest to the hon. member but I found an air of doom and gloom 
in his scenario. I would suggest that the nature of work in many 
respects has changed. A lot of people work successfully at home 
and on flex time. A lot of people volunteer and do a lot of work.
<P>
	We have to face the fact that some people who work at lower 
salaries and pay their taxes are getting a little tired of waste and 
of those who abuse the system. However we are not going to 
solve the problems by attacking only those who abuse the 
system, because the system patently does not work well enough 
in this age.
<P>
	What is wrong with someone asking for some community 
service work from frequent users of the UI program, which is 
supposed to be an insurance program and not a welfare program? 
What in the world is wrong with requesting people who receive 
something to do a little something in return, or at least to take 
responsibility within their community to assist in cleaning it up, 
in it being better run or perhaps assist seniors and children?
<P>
	Would my friend care to explain how if we did that it would 
somehow, as he suggested, impact upon better paying work, 
upon more higher paying jobs? I do not see it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has just told 
us that the system is abused-I fully agree. There is abuse at all 
levels, that is what we mean. We must not consider only how 
people at the bottom of the scale abuse the system. The system is 
also abused by people all the way to the top.
<P>
	Our position is extremely clear and is illustrated by a 
colourful image: when you want to clean a staircase, you clean it 
completely, not just the bottom step or the two lowest steps. You 
start at the top and work your way down. The Bloc Quebecois 
fully agrees with the government on that point; we are prepared 
to open all the books and review them in public. That is all I had 
to say on the question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I must inform hon. members that the 
hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier has advised me in writing that 
he is unable to present his motion during the time provided for 
Private Members' Business on Monday, November 21, 1994.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It has not been possible to arrange an exchange of positions in 
the order of precedence pursuant to Standing Order 94. 
Accordingly I would request the table officers to drop that item 
of business to the bottom of the order of precedence.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business will therefore be suspended and, pursuant to Standing 
Order 99, the House will meet at eleven o'clock on Monday 
morning to consider Government Orders. I am very sorry about 
this, hon. members.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wanted to add some comments to the debate because 
it is a very important one.
<P>
	When we look at the social safety net and its origins all 
members in the Chamber would agree it essentially a Liberal 
creation. In the post-war years there were successive Liberal 
governments. There was a period when we had a Conservative 
government under John Diefenbaker. However I think the 
Liberals, particularly those under Prime Minister Pearson, can 
take credit for many of the social safety net reforms we have 
today.
<P>
	There is no doubt anything that is put together will eventually 
develop flaws and difficulties and will be subject to change and 
reform. What has happened here and the reason why we are 
having this debate right now is that reform of the social safety 
net is long overdue, not just because we cannot afford it but 
because it is not working as well as it should.
<P>
	I would not like to discuss the reforms in detail in this debate, 
but my experience in the last month has been that Canadians are 
ready for the type of debate and the type of reforms being 
contemplated now. We do not know what the final answer will be 
on unemployment insurance. We will have to see. It is a very 
contentious issue. However we have to address it and Canadians 
are ready.
<P>
	I can give a couple of examples. Every year there is a very 
popular fall fair in my area. This is typical of the ridings of most 
MPs; they have fall fairs in their ridings. I took the green paper 
of the Minister of Human Resources Development to the fall fair 
and sat it on a table there. In the course of two days I gave out 
200 copies of it.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8005"> 8005 </A></B>
<P>
	People would come up to me and ask: ``What is that?'' I would 
say: ``You have to read this because it is something that is going 
to affect every Canadian''. People from all walks of life at the 
fall fair took the paper, promised to examine it, read it carefully, 
and send in their reactions.
<P>
	I now have in my office at least 300 replies, not all of them 
sophisticated papers from special interests groups about which 
the Reform Party and perhaps myself love to talk from time to 
time. They were ordinary Canadians reacting to a very important 
initiative by the government, one that has to be debated 
thoroughly not only in the Chamber but in the community.
<P>
	I took the green paper one step further. Once a month I have a 
cable TV program. I use it as an open line show. A local 
journalist comes down. It is quite interesting. Actually it is a lot 
of fun to do because there is no pre-preparation; we do not work 
out the questions beforehand. We simply sit there and talk and 
people call in.
<P>
	People often think that cable TV is not well watched but I can 
assure the House that this program is very well watched. I had a 
tremendous response. The lines were flooded, particularly on 
the subject of the social safety net or reform of our social 
systems. I had all kinds of people call in, but the most 
compelling people who called were are on welfare, the people 
who are the beneficiaries of the system or are seen to be the 
beneficiaries of the system but are also the ones who are losing 
the most by it. One person called in and identified herself as a 
young single woman on welfare with a child; I cannot remember 
whether she had one or two children. She said that she felt 
terribly trapped.
<P>
	I conclude by saying that the debate we are engaged in, 
whether in the House or in society, is one of the most important 
debates of this Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 1.30 p.m., the House will now

listed in today's Order Paper.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="LESTERB.PEARSONACT">LESTER B. PEARSON ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-276, 
an act respecting Lester B. Pearson Day, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize to the hon. member, 
but I want to raise this point of order at the beginning of this hour 
concerning private member's bills because I want to make a very 
important point.
<P>
	Since the beginning of this Parliament we have had a system 
where a subcommittee of the House decides which private 
members' bills are votable or not votable. However, there is a 
tendency in the House for members at the end of the debate to 
ask for unanimous consent for a bill which is not votable, such as 
this one is today, to become votable.
<P>
	From the government side, it is our responsibility to make 
sure that the rules are respected. If members feel that all private 
members' bills should be votable, that question should be 
addressed to the House committee on procedure instead of 
making the point each time. In this case, even though we would 
like the hon. leader, Lester B. Pearson, to have a national 
holiday, the government definitely cannot support such an idea.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> No such motion has been made on this 
bill. There may have been discussions between the minister and 
the member, but as much as possible this hour is reserved for 
private members, not for statements of government policy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to debate the merits of my private 
member's bill entitled an act to establish Lester B. Pearson Day.
<P>
	The purpose of my bill is to establish a national holiday in 
honour of the Right Hon. Lester B. Pearson in recognition of his 
great contributions to Canada and the international community. 
In short, I have proposed that the second Monday in February of 
each year be designated as Lester B. Pearson Day for reasons 
which I will outline in my comments.
<P>
	While I am certain that members are familiar with the many 
achievements of this great man, I feel it was important to state 
some of his accomplishments for the record. Although Lester B. 
Pearson, often known as Mike Pearson, served as Canada's 
Prime Minister from April 22, 1963 to April 20, 1968, he began 
serving Canada long before moving into the Prime Minister's 
office.
<P>
	Prior to joining the department of external affairs in 1928, 
Pearson served in the Canadian Army Medical and Flying Corps 
from 1914 to 1918. As a diplomat with external affairs, he held 
several senior posts abroad, including first secretary to the 
Canadian High Commission in London from 1935 to 1941 and 
eventually became Canadian ambassador to the United States in 
1945.
<P>
	These high profile diplomatic posts contributed to his 
recognition on the world stage and propelled him to the 
chairmanship of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
between 1951 and 1952 and then to the presidency of the United 
Nations General Assembly in 1952.
<P>
	While Lester Pearson was well known on the international 
scene, it was really in 1957 that he became a household name. 
On October 14, 1957 Lester Pearson was awarded the Nobel 
peace prize. To date he is the first and only Canadian to receive 
the peace prize and I am really proud of him.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8006"> 8006 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	The Nobel committee voted to bestow the peace prize on Mr. 
Pearson primarily because of his role in the Suez crisis of 1956. 
In an effort to resolve the crisis between Egyptians and Israelis, 
Pearson proposed the creation of a UN military force to act as a 
buffer between the belligerents. His proposal received 
overwhelming approval, 57 for and none against. The first 
modern UN peacekeeping force was established, thanks to 
Lester B. Pearson.
<P>
	Gunnar Jahn, the chairman of the Nobel committee later 
stated that Pearson had been awarded the peace prize because of 
his ``never tiring determination and his exceptional ability to 
put forward constructive ideas for the solution of problems''.
<P>
	Others would echo those comments, including UN General 
Assembly President Leslie Munro, who described Pearson as a 
great Canadian who is one of the foremost citizens of the world. 
The New York Times reported that Pearson was: ``A big man 
from a country that is a small power'' and that he was probably 
better known abroad than at home. Pearson's victory prompted 
Toronto Mayor Nathan Phillips to declare December 19, 1957 
Lester Pearson Day. Unfortunately I do not believe the tradition 
has been continued.
<P>
	Pearson's success on the international stage and his receipt of 
the Nobel peace prize finally helped him to get the recognition 
he deserved in his own country. Canadians began to take notice 
of him and in 1958 Lester Pearson became the leader of the 
Liberal Party. After a few years in opposition, he went on to 
become the Prime Minister of Canada in 1963.
<P>
	In addition to his success on the international stage, Pearson 
also accomplished a great deal as Prime Minister. During his 
tenure Canadians were given the Canada pension plan, a 
program central to our nation's social safety net. Pearson was 
also responsible for giving Canadians a national flag, a true 
symbol of our nationhood and independence.
<P>
	Other notable achievements include the Royal Commission 
on Bilingualism and Biculturalism and the Canada-U.S. 
automotive agreement, both of which have had a significant 
impact on Canadian life as we know it today.
<P>
	Although Lester Pearson left this earth on December 27, 1972 
his legacy lives on in world peacekeeping. Canada is a 
peacekeeping nation because of Mr. Pearson. We are proud of 
our record as world peacekeepers and in fact many believe that 
peacekeeping personifies what it means to be Canadian. To date, 
more than 90,000 Canadians have participated in UN and other 
peacekeeping missions.
<P>
	As of this fall, close to 3,000 Canadian peacekeepers were 
participating in missions around the world, including a 
significant number in Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina, Haiti and 
Macedonia.
<P>
	If the recent report of the Special Joint Committee on 
Canada's Defence Policy is any indication of our commitment to 
peacekeeping, we can plan on being in the business for many 
more years to come. Canadians have more often than not failed 
to honour those individuals of whom they are most proud. A 
quick review of all of our national holidays show there is not one 
holiday, with perhaps the exception of Remembrance Day, 
which pays tribute to a truly remarkable Canadian.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Although I can understand why we celebrate Queen Victoria's 
birthday and many other of our statutory holidays, I have never 
been able to understand why we cannot pay tribute to our own 
heroes, to those who have had a significant impact on Canadian 
life as we know it, like Lester B. Pearson.
<P>
	Unlike Canada, many other nations take time to pay tribute to 
their heroes. The Americans celebrate George Washington's 
birthday; the British celebrate their monarchs and the Russians 
once had a holiday to honour Lenin. Is it because we feel there is 
no one worthy of our recognition? I say not.
<P>
	Some have asked me why in my bill I have chosen the second 
Monday in February as a day on which to honour our former 
Prime Minister. Originally I had hoped to select a day of 
significance to the life of Lester Pearson. I considered April 23, 
his birthday, but of course Easter is in April. Then I thought of 
October 14, the day it was announced that Pearson had won the 
Nobel peace prize, but Thanksgiving is too close. Then I 
considered December 27, the day of his death, which falls 
extremely close to Christmas and Boxing Day.
<P>
	I opted for February, the one month of the year that Canadians 
do not get a break and the month that most Canadians find to be 
the coldest and most depressing month of the year. A few years 
ago some statistics indicated that a majority of suicides take 
place in February, leading me to believe that Canadians really 
need something to look forward to in the second month of the 
year.
<P>
	I also opted for February because I felt that having two or 
more holidays in April, October or December might pose an 
excessive burden on those Canadians that operate businesses.
<P>
	I have also been asked by some members whether this bill is 
political in nature because Pearson was a Liberal. I want to 
assure all members that politics was not behind this initiative. 
This man was a great Canadian. As stated earlier, he is the only 
Nobel peace prize winner from Canada. He is the father of 
international peacekeeping. I simply want to honour a man who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8007"> 8007 </A></B>
<P>
has given so much to the people of this nation. I want to pay 
homage to a great  Canadian and his political stripe has nothing 
to do with it.
<P>
	At this stage in our history when many Canadians are asking 
themselves what it truly means to be a Canadian and some are 
even asking whether they should continue to remain in Canada, 
we must make every effort to show our citizens there are 
Canadians of whom they can be proud, Canadians who have 
made a difference to their lives today and to the lives of many 
people around the world.
<P>
	Lester Pearson is such a Canadian. By enacting a national 
holiday to honour the Right Hon. Lester Pearson, we would be 
providing Canadians with a day to reflect on this great country 
of ours and on this great man and his valuable contribution to 
our nation. Let us bring a little bit of nationalism and pride to 
Canada that it truly Canadian in nature. Let us honour one of our 
own heroes for a change.
<P>
	I will wrap up here because two of my colleagues who were 
privileged to know and work with Lester Pearson are anxious to 
share their experience and thoughts on this great man.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	In closing, I would urge all members to support this initiative.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today on behalf of the Bloc 
Quebecois to support Bill C-276, An Act respecting Lester B. 
Pearson Day. This is a perfect opportunity to take a look at the 
life and career of an illustrious man, who was Prime Minister of 
Canada from 1963 to 1968, and who made a remarkable 
contribution to Canadian diplomacy.
<P>
	After a brief military career, Mr. Pearson joined the 
diplomatic circuit. It is there that, from 1935 to 1946, he 
developed his exceptional skills in foreign policy and gained a 
solid reputation at the international level. After being Deputy 
Minister in 1946, and then Minister of External Affairs in 1948, 
Lester B. Pearson was well prepared to face the new challenges 
which awaited Canada in the post-war era.
<P>
	As the architect of the new Canadian foreign policy, he helped 
our country gain full status at the international level. The long 
tradition of Canada as a passive observer on the international 
scene was over. After the Second World War, our country had 
become a middle power. Pearson understood more than anyone 
else that Canada had to adopt a distinct and more independent 
foreign policy with its traditional partners, Great Britain and the 
United States.
<P>
	Consequently, he opened the door to multilateralism and 
imposed an expansionist vision of Canadian foreign policy. This 
resulted in Canada joining and actively participating in new 
international organizations such as the UN. For a peace 
proponent like Pearson, Canada's involvement in such an 
organization was crucial for his foreign policy.
<P>
	However, there were limits to what the United Nations could 
do. Taking into consideration the Cold War and the fact that no 
international authority could ensure order and stability on a 
world-wide basis, Pearson, then deputy minister of External 
Affairs, believed that Canada needed to join forces with its 
strategic allies under a collective defence pact. Pearson thought 
that, by signing the North Atlantic Treaty, Canada's security 
needs were being met, but also that NATO would become a 
deterrent and a defence instrument against Soviet imperialism.
<P>
	Guided by an international vision quite rare in North America 
at that time and having taken stock of the events in Prague in 
1948, Mr. Pearson unreservedly supported the creation of this 
organization in 1949. However, the North Atlantic Treaty 
remains a regional agreement. Since 1945, international 
relations have been marked by new forms of violence. All of the 
ideological confrontations between the super-powers and the 
decolonization process, led to many conflicts throughout the 
world.
<P>
	Obviously, the Charter of the United Nations cannot prevent 
war, since the veto of the five superpowers sitting on the 
Security Council limits the scope of the activities of the 
international community. To counter the powerlessness of the 
only agency of the United Nations authorized to use coercion to 
settle international conflicts, the General Assembly passed a 
resolution concerning peacekeeping in 1950.
<P>
	In 1956, during the Suez Canal crisis, Mr. Pearson proposed 
that a peacekeeping force be set up. The UN having 
implemented his recommendation, Pearson was awarded the 
Nobel Peace Prize in 1957. In fact, he had provided the United 
Nations with a new response capability. As a result of his 
international reputation, Lester B. Pearson was twice 
approached to fill the prestige position of Secretary General of 
the United Nations. In 1952, he had been president of the UN 
General Assembly, playing a pivotal role in the creation of 
specialized agencies like the UN Food and Agriculture 
Organization.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	During his term as Prime Minister, when decolonization and 
the emerging non-aligned movement were important elements 
on the international scene, Pearson became known as an eminent 
artisan of the North-South dialogue. He was in favour of an open 
policy vis-à-vis the Third World and enjoyed a privileged 
relationship with leaders like Nehru.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8008"> 8008 </A></B>
<P>
	His vision of Canada and the federal system would reflect the 
same open attitude. Pearson was on very good terms with 
Quebec and the other provinces during his first mandate.
<P>
	It was the time of the Quiet Revolution, as the Quebec nation 
State was emerging. Political leaders in Quebec were 
developing the tools the new State would need to affirm its right 
to exist. Quebec was to recover jurisdictions recognized in the 
Constitution Act, 1867, but never claimed by Canada's 
provinces.
<P>
	At the time, Pearson agreed that Quebec was justified in its 
insistence on some of these rights, and until 1965, he was on 
excellent terms with his Quebec counterparts, so that 
negotiations with the province were relatively harmonious.
<P>
	Pearson was in favour of co-operative federalism and, to 
show that he meant what he said, after he won the election in 
1963, he appointed the Laurendeau-Dunton Commission on 
Official Languages. Under his government, federal-provincial 
negotiations led to a number of administrative agreements and 
also, although there were some problems, to the creation of the 
Quebec Pension Plan and the Caisse de dépôt et de placement.
<P>
	It is hard to understand the complete reversal in Mr. Pearson's 
attitude to Quebec during his second term. He went so far as to 
deny Quebec's international personality and to see the 
province's attempts to create ties with other nations as those of a 
rebellious province intent on usurping powers that he felt were 
exclusive to the federal government.
<P>
	It is amazing that this passionate defender of decolonization 
throughout the world was so unwilling to entertain Quebec's 
aspirations. What made him suddenly become impervious to the 
legitimate demands of a province that wanted to claim the 
jurisdictions to which it was entitled? Some attribute this to the 
rise of the indépendantiste movement in Quebec or to new 
constitutional demands being made by Quebec leaders. At the 
time, it was Daniel Johnson, with his ``Égalité ou 
indépendance''. Some say it was due to the increasing influence 
of Trudeau, Marchand and other members of his cabinet.
<P>
	After Lester B. Pearson, Canada-Quebec relations were never 
again as harmonious as they were before. After the Victoria 
fiasco, the night of the long knives in 1982 was to lead to Meech 
and Charlottetown. Despite some shadow areas, Lester B. 
Pearson was a man of great stature, that is how Canadians and 
Quebecers remember him. However, it is unfortunate that his 
successors either failed or refused to continue his tradition of 
openness and his conciliatory approach.
<P>
	We can only hope that Lester B. Pearson Day will remind men 
and women in Quebec and Canada that openness and respect for 
diversity are qualities that are essential to the individual and the 
national maturity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is indeed a pleasure today to second the 
motion of the hon. member for Cambridge as he brings in his 
Lester B. Pearson day bill. I congratulate him and compliment 
him to the nth degree on his recognition of Canadian 
statesmanship. This is the hon. member's first term in this 
Parliament and this bill is a good example of his national and 
international vision. I am sure that he will have a long stay in 
this place.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hopkins:</B> He has a national spirit that he is projecting 
today in this bill. He has stated he is proud of Lester Bowles 
Pearson.
<P>
	I compliment the hon. member for Laval Centre for some of 
her remarks. Some of them I would not agree with. Everyone has 
their own perspective. As I speak I am not going to be partisan in 
this debate either. Lester B. Pearson was Prime Minister sitting 
just down here when I was first elected. He was my first Prime 
Minister. He did not have a mean bone in his body. One could 
fully understand sitting in this House with the Right Hon. Lester 
B. Pearson that he was a diplomat from day one.
<P>
	Indeed, that caused him some of his heartaches during the 
time he was Prime Minister. He was too kind to some people 
who were not very kind to him.
<P>
	Having known Mr. Pearson on a very personal first name 
basis, I had great respect for him. I was one of those first elected 
in 1965, that great election that Walter Gordon persuaded Lester 
B. Pearson to call. The only benefit the Liberal Party received 
from that election was the 53 of us who were new to the House of 
Commons. When the election was called at the advice of Walter 
Gordon to the Prime Minister, the Liberal government in this 
House had 129 seats and when the final count was in on election 
night the Liberal Party had 131 seats. Walter Gordon had 
promised Pearson a majority government. He resigned from the 
cabinet because he had given the Prime Minister bad advice.
<P>
	When we look at the background of Mr. Pearson's life he had a 
very happy childhood. One thing that really strikes me, as the 
hon. member for Cambridge mentioned, was Mr. Pearson's 
experience in World War I. Can you imagine what the Royal 
Flying Corps in Europe looked like in World War I? Mr. Pearson 
was a member of that flying corps for three years.
<P>
	This undoubtedly was a great experience for Prime Minister 
Pearson. It prepared him for the great flag debate of the 1960s 
which to him at times must have reminded him of World War I 
but he persevered through that battle.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8009"> 8009 </A></B>
<P>
	It is rather interesting that the hon. member for Cambridge 
suggests that Lester B. Pearson day should be the second 
Monday in February because it was in the month of February 
that the Canadian flag was first unfurled, I believe, on 
Parliament Hill. It is very fitting that Lester B. Pearson who led 
the debate for a new Canadian flag should be honoured in the 
same month as the Canadian flag is honoured today.
<P>
	This rather timid man had many accomplishments. When you 
first met him he was very pleasant and accommodating. He 
would always talk to you about things in your riding. It gave you 
that feeling that this man really knows his country and his local 
geography.
<P>
	I remember the last time I had a chance to have a chat with 
Mike Pearson. It was one day after he retired. He was ill at the 
time. He was out for a walk. I met him at the flame on Parliament 
Hill. His first words to me were: ``Well, Len, how are things in 
Pembroke today?''. We had a nice chat there. Then he went into 
hospital. It was not long after that that he passed away. Here is a 
Canadian who gave Canada its flag. Today our Canadian forces 
honour his name in the way they carry the Canadian flag around 
the world and when they take part in peacekeeping duties which 
as has already been stated he originated in settling the Suez 
crisis and the peacekeeping mission of 1956.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	Here was a man with immense ideas. This man when he was in 
external affairs had a national, indeed an international vision. 
He looked at the Soviet Union and saw the threat sitting in the 
east. He saw the threat when the Warsaw pact was formed. He 
saw the need for a North Atlantic Treaty Organization. To a large 
extent he was a formative builder of that great peace 
organization that saw the western world through the cold war 
crisis. It was the match for the Warsaw pact. It held the enemy at 
bay. It was a matter of which side went broke first. It turned out 
to be the Soviet Union and the Warsaw pact.
<P>
	He was president of the United Nations in 1962-63. I was 
looking up the date of Mr. Pearson's first formal election to this 
House. He was appointed Minister for External Affairs in 1948. 
Is it not ironic that on October 25, 1948, Lester B. Pearson 
became the member of Parliament for Algoma East and came to 
Ottawa and carried on his duties as Minister for External 
Affairs. He won that election by 1,200 and some votes.
<P>
	The hon. member for Cambridge mentioned the lack of 
Canadians' enthusiasm and desire to recognize their own 
national figures. Here was a national figure, a man who had 
played a major role in the founding of the United Nations. This 
was a man who had played a role in the founding of the NATO 
alliance. He came back home and ran for election and won the 
election by 1,200 and some votes.
<P>
	Then we go on to the election campaign of 1958. I particularly 
like to look back on that election for one reason alone. That is 
that the last political meeting Mr. Pearson had in that famous 
campaign of 1958 when he was slaughtered politically by the 
Diefenbaker forces was held in the town of Deep River in my 
initial riding of Renfrew North. It was before an audience in the 
high school auditorium. He sat on a table in the middle of a 
platform dangling his feet and answering questions like they 
were rolling off a log. He knew he was going to lose the election, 
but he was so candid and at ease. He came back to Ottawa and 
ended up with 48 seats in this House for the Liberal Party of 
Canada.
<P>
	In 1963 he finally won the election as Prime Minister. There 
were all kinds of issues to be faced during the 1960s. It is much 
like today when every time we turn around there is a new issue 
facing members of Parliament. Lester B. Pearson took on many 
of those challenges.
<P>
	He realized that Quebec no longer wanted to live under British 
symbols. That was very clear in his mind. That was the reason he 
put forward such a fight for the Canadian flag. The Quebec 
caucus strongly supported him on that issue all the way through 
even when the going got very difficult. Today Canada is known 
around the world by that great Canadian symbol that first flew 
over Parliament Hill in February 1965. That was one of his ideas 
of Canadian unity, but he reached out to all regions of Canada to 
try to bring them together.
<P>
<B>(1405) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I wish I could continue. You are giving me the 
signal that my time is up.
<P>
	I would like to talk about being with Mr. Pearson in caucus 
without giving away any major caucus secrets. I remember one 
morning I was delivering a speech in caucus. I came into-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent for the 
member to have one or two more minutes?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hopkins:</B> Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, and I thank 
the members of this House.
<P>
	On a Wednesday morning in caucus I delivered what I thought 
was a great dynamic speech. After that I was sitting in the House 
right over there in the back row where the hon. member for 
Brandon-Souris is sitting right now. A note was sent to me 
across the floor from the opposition. That note from a member 
of the opposition contained the exact words I had stated in 
caucus that morning.
<P>
	I sent the note down to the Prime Minister and the Hon. 
Mitchell Sharp who were sitting together. They turned to me and 
shook their heads because the first thing that came into their 
minds was that members of our caucus were leaking 
information. Actually that was the period when the Liberal 
caucus room 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8010"> 8010 </A></B>
<P>
was wired and certain members of the opposition were listening 
to every  word that was being said in the Liberal caucus room. 
They sure had my speech right.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you for allowing me that extra 
time. I thank the hon. member for Cambridge for recognizing a 
tremendous individual. One of the reasons that made him great 
was that he had some great people around him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot give 
you any personal descriptions of Mr. Pearson, but I too welcome 
the opportunity of speaking to Bill C-276 concerning Mr. Lester 
B. Pearson day.
<P>
	Certainly to establish this as a holiday in honour of former 
Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson is something to be considered, 
but today I want to raise some of the other considerations that we 
must have when we talk about such a day. As well, I do hope to 
pay some tribute to the former Prime Minister because it 
certainly is worthy.
<P>
	It is clear from the member's speech that he holds the former 
Prime Minister in very high regard. I would never fault him for 
this since Lester Pearson did indeed leave the country a 
considerable legacy. I will talk about this a little later on in my 
speech and emphasize the things I remember him for.
<P>
	To my mind politicians such as Mr. Pearson entered the public 
service for many reasons. At least two of those would be to help 
Canada grow and mature as a nation and because they were 
fascinated by the public life and all it had to offer and what they 
could offer it.
<P>
	I do not believe when he ran for the job that Mr. Pearson 
would have expected to have a Canadian holiday named after 
him. After doing some research on him I think possibly he might 
have been somewhat embarrassed by such an offer. There are a 
number of better ways to honour the memory of a former Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	For example everyone who tours around the Parliament 
Buildings will have noticed the dignified statues of our former 
Prime Ministers prominently displayed on the grounds of the 
Hill. Mr. Pearson's statue is among them and Canadians visiting 
the capital will see him in his favourite chair overlooking the 
front lawn.
<P>
<B>(1410 ) </B>
<P>
	As a former Minister of External Affairs and Prime Minister I 
am sure Mr. Pearson would also be proud that the building which 
houses the Department of Foreign Affairs bears his name, the 
Lester B. Pearson building.
<P>
	These types of displays and other similar ones that may be 
proposed are quite appropriate and do a very nice job of 
honouring the achievements and memory of Mr. Pearson. I 
believe they are also a sufficient tribute.
<P>
	On the other hand a Canadian holiday in honour of Lester 
Pearson is excessive no matter how well intentioned and sincere 
my esteemed colleague from Cambridge may be. As I quickly 
ran through the holidays in my head I found that only Jesus 
Christ and Queen  Victoria had a statutory holiday and only two 
saints, St. Patrick and St. Valentine, had named holidays.
<P>
	Coincidentally the second Monday of February which my 
colleague would like to be known as Lester B. Pearson day 
would have fallen on St. Valentine's day this year. Not only 
would I suggest naming a national holiday after a politician 
would be excessive but the date suggested will frequently fall on 
another holiday, albeit not a government holiday.
<P>
	It is my understanding that the member for Cambridge would 
like to see a statutory holiday for Mr. Pearson just like the other 
two we have mentioned. If this happened, then what would be 
next? Would the third Monday of February be Diefenbaker day 
and the following Monday be Laurier day or John A. Macdonald 
day? If we start going down this path then we will have a holiday 
for every week of the year. We would not have a Mulroney day 
and we would probably at least all agree on that.
<P>
	Above and beyond the principle of naming holidays after 
politicians there is the cost which should be considered. How 
much does a Canadian holiday really cost? If it is only a 
government holiday then the cost would be in the millions but if 
all Canadians were to take a day off work, what would that 
mean?
<P>
	Not really knowing how such a calculation might be done, 
someone suggested to me that maybe I should take Canada's 
gross domestic product and divide it by 365 days. I admit this is 
a fairly primitive way of making the calculation but it is 
certainly more conservative than using the GNP numbers. If we 
divide the GDP by 365 we come up with a figure of $1.95 billion. 
I know that number might be exaggerated but I think the point 
we have to make is that the Canadian economy just cannot afford 
that sort of expense.
<P>
	In addition, for businesses such as restaurants, corner stores 
and others which would stay open, such a holiday would force 
them to pay additional wages to their staff. For businesses 
struggling to survive the last thing they need is an unnecessary 
added expense.
<P>
	While I do not agree with the idea that there should be a 
Canadian holiday for Mr. Pearson, this is not to suggest I do not 
think his achievements are praiseworthy. Any one person who 
could be ambassador to the United States, deputy minister of 
External Affairs, Minister of External Affairs, president of the 
UN General Assembly, Prime Minister and winner of the Nobel 
peace prize is obviously someone who has made a tremendous 
contribution to Canada and to the world.
<P>
	While I have this opportunity to speak I would briefly like to 
discuss Mr. Pearson's Nobel peace prize. As we all know in 
order to bring an end to the Suez crisis in 1956 Mr. Pearson 
developed the idea of the UN peacekeeping force which could 
intervene and keep combatants separated. Of course it worked in 
the case of Suez and has been used ever since as a useful tool of 
international diplomacy and conflict resolution.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8011"> 8011 </A></B>
<P>
	As Reform's foreign affairs critic I cannot help but reflect on 
this transition which peacekeeping has undergone since Mr. 
Pearson's days. Under the original formulation peacekeepers 
would only enter a country once there was a ceasefire agreement 
in place. They would then monitor this agreement and make sure 
that no flare ups occurred. In principle while the combatants 
were separated this would provide a window of opportunity for 
negotiations to bring about a lasting peaceful solution to 
hostilities.
<P>
	Since the first peacekeeping missions, Canada has 
contributed troops all over the world and at every opportunity. 
However the requests for our help have continued to increase by 
the year and our resources are now stretched to the limit. I mean 
this in two senses. The personnel of the Canadian forces are 
stretched and our financial resources are limited.
<P>
	Not only has our participation in peacekeeping become more 
of a burden, but the nature of peacekeeping has changed. Today 
our peacekeepers are going into more dangerous situations, 
often without the benefit of ceasefire and much more uncertain 
mandates.
<P>
<B>(1415) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, I was pleased to participate in the Canadian 
foreign policy review during which we discussed the 
peacekeeping legacy of Mr. Pearson in quite a bit of detail. It 
was decided during this review and with the input of Canadians 
from coast to coast that our peacekeeping tradition, begun by 
Mr. Pearson, was still a very important expression of Canadian 
foreign policy and that we would like to see the armed forces 
restructured in such a way that they can optimize their 
participation in future UN interventions.
<P>
	Nonetheless, it was also realized that Canada can no longer be 
the 911 phone number for the world. In the future Canada must 
be more selective about the peacekeeping missions it goes on. I 
would like to personally ask this Parliament for the opportunity 
to debate the question of what specific criteria Canada should 
use to determine which peacekeeping missions will be the most 
appropriate for our participation.
<P>
	I would like to see Mr. Pearson's legacy continue and I would 
like Parliament to deal with this whole issue in a way that will 
allow Canada to continue its role as an international 
peacekeeper into the next century.
<P>
	In conclusion, there is no doubt the Right Hon. Lester B. 
Pearson made a very important contribution to the development 
of this country, and for that he does deserve honour, but this 
must be done in an appropriate way. While a holiday is too 
expensive for the Canadian economy and would set a dangerous 
precedent for opening the floodgates to more holidays for other 
political leaders from our past, I have no objection to the other 
tributes which already exist to honour Mr. Lester.
<P>
	I commend the member for Cambridge for his loyalty and for 
bringing this bill forward. I was pleased to speak on it today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I stand before you today to 
support the bill of my colleague, the hon. member for 
Cambridge.
<P>
	I come at it in quite a different way. The reason I appreciate so 
much that he has brought this issue forward is that I believe he is 
quite right that we so often fail as Canadians to recognize our 
heroes. We have many heroes; heroes of literature, heroes of 
history, heroes in Quebec, heroes in the west. We do not 
recognize them enough. Sometimes I believe that one of the 
reasons why we have problems as a country is because we do not 
have a strong enough sense of self.
<P>
	When it comes to Mr. Pearson as a person who would be 
appropriate to be celebrated on a particular day, I do not believe 
the member is suggesting a statutory holiday but he is 
suggesting a name day, a recognition day. When it comes to Mr. 
Pearson, the politician, I find myself inclining toward the views 
of my colleague in the Reform Party, although from a different 
way. This is the reason.
<P>
	In another life I am a little bit of an historian and I am familiar 
with other aspects of Mr. Pearson's life. I can tell the hon. 
member for Cambridge that one of the problems with 
politicians, and particularly leaders, is that history tells more 
about them as the years go by than we might know or appreciate 
at the time. In the case of Mr. Pearson, documents that are now 
becoming available, as they are in Britain regarding Churchill, 
are revealing that Mr. Pearson was very much involved in the 
intelligence world in co-operation with the United States and 
Britain, and that Mr. Pearson was very, very conscious of the 
threat of communism. That was mentioned. Mr. Pearson was 
actually a bit of a hawk rather than a dove when it came to the 
Soviet Union.
<P>
	As he was talked into a very close relationship with the 
Americans at the intelligence level, during the Suez crisis, as the 
hon. member will remember, it was a situation where the British 
and the French had attacked the Sinai and the Americans were 
opposed to it. The Americans and Canadians were opposed to it.
<P>
	What happened there, as we now know from documents, was 
that the British and the French were reading Egyptian ciphers, 
codes and ciphers. The Americans and Canadians were reading 
the codes and ciphers of all the other Arab nations. When it came 
to sending the forces into the Middle East, Mr. Pearson by 
benefit of the Americans had the advantage of terrific 
intelligence. He was not at risk of losing lives or making a bad 
decision.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="8012"> 8012 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1420 ) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, there is evidence today that Mr. Pearson's 
initiative in the Middle East in solving the Suez crisis with UN 
peacekeeping forces was an initiative that was worked out with 
the Americans. He got the Nobel Prize for it, but I think as the 
years go by we will see a little more about what actually 
happened there.
<P>
	This is not to take away from Mr. Pearson in any way, manner 
or form because, as the hon. member for Laval Centre so 
eloquently said, Mr. Pearson contributed marvellously to this 
country, not only in terms of foreign policy but in terms of 
opening up this this government to francophones from Quebec.
<P>
	Prior to the second world war there was not anything like that 
accessibility from Quebec. Mr. Pearson recognized that Quebec 
was moving forward after the second world war. Mr. Pearson 
tried to join with that.
<P>
	That is a problem. When it comes to naming politicians, as my 
Reform party colleague was saying, it is a little delicate when 
we set aside days to commemorate them. Something might come 
up in the future that would give us second thoughts about it or we 
might decide that it is not that appropriate. When we look down, 
I will agree with the member for Cambridge that I could not 
think of another statesman or politician in this country who 
would be more suitable or almost.
<P>
	Certainly if we look down the roll of Prime Ministers, only 
Mr. Pearson has the stature that would qualify for the type of 
recognition the member proposes. Oddly enough, I would make 
one exception. In speaking from the heart, from my experience 
of life in this country in the last 30 years, I would make one 
exception of a leader in this country who showed he had a heart 
that went beyond politics, having his country at heart and a real 
sense of the country. The member for Laval Centre will just love 
this. It was René Levesque. Mr. Levesque was a man who spoke 
for not just the people of Quebec. He spoke for all Canadians 
with what he brought to the fore. At least in my mind he gave me 
in that entire debate, now quite a few years ago, a sense of what 
being a Canadian really was.
<P>
	I want members to know, members of the Bloc Quebecois 
particularly, that René Levesque, who I saw in action, was an 
incredibly human man, so easy to relate to, not a person like 
Trudeau who tended to be arrogant, or a person like Mr. Turner 
who tended to be inaccessible. I always felt he was a man of the 
people. That was the warmth. He brought us forward as a nation, 
not just Quebec, but as a nation at large.
<P>
	I do not feel the same way about Jacques Parizeau. I feel very 
strongly that what Mr. Levesque created in raising the sense of 
Canadian identity was largely destroyed by a subsequent Prime 
Minister who led us into a fruitless debate and brought us to 
where we are now. I am very confident, on the other hand, that 
we will remember the spirit of Mr. Levesque and that will come 
out of the debate now on the subject of separatism. We  will 
come to be a much stronger country. I am very convinced of that.
<P>
	Obviously we are not going to have a day recognizing Mr. 
Levesque in the near future.
<P>
	This is a delicate thing I would say to the hon. member for 
Cambridge. When one raises the issue of a recognition day for 
prominent politicians it does risk running aground on the rock of 
politics of the day. I would suggest to the hon. member that 
maybe we should look for another sort of hero. There is no doubt 
that as Canadians we constantly overlook our heroes.
<P>
	I would like to suggest to him there is a heroine we constantly 
overlook as Canadians, whereas the whole world recognizes this 
particular person. I speak of Anne of Green Gables. Do we 
realize in this House that a fictional heroine-
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gaffney:</B> What about Lucy Maud Montgomery?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> No, I know who wrote <I>Anne of Green Gables</I>, 
but I do not think Lucy Maud Montgomery day would have the 
same shall we say caché as Anne of Green Gables. I point out 
that while in Japan they have <I>Anne of Green Gables</I> on their 
school programs, nowhere in Canada have I ever heard of a 
school or university teaching it. Yet this book, published in 
1908, has run through more copies and more languages than just 
about any book of fiction in the world. It is known worldwide.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	My colleagues from Prince Edward Island tell me that 
approximately 700,000 tourists come to the Island every year 
and about 40,000 of those are Japanese. They come to see the 
farm where Lucy Maud Montgomery, the author of <I>Anne of 
Green Gables</I>, lived and to see the house that was described in 
the novels.
<P>
	I suggest we avoid falling into difficult political traps when 
we want to recognize a fine Canadian who is recognized 
worldwide. Perhaps we should look to the young lady of <I>The 
Lake of Shining Waters</I>. It is appropriate that we as Canadians 
recognize a person who is recognized in the world's 
imagination.
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A few years ago, I introduced in this House a motion to have a 
statue of the Right Hon. Lester B. Pearson erected on Parliament 
Hill. I had the privilege of choosing the spot where the memorial 
to this great Canadian would stand.
<P>
	I wanted to take a few minutes to tell the House how much I 
like and support the motion in front of the House today. I would 
also like to tell Canadian men and women that, like many of 
them, I consider Lester B. Pearson to be the greatest Prime 
Minister this country ever had, even though some might not 
think so.
<P>
	I always appreciated his sense of humility. If he were here 
today, he would probably blush and he would certainly be 
embarrassed by such a motion, he who never accepted that 
something be named after him or that a statue be erected in his 
honour. His grave, in the Ottawa area-in Quebec, in fact, as 
several members opposite know-is very simple. That is the 
way he lived.
<P>
	His humility might be reason why we now see him as a great 
statesman. This is also the reason why the hon. member for 
Cambridge wanted to recognize Lester B. Pearson.
<P>
	I agree with his statement. I would have liked Parliament to 
send this document to a parliamentary committee for further 
review. Anyway, I will use the few seconds I have left to 
congratulate the member for Cambridge for recognizing in 
Lester B. Pearson a great Canadian political figure, a statesman, 
the father of the flag which stands besides your chair, Mr. 
Speaker, and the originator of Canadian diplomacy. I want to 
join the member in telling Canadians how important it is to take 
steps to honour great Canadians such as Lester B. Pearson.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, the hour provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 96(1), this item is dropped from the 
Order Paper.
<P>
	It being 2.30 p.m., this House stands adjourned until next 
Monday at 11 a.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 2.30 p.m.)
<P>
