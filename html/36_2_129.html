<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>MOTION NO. 425—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am now ready to rule on the point of 
order raised by the hon. member for Fraser Valley on June 14, 
2000 concerning the placement under private members' business of 
a motion regarding the Senate's progress on Bill C-247, an act to 
amend the criminal code and the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act and on the intervention made by the hon. member for 
Langley—Abbotsford on October 5, 2000 on the same subject.  I 
want to thank both members for their interventions.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to thank the Leader of the Government in the 
House of Commons and the hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona for 
their contributions on this matter last June. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his submission, the hon. member for Fraser Valley contended 
that his motion should be more appropriately considered under 
motions, under the rubric routine proceedings, a point echoed by 
the hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford.  The member for Fraser 
Valley referred to an earlier question of privilege raised on 
September 16, 1996 concerning the failure of a committee to 
report a bill back to the House.  He drew a parallel between the 
principles regarding the fate of that bill and the principles 
regarding Bill C-247, which is presently before the Senate.  The 
member also stated that his motion concerned the proprieties and 
authority of the House, which are normally dealt with under 
routine proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have carefully examined both hon. members' arguments and, in 
my opinion, there are two aspects to this point of order.  The 
first is whether a parallel can be drawn between proceedings in a 
House committee on a bill and proceedings in the Senate on a bill 
originating in the House of Commons.  The hon. member for Fraser 
Valley made reference to my earlier ruling on Bill C-234 and I 
would like to repeat a part of that statement, which is contained 
in <I>Debates</I>, September 23, 1996 at page 4561. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should a Member or a Minister be of the opinion that a committee 
charged with the review of a bill is defying the authority of the 
House, he or she may choose to bring it to the attention of the 
House by placing on notice a motion to require the committee to 
report by a certain date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. Members know, this can indeed be done under Government 
Orders or Private Members' Business, but such a notice of motion 
could also be placed under the rubric motions and be dealt with 
under Routine Proceedings. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that it is important to note that this ruling deals with 
an internal situation that lies clearly within the purview of the 
House.  However, in a bicameral parliament such as ours, the two 
Houses share in the making of legislation.  Each House is the 
master of its own proceedings.  The rules of one House cannot 
also be applied to the other, nor can one House compel the other 
to conduct its work in a specific manner or according to a 
specific timetable.  Accordingly, in my view the situation with 
regard to Bill C-247 is not analogous to the situation that was 
at issue with regard to Bill C-234 since the proprieties and 
authority of each House are completely independent one from the 
other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second aspect of this point of order concerns the proper 
rubric under which the hon. member's motion should appear on the 
order paper.  <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I> 
states at pages 390-91: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Different categories of business have developed over the years in 
response to the need to adapt to the organization of House 
business....As a general rule, motions dealing with matters of 
substance or government policy are moved either by Ministers 
under Government Orders or private Members under Private Members' 
Business....the Chair accepts certain motions put on notice by 
private Members for consideration under the rubric “Motions”, 
such as motions of instruction to committees and for concurrence 
in committee reports.  When private Members give written notice 
of other substantive matters, these motions are placed under 
“Private Members' Business” on the Order Paper. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a member or a minister wishes the House to express an opinion 
on any matter which falls outside the narrow scope of what is 
considered to be House Business, such motions should properly 
appear under Private Members' Business or Government Orders, as 
the case may be. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that basis, I must rule that the motion under the name of the 
hon. member for Fraser Valley placed on the order paper under 
private members' business is indeed in its correct place and I 
thank him for having brought this matter to the attention of the 
House.

<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, 
Lib.)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK8">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the government consider the advisability of increasing the 
pension accrual rate for firefighters to allow them to retire 
with adequate financial provisions for their retirement. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, Canada's professional firefighters have a 
long and proud history of protecting the lives and property of 
their neighbours.  For their selflessness and service to the 
public they rightly enjoy the respect and admiration of the 
Canadian people and the members of the House.  I am confident 
that we all share the same image of the professional firefighter: 
a highly trained, courageous man or woman who assists us when 
emergencies arise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The image is certainly accurate.  I know first-hand the great 
job that our firefighters perform.  I would imagine that members 
remember the date 1958.  I remember it as a child of six years. 
At around 2 o'clock in the morning I remember my father crashing 
through the farmhouse telling all of us to get up, get dressed 
and get out of the house because the barn was on fire. The 
building that burned that night was a three story structure, 40' 
by 175', 21,000 square feet.  I can remember the firefighters 
that night trying to save the barn and finally having to give up. 
They then tried to save our farmhouse, which they succeeded in 
doing.  I remember them hooking a tractor onto a huge propane 
tank beside the barn, disconnecting the tank and getting it away 
before it left a very large hole in the ground.  They were 
successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember that the individuals who fought the fire that night 
took their lives in their hands on a number of different 
instances.  It is something that has been branded on my mind and 
in my memory.  I will carry with me as long as I live the memory 
of what happened that night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps there are other members in the House who have also 
benefited from such bravery and professionalism during an 
emergency situation, or who have at least witnessed firefighters 
in action at the scene of a fire, an accident, a medical 
emergency or some other kind of emergency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We owe the firefighters a debt of gratitude.  There is no 
question about it.  In the name of fairness and in the hopes of 
correcting a long-standing inequity, I rise today to share 
another image of the professional firefighter, one not so widely 
known but accurate nonetheless.  I am talking about the 
individual firefighter who spends 30 years in a career that has 
one of the highest rates of on the job injury and illness, who 
faces the result of a career spent in the line of toxic 
substances, communicable diseases and a myriad of dangerous 
situations.  It should be noted that while other Canadian workers 
have the right to refuse dangerous workplace situations, the 
professional firefighter does not enjoy the same right.  Danger 
is an everyday reality for them.  It is part of the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to data collected by the International Association of 
Fire Fighters, which represents 17,000 professional firefighters 
and emergency medical personnel in Canada, firefighters 
experience the highest rate of job related injury and illness of 
any sector of the workforce.  In 1997 almost one in three 
firefighters suffered an injury or illness in the line of duty, 
far exceeding and in fact tripling the rate of injury and illness 
experienced in other sectors such as mining, construction, 
manufacturing or agriculture.  I am a farmer and I know the 
injury level in agriculture.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several studies have showed a link between the occupation of 
firefighting, heart disease and certain types of cancer.  This is 
as a result of a firefighter's exposure during the course of a 
career to toxic substances encountered while attacking blazes in 
chemical and industrial settings, a type of fire that is becoming 
more and more common in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all remember too well the fire that raged for four days in 
July of 1997 at the Plastimet recycling facility in Hamilton, 
Ontario.  More than 100 Hamilton firefighters were exposed to 
burning polyvinyls.  They fought to save the city from this toxic 
inferno and were successful.  However, the long term health 
effects on these firefighters may not be known for several years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give the House an example of that, I had a chance to talk to 
these firefighters last year when they were in Ottawa.  Two of 
the fire trucks that were involved in that blaze were aluminium. 
They were totalled by the chemicals.  The trucks could not be 
repaired and they had to do away with them.  The firefighters 
were exposed to those same chemicals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a past experience, a toxic fire at a Saskatoon landfill site 
in 1982 illustrated that the long term health effects are in fact 
a sad reality.  Six of the 12 firefighters who fought that blaze 
are dead.  Cancers have been diagnosed among those who survived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give another illustration,  one month ago the International 
Association of Fire Fighters added the names of more than 50 
firefighters from across North America to its memorial in 
Colorado Springs.  All of them were firefighters who died in the 
line of duty during the previous 12 months.  This is the highest 
number of names added to the memorial in a given year.  It is 
another reason why I think it is appropriate that we deal with 
this motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the members that line of duty means the same as in the 
course of saving lives and properties of people in the 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's Income Tax Act recognizes the dangerous nature of 
firefighting and deems firefighters to be members of a public 
safety occupation.  This permits them to retire early at age 55, 
which has long been considered to be in the best interests of 
firefighters and the communities they serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is a problem with the regulation in that it stops 
there.  It permits firefighters to retire at age 55 but it does 
not contain any mechanism to allow them to make up for the 
retirement incomes they forfeit because of an early retirement. 
This is a definite inequity which has robbed many firefighters 
and their families of the right to retire with dignity and with 
financial security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an inequity that the International Association of Fire 
Fighters has been raising with the Canadian government since the 
1970s.  This is too long.  It is an inequity that our 
firefighters have endured long enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to add concrete regulatory action to the respect and 
admiration we give our professional firefighters.  As it stands, 
a firefighter retiring at the age of 55 with 30 years of 
accredited service will retire with 60% of his or her 
pre-retirement income according to the 2% annual accrual rate 
that he or she and other Canadians contribute to their registered 
pensions.  This is just too low when the government identifies 
70% of the pre-retirement income as a benchmark for the enjoyment 
of an adequate standard of living in retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For three years now a proposal has existed which would correct 
this injustice.  It involves a very simple regulatory change to 
the Income Tax Act, something that can be done easily and without 
rewriting the legislation.  It involves a regulatory increase in 
the yearly accrual rate for professional firefighters' registered 
pensions from the current 2% to 2.33% for the years of accredited 
service. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1120"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why 2.33%?  This is the magic number for firefighters.  With a 
2.33% accrual rate, a firefighter who retires at age 55 after 30 
years of service will achieve 70% of his or her pre-retirement 
income reaching that important benchmark for the quality of life 
in retirement.  Again, this regulatory change can be done very 
easily and it would come at no cost to the Canadian government or 
the Canadian taxpayer.  This is a win-win situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is long overdue.  It is a regulatory change.  It is simply 
the first step in pension fairness for firefighters.  It would 
allow the higher accrual rate to be negotiated and reflected in 
provincial pension plans.  The final ingredient comes at the 
collective bargaining process at the local level.  However, it 
starts here at the federal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Less than one year ago the Standing Committee on Finance 
released its report to the finance minister.  In the report the 
committee, after listening to a compelling presentation from the 
International Association of Fire Fighters during its prebudget 
consultation exercise, acknowledged the inequity in firefighters' 
pensions and recommended that the finance minister consider 
taking action in correcting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly afterwards, in April of this year, professional 
firefighters from across Canada descended on Parliament Hill 
during their annual lobbying conference.  Of the 154 MPs who met 
with the firefighters, 101 of them, a full two-thirds, said that 
they supported an increase in the accrual rate for firefighters' 
registered pension plans in the name of fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Support for this initiative and other methods of pension 
fairness for our nation's professional firefighters was voiced in 
the House in April echoing the growing chorus of support for this 
initiative.  As it stands, there is no concrete action toward 
correcting this injustice.  This is our opportunity to provide 
meaningful pension reform for Canada's heroes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not let it slip away.  Let us take this opportunity to 
tell our professional firefighters and the people of Canada that 
we recognize the sacrifices that firefighters make in the course 
of their career.  We are prepared to take action on their very 
legitimate concern about their right to retire with dignity and 
with security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Firefighters are not asking to be put on a level above Canadian 
workers, they are asking to be treated the same.  They are asking 
the government to enact a regulatory change under the Income Tax 
Act that will allow them to retire with the same standard of 
living as other working Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to have the 
opportunity to speak on this private member's bill introduced by 
my colleague who just spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a private member's bill designed to address a concern of 
a profession that meets with members of parliament each and every 
year on the Hill.  I would say that this particular group does 
one of the best jobs on putting forward its concerns to members 
of parliament than any of the groups who we meet with from time 
to time.  It prepares its briefs very well.  It makes its issues 
clear and concise.  It involves its grassroots members in the 
effort.  It is not just professionals or paid lobbyist but real 
people in our communities who talk to us about their concerns. We 
appreciate the efforts they take to meet with us and to work with 
us on their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague and others in the House who will speak, speak for 
all Canadians in expressing the appreciation that all of us feel 
for the work of firefighters.  The job entails a great deal of 
danger and involves a great deal of physical and mental ability. 
There has to be a lot of not only physical strength and fitness 
but also good judgement, bravery and ability to meet challenges 
in an effective way in this profession.  We believe that some of 
the finest members of our community are involved in the 
firefighting profession.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is sometimes a profession that is not appreciated as much 
as it should be until some of us experience firsthand the need 
for the kind of rescue operations that firefighters offer when 
our homes, our businesses or our communities are touched by fire 
and by the danger which firefighters deal with each and every 
day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Firefighters are deserving of the highest praise, gratitude and 
appreciation by Canadians and by members of our community.  We 
want to give them that appreciation today.  This bill gives us an 
opportunity to emphasize how much we appreciate and value the 
work of firefighters in our communities and in our cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many of our rural communities, there are volunteer 
firefighters.  They carry pagers and if there is a fire or a 
situation in the community that calls for their services they 
drop everything to respond.  These volunteers sometimes leave 
some pretty important situations in order to help out other 
members of the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard a story about a volunteer firefighter who was at his 
daughter's graduation when his pager went off.  He simply left to 
help other families and other members of the community even 
though his daughter was graduating that day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we want to express appreciation for volunteer 
firefighters across our nation, many of whom work hard in other 
jobs but are still willing to be on call all the time to assist 
their community and their fellow citizens.  The concern for 
fellow citizens which is inherent in the firefighting occupation 
is something that is very praiseworthy and we want to acknowledge 
that today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The firefighters have put forward, in the seven years that I 
have been in parliament, three major concerns each and every 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One was that dangerous goods be tracked across the country so 
that when there was a fire involving trains or trucks 
transporting dangerous chemical, firefighters would have a very 
quick and easy way of ascertaining what chemicals might have been 
involved in a particular fire so they would know how to deal 
with the chemicals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, they asked for the opportunity to find out, when 
they were contaminated by blood in an emergency situation, whether 
they were infected with a dangerous disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to report that my colleague from Fraser Valley West 
put forward a private member's bill called the blood samples act 
that would allow firefighters to obtain an analysis of blood that 
they were contaminated with and which they felt may have infected 
them.  This bill passed second reading in the House and is now in 
committee.  We are hopeful that this blood samples act, brought 
forward by my colleague from Fraser Valley West, will pass all 
readings in the House, will be passed by the senate and become 
law so that firefighters will have the peace of mind they need 
knowing they can ascertain if they were infected inadvertently 
with a dangerous communicable disease.  This was another step 
brought forward by a private member of the House to assist 
firefighters and to respond to their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third issue that firefighters have consistently brought 
forward is the matter of the Canada pension plan and the changes 
that they are requesting.  We have this motion today and I will 
read it: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the government consider the advisability of increasing the 
pension accrual rate for firefighters to allow them to retire 
with adequate financial provisions for their retirement. 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT7"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT7"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1130
<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is fair to say that the wording of the motion is a 
little bit tentative.  Even if we pass the motion, the government 
would simply be considering the advisability of making these 
changes.  The motion would not have the effect of actually making 
the changes.  It is perhaps a small step.  I do not fault the 
mover of the motion for the wording because I am sure that it was 
well considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out that even if the changes to the Canada 
pension plan, which we are being asked to consider, were put into 
place they would not really allow firefighters to retire with 
adequate financial provisions.  The Canada pension plan is 
designed to replace about one-quarter of the retirement needs of 
working Canadians.  Even changes that would increase the accrual 
rate for firefighters would provide only a very small portion of 
the pensions that they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this matter was to go forward for consideration there would 
be three issues that would be debated before the House and in 
committee:  first, the issue of fairness and equity; second, the 
issue of coherence of the pension plan; and third, the issue of 
the best interests of firefighters or how any profession might 
best meet their retirement needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the first issue of equity and fairness, many people have 
raised the fact that other professions must retire early, such as 
the military, or often retire early and become involved in 
stressful occupations within the public service.  The question 
would be whether making special provisions for one profession 
would not lead to concerns about fairness and equity to other 
professions.  I think that is an issue that needs to be 
considered and addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue would be that of whether the Canada pension 
plan, which is a pension plan for all Canadian workers, is the 
proper instrument of public policy to address specific concerns 
for specific groups that may access the plan.  Of course the more 
a plan is tailored for different groups the more difficult it 
becomes to administer and the more costly. That also is something 
that experts will talk about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third concern is whether the Canada pension plan, which in 
the future will yield less than a 2% rate of return, is the 
instrument that firefighters, and particularly those entering the 
profession, would want to count on for retirement income.  There 
is some concern, and we have raised this in the House, about the 
Canada pension plan and its long term viability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are issues that we would be discussing if the motion is 
approved by the House.  I want to say how much we appreciate the 
the firefighters taking the trouble to put their issues forward 
to us so clearly.  We are pleased with the work they do. We 
appreciate them and we are also pleased to consider their 
concerns today in this motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to this private member's motion, and 
congratulate the member for Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey on his 
interesting proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of his motion is to restore equity with respect to 
CPP premiums for the firefighters of Quebec and of Canada, who 
are so important to the life of this country.  That is why it 
deserves our careful attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the existing Income Tax Act, the occupation of firefighter 
is one associated with public safety. 
Firefighters are therefore forced to retire when they reach the 
age of 60.  Over the years, a number of commissions of inquiry 
in Quebec, as well as in Ontario and elsewhere in Canada, have 
suggested that the age of retirement be 55 because this is a 
high risk sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a high risk sector not just because of the sometimes fatal 
injuries that firefighters sustain, but because of the toxic 
substances to which they are exposed every day and which may cut 
short their lives.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, a study carried out in 1994 by the Ontario Industrial 
Disease Standards Panel stated that there was a link between 
firefighting and heart disease, as well as brain, lymphatic, 
colon, bladder and kidney cancer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is serious.  The people in this profession are exposed 
daily to risks not found in other professions.  In my riding in 
June 1998, the municipal fire chief of Acton Vale, Michel 
Daragon, died at the age of 55 while fighting an industrial 
fire.  Firefighter Jacques Houle lost his life in the same 
incident. 
Eight firefighters were injured in the one fire, including Chief 
Daragon's son Mario, who was seriously injured.  Serious head 
injuries were sustained by one firefighter, Réjean Messier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, and elsewhere, these people are exposed every day 
to dangers that can result in fatal injuries.  I should point 
out that just about everyone has a firefighter in the family. 
In my case it was a cousin, Gilles Archambault, father of two 
girls, who was faced daily with situations in which he could 
have been killed.  He risked his life to save others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past weekend I saw a boyhood friend, Benoît Desjardins, a 
career firefighter with two young children, ages six and eight. 
He too puts his life on the line every day. 
They receive no pension contributions, despite the fact that 
they often have to take early retirement by age 60, at the 
latest, because this sort of job involves public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens when these people start drawing their pensions at 
age 60?  They have contributed to their pension plan during 
their life of active service at a maximum rate of 2% annually. 
At age 60 they are obliged to retire.  In the period between 60 
and 65, there are no contributions of 2% annually so these 
people can benefit from fair pension plans as other professions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public official who retires at age 60 can catch up between 
the ages of 60 and 65 by continuing to contribute to the Canada 
pension plan or Quebec's Régime des rentes.  This is not the 
case for  firefighters. 
Their active life, what is called credited service, lasts until 
age 60 at the latest.  And so, their benefits are reduced 
because they are forced to leave their profession at age 60 and 
are unable between the ages of 60 and 65 to contribute to the 
public pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They may retire at 55, which is often the case.  This is not 
really an old age, but it is a fairly advanced age for doing 
such a dangerous job and is as risky for the firefighter as it 
is for his colleagues.  Some firefighters, for health reasons or 
things that have happened to them during their career, are 
forced to retire at 55.  Things are even worse in this case, 
because between 55 and 60 they do not work and therefore do not 
contribute to their pension plan.  In addition, they face the 
same prejudice all firefighters face, no contributions between 
ages 60 and 65. Therefore, they receive less pension income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States, many years ago, firefighting was 
recognized as being a high risk job.  The value of this 
profession and the immeasurable contribution firefighters make 
have long been recognized.  Pension contributions there are at 
the rate of 2.5% annually.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The firefighters association is asking us to restore annual 
authorized contributions to 2.3%. This is not much. In so doing, 
the government would restore fairness by treating firefighters 
like the members of the other professions relating to public 
security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time for fine rhetoric is over. The government must now take 
its responsibilities regarding this type of measure. In 1995, 
the Minister of Finance—with a hand on his heart or, more 
accurately, on his wallet, which is full of our money—sent a 
letter to the firefighters' association, in which he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell you that I am very aware of the daily pressures 
experienced by public safety officials and of the fact that, 
because of the burden that their profession represents, a large 
number of firefighters and police officers see their career cut 
short. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come to follow up on that letter, sent by the 
Minister of Finance in 1995. We have here a concrete motion that 
seeks to partly correct the unfair treatment given to 
firefighters. It also ensures that firefighters are treated just 
like others public safety officials. Allowing early retirement 
at age 55 would make room for young people while avoiding—because 
this is a high risk profession—threats to the physical integrity 
of those 55 and over who are firefighters and of those whose 
lives they save, almost on a weekly basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will support this initiative. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
also wish to begin my remarks by complimenting the sponsor of 
this motion for bringing forward what I believe is a very topical 
and timely issue as it relates to the health, safety and 
well-being of working people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to compliment the International Association of Fire 
Fighters for being visible and very active in trying to promote 
this particular issue for many years, both in the general public 
and in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During their annual lobby, every MP on the Hill has probably 
been visited by members of the IAFF as they have come to our 
offices to ask for recognition of the issues that they feel are 
most important and front and centre for the members that they 
represents.  I do not believe any organization has run a more 
effective lobby in terms of making members of parliament aware of 
the issues that this particular organization is advocating.  The 
association should be complimented for the long, hard road that 
it has followed to finally bring this issue to debate in the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is generally agreed that firefighters enjoy a special status 
in the hearts and minds of Canadians.  All Canadians recognize 
the inherent dangers of the job, the courage and the physical 
stress and duress that such an undertaking shows on working 
people.  All of us recognize what a necessary and valuable 
position firefighters hold within our communities, whether they 
are rural or urban communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no other job in the world like firefighting.  Every 
time the bell rings and every time someone is called out to their 
workplace they are faced with imminent danger.  We can view many 
jobs as dangerous, whether it is logging, coal mining or the 
building trades that I come from, but no worker faces the day to 
day risk that firefighters face every day they go to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in recognition of that fact that we are sensing broad 
support in the House of Commons for this very reasonable 
amendment to the Income Tax Act.  I regret that the motion was 
worded in such a soft way, as are most private member's motions. 
The motion does not particularly bind the government to leap into 
any particular action in the immediate future but it does give 
direction to the government to act in a certain way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, the firefighters have come to us year after year 
in their annual lobby asking for just a few simple things.  It is 
to their credit that they have rendered down the number of issues 
facing their members to a few achievable goals that they have 
been very persistent and consistent in putting across to us.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of those were itemized by previous speakers.  One is 
the hazardous materials identification system firefighters are 
advocating that would go above and beyond the WHMI system that 
all other workers enjoy.  WHMIS is the workplace hazardous 
materials identification system.  It is based on the premise that 
all workers have the right both to know the chemical makeup of 
the materials they are handling and to refuse unsafe work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, WHMIS fails firefighters.  Firefighters do not have 
the right to refuse unsafe work.  Everything they do would be 
categorized in any other conventional workplace as being 
inherently unsafe.  Given the chemical soup that serves as a risk 
to workers these days in many manufacturing settings, 
firefighters are even more concerned.  Unfortunately the ill 
effects of that chemical soup are even more obvious as 
manufacturing systems and processes become more elaborate and 
sophisticated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the real and existing dangers pointed out by firefighters 
who have visited my office is that often it is not any one 
chemical that will harm them on exposure.  It is the compounding 
effect of a variety of chemicals reacting with one another in a 
person's system.  For instance, chemical <I>A</I> is ingested at 
one fire and chemical <I>B</I> is ingested a year later.  Those 
two go on to form chemical <I>C</I> within the firefighter's 
internal organs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a terrible problem.  Firefighters we call the walking 
wounded are walking the streets today.  They are really ticking 
time bombs in terms of showing the ill effects of exposure to 
hazardous things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the paramount things firefighters want addressed is a 
more sophisticated hazardous materials tracking system, 
specifically on the rail lines.  That way, when a rail car 
overturns and creates a toxic plume, firefighters would have some 
way of knowing what was in the tanker car prior to rushing to the 
scene.  They would not have to read the card on the side of the 
overturned tanker that may be burning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue always raised with us when firefighters come on 
their annual lobby is what we are dealing with today, the fact 
that the Income Tax Act recognizes the hazardous nature of the 
work by allowing early retirement at age 60 and even an optional 
window for early retirement at age 55.  This is in recognition of 
the hazardous nature of the work and the fact that there is wear 
and tear on the bodies of firefighters just by the nature of that 
work.  However, it fails to recognize something else.  A 
firefighter opting for early retirement at age 55 pays a penalty 
for every month prior to the age of 60 and is thus forced to 
retire with an often inadequate pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Firefighters seek to achieve by this motion a change in the 
Income Tax Act to allow for pension benefits to be accrued at a 
higher rate than that of the average worker.  When firefighters 
opt for early retirement they would do so at full pension.  We 
think this is a reasonable proposal, and I am glad to see that 
all parties in the House seem to agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should point out to the public that this is not an additional 
cost to the government.  There is no immediate cost associated 
with this recognition.  In fact, this would allow firefighters to 
sit down at the bargaining table with their employer and 
negotiate a higher premium contribution to their pension plan 
above and beyond the 2% allowed by law today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really is not a cost to the general public.  It is not a cost 
to the government.  It is not a cost to the taxpayer.  If at the 
bargaining table firefighters were able to achieve that increase 
in contribution rates from their employer, they then would enjoy 
a maximum of 2.33% pension accrual rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should notify the public that by the passage of this motion 
and the implementation of the recommendations of the motion we 
are not voting for a cost to the taxpayer.  We are not talking 
about any increased cost in CPP or any other tax relief for 
firefighters.  We are simply giving them the ability to negotiate 
a higher rate of contribution to their pension plans.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have many graphic examples of the unique nature of the day to 
day work and workplace of firefighters.  A recent and horrifying 
example is the Plastimet fire in Hamilton, Ontario. It often 
comes to mind as a graphic illustration of the inherent hazards 
associated with this job.  Given the number of fatal injuries 
from that fire and the many complications for the people working 
there, it would not be an exaggeration to say that Plastimet 
serves as the firefighter's Westray.  On a per capita basis it 
was as severe and as extreme and it deserves our immediate 
attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will give relief to one minor detail in terms of 
recognizing the special position that firefighters hold within 
our culture and communities, but it does not deal with many of 
the other issues often raised in this regard.  I do not believe 
any job in the country should be considered a dangerous 
occupation. We have it within our means to make all workplaces 
safer if we address ourselves to that issue.  No amount of 
compensation justifies a dangerous job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We used to face that in my trade.  They would give us danger pay 
for doing certain dangerous jobs.  I do not really want another 
dollar an hour for putting my life at risk.  I would rather we 
take that dollar an hour and put it toward research to make the 
job safer in the first place so that no one gets put into a 
dangerous situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Firefighters are unique in that when all other workers are 
running out of a burning building from a dangerous situation 
firefighters are running in.  There is no easy solution to making 
the workplace safer for firefighters.  There is more we can do 
with the co-operation of the union, their employers and 
government regulatory bodies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best we can do now for firefighters is to recognize the 
inherent danger of their workplace and to give them some 
satisfaction in terms of this issue and the other legitimate 
concerns they have brought before us, including the hazardous 
materials identification system for at least the rail system and 
the blood sample that was situation raised by other speakers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is with a great sense of pride that I rise today to speak to the 
motion put forward by the member for 
Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a previous life I had a substantial amount of experience 
working very closely with a municipal fire department.  I can 
assure the House that I have nothing but respect for the men and 
women who put forward their lives to look after our constituents 
in their duty as firefighters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to thank the member for Mississauga South who 
I know originally put forward this motion.  It is a very 
important issue, one that will deal with the notion of increasing 
the contribution to pensions from 2% to 2.33%. However, before we 
get into that, I think it is important to recognize as other 
speakers already have indicated that the profession of a 
firefighter is indeed unique among emergency services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Firefighting has changed quite dramatically over the past number 
of years.  This past weekend I had the opportunity to stand 
onstage for the 14th annual Manitoba firefighters conference.  At 
that conference two things happened.  First, there was a memorial 
at the emergency fire services college in Brandon in memory of 
the 38 firefighters in Manitoba who lost their lives over the 
last 100 years.  I mention that simply to indicate that the 
profession itself is a very dangerous one.  When a firefighter 
goes to work he or she does not know what will be encountered 
that day.  It could be a life threatening occurrence. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1155"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT12"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT12"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1155
<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing that happened at the conference was a skit 
comparing firefighting of 100 years ago with firefighting of 
today.  They used horse-drawn water brigades 100 years ago.  They 
fought fires using different technology and different training. 
Today both the system and the profession have changed quite 
dramatically.  We talked about the haz mats, the hazardous 
materials faced by firefighters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My firefighters wear a number of hats.  They are full-fledged 
paramedics who have to deal with ambulance calls and other 
situations either on the highway or in the community.  They have 
to deal with search and rescue.  They are responsible for search 
and rescue on our open waters and in other areas of Manitoba.  We 
have firefighters in northern Manitoba, where forests go up quite 
regularly.  The danger of fighting those fires is much more 
dramatic now than it was 100 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone in the House is aware that firefighting remains a very 
dangerous profession.  As compared with workers in the private 
sector, firefighters have twice the rate of job related 
fatalities.  I simply go back to the 38 firefighters recognized 
in that memorial.  More than 40% of all firefighters suffered job 
related injuries in 1997.  That far exceeds the rate of injury 
for any other occupation.  Firefighters are nearly six times more 
likely than the average private sector worker to suffer injuries 
on the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right to refuse unsafe work does not practically exist for 
our firefighters.  When people are running away from a burning 
building, firefighters are running in the opposite direction, 
directly into the inferno, to save property and to save lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention this because the profession is a unique profession. 
One of the other things I noticed when I was onstage at the 14th 
annual Manitoba fire conference was that through the fire college 
a number of very young, well trained and physically fit 
individuals in my community were prepared to go into the 
profession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very physically demanding job.  Because of the demands 
placed on the individual it is not a job that has longevity.  In 
the city of Brandon we decided a number of years ago that the 
retirement age of a firefighter should be 55. Unfortunately the 
pension contributions that can be made do not allow my 
firefighters to retire at 55 with their full pensions. We do have 
people to take over from the firefighters who wish to retire at 
55, but we have to make sure we can get those firefighters off 
the job and retired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to do that, with respect to the motion before us, the 
International Association of Fire Fighters advocates that the 
finance minister increase the pension accrual rates from 2% to 
2.33% for firefighters.  This would allow them to retire with 
adequate financial provisions for their retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a letter to the Minister of Finance dated December 15, 1999, 
the IAFF urged the federal government to revisit the current 
provisions for professional firefighters.  In the city of Brandon 
we have been prepared, through negotiations, to top up the 
retirement funds of firefighters to accommodate to a degree their 
request to retire at age 55.  A regulatory change to the Income 
Tax Act would provide all firefighters with the opportunity to 
collectively bargain for a fair and equitable pension on 
retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regulatory change to the Canada Income Tax Act that the IAFF 
is advocating would allow Canada's firefighters to retire before 
the rigours of the job pose a threat to both the individuals and 
their fellow firefighters.  The change would allow firefighters 
to make adequate pension contributions toward retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed regulatory change would be the crucial first step 
in this process, as firefighters would have to make the same 
change with their respective provincial pension legislation and 
then bargain the increased contribution with their employers.  It 
is a critical first step that the federal government put into 
place the necessary legislative changes. 
The Canadian Police Association also strongly supports the 
position of firefighters on this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year's report from the Standing Committee on Finance is 
clear in recommending an increase in the accrual rate from 2% to 
2.33%.  It has been almost a year since the report was tabled in 
the House.  I urge all members of the House of Commons to support 
the motion and members on the government side to actually take 
action.  The finance committee has already considered the motion. 
It is now time for the government to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a simple legislative change, as was mentioned earlier.  I 
thank the member for Mississauga South.  I also thank the member 
for Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey for bringing it to the 
attention of the House.  Now it is a matter of putting action in 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The firefighters that represent us in our communities deserve no 
less.  They put their lives on the line.  They wish to be able to 
retire at a younger age because of the difficulties and danger of 
the job.  It is incumbent upon us to make it available to them. 
We will be supporting the motion put forward by the member.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Limoges (Windsor—St. Clair, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the opportunity to address private member's Motion 
No. 418.  Yesterday I had the honour of attending a memorial 
service jointly carried out by padres of both the Detroit and 
Windsor fire departments wherein honour was brought to those who 
laid down their lives in the service of our community.  It has 
been said that there is no greater love than the love displayed 
by laying down one's life in the service of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specific provisions in the Income Tax Act are what we are 
talking about and the fact that firefighters are in a very 
different situation than most other people in our society.  Most 
are required to retire early due to contract provisions and the 
physically strenuous nature of their occupation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this year I was able to convene a meeting with senior 
members of the finance department, those people responsible for 
the calculations and for putting forth the provisions of the 
legislation once it is passed by the House, along with the 
executive of the firefighters association.  At that meeting, 
along with the member for Essex, we were able to discuss for 
several hours provisions of the pension plan and the firefighters 
request for the 2.33% integrated plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand there is scope within the existing pension tax 
rules for plans covering firefighters to increase pension plan 
benefits.  This was explained to members of the association along 
with me.  We understand that a number of firefighter pension 
plans provide a 2% pension benefit that is integrated with Canada 
pension benefits.  This means that these plans are not currently 
providing the maximum pension benefits permissible under the 
Income Tax Act.  However, due to the vagaries of collective 
bargaining, it would be very difficult for firefighters across 
the country to be able to negotiate the full benefit they seek. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that firefighters would like to be provided with a 
2.33% pension benefit that is integrated with CPP.  I understand 
that by maximizing the benefits under the current rules the plans 
could possibly provide an even larger pension benefit than could 
be obtained in the 2.33% integration, but as I said earlier it 
would be subject to unprecedented success in collective 
bargaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that firefighters provide a service to our community 
that is desperately needed and absolutely essential.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that firefighters provide a service to our 
communities that is desperately needed and absolutely essential. 
In my 14 years of experience in municipal council I had the 
opportunity of seeing firsthand what some firefighters were doing 
and the dedication they brought to their jobs.  We in Windsor are 
very proud of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Firefighters in Windsor were faced with a situation 15 years ago 
where there were very poor labour-management relations between 
the fire department and the city.  They now enjoy an absolutely 
positive attitude and marvellous relationship.  There can always 
be improvements, I suppose, but in talking to firefighters across 
the country it was brought to my attention that Windsor was a 
model others could only hope to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Firefighters are out in the community doing the job of public 
relations and of increasing safety awareness in children and 
families.  We are extremely proud that we have the type of 
relationship where everyone benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was explained to us yesterday during the memorial service 
that we do not take enough time to recognize and thank 
firefighters for the sacrifice they have made over the past 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion speaks to the need for further consultation and 
consideration of the issue.  It is paramount for firefighters and 
their families.  I urge members of the House to support the 
motion before us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK14"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the fact that we have a very short time and many 
members wish to speak to the motion, so I will keep my remarks to 
the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to the debate today but, more important, I have 
had an ongoing dialogue with the firefighters in my community of 
London, Ontario.  They do honourable work all hours of the day 
and night.  They do it with safety.  They do it with integrity. 
They do it with our interest at heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an obligation to listen to their concerns.  That is what 
many of my colleagues around the House on all sides and I have 
been doing.  I believe a valid point is made here.  I add my 
voice to the people supporting the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been lobbying the finance minister.  In short order we 
should be looking at the reality of bringing in a regulatory 
framework that would provide the needed change.  I will not 
restate the statistics.  We know them.  I will allow someone else 
to speak at this point. 
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak to the particular motion. I 
would like to make three specific points about it.  It deals with 
the rights of firefighters or the consideration of whether 
firefighters should have a different accrual rate to their 
pension plans.  They have to retire early because of health 
considerations, physical fitness considerations and other 
matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, in my opinion firefighters have one of the most effective 
and most grassroots inclusive lobbying groups on Parliament Hill. 
They do a great job of integrating both the parliamentary role of 
their associations and the grassroots back home.  They do it as 
well as any other group in the country.  I have told them that 
and I compliment them on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I would like to put a plug in for my private member's 
motion on the blood samples act.  It specifically targets 
firefighters and gives them protection against contamination from 
bodily fluids with which they may come in contact during the 
course of their duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, specifically the motion has to do with the accrual rate. 
It should be passed and sent to committee for consideration. 
Firefighters will have to work with other groups like the 
military, police officers and others that also face the same 
problem with the accrual rate.  I will leave it at that.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House work to provide the means needed to fight 
poverty and violence against women as demanded by the World 
March of Women, particularly in the areas of income protection, 
health, international aid, violence and wage parity, so as to 
ensure a fairer distribution of wealth between women and men. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to give you 
notice that the leader of the Bloc Quebecois will be sharing the 
time allotted him with our colleague from Longueuil.  All 
members of the Bloc Quebecois will proceed in the same fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, this motion comes at a rather 
particular juncture today, because the women are in Washington 
today.  They were there yesterday as well.  They marched in 
Ottawa as well, as they did in Montreal on Saturday, and in 
Quebec City on Friday and in all regions of Quebec and in all 
neighbourhoods of Montreal and in other regions in Canada.  In 
fact, pretty well around the world.  On Saturday, over 30,000 
women demonstrated in Brussels.  Tomorrow, all these women will 
be in New York. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois members are proud of the fact that this 
initiative originated in Quebec.  It was the Fédération des 
femmes du Québec and its president, Françoise David, who had the 
idea and linked up with women around the world in order to blend 
the demands they were making of their respective governments and 
of international organizations such as the International 
Monetary Fund. 
Tomorrow they will be meeting Secretary General Kofi Annan at 
the United Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people feel that the women's demands are nothing but 
wishful thinking and that, while we agree in theory, it is 
impossible in practice because we cannot afford it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois have checked whether indeed we had the 
funds and the means to respond to the women's demands.  Looking 
at the surplus in the hands of the Minister of Finance and the 
government—and it is important to say this today because we are 
apparently going to be having a mini-budget on Wednesday—it is up 
to $165.8 billion according to our figures.  Without taking the 
agreement with the provinces relating to the Canada social 
transfer into consideration, the figure comes to $147.9 billion 
instead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This represents a lot of money that can be used to meet the 
demands the women have made. 
This is not a debate about whether we have or do not have the 
means, it is a matter of whether we do or do not have the 
political desire to respond to the women's demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have taken great care in calculating the surplus.  For 
example, last year we stated that the figure would be $11.5 
billion while the Minister of Finance was announcing $3 billion, 
knowing as well as we did that it would be far more.  He did not 
want it known, in order to avoid a debate like the one we are 
having here today.  In the end, the figure was $12.3 billion. 
Looking at the Minister of Finance's five year forecasts, I see 
the figure is in the order of $160.8 billion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking the agreement out of the equation, as I said earlier, the 
figure comes to $142 billion and a bit, which is about $5 
billion off the figure we had predicted.  This opinion is shared 
by some of the leading economists as well.  Last week, in a 
debate at the Conseil du Patronat, the same figure was reached 
with the same evaluations.  It seems likely that this is what 
the Minister of Finance will be telling us on Wednesday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, however, it is my impression that he will not 
reach the same conclusions as we on how to use these surplus 
funds. 
Women are asking, among other things, for a review of the whole 
employment insurance issue. If the federal government is 
currently enjoying surpluses, it is because it created them at 
the expense of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the case with the Canada social transfer. The federal 
government finally recognized that it had taken money from the 
provinces, but even more so from the employment insurance fund, 
where it took more than $30 billion from the poor and also from 
businesses. The result is that the employment insurance program 
has become a tax on employment, with over 60% of contributors 
being penalized, since they contribute but do not qualify for 
benefits once they are out of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes announced by the government regarding employment 
insurance have only a very marginal and temporary impact on 
seasonal workers. Does the government realize that over two 
thirds of women who contribute to the program do not qualify for 
benefits? This is blatant injustice and must be corrected. This 
is why the Bloc Quebecois is saying that the government must 
reinvest $25 billion in the employment insurance program, over a 
five year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards transfer payments for health, post-secondary education 
and income support, women are asking the government to invest, 
to take into account the fact that there are enormous needs in 
the health sector, that the provinces must provide services 
without having enough money, while the federal government does 
not have to provide such services, at least not much, but has 
the money to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government announced $17.9 billion over five 
years.  We believe that this amount must be indexed on the basis 
of the cost as it was in 1994, which would mean an additional 
$10 billion, and that the federal government must put $27 billion 
into the social transfer because it affects the health of 
families, and of men and women in an aging population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of an aging population, one of the important demands being 
made by women—I will not go over all the demands because my 
colleagues will be doing so in the course of the day—has to do 
with old age security so that older women do not have to live in 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forty-two per cent of single women over 65 in Canada are living 
in poverty because many of them did not work outside the home; 
they worked in the home and this is work that is unpaid.  Not 
that they worked any less, but they do not have a pension plan. 
These women are living under the poverty line.  We must invest 
$3 billion to ensure that those who raised children, who raised 
our families, who helped build the future, are not abandoned to 
unacceptable and appalling conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite what some say, when all these demands from women are 
factored in, there is certainly enough both for paying down the 
debt by $21 billion over five years and for tax cuts.  We know 
the Minister of Finance will be announcing $58 billion in 
tax cuts with his plan to lower the capital gains tax from 66% 
to 50%, but the rate of taxation on employment income is 100% 
and low and middle income Canadians will not benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is needed are tax cuts and that is something that we can 
aim for, all the while balancing the budget and holding the line 
on the deficit. We do not want to go back to a deficit 
situation. In my view $73.8 billion could be set aside for this. 
This is in no way incompatible with the duty—and I do 
consider it a duty—to invest in the social, economic, education 
and health fields.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the $73.8 billion allocated to the middle class is 
concerned, they are the ones who have borne the brunt of the 
deficit reduction, because they do not have enough money to take 
advantage of the wonderful tax loopholes that companies like 
Canada Steamship Lines can because it earns so much that it pays 
no taxes.  The middle class has borne the brunt of it and must 
get some help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I speak of the middle class, I mean the many single mothers 
who cannot make ends meet because they have to pay income tax 
while the rich companies do not.  This is social inequality and 
it is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a family of four, two adults and two children, pays 
no income tax in Quebec if their total income is less than 
$30,000.  On the federal level that same family starts paying 
tax at the $14,700 level.  In most cases, women and children are 
the ones who suffer.  Often women are raising children on their 
own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we must make an effort to respond to women's 
demands, while at the same time not neglecting to cut taxes for 
the low and middle income groups.  We can afford to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close on that point.  It is not a matter of wishful 
thinking.  This will be addressed in the election campaign.  I 
do hope the government will settle this for us this week.  The 
opposition would lose a point of argument but women would gain. 
I feel that is more important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government does not settle this we will not hold our 
tongues.  What is more, as Ms. David has said, women are 
determined to follow the candidates in this election and to let 
them know that there is a sizeable surplus, that there are 
priorities to be respected and that the wealthy friends of the 
party in power and the companies are not the only ones that 
vote. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
leader of the Bloc Quebecois for speaking on this important 
issue of women's situations and quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like our leader to raise an issue of considerable 
urgency, that of public housing.  I would like him to explain 
the dynamics of public housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993, the federal government has provided insufficient 
funding.  Everyone knows that women, single parents and families 
living under the poverty line are having a hard time making ends 
meet and obtaining appropriate housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, this is a Bloc Quebecois fight, and I would ask our 
leader to put this pressing matter to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, over the past few years, 
negotiations have been taking place between the federal and 
Quebec governments regarding social housing. The federal 
government said it was withdrawing from social housing, but it 
has not given back the money that it has collected in taxes for 
social housing. It has not lowered taxes accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is quite prepared to sign an agreement and to take over 
that responsibility provided it has the means to fulfil its 
obligations. The Quebec government estimates that the province's 
needs for social housing account for 27% of Canada's overall 
needs, this with 24% of the country's population. However, 
Ottawa is only offering 18% of the money, which means there is a 
significant gap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must absolutely invest in that area because way too much 
money is being paid in rent by people. 
Some families spend up to 50% of their income on rent, while 
they should normally not allocate more than 25% of their income 
to that item. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT18"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT18"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1225

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the agreement with Quebec, this represents an amount of 
$400 million. This means that for the whole country the 
government should invest $1.5 billion. Based on our budget 
forecasts, we are anticipating new spending of $18.5 billion, 
without any deficit. As for the government, it is anticipating 
at this point that new spending will total $10.9 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amount of $1.5 billion could easily be allocated to social 
housing if, again, there was a political will to do so. I know 
that women organizations estimate the amount to be $2 billion 
over a five year period. At yesterday's meeting we agreed that 
our economists, both theirs and ours, would meet to determine 
whether it is $1.5 billion or $2 billion. It will then be a matter 
of reorganizing other requests, but there is enough flexibility 
with an amount of $147.9 billion to settle this urgent problem. I 
fully agree with the hon. member for Québec that we must take 
action regarding this issue. Again, this is something that could 
be corrected in the mini-budget if this government would listen 
to ordinary people, to the men and women who pay taxes in our 
society but who are not getting the services to which they are 
entitled. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today on this opposition day motion to support 
women on the occasion of the World March of Women. Allow me to 
read the motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House work to provide the means needed to fight 
poverty and violence against women as demanded by the World 
March of Women, particularly in the areas of income protection, 
health, international aid, violence and wage parity, so as to 
ensure a fairer distribution of wealth between women and men. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is quite clear, in my opinion. We all know the 
government can afford it and that its coffers are full. 
The government has the means to give women a positive answer. It 
has accumulated indecent surpluses while thousands of women live 
below the poverty line. Worse, the government rakes in the 
taxpayers' money while the provinces are the ones who provide 
front line services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this renewed federalism? The money is all kept in Ottawa. The 
government pockets all the money it can and just before an 
election it scatters a little here and there. No thank you. It 
is time for things to change. Women want a change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As status of women critic for the Bloc Quebecois, I have a wish. 
I would like to see justice and fairness for all women. But 
today, Mr. Speaker, it is as a woman that I speak to you. 
There are still too few women in the House. I sincerely feel 
that during last week a great number of us have been walking 
through the streets of Quebec and the rest of the world to put 
forward our claims. I believe that week has left its mark on us 
all, women and men, on various levels. However, I am convinced 
that we will emerge from it transformed. Let us hope that, as 
they did not walk, members opposite listened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with sadness that I must point out that, although we are 
in the year 2000, we still live in a patriarchal society. Much 
remains to be done so that women and men are equal and treated 
fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, in the very best country in the world, what kind of 
record can the Liberal government show with regard to fair 
treatment? The government took more than 15 years to show respect 
to its own employees in the area of pay equity. We also know that 
it is the only government left in Canada without proactive 
legislation in that regard. This means female workers under 
federal jurisdiction have to lodge individual complaints of 
discrimination if they want to get pay equity. Such is the 
shining record of the federal government with regard to pay 
equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even worse, the federal government refuses to extend the 
settlement to female employees of crown corporations and agencies 
who work under the same job classification system. It seems to 
me, from a strictly logical point of view, that if the court has 
ruled that the practices the treasury board used in the federal 
public service were discriminatory, these very same practices 
should not be tolerated in crown corporations and agencies. But 
no, the treasury board is still refusing to act. 
This is the kind of respect the government has for its own 
employees. Frankly, it seems so difficult for the government to 
get some money out when it is for women, while it seems to be so 
easy when it is for its friends.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Just for the information of hon. members and people who are 
watching us at home, here are the government's priorities: 
$45 million for Canadian unity; $90 million for the Canada 
Information Office; $200 million for propaganda; $15 million for 
the one million flags operation. This is where the priorities of 
this government are. This is a lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is precisely the kind of mean-spirited behaviour that leads 
women to fight against poverty. 
This is one of the 2,000 good reasons for marching. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind hon. members today where this wonderful 
idea of the world march came from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the march “Du pain et des roses” in Quebec was a great 
success. More than 850 women marched for 10 days to make several 
economic claims. That march led women from all over the world to 
aim for higher goals and to build world solidarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year, in October 2000, the Fédération des femmes du Québec 
struck again by organizing the World March of Women, which 
brought together 4,200 groups from 157 countries and 
territories. In each of Quebec's regions, thousands of women 
joined the march. I did also and I know my colleague from 
Charlevoix and most of my colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois 
did. I must admit this march was moving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back home in Longueuil on a bright Friday morning 400 women 
marched. Standing together they were so beautiful that for a 
moment I thought they were signalling that the time had come for 
a change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we all know that the purpose of the World March of 
Women is to end poverty and violence against women. This is a 
peaceful movement toward hope, equality, peace and democracy. 
This is a movement toward recognition of the rights of all women 
throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The World March of Women underlines two main demands. The first 
one is the elimination of poverty and the fair sharing of the 
world's wealth between the rich and the poor, between men and 
women. The second one is the elimination of violence against 
women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The status of women is a key issue for the Bloc Quebecois. This 
is why our party proposed various concrete measures over the 
years, beginning within the party itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the last general convention of the Bloc Quebecois, the party 
faithful supported the demands of the World March of Women. At 
their last general meeting, they renewed their support toward the 
demands of the World March of Women and invited party members to 
participate in the campaign promoting the signing of support 
cards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bloc Quebecois members also worked in parliament, at the 
Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, and asked that women's 
demands be examined on a priority basis, as early as this fall, 
so that women could have a political and parliamentary forum to 
voice their concerns and their demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also relentlessly urged the federal government to treat 
young people and women fairly within its employment insurance 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the 10th anniversary of the tragic massacre at the École 
Polytechnique, the leader of the Bloc Quebecois asked the 
federal government to launch a public awareness campaign against 
violence. We are still waiting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois also wanted to hear what the people had to 
say. We travelled throughout Quebec to criticize the government 
for its lack of investment in the fight against poverty. We have 
also made a solemn commitment to the public to demand that the 
federal government make the fight against poverty one of its 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As in 1985, the Bloc Quebecois is getting involved and takes 
part in this great show of solidarity. 
Whether it is to inform, to raise awareness or to mobilize 
public opinion, the Bloc Quebecois wants above all to ensure 
that the federal government does everything it can to eliminate 
poverty and violence against women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is getting involved because we believe that 
the time for change is now. The Bloc Quebecois is getting 
involved because 70% of the poor on this planet are women and 
because 1 out of 5 women in Canada is poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are getting involved because 51% of women in Canada have been 
victims since their 16th birthday of at least one physical or 
sexual assault as defined in the criminal code. In Canada, women 
are still afraid to walk alone at night. In Canada, every week, 
one women is killed by her spouse or former spouse.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Violence can be physical, sexual, verbal or psychological.  What 
is clear is that violence is a reality for all women.  That is 
why we earnestly hope the federal government will create a 
$50 million fund to fight violence against women, and that it 
will give the provinces the means to act in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another request the Bloc Quebecois made here in the House 
concerns basic funding for women's organizations.  Since the 
beginning of our mandate, we, members of the Bloc, have been 
requesting that the federal government earmark $30 million.  This 
represents two dollars for each woman and young girl in the 
country.  The funding for women's groups has been reduced by 15% 
under the liberals, and it has also been reviewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that the World March of Women will be one of the 
milestones of the new millennium.  Let us hope that the federal 
government will finally act and take all necessary measures to 
eliminate poverty and violence against women. In this year 2000 
some tangible changes are required; women have the right to 
equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois believes that society is made up of men and 
women and that it is through their complicity and solidarity 
that they will finally achieve an egalitarian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I conclude, I would like to table an amendment to this 
motion.  I move: 
<A NAME="LINK25">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by adding after the words “That 
this House” the following: “immediately”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The amendment is admissible 
and the debate is now on the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague from Longueuil for her excellent speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What struck me in the demands put forward by women's groups is 
something that could now become an issue during the election, 
that is, the core funding of organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the government took office it has backed away from a 
commitment toward the women's groups that fight daily for the 
most deprived of women as well as for all the women of Quebec and 
Canada, groups that defend women's rights and speak out against 
poverty and violence against women and children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague to speak in greater detail of how the 
government has backed away from this commitment since it took 
office. I would like her to tell us what solution the Bloc 
Quebecois is proposing so that these women's groups can work 
without having to set up projects and that the money needed for 
the fight against poverty and violence is made available. 
This is a minimum. I would also like my colleague to tell us in 
detail about this core funding problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire: </B>Mr. Speaker, before answering the 
question asked by the hon. member for Drummond, I would like to 
underline the work she is doing as a woman and a 
parliamentarian. I know she is appreciated by everyone in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More precisely, to answer her question, funding of women's 
groups has been cut by 15% by the Liberals. It has also been 
reviewed, and it is another scandal. From now on, funding will 
be made on a project by project basis and not on the basis of 
the budget required.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, these groups need basic funding. They also need 
recognition and support, and we are still waiting for the 
government to do just that. What we members of the Bloc 
Quebecois are proposing is basically the same thing as what 
women are asking in their world march, that is $2 per woman and 
little girl or roughly $30 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Minister of Finance, that is not economically 
viable, but he should be reminded that if we want real 
democracy we must give a real voice to everyone, especially the 
most vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government will intervene and give money to 
women who are on the front lines and who are the first to offer 
their help to our women in Quebec and Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) (Status of 
Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity 
to respond to the motion put forward by the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois regarding the World March of Women, an event that our 
government welcomes heartily. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The march is bringing together over 5,000 groups in 157 
countries around the globe to tell governments and international 
institutions, such as the World Bank, the IMF and the United 
Nations, that we need to do a great deal more to end poverty 
among women. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to congratulate every group in our country that has 
played a major role in organizing this march, particularly the 
Fédération des femmes du Québec, which played a leading role in 
making this march a reality. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada shares the goals of the World March of 
Women 2000 and has been doing what it can to help make it a 
success.  For example, on Wednesday the Canadian ambassador to 
the United Nations will host a meeting at the conclusion of the 
march to allow the women to present their resolutions to the 
secretary general of the United Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also very proud of the fact that the federal government has 
been able to contribute $700,000 to the international march and 
$200,000 to the national march, for a total of $900,000, in 
support of women speaking out on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we support women is that in spite of the fact that we 
talk about tax cuts, flat taxes and debt reduction, there are 
still people in this country who live in poverty, and most tend 
to be women.  We still have violence, which tends to be directed 
mostly at women.  We believe NGOs and volunteer organizations 
play an important role in bringing this to the attention not only 
of the public but of governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to continue to ensure that governments in Canada and 
around the world focus on the issues of the march that these 
women are bringing to the fore.  Our government agrees with the 
issues.  We know there is more to be done both on the domestic 
front and on the international front, but we need to do this in a 
consistent and co-ordinated way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that this is an area in which we can work more 
closely with women and other equality seeking organizations to 
see that those goals are met in a way that will ensure that the 
day to day realities of women and their families are addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the Prime Minister met with representatives from the 
women's march.  This is the first time in 15 years that a prime 
minister has met with women's organizations and spent almost an 
hour listening very clearly to the issues that were brought to 
his attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meetings between representatives of the march and some of my 
cabinet colleagues will be taking place within the next few days 
to discuss the very specific issues that the women are bringing 
forward and some of the very specific solutions that they are 
bringing forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We fully support the approach taken by march organizers to 
initiate a constructive dialogue to get the priorities and the 
design right as we build for the future.  In the last federal 
budget the government committed an additional $20.5 million over 
five years to Status of Women Canada to develop and establish an 
agenda for gender equality.  This agenda will expand on the 1995 
federal plan for gender equality so that we can further advance 
the goal of gender equality in the 21st century. That means we 
will continue to develop gender based analysis which will take in 
the realities between men and women and how policies and 
legislation affect them.  We will work horizontally to ensure 
that every single department does gender based analysis on every 
single piece of legislation and policy that it brings forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left>All governments have a responsibility to take a lead in bringing 
about changes that affect the lives of women everywhere.  This 
government believes that it is important for women to play their 
role to the fullest in the economic, social and political life of 
the country.   We want to give them the tools they need to be 
able to do that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, 88% of domestic violence victims in Canada were women. 
A majority of the persons killed in a situation of domestic 
violence are women. It is sad to realize that violence remains 
largely unreported. This is mainly because women are too afraid 
to seek support from the outside or because they feel 
intimidated. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Action has already been taken in these areas.  These are the 
building blocks.  The actions the government has taken to date on 
violence against women are the building blocks upon which we hope 
to advance women's equality and to decrease violence against 
women, each year addressing those in accordance with the plan 
that we are going to develop with women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the shelter enhancement program, we have committed $43 
million to build and improve shelters for women, children and 
youth who are victims of family violence.  Because we want to get 
at the root causes of family violence, we recently added $7 
million to an already over $40 million initiative supported by 
seven departments in the government to deal with the family 
violence initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice has also put $32.5 million toward a 
crime prevention strategy, $32.5 million over five years.  One of 
the core pieces in that puzzle, on which she is working with 
community groups, is to specifically address the issue of 
violence against women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the last meeting in August in Iqaluit, our Minister of 
Justice brought to the table, to the other justice ministers, a 
project to deal with advancing and improving legislation on peace 
bonds and against those who commit violence against women.  That 
result will come up by the end of this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that to strengthen our response to the tragic reality of 
domestic violence, jurisdictions have to work together.  We have 
to work with women to make this so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an extremely important piece of the strategy in 
defeating and dealing with violence against women.  We know that 
88% of the people killed in domestic violence are women and about 
75% of them are shot.  We know that the gun control legislation 
brought out in 1996 is an absolutely key piece in decreasing the 
shooting of women, especially when we know they are shot with 
guns that happen to be in the house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Spousal violence is a key factor underlying homelessness. Single 
women and families headed by women account for an increasing 
proportion of the homeless population.  The government is taking 
action to address this problem.  The 2000 budget confirmed a $735 
million strategy to combat homelessness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A piece of that strategy is specific work with women's 
organizations, because we know that many women who are homeless 
are homeless because they are running away.  They are the 
invisible homeless.  They do not want to be found because they 
are running away from violent spouses and partners and they know 
that if they are found someone will take their children away from 
them.  These women tend to move from place to place. 
Confidentiality is a key component.  We are working specifically 
with women's organizations to address that confidentiality 
component. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that a key component of homelessness is not only 
violence but women's inequality.  The face of poverty in Canada 
and around the world is female.  More than two-thirds of the 
world's population lives on as little as one American dollar a 
day.  Poverty is still a reality in Canada.  We accept that this 
is truth.  In 1997, 13% of all Canadian children under the age of 
18 lived in low income families headed by a single female parent. 
This figure represents 40% of all low income families.  In 1998 
60% of homeless runaway children aged 12 to 17 were female. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actions that the government has taken are the building blocks. I 
want to stress that we are not going to do everything in one 
year.  We are beginning with strong building blocks.  The actions 
we have taken are building blocks upon which we will continue to 
build, working closely with NGOs and women's organizations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Significant resources have been committed to assisting poor 
families with children.  We know there is an additional $2.5 
billion a year for the Canada child tax benefit, which brings the 
annual investment of new money by the federal government to more 
than $9 billion, to address the issue of low income and poor 
families, which we know are mostly headed by women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the early childhood development agreement which, under 
the recently signed action plan for health, provides another $2.2 
billion to help ensure that all Canadian children get the best 
possible start in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made changes to the employment insurance program to 
extend maternity and parental leave from six months to a year to 
allow new mothers to spend more time with their newborn or newly 
adopted children.  We know that one of the chief stresses on 
women today is balancing the paid work they do with their family 
responsibilities, because women still bear the disproportionate 
burden of caregiving in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that further changes to EI, announced recently, will 
ensure that parents who leave the workforce to remain at home 
with young children will not be penalized the next time they find 
it necessary to apply for EI benefits.  This is a positive step 
for women's equality since most of the parents who do remain at 
home with their children are women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has also introduced several programs to assist 
aboriginal women whom we know suffer disproportionate 
discrimination and multiple barriers that prevent them from 
having access to some of the things that other Canadians take for 
granted.  We are investing $22.5 million annually, plus an 
additional $100 million over four years on the aboriginal head 
start program for children living on and off reserves.  We have 
created or improved 7,000 quality child care spaces under the 
Inuit and first nations child care program because that is a 
federal jurisdiction.  We know that in many other areas in the 
provinces child care is a provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The future in Canada can belong to women but they need an 
education to get them there.  Enhanced support for students by 
increasing the amount of tax free income from bursaries, 
fellowships and scholarships, such as the $2 billion Canadian 
millennium fund, will help women.  It is direct assistance that 
the federal government is moving to this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard questions asked about money from HRDC.  That has 
been specifically used to forgive loans, especially for people 
who cannot afford to pay them, and we know that those persons 
tend to be women with dependants, women who are trying to get an 
education so that they can have a better chance of supporting 
their children with pride and dignity.  The Canada studies grants 
for high need, post-secondary students with dependants, students 
with disabilities, high need, part time students and women 
pursuing doctoral studies is a grant program, not a loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been talking about actions we have taken for Canadian 
women but Canada has also taken a leadership role internationally 
in promoting gender equality and the diversity of women in a 
number of international fora such as the Francophonie, the United 
Nations, the Commonwealth and the Asia-Pacific because Canada has 
written the book on gender based analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to move forward and ensure that the steps we take will 
actually benefit women, we have to know the figures on the status 
of women at the moment.  We have to be able to set clear 
strategies within each department so that looking at women's 
needs will not be only a ghettoized place in Status of Women 
Canada but so that at the end of the day we will be able to 
evaluate the strategies and see what worked, what did not work 
and what we need to do better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to reach out to women as we do on our research 
policy, where many grassroots women's organizations in 
partnership with academia work on particular grants and 
particular research projects that help us to understand what are 
the next steps we need to take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of international assistance for the women of the world, 
let us not forget that Canada is part of 155 countries that are 
marching around the world.  We have set aside an additional $435 
million for the international assistance envelope over the next 
three years.  We have undertaken a $2.8 billion five year plan to 
strengthen social development in developing countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that Canada is one of the few countries to call for an 
immediate moratorium on debt repayment for the world's heavily 
indebted nations.  In fact Canada, has done that. 
We have forgiven the debt to the heavily indebted nations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Prime Minister was in Okinawa recently and talked to 
the G-8, he talked about having every country raise the amount of 
foreign aid it gives and dedicating it especially to housing, to 
drinking water, to health issues and to literacy for the women of 
the world.   As members know, my colleague, the minister 
responsible for international development, has recently doubled 
the percentage of money in her budget that she has been spending 
to specifically target those areas in which women around the 
world need more help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can assist women around the world not only with talk, with 
rhetoric, with gender based analysis and with instruments of 
government, but also by putting money into the areas where we 
know women need help:  to be able to read and write, to be able 
to know that their children will not die because the water they 
drink is unsafe, to know that they have shelter and housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our priorities as a government over the past few years reflect 
our commitment to a focus on areas where outcomes will improve 
the quality of life for women.  Federal initiatives are helping 
to combat violence against women and to reduce poverty in Canada 
and around the world.  We know we cannot achieve the ultimate 
goals where women are absolutely equal, where they fear violence 
no more and where they are no longer among the poorest in the 
world, in isolation.  We know that we have to do this in 
partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Prime Minister met with the women on the march. 
That is why we have supported the march financially, with a large 
and substantive amount.  We believe that organizations and NGOs 
have a real role to play in moving the agenda forward, especially 
when we see political parties talking simply and only about taxes 
and debt and not even considering and understanding the needs of 
poor women.  We have heard members across the House talk about 
how changes to EI will help women to be on greater welfare.  The 
reality of women's lives does not factor in with our colleagues 
in the Alliance who do not seem to understand anything about the 
lives of real women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also think it is extremely important that women move into the 
political process where they can help make those kinds of 
decisions.  We know that by having a lot of women in our caucus 
who consider this issue every single week we have managed to push 
an agenda toward looking at gender equality in all the areas we 
talked about.  Having women in political positions helps to move 
that agenda forward in a balanced way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Prime Minister has done everything that he can to move women 
forward.  We have the first female head of the Supreme Court 
Justices of Canada.  We now have 31% women in the Senate, where 
the Prime Minister has been appointing women two to one.  He has 
taken initiatives to name women in winnable ridings because we 
know that the nomination process has been difficult for women. It 
is because of this that we have the kind of government we have, 
one that has been paying attention to the issues of women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government understands that achieving gender equality not 
only enhances the economic, social and political participation of 
women, it benefits their families, their children and society as 
a whole.  We have always recognized that economic and social 
progress go hand in hand.  This is a government that knows this. 
This is something we are committed to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot have strong social programs without a strong economy 
and we cannot have a strong economy without the social supports 
that allow every individual to contribute to society and to have 
some kind of economic autonomy.  This is a balanced approach. 
This is the approach of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the dignity of all individuals is enhanced when 
everyone is treated fairly and equally.  I want to stress that 
equality does not mean sameness.  Equality means recognizing that 
different people and groups in society have different barriers to 
face, and we must have different strategies to address each one 
of those issues. That is something that I think our friends in 
the Alliance might be able to learn from us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We continue to realize that diversity in the policies, plans and 
programs we put forward is completely important.  To reach our 
goal we must work together in partnership.  We must listen to 
non-government organizations and not treat them like special 
interest groups, as I know certain members across the way have 
been wont to describe women's organizations in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that every member of the House will agree with me that we 
must ensure as we move into the 21st century that no woman or 
girl is left behind as we move into this new millennium.

<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
closely to the remarks of the Secretary of State for the Status 
of Women, who is part of this government. We know that women feel 
concerned by the women's march and all the demands made by this 
great mobilization that started in Quebec and has spread to the 
whole world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I doubt that the government is committed, and I urge the 
Secretary of State for the Status of Women to keep a watchful eye 
over the issues of real concern to women. I know she is very 
sensitive to all women's issues, but I am not convinced her 
government has made or will be able to make all the efforts 
wished for by various women's group in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Bloc Quebecois has put forward a $45 billion 
strategy over the next five years for a real investment after 
what I would call seven years of social deficit incurred by the 
Liberal government as far as caring for citizens, for women and 
children, for the most destitute in our society, and for men too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have demands to pass on to the government. I am sorry, but 
this debate today concerns mainly women. The Bloc Quebecois had 
the opportunity to meet some community agencies, which have to 
face tremendous challenges to promote fairness and balance in our 
society. What they are asking for is the reinstatement of core 
funding for community agencies. 
It is a well known fact that community organizations had to pick 
up the pieces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Secretary of State for the Status of Women talked about 
parental insurance. It is one thing to extend the period during 
which women can stay home with their children but how could they 
take advantage of the new insurance program if they are excluded 
from EI? I wonder if the minister could make specific requests to 
the government regarding the day care system, the financing of 
community help organizations, funds to combat violence and 
funding for social housing, where the government has disinvested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993, there has been no new money to answer the needs of 
the population. I think that we are far from meeting the main 
objectives of the World March of Women in response to the great 
debate on the societal issue of poverty which affects women, 
children and men. I would ask the secretary of state to be more 
specific. It is not the first time that a Prime Minister meets 
with women's organizations, but it is the first time for the 
present Prime Minister. It is a bit sad to see that he waited six 
years after coming to power to finally sit down with women's 
groups. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to let the hon. member 
know that it was not $25 million.  We have contributed $20.5 
million over five years only to Status of Women Canada.  We have 
also increased the money given to women over the last few years. 
We brought it up to more than $40 million by adding another $7 
million to be able to deal with violence against women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just talked about the money put into homelessness, much 
of which will be discussed with NG organizations.  There will be 
discussions about their ability to find ways to deal with 
homelessness, transition homes and shelters in a confidential 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of the $32.5 million per year for crime prevention will be 
dedicated to working with grassroots groups to look at prevention 
of violence against women.  We are not just talking about the 
Status of Women Canada looking after women's issues but about how 
every department addresses women's equality.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are still committed to working with non-governmental 
organizations, as we said in the throne speech.  We have an ad 
hoc group of ministers currently looking at how we work with NGOs 
and volunteer organizations.  We are discussing with them how to 
improve their capacity.  We are working with them before we even 
begin to develop public policy.  They are at the table with us to 
develop that public policy so that it is implementable and 
effective. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the minister two questions that 
I think should demand fairly straightforward answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She mentioned in response that $20.5 million over five years 
went to Status of Women Canada.  How much government funding from 
her department went to the group REAL Women? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She also mentioned that the Prime Minister met yesterday with 
some of the representatives of the women's group.  Why it is 
being reported today, then, that the leaders of NACSOW have said 
that seemed to be a complete waste of time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not have the exact 
figures, but I think over the last nine years we have funded REAL 
Women in projects it has brought to the table.  It has in fact 
been doing very good work in dealing with the issue of unpaid 
work, something at which the government has been looking, the 
caregiving work women do for which they get no reimbursement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have funded REAL Women but we did not fund that group this 
year because it did not come forward with a project worth 
funding.  We have not funded many other groups when their 
projects did not meet the criteria for funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister met with women because he is very supportive 
of the attention the World March and the women's march in this 
country is bringing to issues that he has consistently had to 
defend in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of her party only talk about tax breaks and the wealth 
of individuals.  The Prime Minister is on record as saying we 
have to deal with the issue of disadvantaged persons.  That is 
the kind of balanced approach we are taking.  That is why the 
Prime Minister met with them.  The Prime Minister told them that 
he does not micromanage and that in their meetings with members 
of his cabinet that will take place over the next two days they 
will discuss the very specific issues in their 13 requests. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, listening to the minister responsible for the status of 
women reminds me of an old expression “one step forward and two 
steps backward”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to say how hopeful women were 20-25 years ago at 
the height of the women's movement.  We were moving toward pay 
equity, dealing with violence against women, addressing the need 
for pensions and dealing with poverty.  The list went on and on. 
Yet here we are today with thousands of women coming to Ottawa 
appealing to the government on the most basic demand, the most 
basic questions pertaining to economic and social security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today women are under stress more than ever before as they try 
to juggle work and family responsibilities.  Women are finding it 
more and more difficult to meet all the demands on their time and 
to provide for themselves and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My questions are threefold.  The minister talks about the Prime 
Minister meeting with the organizers of the women's march.  Is it 
better for the Prime Minister to meet and patronize women with 
words and spurn their concerns, or is it better not to meet at 
all? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, when it comes to the rhetoric of the minister around 
gender based analysis, why do we never see that translated into 
actual policies and programs?  I can testify to the fact that 
when it comes to applying those words, as we had an opportunity 
to do in the health committee, it is Liberal members who stand 
and refuse to apply gender based analysis, refuse to even ensure 
parity on the governing councils for such basic areas as 
scientific and medical research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the most basic of matters where women are truly struggling, 
why does the government stand in the way each and every time? 
Whether we are talking about providing for national child care, 
national home care, national drug coverage or national housing 
programs, these issues really matter to women in terms of making 
a difference the government has done nothing.  It has actually 
backpedalled and made the situation worse.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government reverse the agenda of privatization and 
deregulation and start to work in the best interest of women to 
ensure we finally achieve equality in this millennium? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member must not 
confuse rhetoric with fact.  The issue of what gender based 
analysis has done is pretty clear.  The changes in EI announced 
recently by the minister of HRDC show that gender based analysis 
has played a part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the changes in the CPP, the government pushed very 
hard to ensure that the dropout provisions would be there for 
women so that they could drop in and out and not lose their 
pensionable earnings.  The survivor benefits in the CPP are part 
of it.  We talked about health.  The whole new gender institute 
in CIHR is a huge piece.  When the government came into power in 
1993 it established five centres of excellence for women's health 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on about the initiatives taken when gender 
based analysis showed us the way to go.  What the hon. member 
does not understand is that gender based analysis is about 
helping each department.  She should look at each department and 
the changes that have been made, many of them in the budget when 
the Minister of Finance put forward a tax credit for women who 
are caregivers.  That was a start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Students with dependants was another start.  Persons with 
dependants getting grants was a start.  It all shows that we 
understand that women with dependants have a need for education 
and other issues.  I could go on but I do not have the time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the debate today as well.  I 
noticed that my colleague talked about the fact that we have been 
trying very hard for 20 or 25 years, I think was the number she 
used, to advance some of the problems we have seen today.  I 
would like to put on record that a full 35 years ago in the 
mid-sixties, my mother Joyce was a single parent.  It was fairly 
rare back then, certainly in Vancouver in the sixties.  I can 
remember being I think the only family in our school that had 
divorced parents.  It is not that many years down the road and it 
seems almost strange if a student has two parents at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government money is going into looking at these problems.  They 
are endemic in society, but is just throwing money at them the 
ultimate solution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister just took a shot across, saying that my party and I 
are only concerned about taxes and debt, that we do not 
understand the lives of real women out there.  I have news for 
her.  I know all too well on a personal basis the pain involved 
in growing up in a single parent family in Vancouver, very close 
to where she lives right now.  I have been very blessed by that. 
I would have given anything if my mom had been able to be a 
doctor or a professional person to raise her kids.  She had no 
trade.  She went out, got a job in a lamp store and raised five 
children single-handedly.  I take my hat off to her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are thousands and probably millions of people out there in 
the very same position, but surely these things have been going 
on not just for 25 years but for 35 years.  For the money the 
minister says she is putting in to rectify these problems, surely 
something else is missing in this equation.  It is not just money 
for this group or money for that group, but something is wrong if 
the basic building block of the family is not a concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We put forward a tax friendly policy toward families because we 
truly think that families are discriminated against if, for 
instance, one parent chooses to stay home and raise the kids. 
That does not mean I advocate that one parent out of every family 
should stay home, but surely they should be given that choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister knows that under tax policy one needs a receipt for 
third party day care.  What is the problem?  If someone chooses 
to have one parent stay at home, why can that not be treated as 
some sort of tax break?  We have been around the block on that. I 
know that the junior minister of finance got backed right into a 
corner some months ago about this very issue because it is 
indefensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If she says that all I do is rant about taxes, that is one way 
they could solve a whole lot of problems in a big hurry. 
Many of these things we are looking at and talking about today, 
and which the March of Women, address the whole idea of violence 
against women.  However, there is violence against everyone in 
our society.  Everyone of us here should abhor that.  Surely we 
could make changes in the justice system.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at the youth justice bill for instance.  The justice 
minister was sworn in I believe on August 3, 1997, but I am not 
sure of the exact date.  She said the youth justice bill was 
going to be her number one concern.  It is now October 2000 and I 
am terrified to think what concerns seven, eight and nine are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth justice bill deals with women but it also deals with 
all kinds of problems.  It deals with young men and women being 
perpetrators of crime and young men and women, older people and 
children being the victims of those crimes.  What happened? She 
blamed the separatists and said they were holding it up in the 
House of Commons.  This is a majority government.  If something 
is as important as making sure that our justice system works 
well, surely to heaven we do not have to blame it on the Bloc 
just because it is doing a bit of filibustering in the House.  If 
a government really believes that then let it work through the 
House and through committee.  For goodness sake in two 
parliamentary terms, one of which is coming evidently to a rapid 
end for no reason, why can we not get these things through and 
let justice be justice in the justice system and not under the 
guise of the Minister of State for Multiculturalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice and equality do not necessarily require further 
government intrusion.  As I said earlier, we put more and more 
money into these programs and yet the minister claims that the 
incidence of violence and the incidence of women's shelters is 
going up at an alarming rate.  It would seem to me that when she 
talks about the roots of violence or family domestic problems, we 
have to dig a little deeper to the root. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She talked about the gun control bill and that this really was 
going to help things because she said guns commit these crimes, 
and granted they do in violence against women.  However, it is 
almost as if there is a myth across the way that nothing is going 
to happen or some of these dreadful things will not happen again. 
Even if a gun is registered, do government members think that a 
gun will not be used commit a crime? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the roots of violence and why domestic violence 
happens.  I know plenty about violence even though the minister 
would laugh and say that am just a Alliance member and know very 
little about it.  I understand what family violence is about.  I 
do not understand it totally but I understand that even if there 
is a gun in the house or a knife or a frying pan, if a male or 
female has it in his or her heart to commit violence, we know 
darn well it is going to happen.  It does not matter if a gun is 
registered or if a longbow or a crossbow or a Henckels carving 
knife is used.  If violence is in someone's heart, the person is 
going to commit violence.  I really do not think gun control is 
going to answer the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at economic equality and women and work.  Women are 
more often greatly affected as part of the sandwich generation. 
They have kids at home to look after.  Many of us who are baby 
boomers are not only getting older but our parents are aging. 
Many of us look after our parents at home and that obviously 
takes up, in terms of unpaid work, huge amounts of responsibility 
for women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I already mentioned family tax fairness and child care.  Why 
would we discriminate against two parent families where one 
chooses to stay home?  Who in the House would be able to defend 
such a policy where the government discriminates in the tax 
system against someone who chooses to stay at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Setting up the promised national child care fund is something 
that the group is looking for, starting with an immediate 
contribution of $2 billion.   When I talk about family and 
celebrating family as a priority, lots of people send their kids 
to day care and many times they have to.  I do not think it 
should be a natural way of life to assume that we are going to 
send our kids to day care as a matter of course.  This motion 
certainly leads in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about personal and business taxes.  The minister 
talked about taxes.  I wish she were here to hear this because it 
is a really good one.  She needs to know that women are starting 
businesses at twice the rate of men.  That to me is a pretty 
significant and exciting development.  Yet, I did not hear 
anything about it from the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes:</B>  I did S. O. 31s on that years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Very good.  I am glad to know that 
somebody over there has talked about how women are starting 
businesses at twice the rate of men.  That is good news.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about taxes and how this will absolutely help, we 
want to lower business taxes.  The minister and a couple of other 
members over there are rolling their eyes to indicate as if this 
would help.  Lower business and payroll taxes would help a man or 
woman with a small business.  I see that as good news and I am 
sure they do over there too.  It is just the looks on their faces 
that does not have me convinced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On planning for retirement, the official opposition has a plan 
to benefit all older Canadians, especially women.  That is 
exciting to me.  In 1997-98 women made up 52% of college 
enrolment and 55% of university enrolment.  There is nothing 
wrong with that.  It is certainly representative of what they 
represent in the population and it is absolutely wonderful to see 
that happening.  The minister talked about some of the good 
things happening regarding student loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me wind down by talking about the manifesto of the March 
of Women 2000 and NAC have as their plank and platform. This 
actually is what we are voting on, not just the words of the Bloc 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, of its feminist dozen, which is 13, is to restore federal 
funding to health care and enforce the rules against the 
privatization of our health care system, beginning with Alberta. 
I notice that at the Liberal convention this weekend people 
want to talk about two tier health care systems in Quebec.  I 
will be interested to watch the health minister have a little fit 
like he did with the folks in Alberta.  I also will mention for 
the listening audience that B.C. and Alberta pay health premiums, 
and I understand that no other province does.  That is kind of 
interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second is to spend an additional 1% of the budget on social 
housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third is to set up the promised national child care fund, 
starting with an immediate contribution of $2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth is to increase old age security payments to provide older 
women with a decent standard of living.  That is an excellent 
idea.  Women between the age of 55 and 65 who are widowed receive 
pitiful survivor benefits.  It is a difficult 10 or 15 years that 
they have to spend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth is to use the surplus from the employment insurance fund 
to increase benefits, provide longer payment periods and improve 
access as well as improve maternity and family benefits.  It is 
funny that the Liberals took all that away but now that we are on 
the eve of an election all of a sudden it comes forward.  Maybe 
we should revive that old Barry McGuire song “The Eve of 
Destruction”.  It is not an eve of destruction but it is 
certainly an eve of an election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixth is to first support women organizing for equality and 
democracy by allocating $50 million to front line, independent, 
feminist, women controlled groups committed to ending violence 
against women such as women's centres, rape crisis centres and 
women's shelters.  Yes, these are good ideas.  However, what 
happens to men who are perpetrating violence or men who are 
victims of violence?  We would all agree that we have some of in the 
country.  Surely they would not just fall through the cracks. 
Second is to recognize and fund the three autonomous aboriginal 
women's organizations to ensure full participation in all 
significant public policy decisions, as well as provide adequate 
funding to aboriginal women's services, including shelters in all 
rural, remote and urban aboriginal communities.  Third is to fund 
a national meeting of lesbians to discuss and prioritize areas 
for legislative and public policy reform.  Fourth is to provide 
$30 million in core funding for equality seeking women's 
organizations which represents only $2 for every woman and girl 
child in Canada, our fair share.  I am not sure what that is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventh is to fund all consultations with a wide range of 
women's equality seeking organizations prior to all legislative 
reform of relevance to women's security and inequality rights 
beginning with the criminal code and to ensure access for women 
from marginalized communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighth is to implement progressive immigration reform to provide 
domestic workers with full immigration status on arrival, abolish 
the head tax on all immigrants and to include persecution on the 
basis of gender and sexual orientation as grounds for claiming 
refugee status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ninth is to contribute to the elimination of poverty around the 
world by supporting the cancellation of the debts of the 53 
poorest countries and increasing Canada's international 
development aid to .07% of the gross national product.  We are 
$600 billion in debt.  For every family of four either watching 
here or on television today that is an extra mortgage of $75,000 
on our debt.  It cannot be forgiven.  We owe that money and every 
single family of four in the country owes that percentage to our 
national debt.  Surely we are in a pretty grave situation here 
too.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Tenth, of the feminist dozen 13 immediate demands to the federal 
government to end poverty and violence against women, is to adopt 
national standards which guarantee the right to welfare for 
everyone in need and ban workfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I always liked working.  I am very glad and grateful, being 
raised by a single parent, that my mom did not have to use 
welfare.  She worked in a lamp store and raised five kids by the 
scruff of the neck in downtown Vancouver in the sixties when 
such a thing certainly was not popular.  She was very blessed 
that she did not have to go on welfare.  She certainly did not 
think she had a right to it.  She had the opportunity to get out, 
get a job and raise those kids.  For her, welfare would have been 
something that she would have to fall back on if she needed to. I 
certainly do not think she thought that it was a right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eleventh is to recognize the ongoing exclusion of women with 
disabilities from economic, political and social life, and take 
the essential first step of ensuring and funding full access for 
women with disabilities to all consultations on issues of 
relevance to women.   Yes, that it a good thing but are men with 
disabilities treated fairly in the workforce as well?  Do we just 
eliminate them?  There are great problems with all people with 
disabilities and we would be discriminatory if we just picked out 
one group of them and not the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twelfth is to establish a national system of grants based on 
need not merit to enable access to post-secondary education and 
reduce student debt.  As far as I know, we are the only national 
party in the country that has in our platform an income 
contingent student loan repayment plan.  I have not seen that 
over there.  I understand that the minister of HRD not long ago 
said “We lost $245 million but shucks it was student loans.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These were taxpayers' dollars.  They just disappeared?  We have 
said pay the money back.  If they have a job doing <I>x</I> when 
they are qualified to have a job doing <I>y</I> then surely they 
should pay back some of it out of the money they are making doing 
job <I>x</I>.  Make it contingent upon their income.  People would 
know that they would be paying back their loans, maybe at a lower 
rate. However, when they get a better job at least we know it 
would be paid back fully.  Then we would not have the HRD 
minister saying that they lost the money and since it was more 
than six years ago they just wrote it off.  I do not think that 
is fair to anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thirteenth is to adopt proactive pay equity legislation.  I have 
always believed in equal pay for equal work.  I am a high school 
teacher and worked just as hard as every male teacher in that 
school.  How do we go to pay equity where we are talking about 
equal pay for work of equal value?  How do we ever define that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention to the minister as I wind down now, that 
in my little school in Dewberry, Alberta we had some problem with 
the boiler systems.  One morning it was 45 below.  Yes, the 
principal is number one in any school, but does anyone know who I 
went to see on that morning when the boilers were out? I went to 
see the janitor because I knew he was the only guy who could get 
those things going or get some propane tanks in there to blow 
heat down the hall.  How do we ever determine what is work of 
equal value— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine:</B>  Equity is important then, is it not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  I see I have touched a nerve.  It is a 
funny thing.  When we look at it, we must 
realize that these are the demands we are talking about and 
will be voting on maybe not later this afternoon but 
certainly tomorrow.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened to the hon. member 
and I realize that she does not have a clue.  She still does not 
get it.  She does not understand the difference between the 
realities of men and women.  I do not know what part she does not 
understand that 88% of persons who are killed in domestic 
violence are women.  It is all about sameness.  It is all about 
one size fits all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I want to ask is on the issue of pay equity. Here 
is another prime example of how that party across the way does 
not even have a clue.  Pay equity recognizes the fact that women 
have for a long time been caught in what we call the pink ghetto 
or in the low paying jobs in which the jobs were paid low 
because women did them.  They are still being paid low wages 
because women are still doing them.  It brings them up to scratch 
in terms of the value of the work that secretaries do, the value 
of the work that elementary school teachers do and puts it 
against the value of the work that men are doing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member explain to me why she does not seem to get it? 
I would like to know where she lives.  She talks a lot of 
rhetoric, but I would like to ask her to explain to me what she 
knows about the historical pay equity problems, the pink ghetto, 
and the fact that women for so long have been underpaid because 
of the work they do.  Could the member tell me what she thinks 
about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member says I 
just do not get it and do not understand the differences between 
men and women.  Does that mean seven years of marriage have 
taught me nothing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me assure the hon. member that I am well aware of the 
differences between men and women, and I say praise God.  I was 
41 when I was married the first time and I love having a husband. 
The hon. member can bet I understand the differences between men 
and women.  I grew up in a family of four daughters.  My husband 
is the eldest of five sons.  I certainly do understand some of 
the intimate differences between men and women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talks about women being caught in the pink 
ghetto.  She said I do not get it and she asked where I live.  I 
live in Edmonton.  I have seen some things all across the 
country, specifically in Vancouver, where family members still 
live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member laughs this off and talks about the pink ghetto and 
whatever else.  Frankly, I do not find it very funny.  The hon. 
member says I do not get the fact that women have been ghettoized 
and asks me to explain that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister knows there are many reasons why women exit the 
workforce.  She just talked about it with her CPP in and out 
plan.  That is one of the reasons there are problems.  That is 
one of the problems.  Beyond that, many women choose to go into 
the humanities and other areas.  They make conscious decisions 
about child raising and child rearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to label it off and make comments about the colour I am 
wearing today, I am not sure— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry:</B>  That has nothing to do with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, she says it has nothing 
to do with it.  What does have something to do with it is the 
fact that when government money is being thrown at something and 
it really does not solve the problem, the government needs to go 
back to the table and say “wait a minute, maybe there are deeper 
root causes for some of these issues”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as I sit here and listen to the Liberals and the 
Alliance on the issue of pay equity I just want to say a pox on 
both their houses.  The concept of pay equity is well understood 
by those who have worked long and hard to advance this notion 
over the past 20 years.  I do not understand how, in 2000, we are 
sitting here debating whether or not it has merit and can be 
applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Alliance sit in the Chamber and say no to pay 
equity, no to equal pay for work of equal value.  The Liberals 
just refuse to apply the law.  Goodness gracious, we sat here for 
10 years while the government found every legal loophole it could 
to avoid paying its obligations and applying equal pay for work 
of equal value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the difference?  On the one hand we have a party that 
gives lip service and lots of rhetoric but refuses to do anything 
until it is pushed, dragging and screaming, to do something.  On 
the other hand we have a party that just does not acknowledge the 
basic facts and the basic situation.  It refuses to simply 
acknowledge that fundamental aspect of the pursuit of equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of Alliance members I should point them back to 
some 15 years ago when the concept of equal pay for work of equal 
value was developed and implemented.  It was implemented fully in 
the province of Manitoba.  It was implemented fully in Yukon.  It 
was implemented in other provinces across the country.  It works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member give some thought to the record of 
jurisdictions that have applied this concept, bring her policies 
up to date, and support the very important struggle we have as 
women in parliament and in the country to ensure full equality 
between women and men? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would be interested to 
know if the government of Saskatchewan has brought in full pay 
equity.  Maybe it is working on this before Roy leaves.  I am not 
sure.  This might be his last item of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been told that I do not know the difference between men 
and women and that I just do not get it.  Now I have had a pox 
put on my house.  This could be a long winter.  However, I am 
looking forward to heading home to see my husband as soon as time 
permits.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go back to the difference between equal pay for equal 
work and equal pay for work of equal value.  How do we know the 
value of work?  It seems to me all work is valuable.  It seems 
the government is talking about the fact that only some work is 
valued.  I think all work has value whether it is done by men, 
women or young people.  I spoke at two or three schools last week 
and saw groups of young people.  I think it will be exciting to 
have them in the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very difficult to see an ill defined policy like this one. 
I just gave probably the best life example of work of equal 
value.  As much as I respected my principal, he was the last guy 
I wanted to see when it was -45°C and the boilers were not 
working.  Somebody has to somehow arbitrarily put value on work 
<I>A</I>, work <I>B</I> or work <I>C</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see I have exorcised some of the members across the way. 
Before we move on to the next speakers, and I look forward to 
hearing what they have to say, let me reiterate very strongly 
that with more and more government money being distributed to 
various groups on various issues, the problem is only increasing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk about women's shelters, family violence, violence 
against women, women staying home with their children, or those 
of us with older parents.  Many baby boomers are staying home 
with those people.  Is it getting worse?  It would seem so.  The 
government just continues to put in more and more money and give 
the rhetoric that it has solved the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister met with NACSOW.  I was amused the minister 
said that I was ranting about the Prime Minister's meeting with 
the women's groups yesterday.  It was not this member but the 
NACSOW people themselves who said the meeting was a colossal 
waste of time.  I was not at that meeting.  I was on an airplane. 
When the people themselves say it is a waste of time, I think we 
need to realize that surely there are better ways to solve the 
problem than an increase in rhetoric and money and everything 
else. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have been listening very intently to the member.  I 
think we want to establish for not only ourselves but all 
Canadians the position she is putting forward as an individual 
member and on behalf of her party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I get the idea that she is saying one size fits all.  Are we 
talking about equality and equality in the workplace?  What is 
her party's position on dealing with equality in the workplace, 
on women gaining equality in the workplace?  How would the member 
deal with visible minority women, aboriginal women and women with 
disabilities in the workplace? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  In two words, Mr. Speaker, equal 
opportunity.  Regardless of whether it is based on gender or 
disability it should be equal opportunity for everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister stands and says she defends these feminist dozen. I 
do not know how anyone, even a Liberal, could defend the fact 
that they say they want full funding access for women with 
disabilities.  That is discriminatory.  There are lots of women, 
lots of men and lots of young people with disabilities who need 
equal opportunity, period, in the workplace regardless of gender 
or disability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not one size fits all.  That is making sure we do not 
just separate out women with disabilities but include men with 
disabilities and say that we will hire on the basis of merit and 
merit alone.  There would not be the discrimination that I see in 
this document.

great pleasure in participating in this debate.  I will be 
sharing my time with the member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, the 
status of women spokesperson on behalf of the New Democratic 
Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I reflect on the exchanges that have taken place between the 
spokespersons for the government party and the official 
opposition, it is little wonder that women in the country have 
become discouraged.  They are tired, fed up with being dismissed, 
demeaned and basically pushed into the shadows by the party in 
government and the official opposition.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it worse to have an official opposition that does not even 
understand the concept of equality and justice, that does not 
even understand the notion of sisterhood and solidarity, that 
clearly embraces the Margaret Thatcher view of the world that 
there is no such thing as community or society but only 
individuals living as isolated islands in a society that does not 
care about them?  Or, is it worse to have a government party that 
actually does understand something about the magnitude of the 
problem, that cannot even make that excuse, but that does not use 
the power, the mandate and the resources it has at its disposal 
to do something to advance equality and justice on behalf of 
women?  It is hard to know which is worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to leave that very depressing situation to focus on 
something very much more hopeful. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday a group of Canadian women held a huge 
rally here on Parliament Hill. I remember that six years ago 
Quebec women organized a solidarity march which focused on a 
very important and progressive symbol: bread and roses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I want to congratulate Quebec women for having shown 
leadership in the great battle to fight violence against women, 
to fight poverty and to promote justice, solidarity and 
equality for women. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud of the leadership shown by the women of Quebec 
in this struggle.  They have undertaken to turn what started out 
to be a modest and successful march in the province of Quebec 
which extended across Canada the next year into an international 
women's march against poverty and violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, as I had the opportunity to mix and mingle and 
participate with those women, as did many of my New Democrat 
colleagues, I felt very hopeful.  Despite all the discrimination 
women have suffered, despite all the reasons women have to feel 
discouraged, they celebrated yesterday.  They celebrated with 
music, with humour, and with a reinforcement of the kind of 
solidarity and sisterhood they know will be necessary to move 
governments to act to eliminate poverty and violence against 
women in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not an accident that the women of the world who have come 
together have recognized that they have to work with one another 
and support one another to get governments to act.  That is why 
we are privileged to have a democratic process that allows women 
an equal voice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very encouraged to hear woman after woman, and not just 
those who had the opportunity to speak on behalf of others, speak 
very much from their own experiences, their own hearts.  They 
will not take no for an answer.  They have been waiting on the 
sidelines.  They will use the democratic process available to 
them in the upcoming election to say enough is enough.  They will 
not put up with a government that is sitting on a surplus, which 
is building to $121 billion and beyond, and refusing to implement 
its commitments to women, to the people of Canada, in the 1993 
election and again in 1997.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What were those commitments?  A commitment to a national child 
care program, which still has not seen the light of day, and a 
commitment to a national home care program.  Make no mistake 
about it, it is women who carry the double burden of the cutback 
in our health care system.  The government brags that it has 
reinvested some money into health care.   Wrong.  It has not even 
brought health care funding up to the level that it was, for the 
name of heavens, under the Mulroney government when it took power 
in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a commitment to a pharmacare program that would ensure 
that elderly women would not be forced to choose between buying 
their groceries or filling their prescription for drugs given to 
them by their doctor.  There was also a commitment to more 
adequate, affordable housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals were in opposition they said that social 
housing was a disgrace and that more money needed to be invested 
in social housing.  Does anyone know what their contribution has 
been to the women and children struggling with inadequate 
housing, struggling with the reality that more and more women and 
children are homeless on the streets in some parts of this 
country?  We have some 5,000 children who are homeless and who 
have nowhere to go to bed at night except at an emergency shelter 
in the city of Toronto.  Does anyone know what the federal 
Liberal contribution has been toward solving that problem and 
eliminating any national commitment to social housing?  We are 
the only industrial nation in the world that does not have a 
national housing program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far from despair, I celebrate and I take hope from the fact that 
50,000 women came together representing millions of other women 
to say “We will solve this problem.  We will take charge of our 
own futures.  We will use the democratic instruments that are 
available to us to ensure that we demand accountability from our 
governments and we make progress that will advance genuine 
equality and justice for ourselves and for our children”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by once again saying how inspiring it has been 
to watch women come together to support one another in this 
struggle.  This is not just a slogan.  The women's movement, I am 
prepared to say, is the single most important movement 
happening in the world today.  These women have come together and 
said “As long as one woman is a victim of violence, as long as 
one woman in this world is a victim of poverty, then we are all 
at risk of victimization”.  That is the meaning of the notion of 
sisterhood in solidarity. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“So, so, so, solidarity”, that was the slogan. Many women, not 
only across Canada but literally all over the world, are working 
together to solve the issues of violence and poverty. I am very 
proud to participate, along with my NDP colleagues, in this 
great battle, one we intend to win.

says it cannot afford it but we cannot afford not to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a serious issue.  That member, who was the previous 
leader of that party, voted against gun control.  Gun control was 
a woman's issue.  I know there were members of that party who 
clearly understood the issue.  My concerns come from wanting to 
have both the actions and the words on this issue on the same 
page, which I believe would actually unite us in many respects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respect a lot of the members in that caucus for their stances

Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, why does it not 
surprise me that Liberal members of the House absolutely never 
want to deal with their own record?  What do they want to do? 
They want to ask me to account for a government at some other 
level in some province that is halfway across the country from 
where I spent my political years and active life so they can be 
satisfied that they do not have to do anything about pay equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who can blame government members for not wanting to talk about 
the fact that some 17 years after pay equity legislation became 
the law of the land they were finally forced, because the courts 
would not let them get away with breaking the law any longer, to 
pay up.  No wonder they do not want to talk about that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do members of that government have to say about the fact 
that it is now seven years later and we still do not have a 
national child care program?  What do they have to say about the 
fact that poor women, visible minority women and the poorest, 
most discriminated women of all in this country, aboriginal 
women, are able to give more leadership in the fight for child 
care, for services to deal with domestic violence, for home care 
and for pharmacare than this whole government put together with 
all of the resources in Canada at its disposal.  No wonder the 
members of the pathetic Liberal government do not want to give an 
accounting of their record over the last seven years.

government's move in this area for women and their families.  I 
can talk about equity.  I can talk about all kinds of programs in 
terms of head start programs and children's programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why the members of the NDP, and that leader 
in particular, want to take the high ground here when they would 
bankrupt the government with their spending spree.  They have no 
concept of equality.  They have no concept of equilibrium.  What 
they would do is spend the whole pot on whatever they think is 
appropriate without being fiscally prudent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader opposite should hang her head in shame knowing that 
she cannot bring about the balance necessary.  I can defend the 
record of this government any day of the week and twice on 
Sundays because we have done the right thing.  What they cannot 
get their heads around is having the fiscal responsibility 
necessary to govern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, for seven straight 
years the government has used the excuse of the deficit for 
breaking practically every single promise that it made in two 
election campaigns that might have positively impacted on the 
suffering of women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should not talk to me about fiscal 
responsibility.  The reality is that the jig is up.  The 
government can no longer use the excuse of the deficit for 
continuing to turn its back on home care, on child care and on 
pharmacare, on the things that would really make a difference in 
the lives of women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, that member is correct.  When it comes down to what we 
would do with the surplus, we would make no apology for the fact 
that we would overwhelmingly spend that surplus to deal with 
poverty, with violence, with homelessness and with the hunger of 
children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
after listening to the speech by the hon. Secretary of State for 
the Status of Women, I could not help but notice how full it was 
of incredible contradictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. secretary of state was saying that to eradicate poverty 
among women we would have to somehow reduce the capital gains tax 
for the wealthy; that to eliminate poverty among women we would 
have to give bankers another tax break; that to eliminate poverty 
among women we would have to change the EI system in a structure 
where still only 30% of unemployed women will qualify for EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. leader of the New Democratic Party could 
clarify some of the inherent contradictions in the attitudes held 
by the hon. secretary of state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can try to clarify 
but I sure will not make excuses for the Liberals.  What is so 
astounding about this is that they do know better.  They know 
that when a federal government eliminates its commitments to 
social housing it is bound to increase the number of homeless 
people and the number of people living in substandard housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals do understand that if they provide no leadership on 
child care they will have more and more families at risk and more 
and more children who do not have the benefit of affordable 
quality child care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What makes this so pathetic is when one of those members stands 
up, as he just did, and says “Why are you not congratulating us 
for our head start program?”  I have worked with the head start 
movement for 33 years.  What the government knows is that the 
vast majority of Canadian children are being robbed of getting 
the kind of head start in life they need because the government 
has completely abandoned its commitments to universal affordable 
child care.

violence can take on many forms.  It can be physical, 
psychological and sexual.  Although violence can affect everyone, 
violence against women, particularly physical violence against 
women, is a predominant reality.  The UN estimates that around

at home.  Battery is the world's leading cause of injury among 
women aged 15 to 44.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations has defined food security as existing when 
“all people, at all times, have safe and nutritious food to meet

Tragically, because of war and political interference, millions

families all across this country are being forced into bankruptcy 
by international interference in the market.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if you were approached by someone asking for $5 million 
and you knew that the guy was under investigation for fraud and 
theft, you would probably be a little hesitant to hand over the 
cash, but not with this government, not in the Prime Minister's 
riding.  It handed over five million more dollars to Mario Pépin 
in spite of an ongoing RCMP investigation for fraud and theft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the government give millions of taxpayer dollars to a 
suspected fraud artist? 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, with reference to the individual and the 
circumstances the hon. member is bringing to the House, there are 
RCMP investigations under way.  She knows full well that it is 
inappropriate for me to comment on this further in the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, there was already an RCMP investigation under way 
and it would seem to me pretty highly appropriate not to give 
them five million more dollars while the investigation was going 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not let the investigations discourage you, Mr. Speaker, if 
you want to get your hands on the public purse; in fact maybe 
just move to the Prime Minister's riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mario Pépin and his Groupe Forces were under RCMP investigation 
already for fraud and theft, but the government thought nothing 
of handing him five million more dollars of taxpayer money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know:  Do all fraud suspects qualify for 
millions of dollars of taxpayer money, or just those who live in 
the Prime Minister's riding? 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me say again that it would be 
inappropriate for me to comment on circumstances surrounding 
investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member knows full well that it is inappropriate for me 
to comment upon it, as it is inappropriate for her to ask about 
it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK80"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let me just say again how highly inappropriate it is 
of the minister to okay funds of $5 million to go to someone who 
is already under investigation.  Talk about secrecy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a nudge and a wink, and may the Groupe Forces be with you, 
the Prime Minister handed five million more dollars to a 
suspected fraud artist, and now the minister says that she has to 
hide behind a cloak of secrecy.  She cannot talk about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was okay for her to okay a cheque.  Why does residency in the 
Prime Minister's riding qualify even suspected fraud artists and 
thieves access to the public purse that she okays? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We are going a little further than we should 
be going.  We would hope that the words used in our questions 
would be a bit more judicious.  If the hon. Minister of Human 
Resources Development wants to address herself to the question, 
she may. 
<P><A NAME="LINK81"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I listened to the hon. member's 
question, first, she seems to be presuming guilt and I think that 
is highly inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I remind her that when it is clear that things are under 
investigation it is not only inappropriate for me to be 
commenting but it is inappropriate for her to be asking such 
questions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK82"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we have heard answers from the minister and the 
government before.  They say they cannot comment because there is 
a police investigation and blah, blah, blah.  They keep going on 
like that but they could at least answer this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While they were twiddling their thumbs and the police were doing 
their investigative work, doing the good work they are supposed 
to, why did the minister not at least ensure that no more money 
went to people who were already charged with theft and fraud? 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, again I would suggest the hon. member is 
presuming the outcome of an investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  As I said on a number of occasions, the 
government takes very seriously the investments we make in 
communities right across the country, but if there is ever any 
evidence of misuse of Canadian tax dollars we send it to the 
appropriate authorities for investigation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, eventually, in July 2000, Mr. Pépin was actually charged 
with fraud and theft.  He had been investigated all spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could ask ourselves why.  Why would the government give 
another $5 million grant, this time from Industry Canada, to a 
guy who has been charged with fraud and theft? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The better question is not why.  The question is where.  Where 
did it take place?  It took place once again in the Prime 
Minister's riding.  Why is it that whenever the Prime Minister's 
riding is involved, even if someone has been charged with theft 
and fraud, the money just keeps getting ladled out by the federal 
government? 
<P><A NAME="LINK85"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is just not 
listening.  I think the minister not once, not twice, but three 
times has said repeatedly that with the situation and the 
position it is in it is inappropriate to answer.  Hopefully they 
are professional enough to understand that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we all know that the government is enjoying huge budget 
surpluses, including a surplus of over $30 billion in the 
employment insurance fund, something which the Bloc Quebecois has 
been condemning for months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of the World March of Women, is the government 
prepared to make a formal commitment and follow up on women's 
claims by ensuring that the surpluses in the employment insurance 
fund are used only for employment insurance purposes and that 
women will finally get what they deserve? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, like many of my colleagues I am looking 
forward to meeting with those who are representing women on this 
very important march and looking forward to hearing directly from 
them about their demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say to the hon. member that he need not look too far for 
our record in support of Canadian women.  First and foremost let 
us remember that since 1993 the unemployment levels for women 
working in the Canadian marketplace are the lowest they have been 
in 25 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition we have made focused investment, not only using EI 
money but through the national child benefit that goes directly 
to low income earners.

<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, I met with the women's delegation. These women did not 
share the minister's opinion. They condemned the government for 
being driven by vote-seeking motives with its employment 
insurance reforms, on the eve of a general election. Two thirds 
of unemployed women do not qualify for benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking this government and particularly the Minister of 
Finance, who is about to lower the tax rate on capital gains for 
the wealthy, the following question: Could they not get moving 
and take concrete action to meet the needs of women, considering 
that two thirds of those who are unemployed and who paid premiums 
are not getting any benefits? There are no words to describe this 
situation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
had the Bloc Quebecois leader listened to the minister, he would 
have heard her list a whole series of measures taken by the 
government, and the minister in particular, for the benefit of 
women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, in other areas, including measures to improve employment, 
support for universities, help for single mothers and so on, the 
leader of the opposition will know that this government is fully 
aware of the plight of women.

<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as we know 
75% of single parents are women, and they taxed federally even 
though they earn less than $35,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Bloc Quebecois is advocating and as we know that billions 
of dollars are accumulating monthly in his coffers, would the 
Minister of Finance agree to relieve these families of having to 
pay taxes after his mini budget is tabled? 
<P><A NAME="LINK93"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is no need to await the budget or the upcoming economic 
statement, one needs only look at the February budget to see that 
we substantially increased help to Canadian families. 
<P><A NAME="LINK94"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
according to the National Council on Welfare, 42% of older women 
living alone are poor.  This is totally immoral when the 
government is floating in billions of dollars in surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the Minister of Finance simply promise right now in the 
House of Commons to respond to one of the demands of the world 
march of women and substantially increase old age security 
benefits?  That is easy enough. 
<P><A NAME="LINK95"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the women's cause is one that is very important to this 
government. This is why a number of ministers, including the 
Minister of Finance, intend to meet their representatives 
tomorrow.  This will certainly be one of our topics of 
discussion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, every 
day Canadian women are paying the price for Liberal choices. More 
and more women and children are forced to use food banks. More 
and more go without adequate child care.  More and more live in 
substandard housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday 50,000 women, on behalf of millions across the 
country, came together and said that is not good enough.  When 
will the government recognize that investing in women and 
children must take priority over investing in hotels and golf 
courses? 
<P><A NAME="LINK98"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I remind the hon. member of the 
investment that the government has made in support of Canadian 
women.  First and foremost, let us look at the doubling of 
parental benefits from six months to twelve months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, let us look at the $2.5 billion that will be invested in 
the Canadian child tax credit which goes directly to low income 
families, many headed by women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the recent changes to employment insurance where 
we will not claw back from women who choose to stay home with 
their children.  There are a number of investments specifically 
directed at Canadian women. 
<P><A NAME="LINK99"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Canadian women are not buying the government line.  Women finally 
got to meet with the Prime Minister yesterday, and do we know 
what they said?  They said it was a waste of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women have been waiting for seven years for the Prime Minister 
to take them seriously, for the government to take action against 
poverty and violence.  When will the government get beyond the

<P><A NAME="LINK100"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

of the Prime Minister and the government to women.  Let us look 
at the Canada study grants where we recognize that single women 
want to go back to university, to study and to improve the 
livelihood of themselves and their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at our self-sufficiency project where we are 
offering earnings to ensure that women who take work have 
sufficient income to support their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the changes to the Canada pension plan that look 
at the different work patterns women face in the workplace. There 
are more indications of our commitment to Canadian women.

the matter in question.

been in fact adopted by the government.  That is the basis on 
which we are proceeding with this procurement.  It is an open and 
fair procurement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We intend to follow that process to get the best helicopter to 
meet the operational requirements of the Canadian forces and to 
do it at the best price for taxpayers.  That has always been our

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this is a scandal that has already cost the lives of Canadian

</I></B></P><P align=left>Not long ago, we met in New Brunswick with all of Canada's

</I></B></P><P align=left>If there has been a delay, the hon. member ought to be aware 
that there was a change at the head of the Société de 
l'habitation du Québec this summer.  We therefore had to wait 
until the new person was in place, and have just resumed 
negotiations.  As far as this part of her question is concerned, 
therefore, I believe she should inquire at the head office.

we can work together with interested parties, including the

<P><A NAME="LINK145"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
spoken clearly that I support a tribute.  The Yukon also supports 
a tribute but it does not support this tribute.  Maybe the 
aboriginal affairs minister has something to say because the 
umbrella final agreement for the Yukon, which was signed in 1993, 
clearly states that a traditional territory, if it is to be 
renamed, has to be done in consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's approach to this has been a failure.  It 
has offended and affected first nations people.  It has offended 
Canadians.  It has probably seriously embarrassed the Trudeau 
family.  They should rethink this, do it properly and let 
Canadians choose a tribute. 
<P><A NAME="LINK146"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the member will know that when she stated her

responding, in particular, to the support that people have for 
the recognition of a beloved former prime minister of Canada, Mr. 
Trudeau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the message she is sending, and certainly the message 
being sent by Canadians, is that we have to ensure that in 
respecting Mr. Trudeau's memory we do not cause any difficulty 
for the history of Mount Logan.  That is something that the Prime 
Minister has taken into account and is certainly something we 
will want to work on with her, with other members and with the

we bring up.  We are giving him advance notice of one that is 
going to happen on October 27.  He does not have to wait for us 
to bring it up until after it has happened.  He knows it will 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 27, $600,000 of taxpayers' money will be transferred

Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada has entered into an

the agreement as made.  If the audit shows to the contrary then 
obviously we will take remedial action.  However, we will wait

incomes through such programs as AIDA, agriculture income 
disaster assistance.  However these attempts have not addressed 
the needs of farm families.  For example, only 42% of emergency

table in Ottawa and been delivered to farmers.  That leaves an

<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate today, but I 
think it is very important that we also talk about what is 
happening across the country as we sit here.  We have to look at 
the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One in five Canadian children, or 1.3 million, live in poverty. 
That is up 25% since 1989.  The fastest growing segment of the 
homeless population in Canada is families with children.  Up to 
40% of all food bank users are children under 18 years of age. 
The Canada child benefit, Canada's major tax transfer program for 
children, goes to only 36% of poor families.  Those are the 
facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday was a momentous time for women across Canada and the 
world.  The streets of the capital were filled with 50,000 men 
and women in a demonstration to make their demands known to the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the purpose of the march?  What had inspired such a 
mass demonstration of anger toward the Liberal government?  The 
march was for equality.  The march was to stop violence against 
women.  The march was to end poverty affecting women.  It was an 
expression of anger at the Liberal government.  Here we are, a 
supposedly civilized developed nation, and yet we still have to 
march in the streets to demand decent funding for health care. 
This is what Canada has come to.  Yesterday 50,000 people shouted 
that it is time for a change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1985 the UN announced that the target date for equality 
between men and women was the year 2000. 
We have two months left before the target date and it is 
terrifying to see how far we are from equality.

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wages for women are on average two-thirds those of their male 
equivalents.  The glass ceiling in many professions is just as 
solid as it was 30 years ago.  Members should look around the 
House.  Do we see equality? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One in six Canadian women is poor.  This figure of one in six 
includes all types of women.  Of those women living alone who are 
more than 65 years of age there is a poverty rate of 49%.  Is 
this how the Liberal government wants to thank those women who 
have put so much into our country?  As well, of women who head 
single parent families 56% are poor.  Is this the environment the 
Liberal government wants our future generations to be raised in? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this mass poverty lead to?  It leads to women staying 
in violent or abusive relationships.  The financial cost of 
escaping is too great.  It leads to fear of running away.  We all 
know the federal government has not set aside resources and 
benefits to protect these women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should it really take 50,000 marchers to make the government 
give money to those who really need it?  The demands of the World 
March of Women are vital to the development of our nation.  We 
must restore federal funding to health care and prevent it from 
the awful prospect of privatization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the lifetime of the Liberal government millions of dollars 
have been cut year after year.  Acceptable health care is a 
crucial part of society.  We must fight every day to restore it 
to acceptable levels.  We must also continually demand that a two 
tier system of health care be prevented.  Only recently Alberta 
made moves toward such a system.  The nation was outraged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian women say health care funding must be restored now. The 
World March of Women also demands that an additional 1% of the 
budget must be spent on social housing.  With increasing numbers 
of people being forced to sleep on the streets and rising numbers 
of women using women's shelters, increased federal spending on 
social housing is well overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government promised to contribute $2 billion to the 
setting up of a national child care fund.  This money is yet to 
materialize.  Any working mother knows the difficulty of juggling 
a career and a family, and yet the government seems to be 
reluctant to support these women who need their help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the Liberal government recognize that until women know 
that their children can be looked after they cannot go back to 
work?  In many cases they cannot afford child care until they are 
earning a wage.  This is an ongoing nightmare for many women 
across the country who are desperate to get back to work but are 
unable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many more specific demands submitted by the World 
March of Women and it is time they were answered.  Last month the 
government triumphantly announced its $12 billion surplus.  Now 
it is time to use it.  How long can the government ignore the 
shouts of thousands of its citizens who say give the money to 
health care, give the money to benefits, give the money to reduce 
student debt, promise to protect women from violence at home, and 
find ways to secure equality between men and women?  It should 
open its eyes and recognize that these issues will not go away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not just women's issues.  These are the issues of 
Canadians.  The NDP has been calling for many of these changes 
throughout this parliament.  Health care and education have been 
two of our highest priorities.  We will not give up the fight to 
protect and approve them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Halifax and I were on the Hill supporting the 
march.  We were showing our desire to gain equality and end 
poverty and violence against women.  Today the NDP women are on 
the inside of parliament shouting just as loudly for the same 
demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday's march was a triumph for the women of Canada.  Now 
that momentum must be harnessed and pushed forward.  The 
government cannot ignore the cries of 50,000 people with the 
support of thousands more around the country and the world.  The 
message is loud and clear.  It is time for change.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>   Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate my hon. colleague from Cape Breton for an 
excellent speech and for the work that she has done on behalf of 
not only the women of Canada but the important work that she has 
done in promoting equality, justice and solidarity with women 
globally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very pleased to see that an important element of the 
women's march yesterday was a recognition that we are global 
citizens.  When women are victims of violence or when women are 
victims of poverty around the world, that pain is pain we as 
Canadians must respond to as well.  I salute the hon. member for 
leadership on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a New Democrat I say that we are proud to stand in solidarity 
with the women who marched yesterday and to support the demands 
of the women's march. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our leader, the hon. member for Halifax, spoke eloquently this 
morning about some of these demands, in particular challenging 
the failure of the Liberal government to take seriously a number 
of the specific concerns raised among the demands made by these 
women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because this is a day long debate and I think it is important 
that there be a broad range of issues covered, I want to refer to 
one element.  That is the section in the women's march document 
which called for respect and promotion of the human rights of 
lesbians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often when we speak of women as minorities, when we speak of 
aboriginal women, and when we speak of women with disabilities, 
we forget another group of women still unfortunately face 
violence and still face discrimination.  The section included in 
the march document points out that despite recent victories 
recognizing same sex couples, lesbians have not yet achieved 
legal equality.  Because of hatred and prejudice, lesbian mothers 
can still lose custody of their children despite overwhelming 
proof that children in lesbian homes grow up healthy.  Lesbians 
still do not have the right to bring partners to Canada under the 
Immigration Act.  Lesbians of colour face a toxic mix of racial 
and homophobic prejudice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The document points out the high suicide rate of young lesbians, 
which is indicative of the hatred and self-loathing experienced 
in a country that refuses to denounce homophobia and fosters 
heterosexist values and norms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The document goes on to point out that internationally in many 
countries a woman who enjoys an intimate, physical relationship 
with another woman can be criminalized, jailed, slashed, flogged, 
harassed, shunned and sometimes even killed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The document finally notes that women's right to sexual autonomy 
must be respected as well as their freedom to choose and 
celebrate their sexuality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as New Democrats support full equality for Canadian women and 
justice for Canadian women.  I wanted to note particularly as 
well some of the challenges that face lesbians in Canada.  We 
stand in solidarity with those women and we urge the government 
to respond to the very important demands made by the women's 
march in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. 
colleague for his comments.  I think he makes a very valid point. 
When we are talking in the House about equality, as women have 
been talking across the country, that is just what we are talking 
about:  equality for all women who are Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently we have heard a lot of discussion from the other side 
of the House about values, about Liberal government values.  As a 
Canadian citizen I have to say that we all should be standing 
here and holding our heads in shame when we look at the social 
deficit that has been caused at the hands of the Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a mother I cannot imagine knowing and dealing with, day after 
day, my children having to go to bed hungry.  Women across Canada 
to their credit yesterday sent a clear message to the government. 
This is not about our asking for equality. This is about 
Canadian women from coast to coast to coast saying we want it and 
we want it now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member gave a beautiful vox intellectus.  I would 
like her to speak on the challenges of women in politics, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She experienced a bit of her ordeal through all this.  There are 
challenges at every level including women who are in poverty and 
some who are not.  We have a whole global problem when it comes 
to women in this advanced country.  I believe that we have to 
look at all the issues.  I would like the member to speak to 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague 
for her question.  As she knows, being a mother, it is a struggle 
and it is tough being a mother and not having the ability to feed 
or clothe one's children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have seen happen is a slash, burn and cut mentality from 
the Liberal government.  Unfortunately women have carried the 
brunt of the Liberal cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the member's question about whether it is 
difficult, as I said earlier in my speech, the government talks 
about equality, but when we sit in the Chamber do we have 
equality?   Not yet.  Will we?  I believe so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important about the women's world march is that it is 
not about asking any more.  It is about Canadian women demanding. 
This will be something for which women will want an answer from 
every government member when they possibly go knocking on doors 
in two weeks.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was listening to the comment of the 
hon. member.  She mentioned that there is no equality in the 
House.  Could she explain to me where the lack of equality for 
men and women in the House exists? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is really simple. 
It is the number.  All we have to do is look at how many men and 
how many women there are in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably the member has some ideas about why that is so.  We 
talk about equality.  We hear the government talk about it all 
the time.  If we as members are not committed to that equality 
when it comes to representing citizens, I am afraid that by the 
time my 11 year old daughter is old enough we still will not have 
that equality, if we do not have that commitment from the Liberal 
government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with my hon. colleague from 
Beauséjour—Petitcodiac. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with genuine sadness that I rise before the House to 
participate in the Bloc Quebecois opposition day motion calling 
for an end to poverty and violence against women.  It is also 
demanding equality in the workplace and better health care 
programs for all women throughout the country.  I say genuine 
sadness because who would have thought that as we entered the 
21st century women would still be victims of domestic violence? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments are quick to condemn these acts of violence yet they 
do very little to protect individuals against their abusers. What 
about discrimination in the workplace and the high prevalence of 
poverty found within our female population?  For years women have 
been listening to governments promise to address these inequities 
in society, yet most cuts in government spending 
disproportionately affect women.  Provincial cuts for women's 
shelters and housing programs force many women to remain with 
abusive partners.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A lack of subsidized child care spaces and reductions in 
education and retraining programs effectively prevent women from 
pursuing a better life for themselves and their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish I could say that I completely understand and appreciate 
the frustration women are feeling because of the lack of progress 
in addressing their serious concerns, but to say that I 
completely understand would be patronizing and completely false. 
Only those women who live in poverty or are victims of violence 
or discrimination in the workplace can truly understand the 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, at the fourth United Nations world conference on women 
in Beijing, Canada reaffirmed its commitment to a number of 
international United Nations agreements including the charter of 
the United Nations, the universal declaration of human rights, 
the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination 
against women, the convention on the rights of the child, and the 
declaration on the elimination of violence against women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us add to this impressive list the designation by the UN 
that the years 1997 to 2006 are to be known as the international 
decade for the eradication of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the Canadian government being a signatory to all these 
agreements, why are Canadian women still being marginalized and 
in many instances treated like second class citizens?  I will 
tell the House why.  It is because the Liberal government is more 
interested in offering lip service than actually addressing the 
serious concerns facing women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Sunday our Prime Minister met with a delegation representing 
over 5,000 women who gathered on the Hill to protest the lack of 
government commitment toward addressing serious women's issues. 
In 1993, prior to being elected Prime Minister, the leader of the 
Liberal Party wrote a letter promising to abide by any decision 
rendered by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal with regard to the 
outstanding issue of pay equity.  This issue affected 
approximately 200,000 predominantly female workers in the public 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same individual, our Prime Minister, who fought 
tooth and nail to try to prevent these workers from getting the 
money they so rightly deserved.  The Prime Minister reneged on 
his promise just as he did on the GST and free trade. 
Unfortunately for women in Canada and around the world he is 
likely to renege on our international UN commitments as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 women working outside the home earned 72 cents for every 
dollar earned by men.  This is totally unacceptable and serves 
only to magnify the disparity which exists in Canadian society. 
Already 60% of families headed by single women live below the 
poverty line.  If this wage gap continues we can expect that the 
number of single women living in poverty will certainly increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can we do to address poverty in the country?  The PC caucus 
put together a task force on poverty last year that travelled 
extensively across the country to meet with Canadians to discuss 
the issues and try to come up with possible solutions to the 
problem.  As a result of these extensive consultations, our party 
released a report in January entitled “It's Up To Us” which 
identifies a number of the problems associated with poverty and 
makes a number of recommendations on how some of these problems 
should be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the member for Shefford was instrumental in helping put 
this report together, I am confident that she will be able to 
convince her new party to adopt many of our measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Liberal government doing to address domestic 
violence which continues to be perpetrated against women in 
society?  The answer is very little. 
The tragic 1989 killing of 14 young women at École Polytechnique 
in Montreal shocked the nation and forced us all to look deeper 
into the roots of violence within our society.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, as so many people's memories of the event are 
waning, so is the Liberal government's commitment to finding ways 
to put an end to violence against women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics Canada reveals that at least 51% of all Canadian 
women have experienced at least one incidence of physical or 
sexual violence since the age of 16 and that sexual assaults 
account for almost one in ten violent crimes.  This suggests to 
me that government policies are not working.  We need more money 
for women shelters, community counselling, child protection, 
crisis lines and legal aid.  We need better training for our 
enforcement agencies to handle domestic disputes.  We need a 
justice system that is more in tune with the potential danger 
facing women by their partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As our Canadian women's lobby continues on to the world march in 
New York City, I can only hope that this Liberal government will 
take concrete measures in its expected mini-budget to address the 
immediate concerns of women's rights across the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am sure that the member will appreciate that all Canadians are 
very concerned about the issues that the member talked about, 
which were child poverty and domestic violence.  Certainly there 
are a number of issues.  However, I was very interested in the 
member's statements about the domestic violence angle and the 
solutions that he suggested which were more shelters, more crisis 
intervention and many things after the problem occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member not agree that there should be a balance 
between prevention and remediation and that part of the solution 
of domestic violence is trying to make sure that it does not 
happen in the first instance?  The member will well know that 
family breakdown is terribly high in Canada.  In fact 50% of 
married persons will break up before their children reach their 
18th birthday.  He will also know that common law couples will 
also have the breakdown in their relationship 50% more frequently 
than married persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem here, and I am sure the member would like to 
comment, is the reasons why families break down and the reasons 
why the children are the real victims of divorce and family 
breakdown.  The fact is it is not a simple, linear excuse.  It is 
a multiplicity of things.  I believe the member would agree that 
strengthening the Canadian family and investing in the Canadian 
family, men, women and children, and not making it simply a 
women's issue but making it a societal issue, is the fundamental 
prerequisite to addressing the serious problem of domestic 
violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the member's 
question comes truly from the heart and I recognize that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague's question and comments were genuine.  I would like 
him to be able to share some of those same sentiments with his 
caucus so that the government enacts legislation and policies 
that will help people in society.  Also, his comment that this is 
family issue and not just a woman's issue touches on an important 
point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's children who are poor are poor because their parents are 
poor.  When we have a situation in the home where people do not 
have the resources to adequately clothe, nourish and house not 
just their children but their whole family, it leads to stresses 
that cause the types of things that we are discussing today. 
As my colleague says, what we are looking at is even broader than 
just the women's issue.  It goes back to the fact that the 
government has reneged and has cut to the point where families 
are negatively impacted, hence negatively impacting women.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member also touched on 
the issue of child poverty.  He mentioned some statistics about 
lone parent situations.  I understand that about 14% of all 
families in Canada are in lone parent situations but they account 
for over 54% of all so-called children living in poverty.  Of 
course, the member will acknowledge that it is really families 
living in poverty.  This again very clearly goes to the issue of 
family breakdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member not agree that investing in the Canadian family 
and in our children, and making sure that children are raised in 
a healthy and well adjusted environment so that they can grow up 
to be healthy, well adjusted children as they move into adult 
life, is prevention versus remediation?  I think the member gets 
the gist that my concern is not so much what to do when we have 
the problem.  My concern is more with what are we doing to 
prevent the problem from occurring in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not say for a moment that we should legislate behaviour but 
I think we have to encourage healthy family life in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is fine for my hon. 
colleague to say what he said.  However, when I look at the cuts 
the Canadian people have suffered over the last seven years, a 
$33 billion surplus in one year, and I see poverty and all the 
negative impact that it has on the Canadian population, I cannot 
stand here and accept what my colleague is trying to put across 
to the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian people deserve a part of the $33 billion surplus.  A 
good chunk of the surplus comes from the people who could least 
afford to pay it.  They are single parents, those on fixed 
income, the poor and the elderly.  That is not acceptable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the organizers for the marches across 
the country and the world.  A world women's march does not happen 
overnight.  We are talking about days and months of organization. 
As a woman member of parliament, I want to thank them for 
everything they are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was part of the organization when we organized the national 
women's march against poverty in 1995 or 1996.  I helped 
co-ordinate the march in New Brunswick which certainly brought 
awareness.  Pay equity was one of the big issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After several courts, the Liberals finally decided to pay what 
was owed to mostly women who were federal government workers. 
Maybe to the Liberals it did not seem very important but it 
recognized that there was an inequity within salaries of federal 
employees.  What the mostly women and some men did with that 
money was reinvest it in their communities.  It also helped a lot 
of them to catch up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to also recognize the work that was done by the members 
of the Public Service Alliance of Canada.  We have to thank them. 
We have to thank Nycole Turmel and the whole group who worked 
on this.  Without their persistence and work I believe that women 
would not have won this very important justice that was owed to 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ten minutes is certainly not enough time to talk on all the 
issues but we have to touch on violence. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Violence against women is clearly unacceptable. There is 
certainly too much violence against women in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women's needs are not being met by our justice system. Too often 
women find themselves in dangerous situations. They ask the 
courts for help, but their spouse still manages to find them 
eventually, and we often see children who end up losing their 
mother.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often women live in shelters. This should not be happening. 
They should have the right to live in their own home, in their 
own environment, and feel safe. We must address this problem. Too 
many women live in fear and insecurity, afraid to leave the house 
or go to work, because they fear for their life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the way the justice system works, it is obvious that 
the Liberal government has to do a lot better to correct the 
problem. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague mentioned a while ago, we certainly have to 
address the problem.  Yes, I believe in prevention.  I believe in 
a justice system.  We need more prevention.  We need prevention 
at home and, as mothers, we need to make sure that we address 
that with the our children.  We need a society that talks about 
it and recognizes it.  We need governments that address the 
problem. That is how we are going to fix this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need shelters and we need to put a lot more money into 
them.  We have the rural communities which are always 
disadvantaged.  Shelters for battered women are much needed in 
our rural communities.  We always have to scrape and scrape to 
try to get enough funds to operate shelters which are safe homes 
for women and their kids.  They are safe homes that allow those 
moms to get out of a situation.  They can get some counselling. 
They can reflect on their situation.  They can get safety for 
their children.  Then after they have had a time to rest, to feel 
safe and secure they can make those decisions.  Those shelters 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I used one quite a few years ago and it worked.  There was 
counselling.  Children were safe and the women could think. 
Unless we have those shelters for women who need them, they 
cannot get out of the environment.  They cannot think straight. 
It does not matter how much prevention there is we will never 
solve all the problems.  However, we need the shelters and we 
need to reinvested in them.  All levels of government need to 
co-operate and address that.  If we do not then we are not facing 
up to the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most children living in poverty are female.  We have to look at 
the changes to the EI. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes to the employment insurance program have affected 
seasonal workers, of course, but women in particular. Did the 
Liberal government recognize that when it brought in these 
changes? The Liberals said that the changes to the employment 
insurance program would primarily affect women. Now they want to 
make changes to maternity leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very nice to tell women that they will get a one year 
maternity leave, but how many women can afford to take advantage 
of it with 55% of their $6 an hour salary? These women will spend 
a minimum amount of time at home with their children because they 
are forced to go back to work. They have no choice, because they 
cannot stay at home and live on 50% or 55%—the new amendments 
have not been adopted, and it looks like the government will not 
let them go through—of their salary. A woman cannot afford to 
stay at home with her children if she receives the equivalent of 
$3 an hour. It is simply not possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very nice to announce that a woman will be able to stay at 
home for a whole year with her children, but that only applies to 
women who earn big salaries. Those who are at the bottom end of 
the income scale will not have access to maternity leave, because 
they will not be able to afford it. We must also take a look at 
the child care program. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Child care is a big problem in this country.  In August I 
released my report.  On page 31, I recommended that we look at 
child care, especially in rural Canada.  There are serious 
problems when it comes to child care.  It is too expensive.  A 
lot of women are working in fish plants or in tourism and are 
earning low salaries.  They cannot afford child care.  So where 
are the children going?  The children are going where the moms 
and parents can afford afford to send them. 
Are they getting the best care?  I am not too sure that they are. 
Is it the parents' fault?  No, it is not the parents' fault.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to address child care in this country.  It is not right 
and it is not fair that only people making high incomes can 
afford child care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do believe that Quebec has a good example in child care at $5 
a day.  We have to look at that.  We have to look at it as a 
model and implement it across the country in different provinces 
where governments want it.  I believe every provincial government 
should want an affordable child care program for parents.  The 
children deserve it.  If those governments do not care about the 
parents perhaps they should care about the children who are the 
ones suffering at the end of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at breakfast programs.  On the weekend I was talking 
to a director of a school of about 500 children.  Two years ago 
he had to put in place a breakfast program, not twenty years ago 
but two years ago.  He is feeding 20% of the kids in that school 
at least one meal a day, which is an awful shame.  Why?  Not 
because the parents are doing better, but because the parents are 
making less money and everything is going up.  It may be gas, 
milk or bread, but everything is going up.  Salaries are not 
going up. They are going down.  Those are the issues that keep 
parents and children in poverty.  That is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about part time workers?  Who usually has a part time job? 
It is women.  Which group was attacked most in the EI cuts?  It 
was part time workers.  They now pay into the fund but they 
cannot collect.  Before when they used to pay they used to get at 
least a little bit but now they do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the EI legislation was passed it was clear that women in 
particular were going to be targeted by it.  The government 
passed it anyway.  We need a system in place with policies that 
make sure there is not one group in particular being targeted. 
This Liberal government does not do that.  The government speaks 
well today that it cares about women and poverty but I do not 
think it is really doing anything about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Violence and poverty among women has to be addressed.  We are 
living in a very rich country.  Every woman should feel safe in 
her home.  Every child should have food in his stomach when he 
goes to school.  Only by addressing poverty among parents can we 
ensure that.  Single parents are usually women.  This issue has 
to be addressed.  Talking about it is not enough.  We need sound 
policies that are going to address it once and for all.

probably support the Bloc Quebecois' motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It provides, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House work to provide the means needed to fight 
poverty and violence against women as demanded by the World March 
of Women, particularly in the areas of income protection, health, 
international aid, violence and wage parity, so as to ensure a 
fairer distribution of wealth between women and men. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned the $5 day care program that Quebec has put 
in place and that is indeed an excellent program. Could she 
provide more information and tell us whether she shares the 
viewpoint of the Canadian women's march committee, the 
representatives of all Canadian women, which, 
concerning demands pertaining to issues under Quebec's 
jurisdiction, recognized that Quebec has the right 
to establish its own standards, programs and policies in these 
areas? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member tell us whether she shares this viewpoint, the 
one of the women of Canada, which is ahead of everything the 
federal government has proposed?  For many years, the federal 
government has considered that it alone could put forward such a 
vision. Should the Liberal government not in some specific way 
respond to the demands from Quebec to grant the parental leave 
that the government of Quebec has set up and which is part of a 
structured family policy, rather than limit itself to ensuring 
its visibility through the program it condemned, namely the 
parental leave program under the employment insurance program? It 
will leave people with low incomes in a state of poverty, thereby 
ensuring that it is simply unrealistic to take a year's leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour: </B>Mr. Speaker, my answer is clear: I believe 
so.  The government must consult the provinces.  I believe Quebec

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has proven that the $5 dollar a day child care program works. 
There cannot be an immediate no simply because it is Quebec. 
It is clear that anything coming from Quebec triggers an 
immediate no from the Liberals.  I am not saying that they 
should always say yes, but they should consider the situation in 
each province.  There must be leadership.  Provinces must be 
encouraged to participate with the federal government and the 
municipalities.  The problem must be addressed.  The maternity 
leave problem is a serious one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only high income women will be able to afford to stay at home 
with their children. The women who work for minimum wage in a 
variety of factories—there are plenty of women in my area who 
work year round for $6.50 an hour—are certainly not going to 
stay home for a year with their children, not out of choice but 
for financial reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must sit down with the provinces and find a 
workable formula.  It should not do so with all provinces at the 
same time but rather one at a time, in order to solve the 
problems once and for all.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
had an opportunity to write a monograph entitled “The Tragic 
Tolerance of Domestic Violence”.  I would like to share with the 
member a couple of statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January 1998 a newsletter called “Common Sense and Domestic 
Violence” reported that only 25% of women in shelters actually 
go there to use the shelters as hostels.  It also showed that 50% 
of cases of domestic violence involve alcohol use or misuse.  It 
showed that 71% of domestic violent situations occur in 
non-marital relationships and that 30% of all abuse cases occur 
between the ages of 18 and 34. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the member will probably acknowledge, and maybe she 
could acknowledge, that this is not a simple societal problem we 
are dealing with and in fact only 15% of cases of domestic 
violence are ever reported to any authorities to break the cycle 
of violence.  Would she not agree that encouraging women to step 
forward and report cases of violence is an important part of the 
solution as well as requiring mandatory counselling for all those 
convicted of domestic violence in order to prevent the 
reoccurrence? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do agree.  I do not 
have the figures the hon. member mentioned.  What I do know is 
that when women go to a shelter it means they need shelter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to address the problem.  When partners are convicted 
they need rehabilitation.  We need to have programs out there, 
maybe before the partners are convicted.  We do not have enough 
programs.  There was a program at one point that was called the 
turn around program.  The success rate was not very high but at 
least it was a beginning for men who wanted to work out their 
violence and their tempers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those programs cost money, but unless we have those programs, 
unless we invest in having these programs available to help these 
men who do not want to be violent any more, who want to control 
their violence and who want to have a normal life, these men do 
not have the resources to get themselves out of it.  A lot of men 
who hit their women are not happy with themselves but they do not 
have the resources to get themselves out of it.  We need to have 
resources available, not only for women but for men.

proud to address this Bloc Quebecois motion. I am not only proud 
because the Bloc Quebecois presented this motion, but because 
this extraordinary march of women in 2000 has its roots in a 
similar initiative by the Fédération des femmes du Québec in 
1995, a march that all Quebecers remember and which was called 
the Bread and Roses March.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This women's movement is something extraordinary for all 
Quebecers and Canadians, for all those interested in organizing 
a movement to counterbalance the constant and rampant phenomenon 
whereby the rich are getting richer—it is true of countries and 
it is also true of the people living in these countries—and the 
poor are getting poorer, which is also a reality for countries 
as well as for the people living in them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a way it is just a start, but a very promising one, which was 
strongly felt in my riding, and perhaps also in yours, 
Mr. Speaker. In the riding of Mercier, women's groups, and two 
women's centres in particular, namely the Centre des femmes in 
Pointe-aux-Trembles and Info-Femmes in Tétreauville, mobilized and 
prepared this great march of women, first in my riding and then 
here in Ottawa. 
A number of these women are currently in New York city to take 
part in the great international march. I am very proud of all 
the work that has been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However that is not the end of it. One only had to hear the replies 
provided today by the government to realize that the fight is 
far from being over. This mobilization—that is what this 
is—will ensure that issues as serious and as important as poverty 
among women and children and violence against women will no 
longer remain secret. The women who are the victims of such 
situations will no longer be isolated and basically led to 
believe that they are responsible for what is happening to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the time available is extremely short, I would like to 
speak today to the international outlook of this march of women, 
which began in Quebec, became Canadian and is now an 
international event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are Canadian women calling for?  They are calling for an 
international outlook.  They are calling on Canada to get ready 
to meet the international aid objective of 0.7% of GDP, which 
could be called the nation's wealth.  It makes sense to link 
international aid to wealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also called on the government to reduce the debt of the 57 
poorest nations.  They are so right, because these debts are 
eating up what little revenue these small countries have leaving 
nothing for health and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's reaction to this should not be that everything 
it is doing is just fine.  I would remind the House that it was 
in 1990 during a full recession that Canada made its commitment 
to the UN to meet an objective of 0.7% of GDP.  At the time, 
Canada was contributing 0.48% of its GDP to international aid. It 
was already close to 0.7%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then, its contribution has continued to slide.  So much 
for the so-called “best country in the world”.  Right now, 
international aid stands at 0.25%, compared to the 0.48% it was 
at the time the commitment was made.  How many years have we been 
enjoying this period of prosperity of which the government is so 
proud?  Six years, seven years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is completely unacceptable and I am extremely 
grateful to women for adding their voices to those of all the 
people in Quebec and in Canada who think that Canada's position 
does not make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes so little sense that in committee I asked the 
president of CIDA and the minister responsible for international 
cooperation what percentage of international aid comes back to

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister was somewhat taken aback. At first she said it was 
30%. The president of CIDA had to step in to correct that 
statement by saying that it was 75%. Of all the international aid we 
provide, which is far from the objective set out by Canada in 
1990, 75% comes back to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything we heard about helping underdeveloped countries to 
repay their debts, about helping poorer countries by providing 
international assistance, about targeting the hundreds of million 
dollars announced by the minister is nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very worried because it is in the poorest countries of 
the world, mostly in Africa, that the status of women is the most 
vulnerable in terms of health and violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is even more horrible is that these women often have to 
face poverty and violence in countries that are fighting what 
seem to be endless wars, where the international community is 
reluctant to interfere because it fears that it may not be equal 
to the task. People have to realize that the international 
community has been extremely cautious. Unfortunately the troops 
the UN sent to Sierra Leone, for instance, became the laughing 
stock of the world, to make a long story short since my time is 
limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote a report that everyone ought to read, 
the Year 2000 Report of the United Nations Population Fund. The 
introduction begins as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gender inequality holds back the growth of individuals, the 
development of countries and the evolution of societies, to the 
disadvantage of both women and men. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts of gender inequality—the restrictions placed on 
women's choices, opportunities and participation—have direct and 
often malign consequences for women's health and education, and 
for their social and economic participation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They added something that is extremely important and important 
to this country too: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet until recent years, these restrictions have been considered 
either unimportant or non-existent, either accepted or ignored. 
The reality of women's lives has been invisible to men. This 
invisibility persists at all levels, from the family to the 
nation. Though they share the same space, women and men live in 
different worlds. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is true here, improved to some extent in certain areas, but 
it is poignantly true in developing countries and in the poorest 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to wait for the party opposite, on the eve of an 
election, to wake up and provide money instead of fancy words, 
wherever it wants to appear generous.  Canada does not have the 
situation under control by any means. Far from it.  This is 
shameful in the field of international aid.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for Mercier for her perceptive 
comments and also for the motion that has come forward today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make a few comments rather than ask a question if I 
may have a minute or two to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our leader spoke this morning about the women's march and the 
women's demands. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT65"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT65"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1620

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A group from the women's march on poverty met with our caucus 
recently.  When its representatives presented us with their 
demands I found that they fit like a hand in a glove with the 
kinds of things the New Democratic Party has been proposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe an election may be near.  Each party is coming up 
with a platform, and we are as well.  While I do not have all the 
details, I will go through some of their demands and indicate how 
closely they resemble some of our platform points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want to restore federal funding to health care.  We have 
argued for that all along.  They want to enforce rules against 
privatization of health care.  We have fought that fight as well 
and agree with the women of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want an additional 1% of the budget spent on social 
housing. The government has removed itself from social housing 
almost entirely and we have a crisis on our hands.  The 
government has done virtually nothing during this crisis.  We are 
with the women of Canada in saying that we must do something 
about social housing.  We are proposing 25,000 units per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want a promised national child care fund set up.  The 
Liberals made that promise in 1993 and it still has not been 
acted on.  I recently presented a petition in the House from 
parents and other members and friends of the Confederation Park 
Childcare Cooperative in my riding asking about that fund.  They 
were talking about the fact that two-thirds of Canadian women 
work outside of the home.  Not everyone has a situation whereby a 
family member can care for the children.  In this economy, if we 
want to be productive and just, we must have such a program.  We 
in the NDP are pushing for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want old age security payments increased.  We have fought 
the Liberal government's attempts to reduce old age security 
payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also supported the reduction of the head tax on 
immigrants.  The women of Canada have asked for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like my colleague from Mercier, we have also been calling for a 
restoration of our overseas development assistance to the target 
level of .7 of 1% of GNP.  We are saying that we have to get to .35% 
immediately.  In that, I agree with the women and with my 
colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we have adopted the proactive pay equity legislation. 
The women of Canada are calling for that and we support them 
entirely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I merely wish to state that the wishes, desires and demands 
brought forward by this group of women from Quebec and from all 
over Canada fit very closely with what the NDP has been 
advocating for years.  Perhaps it is no accident.  We have eight 
or nine women members in our caucus and they have had a great 
impact on bringing forward issues from the women of Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois is most 
decidedly happy to have the NDP vote in favour of its motion. 
Indeed, what would make us really happy is to have the entire 
House support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is an extension of the march of women, these women 
who have developed positions that we in the Bloc Quebecois are 
extremely comfortable with because we have been fighting for 
these proposals for years in the House of Commons. We are very 
proud to see that the Regroupement canadien des femmes fully 
recognizes that the provinces are the ones to act in matters of 
provincial jurisdiction, as the president of the Fédération des 
femmes du Québec put it so forcefully.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member had a quote that I thought was interesting.  She said that 
men and women live in different worlds.  We have an organization, 
Men Against Violence Against Women, which was created because men 
had been shut out of the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member agree that the issue of domestic violence is in 
fact not just a women's issue but a societal issue?  If she does 
agree, would she not support all men and women getting together 
to work together on effective solutions for the issue of domestic 
violence? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde: </B>This is an interesting question, Mr. 
Speaker, and I shall answer it in this way. The more one studies 
these questions the more one knows that the solution to violence 
toward women must be found in a context where there is no need 
for men to be violent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way to make it possible for men and women to be equal 
partners is to ensure that both can fulfil their total potential 
and then they will go on to be capable of a partnership of 
equals.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are finding more and more, and what some people have 
realized for a long time already, is that the couple must be 
based on a relationship of equality. As for help, the networks of 
men and women must be such that they create couples in which 
there can be an equal to equal relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the case not only here but also in the poorer 
developing countries.  I find the report so 
extraordinary because it states that the inequality between the 
sexes is considered a problem of the utmost urgency and is a 
priority for development.  To quote the report, it is “a matter 
of urgency affecting both human rights and development 
priorities”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inequality must be brought out into the light and solutions 
sought, with women first of all, in order to manage to attain a 
level of equality so that within the couple, the woman can assert 
herself in situations relating to her fertility.  There are 
millions— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member 
but her time is up. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on this 
opposition day on the World March of Women, I would like to 
welcome to the world my granddaughter Béatrice, who was born at 
midday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members: </B>Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie: </B>My wish for her, her mother and her 
grandmother is that we may live in a world where increasing 
efforts will be made to eliminate poverty and violence, and that 
she, her grandmother and her mother may be able in their 
respective communities to establish themselves and live in the 
equality that is vital to their development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to reread the motion we introduced this morning 
because every word in it is important in my view: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House immediately work to provide the means needed to 
fight poverty and violence against women as demanded by the World 
March of Women, particularly in the areas of income protection, 
health, international aid, violence and wage parity, so as to 
ensure a fairer distribution of wealth between women and men. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been repeatedly pointed out today, the government is in a 
position and has the means to help women with their demands. The 
budget surpluses can be used to do much to improve the conditions 
in which women and, by extension, their children live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The World March of Women, which brings together 5,000 groups of 
women from 159 countries, managed to get over three million 
signatures in support of its demands. These signatures are cards 
that will be delivered to Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This march has its roots in Quebec, where a group of organized 
women, of activists, came to the conclusion that many policies 
at all levels were not working and were harmful to women. Back 
then people probably did not think that the movement would 
spread to other countries, that these women would join forces 
with others to achieve the success that we are witnessing this 
week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took part in the march in my riding and felt solidarity 
between the men and women who participated. 
Colleagues, friends, fathers and even young men took part in the 
march. We could feel solidarity among us and, above, all 
dignity and pride in representing women who, after all, 
symbolize the perennial character of society and account for at 
least 52% of its members. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That march was necessary and it was a wake up call for many 
people. Wherever we are we must recognize that the poverty 
level is increasing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my area, an organization called La Table de la pauvreté 
conducted a survey. It found that in a riding which appears to 
be rich 25% of the families were living below the poverty line. 
I can assure members that living below the poverty line in a city is 
very difficult. It may be more difficult than in the country 
where people can sometimes manage to get by, which is not the 
case in cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In echoing what was said here this morning, I would like to talk 
about two groups in particular. 
The first one concerns aboriginal women and human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may wonder why I am the one speaking about the human 
rights of aboriginal women. It is because I had the pleasure—and 
I say the pleasure because I discovered a lot of things with 
them—to study with a group of aboriginal women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to salute them today. I am thinking about Fernande 
St-Onge, Suzanne Achini, Germaine Pinette, Marie Jourdain and her 
sister, Angéline, who came from Maliotenam to study on the south 
shore, in La Pocatière, in my colleague's riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They came to the south shore because they wanted an education 
that would help them make things better in their society. It was 
not easy for them to attend a boarding school and be away from 
their people for a whole school year. But they did it and today 
they hold values that they share with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those involved in the march of women are calling for a lot of 
things. To eliminate poverty and violence against women they are 
asking the federal government to support the human rights of 
aboriginal women as well as the welfare of their children, their 
family and their community and to respond to their concerns 
regarding housing, health, education, justice, territorial issues 
and resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are also asking the government to make funding available to 
national and regional groups representing aboriginal women so as 
to ensure their full participation in discussions on 
self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are asking that all programs include a gender equality 
analysis. 
When we realize that the aboriginal peoples have a concept of 
equality governing their traditions, this demand appears totally 
justified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are asking for changes to the Indian Act to restore the 
traditional rights enjoyed by women in the transmission of native 
heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are asking for sufficient funding for aboriginal women's 
groups to enable them to set up halfway houses and other 
services in the communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, they are calling for the full implementation of the 
recommendations of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, 
which includes a whole section on the equality of women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has already proposed a review of the rules of 
the dissolution of an aboriginal marriage, which discriminate 
against women by failing to recognize the right to equal division 
of matrimonial property.  It also proposes a bill to rectify the 
situation given the government's inertia on the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support funding for aboriginal women's organizations, as 
requested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to speak of another group of citizens for whom 
the march of women has made demands.  They are calling for the 
implementation of a progressive immigration reform so that 
domestic workers receive immigrant status as soon as they arrive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Domestic workers are all too often a source of cheap labour 
governed more by the terms of modern slavery than by positive 
immigration measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois proposes that the government tighten up the 
procedure for support of candidates for this program so they may 
be monitored by an immigration officer in order to prevent abuse.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also want the immigration reform to call for the elimination 
of the head tax for all immigrants. We want this federal tax to 
be abolished because the federal government is taking no 
responsibility whatsoever except in Quebec, I might add for the 
integration of immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another major recommendation concerning new immigrants would 
include persecution based on gender or sexual orientation as a 
specific reason justifying the granting of refugee status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1951 United Nations convention relating to the status of 
refugees stipulates that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of events...and owing to well-founded fear of being 
persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, 
membership of a particular social group or political opinion— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that membership of a 
particular social group must include people who are afraid of 
being persecuted for other reasons such as gender or sexual 
orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois wants the federal government to ensure that 
visa officers overseas interpret the definition of a refugee 
according to the court's ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have only one minute left, but I could keep going for hours. 
I just want to say that, as my hon. colleague pointed out, we 
are in favour of forgiving the debt of the 53 poorest countries 
of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As agriculture critic for my party, I want to add that the 
farming industry could very easily help to feed the poor on this 
planet. The problem has nothing to do with production but 
rather with the fair distribution of our production. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member started off by saying that it would be nice to abolish 
poverty.  That might be part of the problem.  There seems to be a 
sense that somehow we can legislate it away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will know from the prior debate that the statistics 
with regard to the lone parent situation is quite alarming.  In 
fact 14% of all families in Canada are lone parent families but 
they account for over 54% of all children living in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that as background, if the member is truly interested in 
finding constructive solutions to address the problem of child 
poverty, we will then have to deal with issues such as family 
break down.  I hope the member would acknowledge that and comment 
on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I would like to pose to the member another approach.  If 
we cannot legislate behaviour, maybe the approach within programs 
at all levels of government should be to create an environment in 
which children are raised to develop good, sound social, moral 
and family values so that when they grow up and take their place 
in adult society they will make decisions that will make sure 
they do not end up in poverty or in situations where 
domestic violence occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea is prevention, not remediation after we have the 
problem.  I wonder if the member has some comments on those. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie: </B>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question.  I must say there are all manner of means for 
lessening the tensions that lead to major difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reference to lessening tensions, since this morning I have 
been thinking that what we have been discussing is a series of 
steps that can be readily taken in relation to funding social 
housing, health, the aging population, and all that can be done 
to set up day care centres.  These ought to be able to 
accommodate very young infants.  All of this would improve the 
social climate in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very often, when one looks into social problems more thoroughly, 
one realizes that poverty is indeed very much what lies behind 
social problems.

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that the poverty in which people live is a natural 
source of conflict, so if part of the conflict can be eliminated 
through measures providing direct assistance to women, and when 
we are speaking of women then we are speaking of families, in 
order to provide them with more support and more of a chance to catch 
their breath, then probably there would be less tension within 
the family, which is what leads directly to violence. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member would like to 
discuss child care so maybe I could pose to her the principle 
that the most important thing for a child is a secure and 
consistent attachment with an engaged committed adult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure whether or not day care, as a simple solution, 
will necessarily provide that to all families.  As a matter of 
fact, it appears to me that we have both the urban and rural and 
accessibility and affordability of child care may be an issue. 
Does the member not believe that families should have more 
choices so that they include such things as allowing families to 
be able to provide direct parental care?  Right now more than 50% 
of families provide direct care.  Does she not believe that maybe 
promoting simply a child care solution is somewhat simplistic and 
does not take into account the realities of the Canadian family? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie:</B> Mr. Speaker, of course, in a perfect world 
each child would be able to stay home with one parent 
or both. 
Unfortunately that is not they way things are. Because of that, 
I think we need a family policy that addresses the needs of both 
parents and children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about $5 a day day care, it is 
a very effective way of helping parents. When parents can do 
another kind of work during the day, they come home at night 
with an open mind ready to resume their child-rearing duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must help families so that children can grow up in the best 
environment possible. 
We must be realistic, however. It is easy to say that the ideal 
situation would be this or that, but reality is different and 
we must find the means to address the major problems in our 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
would like to ask for the unanimous consent of the House so 
that, notwithstanding the standing orders governing private 
members' business, we can have one more hour tonight, October 
16, at the end of government orders, to allow debate on Bill 
C-213, dealing with shipbuilding, at report stage and, if 
necessary, at third reading stage. This bill is extremely 
important, and with all the rumours we hear about an upcoming 
election, it should be dealt with as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member said he would like one more hour. 
Does he mean tomorrow night or tonight, even though 
consideration of private members' business was this morning? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Yes, but if there were unanimous consent— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I just wanted to clarify the request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there unanimous consent of the House to proceed in this 
fashion?

around the world, governments have had to concentrate on and 
remind themselves of the enormity and complexity of this problem, 
a problem that continues in Canada despite the efforts of 
organizations, governments and individuals to eliminate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we speak about violence as a health issue, we include 
violence in all its forms, physical, sexual, psychological and 
spiritual, which then includes things like abuse, date rape, 
stalking, violence in the home and in the workplace, and violence 
by family members, acquaintances or persons in positions of 
trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that all forms of violence seriously impact on 
the health and well-being of women.  Along with immediate and 
more physical impacts of physical and sexual violence, there are 
many other possible consequences, which would include the 
possibility of HIV-AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, unplanned 
pregnancies and permanent pain, injury and disability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Violence against women and girls has serious psychological 
impacts.  They can become withdrawn, have depression and low 
self-esteem, have eating disorders and self-destructive 
behaviours which I have seen evidenced in my own constituency 
office with people having to deal with these issues.  They can 
have physical problems that are a consequence of poor mental 
health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have a simplistic viewpoint.  There is a whole range 
of areas to be considered.  These all have an impact on women's 
ability to empower themselves and to interact with their 
community, with their family and with society.  In a sense they 
have this area of their lives where they feel powerless.  I think 
that is wrong and it is very difficult to overcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health is a function of much more than biology and health 
services.  Health is also greatly affected and impacted by the 
social and economic factors.  The social impacts of violence 
against women can include hours of lost work, lost income, loss 
of home and isolation.  These can all worsen one's health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March of 1999 Health Canada released its “Women's Health 
Strategy” which had a significant component of the government's 
health agenda.  There were 64 commitments in the strategy which 
were based on a health determinants approach.  As part of the 
strategy, Health Canada undertook to integrate a gender based 
analysis.  We have talked about that many times in the House.  I 
think the fact that gender based analysis is integrated into the 
department's programs and policy development work will have an 
eventual impact on what we are trying to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gender based violence is a risk factor that women face and has 
wide ranging consequences for not only health but for the health 
system.  We had recent negotiations at the UN's special session 
of the general assembly.  It has been commonly referred to as 
Beijing +5.  It did address the violence issue as a health issue. 
States recognized that while some advances had been made in the 
provision of specialized health services for women and children, 
there was a lack of a co-ordinated multidisciplinary approach 
responding to violence.  We need to include not only health 
systems but education systems, media, workplace knowledge as well 
as the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the Beijing +5 commitments, we have a view now of 
a more holistic approach to the issue of violence against women 
and girls, including marginalized women and girls.  That would 
also then encompass those areas of provision for appropriate 
health care and services which on the whole are not well 
integrated in all our communities in Canada at the present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in the health sector we need to do more than treat the 
impact of violence.  This has been mentioned a number of times 
today.  We need to encourage and engage in preventing violence 
before it starts, in all of our systems.  Health care services 
should also recognize the symptoms of violence and provide 
support to women and girls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that we have marginalized women and girls in our 
society, often aboriginal women, immigrant and refugee women, 
lesbians, women with disabilities, older women, and women of 
minority, racial, ethnocultural and linguistic groups.  They need 
services that are sensitive to their culture, their situation and 
their life experience.  Unlike the reform alliance, one size does 
not fit all and cannot help all the people that need to be 
helped.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with those groups, women in isolated and rural communities 
also have difficulty accessing the services they require. 
Community groups and non-governmental organizations have been 
active in these areas and are to be commended for their work to 
date, which is essential to achieving the holistic system we are 
after, that holistic response to violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a few examples.  Through the Health Canada health 
transition fund, the University of Montreal completed a project 
to implement and evaluate the use of a screening tool in local 
community health service centres for the detection of women 
abuse.  Recently in my home town, the London based task force on 
the health effects of women abuse released a report recommending 
that health care providers screen female patients for abuse.  The 
Centre of Excellence for Women's Health has studied the 
relationship between health and violence among aboriginal women, 
the impact of violence on women's mental health and the provision 
of health services to women diagnosed with mental illnesses who 
are survivors of trauma and abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through family violence initiatives, Health Canada supports 
research related to health consequences of violence against 
women, particularly with a view to encouraging and educating the 
health care sector to respond more effectively to violence 
against women as a health issue.  This includes guidelines for 
physicians who are dealing with women abuse and the criminal 
justice system, a handbook for health and social service 
providers and educators and children who are exposed to women 
abuse, and a handbook for health and social service professionals 
responding to abuse during pregnancy, a particularly vulnerable 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Clearinghouse on Family Violence contains many 
resources that provide information to aid women, including women 
from these marginalized areas of our country and from minority 
groups.  I hope that women and men will access these resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will continue to promote respect for the physical 
and psychological integrity of all individuals.  Health and 
well-being are necessary to women's full participation in 
society.  Girls and women of all ages, I believe, cannot achieve 
any real equality until they are free from all forms of violence. 
I see around this House people who understand the issues, many in 
different parties but certainly on the government side of the 
House.  We have to understand the problem while we work at the 
solution.  Women and men, civil society, all governments and all 
members of the House must be engaged to eliminate violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very pleased on Sunday to come to Ottawa a day early to 
spend time with some of the people who came from London, Ontario 
to visit the Hill and participate peacefully in a demonstration 
that raises very significant issues for Canadians to understand, 
to take action on and to involve themselves in.  The government 
has been working in its various departments to continue the work 
that has progressed since we have been here.  I can only speak of 
the time since 1993, but this is not my first debate on these 
issues of violence against women.  I hope that by the time the 
grandchild of the hon. member opposite, who just had a grandchild 
today, reaches the age where she or he can enter the House, it 
not be in a similar debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are good people in the House and in the communities who 
believe this is an important area.  The Alliance Party in 
particular demonstrated earlier today some misunderstanding of 
some of the basic theory that goes with some of the issues we 
talk about in the House and that we have to follow through with 
our policy and practice in our ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will not be a debate in the House on violence that I do 
not want to participate in because it is important to recognize 
it, not to hide behind the statistics that say everything is 
getting better.  It is always important to stand up and say that 
there are still marginalized people, that we are still 
underserviced in many ways and that resources, both human and 
monetary, have to go into these areas for progress to continue to 
be made.  I believe that the government, with its gender 
analysis, will help integrate all those solutions into the policy 
development of the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the members of the House for participating in this 
worthwhile debate.  I also thank the member from the opposition 
party who put forward this motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I am aware that there is quite a list of speakers who 
would like to get involved in this debate.  I was wondering if 
there would be unanimous consent for us to forgo questions and 
comments so that more speakers might be involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> 
Does the hon. member for Cariboo—Chilcotin have 
unanimous consent of the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am hoping 
that the member from London can help me on this.  I know she has 
worked hard on this issue and believes strongly in equality for 
women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to women's issues or moving policy on women's 
issues it seems to be really difficult.  When policy does get 
changed it gets changed so that it penalizes women, such as in 
the case of the EI program or moving forward with child care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One area that has bothered me a lot is the area of the defence 
of provocation.  This defence is used if a man is insulted or his 
honour is besmirched on the basis of an insult.  We excuse the 
murder done to a woman because he was insulted.  We are making 
excuses for anger when it comes to violence against women.  It is 
in our laws.  It is very symbolic.  The law says that a man can 
react violently to what he perceives as a verbal insult.  It is 
very discouraging to think that we cannot even make small changes 
like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another little thing I want to bring up, which is not 
little for the women involved.  Everybody knows that Canada is a 
huge country with vast areas of isolated communities.  The 
federal prenatal health program has just cut funding for women in 
Dawson City.  They can no longer get any assistance to go to 
Whitehorse to give birth.  They do not have a choice in this. 
They cannot stay in Dawson City to give birth.  They have to 
spend at least two weeks in Whitehorse near the hospital but the 
funding to enable them to do that has been cut.  Most of these 
women are not wealthy.  They live on very fixed incomes and the 
accommodation is expensive.  Why would something like that 
happen?  It is just unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the women members on the other side of the House are 
working hard to change things but why do we not have the changes 
that we need?   Why do we have something like this?  The amount 
of money we are talking about is only around $7,000.  It is such 
a minuscule amount compared to our full budget.  Why was it cut? 
It has a drastic effect on the lives of women at a time when they 
need help to give birth in a place that is safe.  They do not 
have any other choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I respect the hon. member 
opposite.  I also know she works very hard because I have had the 
pleasure of working on committees with her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I will address the question that she raised with respect 
to the provocation defence and the criminal justice system.  I am 
sure the hon. member is also aware that this defence has been 
used successfully in the past with women who have been repeatedly 
attacked by their spouses in a situation where there was ongoing 
abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one of the areas we have to look at when we make changes 
to the criminal justice system.  On the one hand it is seen as an 
out, but in other circumstances there are real reasons it is used 
as a valid defence.  I see a need to examine this area. I believe 
it is currently being examined in order to look at how we can 
better get at the goal without necessarily changing the exact 
section of the code she is referring to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to pay attention to the comments made earlier in her 
remarks about child care.  I remember being part of a woman's 
caucus in 1993 when we on this side of the House had a minister 
who was very much prepared to go forward to the provinces with 
child care policies.  There was no take-up from many of the 
provinces. 
That was at a time when there were deficits in a lot of the 
provinces.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, though, a child care agreement has recently been 
negotiated inside the health care agreement with the provinces 
and territories.  Money would be available for those provinces to 
choose where they would put the resources and programs in 
relation to their populations.  I believe in Ontario the dollar 
amount is $800 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of those provinces may in fact choose to go with child 
care.  I understand that B.C. and perhaps the member's area, 
although I am not certain of the latter, may go with increased 
child care.  However, other provinces may very well choose to 
spend those extra resources in areas where the resources are most 
needed.  I understand that where fetal alcohol syndrome is more 
of a problem some of the provinces are looking at increased 
spending in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand my own province has not given any indication, and I 
know there is a dire need.  The women's programs in my city could 
use more beds every night in our shelters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand I am out of time.  I thank the hon. member 
opposite.  On the health care, I am sorry, but I will have to 
take that at another time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to join in the debate on this opposition 
day motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to begin by saying that the Government of Canada supports 
the World March of Women.  As a member of the women's Liberal 
caucus, I offer support to the women of Canada as they make their 
demands and look for ways and means to better the lives of all 
women.  As chair of the Canadian Association of Parliamentarians 
on Population and Development, I see this march as being an 
important initiative that demonstrates the increasing level of 
global linkages being created by Canadian women, NGOs and other 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of my constituents in Etobicoke—Lakeshore participated in 
this march for women.  They too joined and they want the 
government to know that they are working to improve their lives 
and the lives of all women all across the country and the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to focus on the issue of family violence and take up from 
where the previous speaker, the hon. member for London West, left 
off.  I will quote from a recent Canadian publication that is 
especially relevant to this world march.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Violence against women knows no geographical, cultural or 
linguistic boundaries and it affects all women without regard to 
their level of income.  For many women, poverty adds another 
dimension to the pain and suffering they experience as a result 
of violence.  Poverty limits choices and access to the means to 
protect and free oneself from violence. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much has been said here today, but I think one thing that is 
very clear to me and that was left with all of us is the fact 
that the Canadian Alliance has proved that it does not understand 
the issue of pay equity, which is a very important issue for 
women.  As well, it believes in a one size fits all approach to 
equality.  It should not speak to them about measures to address 
visible minority women, aboriginal women or women with 
disabilities. This is very sad.  This march underscored the 
importance of those issues for women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, I want the women in my riding and all women to know 
about the resources we have within the federal government to 
address the issue of family violence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The quotes I mentioned earlier came from a document called 
“Breaking the Links between Poverty and Violence Against Women: 
A Resource Guide”.  I think that report adequately reflects the 
perspective of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is committed to both ensuring that 
women are safe in their workplaces, their homes and their family 
situations and to reducing the toll that violence takes on 
Canadians.  We are also committed to finding solutions to such 
problems as poverty, which affects the health and well-being of 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada has some responsibility here.  It is the lead 
ministry in co-ordinating the family violence initiative.  As 
part of this initiative the Government of Canada continues to 
help individual Canadians and communities increase awareness and 
develop more effective ways to prevent and respond to the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have we done?  Let me take this opportunity to go through a 
number of initiatives.  We have allocated $7 million a year for a 
range of activities across seven federal departments and 
agencies, some of them very important, including Canada Mortgage 
and Housing Corporation, Canadian Heritage, Health Canada, the 
Department of Justice, the RCMP, Statistics Canada and Status of 
Women Canada.  The initiative entails collaboration with an 
additional six departments that are not funded through this 
initiative but act on the problem through their regular budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has introduced a wide range of legislation, 
policies and programs dealing with violence.  On this side of the 
House from time to time we draw attention to those programs and 
policy areas.  They are managed through a variety of 
interdepartmental collaborative mechanisms, including, for 
example, the interdepartmental working group on family violence, 
the interdepartmental working group on crime prevention and 
community safety, and working groups dealing with related issues 
such as Canada's drug strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other federal initiatives.  The building healthy 
communities program provides crisis intervention services for 
aboriginal communities.  Other initiatives deliver intervention 
and treatment programs to offenders in correctional institutions 
and other facilities.  Those programs have an impact on family 
violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through successive initiatives we have established a baseline of 
information on the nature and extent of family violence in 
Canada.  We were able to share this with our international 
partners in this area.  Research that is done in Canada is 
research that is up front and at the same time very progressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have conducted research and provided data on such important 
areas as violence against women, children and older persons, and 
the utilization of transition houses and shelters.  We have 
conducted ongoing research to evaluate the effectiveness of what 
we are doing and to address the gaps we have identified in the 
consultations we have had with the provinces, territories, 
frontline workers, and NGO and service agencies.  We also provide 
research to policy makers and services providers to give them up 
to date information so that they can work on the ground and with 
communities to address family violence in the most effective way 
possible.  We have the data.  We have the research.  We have the 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well as addressing this awareness and understanding of the 
problem, we see the issue of family violence addressed daily in 
the common media and in the multidisciplinary, multi-sectoral 
intergovernmental approaches to this very important issue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Family violence is a long term problem that requires a long term 
collaborative response involving all sectors of Canadian society. 
I think all of us in the House recognize that this is not an 
easily solved problem.  Frontline workers, community groups, 
members of the public, and all the others working together on 
this issue recognize the difficulties involved in dealing with 
family violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have had a special national campaign against violence. 
There are two phases.  The Canadian Association of Broadcasters 
has been working with us in this regard.  With $1 million coming 
from Canadian Heritage, Health Canada, Justice Canada, Solicitor 
General, Status of Women and National Defence, the CAB has 
provided approximately $20 million of airtime for a series of 
television and radio messages revolving around three themes: 
violence against women, violence against children and media 
literacy.  We thus have partners in this endeavour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example of partnership is an interdisciplinary project 
on family violence.  It is a complicated issue.  It is an issue 
that all of society has to deal with.  The World March of Women 
highlighted the issue for us.  The government is working 
assiduously with all departments and partners in this regard.  We 
have provided handbooks.  We are doing everything we can to 
ensure that the issue comes to the fore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the government is cognizant of the issue.  The 
women's march has highlighted it.  We will continue to work. We 
will continue to provide the necessary resources to ensure that 
we fight violence against women and that families are safer 
places in which individuals can grow and develop. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I total the 13 demands it seems to 
me they would probably cost about $20 billion a year.  These 13 
demands are listed as immediate demands, so when these are paid 
for I presume there would be more demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It occurs to me, from my experience dealing with families and 
family counselling, that two of the greatest pressures in 
families that cause disruption, violence and loss are financial 
problems and loss of health by a member of the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the amount of money Ottawa spends on interest 
payments. It is about three times what we spend on health care 
and education.  We casually talk about this $33 billion surplus. 
This money came from taxpayers.  I have difficulty understanding 
many elements of this argument.  Why are we taking money from 
families when this is one of the greatest causes of stress and 
violence in families?  Why can the government not see that it 
should reduce the tax level and leave money in families? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party has suggested a $10,000 tax exemption for any adult 
member who pays taxes and any adult dependant and $3,000 for each 
child.  That would mean a family of four would pay no taxes on 
the first $26,000 of income.  They would then pay at the rate of 
only 17%, except for the highest earners of over $100,000 who 
would pay at 25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member consider that some of the fundamental 
problems causing the difficulties we are discussing are in fact 
promoted by the government and its own policies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is amazing how we can 
reduce any kind of discussion down to the issues of taxes and 
dollars and cents.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke about the problem of violence against women and violence 
in families.  It is a very difficult and complex issue.  It is an 
issue we find all over the world in all classes in society and in 
all groups, racial, cultural, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke about what we are doing in Canada to address that issue, 
to bring it to the attention of the public, to work with partners 
and to ensure that Canada and Canadian women join with women 
across the world to resolve that problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of taxes and putting more dollars in the pockets of 
individuals to resolve this is not the answer to violence.  We 
know it happens in families who are millionaires.  It happens to 
families who have big houses and who have lots of money in their 
banks and pockets.  This is not a money issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not surprised that my colleague does not understand what 
this issue is all about. 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague across the way for her 
remarks.  I want to focus on one point because time is limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The women's march talked about the lack of housing as being a 
major cause and perhaps the effect of poverty among women.  Today 
on the Hill there was another related event.  The Canadian 
Association of Food Banks held a news conference to talk about 
two studies it had released.  There are now 707 food banks in 
Canada and 726,000 people using those food banks, which is an 
increase in the last year.  Many of those people live in very 
poor housing.  That is one of the problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It talked about the fact that while we have a minister for 
homelessness in Canada, we have a lack of a national housing 
strategy.  I am now paraphrasing from the remarks in the study 
this morning.  It also indicated that the minister in charge of 
CMHC announced further research and consultation but that that 
was really not what we needed.  We need funds committed to a 
national strategy and targets for the creation of affordable 
housing.  So there is a link between poverty, particularly 
women's poverty and the lack of affordable housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if my colleague could tell me how we might attack this 
problem?  There has been a retraction by the federal government 
on this issue.  I wonder if she could tell us how we might get 
ourselves into a position where we have a decent strategy for 
housing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as you know from my 
background, I spent six years as the chair of the Metro Toronto 
Housing Authority which houses 125,000 people in what is called 
rent geared to income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the situation of the lack of affordability.  I know the 
linkages and the connections.  If the member would remember what 
we did fairly recently in the area of homelessness, those people 
who are on the street either through eviction, psychiatric and 
other kinds of problems, and the work we have been doing with 
communities to alleviate those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of affordability is one we have to tackle.  Despite 
what we have in terms of CMHC and the present RRAP funding, et 
cetera, I have to admit that we have to work on the issue of 
affordability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us all join together.  The issue of affordable housing is 
very important.  All of us in the House have to find some ways to 
take responsibility for that issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing mine with the member for 
Québec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy to rise today to speak on this motion put 
forward by the Bloc, of which I am especially proud. Last week, 
along with a thousand women from my riding, I walked in 
Trois-Pistoles, Cabano, Pohénégamook, in some neighbourhoods in 
Saint-Éleuthère, Sully, Estcourt, Rivière-du-Loup, Saint-Pascal and 
La Pocatière.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I felt very at ease because many of the issues raised by the 
women had already been supported by the Bloc Quebecois. The 
efforts made by the Bloc to improve EI were obviously considered 
very credible. The Bloc position on poverty, as explained by the 
hon. member for Québec throughout the province, also enjoys a 
lot of support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard from a lot of people. For instance, after a speech I 
made at one of the demonstrations, a young mother told me “You 
talk about women and men living in poverty, but I would like you 
to talk about the children of these families who have to make 
due with what is put on the table”. That stuck in my mind. That 
is why I am reminding the House today that the 13 demands these 
women made to the federal government would also help to 
eliminate child poverty. There are no poor children without poor 
parents and especially poor women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also saw a young woman who came to talk to me because someone 
had said in a speech that it was sad that, on the 8th of each 
month, some people did not have any money left from their welfare 
cheque to pay for current expenses. A young woman came to me and 
said “I still have money left from my welfare cheque on the 8th 
of each month, but every day I have to make sacrifices to make 
sure my children will have what they need so we can get through 
the month, and I will give you examples”. She was very proud to 
tell me about the necessities she did without so that her 
children did not have to do without. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the testimonies I heard during a march where I felt a 
lot of enthusiasm. I would say I found in that march the first 
organized movement. All the men in Quebec, in Canada and, 
basically, in the world must be grateful to women for having 
taken the initiative to turn things around, to say that 
productivity and profit will no longer be the only things that 
matter, that other factors will have to be taken into account in 
developing policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And this was done by women from our own communities. They are 
real people who started marching from the Lower St. Lawrence area 
or from Matane on to La Pocatière, and then on to Montreal and 
Ottawa. This march reflects a reality. It was not a debate among 
intellectuals but concrete action which must be recognized. Those 
responsible deserve our thanks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also heard testimonies that did not necessarily relate to the 
issue of economic poverty. 
On that day there was much talk of domestic violence.  One woman 
came to speak to us about the situation she had been through. 
This was a woman who did not necessarily have any financial 
problems, but she lived with a very controlling partner who 
subjected her to violence.  This violence is something else we 
must fight against and eliminate from our society.  When I 
listened to this woman speak, I was also listening as a father, 
because I have two daughters.  I have a son and I want him to be 
able to grow up in a society in which we have done what is 
necessary to eliminate such behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we are not living in a country with financial 
difficulties.  We are living in a country which has resources, 
wealth.  There is a major problem distributing this wealth. 
Today, I was expecting a much more open attitude from the 
government towards the demands that have been presented.  I am 
very proud that the Bloc Quebecois has brought this debate to the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, on our tour, I said to the women “You know what you 
are doing today”.  When we had been walking for an hour, an hour 
and a half, and might have been a little tired, we said “What 
you are doing today will make it to the floor of the House of 
Commons and it is the Bloc Quebecois that will take it there. The 
Leader of the Bloc Quebecois has made a commitment to do this and 
if you listen to the debate on Monday, October 16, you will see 
that all your work has been for something, that the federal 
government will be called on this, and that there will be a 
vote”.  This vote will take place tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that we on this side are doing our job. 
At this time, we take great pride as MPs and as politicians in 
showing that we are behind the people from our community, behind 
the people who want to see more social equity in our society. 
Personally speaking, this has been my greatest source of pride 
since becoming an MP, that we were able to provide support to the 
women organizers of this march and the men who were in solidarity 
with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the 13 demands I find particularly of interest and of 
particular appropriateness to my riding, among them the ones 
relating to female seniors living below the poverty line. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1725"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT78"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT78"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1725

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has a very concrete proposal that will affect 
not only older women living below the poverty line but also 
single men and couples, relating to providing these 506,000 
people with $1,180 more a year, to increase their income by 
11.6%.  This would be for those who are truly below the poverty 
line and who need the money to make ends meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are examples in all of our regions, in the little parishes 
where older ladies are living in small rooms or apartments and 
having trouble getting by.  The same thing happens in our cities, 
and sometimes also in rural areas.  There are more and more women 
living alone. 
Women are living longer, but they have not had the opportunity to 
pay into a retirement plan. They have to rely on the Canada 
pension plan. The fact that the CPP has not been improved the way 
it should have been is hurting women the most. We have a concrete 
proposal that would meet the demands of women while dealing with 
elderly men who live alone and are similarly poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say, there is a crying need for social housing. The 
Bloc Quebecois has raised this issue on numerous occasion. We are 
still doing it and will continue to do so. Statistics do not give 
the whole picture, we must stress the principle that people are 
entitled to decent, affordable housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When 25% or 30% of one's income goes to housing, there is enough 
left for other things. But when one has to spend 50% or 60% of 
one's monthly disposable income on housing, things go out of 
whack. Some people cannot afford food for the last week of the 
month. This in turn creates health problems, and problems across 
the whole system. I believe this is another concrete step the 
government should move on and take a different attitude from what 
we have been seeing here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that tour I discovered something. I discovered how women 
manage with next to nothing, often all they have is very little 
means and a lot of determination. This is why these women are 
first rate organizers, they have the right stuff to get something 
like the march of women off the ground. They are used to doing a 
lot with very little money, and they managed to do a lot with 
very little money. 
We have seen the demonstrations in Montreal and Ottawa, and we 
will see the one in New York. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the initiative taken by the women of Quebec five years 
ago in the bread and roses march, now repeated on the world 
stage, must be given real attention by all those involved in the 
distribution of wealth as elected representatives.  This is the 
clearest and most specific message we have had on the fact that a 
society creating an enormous amount of wealth but unable to 
distribute it properly has no future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This applies to the incomes of seniors who live alone, public 
housing, funding for groups of women to enable them to help their 
colleagues, so that when there are groups of people with problems 
of self esteem they my be supported, so that in the case of 
domestic violence, women may have support to get out of it, in 
order to realize their full potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last demand involves the whole issue of maternity leave.  In 
Quebec, we have a parental leave program that meets needs, that 
is a full complement to the family policy of the Government of 
Quebec, and the federal government in an effort to ensure its own 
visibility is refusing to act on it.  I find that totally 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by pointing out to the Liberal government that 
the demands made by Canadian women include recognition of 
Quebec's right to opt out to be able to fund these activities 
according to its own criteria. Canadian women, in my opinion, 
are 100 years ahead of the current Liberal government. They 
already recognize that Quebec is a distinct society. There are 
already existing models and the government should accept the 
model developed, it should allow Quebec to develop at a 
different pace from the rest of Canada, it should avoid coast to 
coast standards. This is an improvement compared to all the 
positions taken by the government in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a strong movement, a movement that has drawn the 
attention of the Quebec government, the federal government and 
the international authorities. An effort must be made at all 
levels. There is room for additional effort by all levels of 
government or organizations.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five or ten years from now, we must not be facing the same 
situation regarding child poverty and we must not come to the 
conclusion that, as parliamentarians, even though we were not 
there 10 years earlier, we did not do our job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the Bloc Quebecois will definitely have done its job. We 
presented a motion on this issue, here in the House. There is 
now a debate and a vote will follow. Again, I say to all the 
women who took part in the World March of Women that the Bloc 
Quebecois is very proud to have worked so that this vote can 
take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, no more violence, no more poverty. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member will know that the Government of Canada spends about 
$340 million a year on housing in Quebec, most of which supports 
the 140,000 low income families in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand it, and maybe the member can clarify it, 
Quebec's main concern is that it is not being offered its fair 
share of social housing assistance based on the current share of 
Canadians with housing needs.  Quebec, like other provinces, is 
being offered federal money to cover the cost of the shared 
national portfolio of social housing.  In Quebec's case this is 
lower than a province's share of current housing needs.  Quebec 
in fact is getting proportionately more of the current investment 
in social housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to comment very briefly on the member's issue with 
regard to maternity and parental leave.  It is an issue that is 
very important to me.  It was Bill C-204 that brought it to the 
House and which was incorporated in the throne speech and budget 
2000.  I am pleased to say that it will to be implemented on 
January 1, 2001 so that families can have up to one full year of 
maternity and parental leave to provide direct parental care to 
their children.  Therefore it is in fact happening 
notwithstanding that the member said that it should happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise those issues for the member simply for his comment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, the first thing I would like to 
point out is that this is not the federal government's money. It 
is taxpayers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is not some Santa Claus who gives us 
presents.  This is our money.  The $32 billion surplus in the EI 
fund did not come from the federal government.  It came from 
employers and employees.  It is this money that the federal 
government would like to hand out.  This is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is paternalistic of the federal government and Quebecers no 
longer want any part of it.  It is an approach women no longer 
want.  They no longer want to be treated by the Liberal 
government as though they were being given a gift.  It is 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for social housing, original approaches are being developed 
in Quebec.  There are ways of funding what we need.  And the 
little boxes of the federal government have no place in it.  It 
is a pity, and because we do not fit into your little boxes, we 
are not entitled to the money which is rightfully ours?  I think 
that we must take another approach and make sure that we get 
adequate assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to maternity leave, I challenge the hon. member.  If 
a woman now earning $7 an hour gets 55% of her salary, that makes 
$3.50 an hour.  If she works 40 hours at $3.50 an hour, she will 
wind up with $150 to live on.  Even if her maternity leave went 
on for ten years, there is nothing in it for her. What is needed 
is flexible maternity leave entitling people to an adequate 
amount for a certain number of weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this demand from the women of Quebec and of Canada that 
the federal government is unable to satisfy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, responding to the member's concern 
about the affordability of housing, I would raise the issue of 
affordability for seniors' housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lady who owns a very modest house on a very modest piece of 
property phoned me.  She was in part dependent upon $13,000 that 
she and her husband had managed to put in the bank while they 
were working.  They had a little bit of extra income to go with 
their old age pension.  When he died she did not have the money, 
because of the taxes she paid, to pay the taxes on her house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I am raising is, would it not be better for those 
people who think it is so great for the government to collect 
money and then decide who to give it back to, to just leave the 
money in the hands of those people who are at the bottom end?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a policy in our party to take about 1.5 million people 
off the tax roles.  Would that not be preferable to taking the 
money away and then saying that there is not enough to give back 
so Canadians can pay their taxes? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, we all want tax reductions, but the 
hon. member did not talk about the thousands of people who do 
not pay taxes and still do not have enough money to live a 
decent life. There are 506,000 senior Canadians who do not have 
enough money to meet their basic needs, including 359,000 single 
women over 65 and 82,000 single men over 65. Even with the best 
tax reduction possible, these people would not get a penny more, 
because they do not pay any taxes as it is. They do not have 
enough to live on. Most of them have worked all of their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is especially true of women who have worked 30 or 40 years 
at home, taking care of their children. Their husbands may have 
died or left them, and all they have left today is the basic 
pension. That is all they have to live on. A tax reduction does 
not mean a thing to them. A tax reduction will not solve 
everything. It is however part of the solution, because the 
federal government has too much money for its own needs. The 
wealth needs to be redistributed differently and that is the 
message sent by women. 
<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to take part in this debate on such an important issue, 
namely the status of women and their march against poverty, 
against exclusion, for solidarity, and all that synergy that 
concerns us as parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have often spoken in the House about these things. I am 
thinking of poverty resulting from a scarce jobs, from a lack of 
the necessary resources to make ends meet or to improve one's 
quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The march of women is a way to fight against exclusion so there 
is no more suffering for children, so there is more equity 
between men and women and, above all, so there is no more 
psychological and material violence against women. 
Making a few changes in our justice system will not be enough. 
We need better social policies. We need this government to have 
social priorities. We have seen was the seven year social 
deficit of the Liberal government has wrought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I toured Quebec with regard to the issue of poverty in April, 
May and June, before the summer recess, and I met the 
representatives of some 400 community organizations. They all 
told me they had difficulty meeting the urgent needs of people 
living below the poverty level, living on the minimum wage, 
unable to afford decent housing, unable to have a certain 
quality of life and to put enough food on the table for the 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say bravo to the march of women. Things have to change, the 
message has to be heard. 
I take pleasure in pointing out that the Bloc Quebecois are the 
ones who initiated this debate with the motion by the hon. 
member for Longueuil, the opposition critic for women's issues. 
I congratulate her and I know that she is involved in a real 
struggle to get the MPs to grasp certain realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament, I feel a sense of involvement and I 
trust that the members on the government side will be able to 
bring a positive influence to bear on it as an election is 
looming.  We know that this is the time to hand out the goodies, 
and we can only hope that some of the goodies will help improve 
the status of women.  There is an urgent challenge to respond to 
the immediate and pressing needs of women and children, and men 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a family is living below the poverty line, as my colleague 
for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques has said, 
often the husband puts pressure on the wife to make ends meet, 
to manage the family budget and be able to meet pressing family 
needs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This world march of women has raised a great many issues and the 
Bloc Quebecois has some concrete proposals: $45 billion over 
five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as social housing is concerned, this is a battle that we 
have been engaged in since 1993.  We all know that the federal 
government has backed away from its commitment to social 
housing.  It is unacceptable that not another cent will go into 
social housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put a question to the Minister of Public Works today. He 
replied that negotiations were being held and that there had 
been a deputy minister change in Quebec.  There are negotiations 
going on in Quebec City, but there is also a reality in the 
field. 
Why did they change the deputy minister?  I could perhaps say 
that they also took a while to attend to Quebec's needs to enable 
it to meet the people's public housing needs.  The federal 
government offer on the table does not meet Quebec's needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know what the government thinks about the situation of public 
housing in Quebec.  It fails to meet the need and is inadequate 
for the population.  We understand why Quebec does not want to 
sign this agreement, because once it signs, it will be forced to 
respond to the pressing need of the public.  We have the support 
of groups wanting more public housing in Quebec.  So we will come 
back to the response by the minister, who is a member of this 
Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are calling for a second investment in health care, an 
additional $10 billion to correct the shortfall the provinces 
have faced since this government has been in power.  This 
additional $10 billion is essential to enable the provinces to 
meet the needs of an aging population, and women have a longer 
life expectancy than men. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also calling for financial assistance for home care.  It 
is often women who end up taking over the care of sick 
grandparents or children.  If there is not enough money in the 
health care budget, women will have to pick up after seven years 
of the Liberal government's social deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are calling for a fund for daycare and an end to the hide and 
seek with national child benefit. The government says it has 
invested over $9 billion in this child benefit.  I would point 
out to this government that it took $720 million away from 
daycares and child care services. It was supposed to set up child 
care services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us stop playing hide and seek with this money because the 
federal government said we could use it to help families. If 
there is not enough money to help families, to set up a true 
child care system in Quebec, the government should stop telling 
us that it is good, and invest more money so that we can have a 
real family policy including both a national child benefit and a 
child care system to help women go back to the labour market 
without having to pay an arm and a leg so that their children are 
taken care of during the day or at night while they are at work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we need $2 billion to have a child care fund; this money 
should be turned over to the provinces, they would manage it. It 
is said that the only province that has initiated such a program 
is the province of Quebec. Hopefully Quebec's child care 
initiative will be taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to old age security, we are asking for $3 billion. 
We know that women live longer than men. The guaranteed income 
supplement should be increased by $1,100 a year to help women 65 
and over who often live in dire circumstances. Through the years, 
the purchasing power of the elderly gradually diminished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking for another $50 million for various groups. 
Shelters helping victims of domestic violence are underfunded. 
They need a place where they can provide women in need and their 
children with a safe place, emotional support, and counselling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking for $30 million over five years to help community 
groups that promote equity and social justice, and help the 
community maintain some degree of social balance and peace.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Community organizations are at the forefront, helping these 
women, children and men, by providing food banks, clothing, help 
with the children' homework and educational services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since it came into office, the Liberal government has reduced by 
15% the funding for these organizations. No additional help has 
been provided to help them meet their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the government to do its homework and make some 
adjustments. Meanwhile, the Treasury Board is racking up a $160 
billion surplus. The finance minister is untying the purse 
strings with too much caution, and the people below the poverty 
line are hurting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some $32 billion was taken out of the EI fund. Some very minor 
changes were made last week on the eve of an election. But we all 
know that some people will still not be eligible for EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing goes for the Canada social transfer. Some $17 
billion worth of adjustments were made recently. That is not 
nearly good enough. We need better health care, because people 
living in poverty require more and more health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sick people who have money can afford the medication they need, 
like aspirin or other such remedies not covered by pharmacare in 
Quebec. We all know that these people need money in their 
pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People tell me that they are sick, that they have got the flu, 
but that the medication is not covered by a drug plan. These 
people need health services that are increasingly more effective 
and supportive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Home care services are under provincial jurisdiction to 
adequately meet the needs of the public. The federal government 
should stop brandishing the maple leaf whenever it hands out $1 
million. There are channels of investment, such as the Canada 
social transfer for health, education and income security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are pressures at both the provincial and federal levels. 
When cuts are made to the Canada social transfer, it means that 
cuts are also made to the support that the provinces can provide 
to the public. Things must change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But at the same time, the federal government still finds $500 
million to invest in various propaganda programs, such as the 
Canada information office, to promote Canadian unity. The 
government has no problem finding money for such programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could have talked about child care services, but as my time is 
up, I will close my remarks by saying that I hope the government 
will hear this message and will be flexible enough to follow up 
on women's demands.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi—Le Fjord, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to congratulate my colleague for her speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Usually, the Bloc Quebecois strives to defend the interests of 
Quebec and of the whole world. What I am interested in is 
defending the interests of our respective regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc is always asking for massive transfers, like the 
transfer of funds with regard to employment insurance. We know 
what happened. In the area of health, there is more money 
available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is giving money to the provinces for 
health and education through equalization payments and the 
social transfer. Equalization is a kind of transfer where the 
Government of Quebec can use the money as it sees fit. 
The federal government uses criteria such as the unemployment 
rate, the poverty index and the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can my colleague tell me if the Government of Quebec has a 
system of equalization payments and social transfer to the 
regions that ensures fairness? According to the figures from the 
regional board in my area, I know that we are short $75 million a 
year for health care. We can hardly provide health care services 
to our population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say there is nothing wrong with defending the interests of the 
whole world and the best interests of Quebec, but is there a way 
of knowing if we can defend the interests of our dying regions 
through provincial equalization?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member who 
has crossed the floor.  He has gone over to the other side to 
defend the Liberals' upcoming policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the member opposite that we come from the same 
region.  We were born in the wonderful Saguenay region and I am 
very up on the problems there.  He has told me that we are 
defending global interests, but we are also defending the 
interests of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I speak of being able to restore transfers to the 
provinces, it is so that they will be able to meet the needs of 
the public.  When the federal government makes cuts, it follows 
that the provinces have problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the member opposite is used to crossing the floor of the 
House, perhaps he could take the debate to the right parliament, 
the one in Quebec City, and have things rectified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it unacceptable that, when he was on this side of the 
House, he criticized the Liberal government with respect to the 
Canada social transfer but, now that he is part of that very 
government, he starts criticizing the way Quebec operates.  I 
think he is speaking to the wrong audience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here to defend the interests of the regions and of Quebec 
and I wonder what the hon. member is doing sitting over there. 
I believe the hon. gentleman is in the wrong parliament. 
<P><A NAME="LINK260"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can 
tell you that this member here will stay put. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened carefully to what my colleague from the Bloc 
Quebecois had to say. I also took part in the March of Women 
last Sunday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also participated in a study carried out by my party on 
poverty in Canada in general and among women in particular. We 
noticed that women's poverty mostly affects single mothers and 
their children. Very recently, the government introduced Bill 
C-44 to change the eligiblity criteria for EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my hon. colleague for Québec, who sits on the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development, think these new 
changes will help women and families with young children qualify 
more easily for EI benefits? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a very easy 
question to answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes made were mere cosmetic changes. The Bloc Quebecois 
expressed concern several times last week when the government 
announced the changes. They do not go far enough compared to all 
the money that was taken out of the EI fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new changes will not help many women. A lot of them will 
still be excluded. Two out of three women do not go on maternity 
leave because they cannot qualify for parental leave; they are 
not eligible for EI benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With only 55% of their income, these women will not be able to 
afford maternity leave. I am sorry we did not come up with more 
suggestions concerning, for instance, women who have seasonal 
jobs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK261"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds—Dollard, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the member for Ottawa West—Nepean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to rise in the House to talk about the World 
March of Women, a very important event for Canadian women and all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since March 8 of this year, many women from coast to coast have 
been working hard to make this march a memorable success. For 
more than seven months now, they have been organizing numerous 
activities at the local, regional and national level to make 
Canadians more aware of the cause of women.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For days, they have been marching hand in hand with their 
sisters from all over the world to fight poverty and violence 
against women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And tomorrow, the World March of Women will culminate in New 
York, when women from more than one hundred countries will speak 
with one voice before the United Nations. As a matter of fact, it 
was in the Big Apple that women started making demands almost a 
century ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Armed only with their will, their courage and their 
determination, women took to the streets to speak out against 
their dangerous working conditions and their meager wages. These 
women rose above prejudice to make sure their message was heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then other women throughout the world took up the torch in the 
name of justice and equity. Little by little, progress was made: 
the right to vote, respect of fundamental rights, massive entry 
into the labour force. Gradually, women took their place in 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, in Canada, a country known as one of the most progressive 
countries, women also had to fight hard to acquire the status of 
a person, to have access to higher education or to have the right 
to vote. There is no doubt that their collective progress has 
been slow, too slow, and often very difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We needed the work of pioneers like the Famous Five to give 
Canadian democracy its true meaning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But today we can see the concrete results of that progress. 
Canadian women are present in all areas of our society. 
They travel in space, they push back the limits of science, they 
amass great wealth, and they are elected to our democratic 
assemblies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite this considerable progress, however, the road to 
equality is long and obstacle-ridden.  For example, Canadian 
women are still considerably under-represented in the rapidly 
developing areas of science.  Far too many are still in insecure 
employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there are other still more serious problems that remain with 
us.  In 1997, 88% of the victims of spousal abuse in Canada were 
women, and 65% of these reported more than two incidents of 
violence.  One victim in four has been involved in ten or so such 
incidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government is very much aware of these problems.  Moreover, 
poverty and violence toward women are among its highest 
priorities. In the area of justice, we have stepped up our 
efforts in recent years to eradicate violence toward women and 
children.  Women cannot develop their full potential except 
within a society that is totally free of violence toward them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years we have made the necessary changes to make 
substantial improvements to the situation.  We have passed 
appropriate and effective gun control legislation.  We have 
amended the criminal code in order to bolster the provisions on 
high-risk offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999, we also passed three extremely important pieces of 
legislation.  These have made it possible to provide more rights 
to the victims of violent acts, to promote the personal safety of 
women and children, and to ensure that the legal system provides 
a better response to the needs of abused women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite this significant progress, we are firmly determined to 
continue our quest for a society in which everyone, men and 
women, may live in safety.  That is why we have been working so 
hard to eradicate the evil at the root of it by fighting poverty 
vigorously, especially poverty among children.  We are helping 
families to ensure that each child gets a good start in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unanimous and historic agreement on health care concluded by 
the first ministers includes considerable investment in women's 
health and help in early childhood.  We are continuing to 
increase our help to Canadian families through the national 
child benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between now and 2004, we expect to invest an additional $2.5 
billion annually in this initiative, which has been called the 
most innovative social measure in the country in the past 
generation.  We are also investing more in public housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are making available effective initiatives such as the Canada 
prenatal nutrition program, which gives considerable help to 
pregnant women in Canada.  We have also decided to double the 
length of maternity and paternity leave to enable mothers and 
fathers to devote the necessary time to their family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These actions merely form the basis of our fight against poverty 
and violence against women.  More than ever, we have to do more. 
And so we will.  Yesterday, the Prime Minister met the 
organizers of the march.  He reiterated his support and that of 
the Government of Canada. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He reiterated our intention to work closely with all our 
partners to improve the status of women.  However, our 
government is well aware that legislative measures alone will 
not ensure equality.  They must absolutely be supported by 
effective and flexible policies that take into account the 
realities and diversities of women's lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, our government launched an action plan in order to 
advance our government's policy on equality. 
This plan, which includes the initiatives of 24 federal 
departments and agencies, enables us to conduct comparative 
analyses between the two genders. This revolutionary approach 
allows us to accurately analyze the impact of each legislative 
measure and policy on women and men. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new data helped us learn important lessons. First, it was 
imperative to approach the issue of gender equality from a new 
perspective. We can never eliminate the anatomical, 
physiological and psychological differences between men and 
women. Men and women will never communicate, make decisions or 
solve problems in the same way. To be sure, we are always 
striving to achieve equality, but we must do so while taking 
these differences into account, not by imposing uniformity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1999, the federal Minister of Health introduced, among 
other initiatives, the women's health strategy. This innovative 
strategy will allow us to not only target inequalities but, more 
importantly, to meet the specific needs of women when it comes 
to health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also took measures in the area of justice with our National 
Crime Prevention Strategy, and we are firmly determined to 
continue in that direction. We have not given up, far from it. 
Rather, we want to intensify our efforts. We know that our 
comparative analyses by gender can be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are working to design new tools and new methods to promote 
equality in all areas of our society. However, we are also aware 
that governments cannot do everything alone. In Canada, there 
are currently over 3,000 women's groups that are active. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through its equal opportunities for women program, Status of 
Women Canada provides financial assistance and professional 
services to groups of women working at the regional, provincial 
and national levels for equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998-99, we contributed $8.2 million in funding to 267 projects 
and groups throughout the country.  To advance a cause, ideas 
and a vision are needed, but much more is often needed as well, 
such things as determination, courage, tenacity and willingness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a number of days now, participants in the World March of 
Women have left the beaten path to take up just causes, values 
and ideas.  The Government of Canada supports their efforts.  We 
have invested close to $1 billion in promoting the World March of 
Women nationally and internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we begin a new century and a new millennium, it is wonderful 
to see women throughout the world speaking with one voice.  They 
are sending us a clear message that poverty and violence against 
women must be ended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I am sure that all members of the House will want to join 
with me in congratulating women on their efforts and sacrifices, 
which will help improve the status of women both at home and 
abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to work together to ensure that this historic march 
signals the beginning of a new era, an era which will see us 
step up our efforts to build a fairer and more equitable 
society, a society in which equality of the sexes will be not a 
noble objective but a daily reality.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was glad to hear the hon. member 
mention the famous five.  These are women who were strong, sought 
independence and sought the independence of others.  I am glad 
that we will be honouring these famous five.  I thank him for 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am concerned about is the continuing independence that 
people seek and are thwarted often by government policies.  For 
example, our health care system leaves people who are waiting for 
heart surgery in line to the point where they die.  In our health 
care system cancer patients do not get the diagnosis they need to 
save their lives.  In our health care system contaminated blood 
was given to hepatitis C victims.  After many years of struggle 
the lawyers have been paid, but the hepatitis C victims have 
never received anything from the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These matters cause me great concern.  I realize that nearly 
three times as much money is spent by Ottawa on interest on the 
national debt as on health care and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another matter which concerns me is the violence perpetrated 
against women and others.  For example, people are brought to 
justice and then turned loose before they are prepared to take 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>David Bruce Jennings was out for a short time, reoffended, put 
back in again, and now he is out.  He has never taken treatment. 
The police are telling everyone to be careful, that this guy is 
in the community.  He has been told he cannot go near schools. He 
cannot be near kids under 16.  He is not to go near parks, but he 
is out on the street.  Why is that so? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>David Trott asked not to be turned out because he knows he could 
not resist reoffending.  When he was out he stole three different 
vehicles in three different days.  Now he is in custody and they 
are assessing him to see if he is fit to stand trial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is government policy not giving us a justice system that 
will protect women, children and families from these kinds of 
violent offenders? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member of the Canadian 
Alliance for his question. I will deal with his first point 
regarding health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1996, the federal department of health has been setting up 
centers of excellence for women's health. We are talking about 
five focal points for multidisciplinary research financed over 
six years. By studying what determines women's health, they will 
help shape policies. Women's health is a very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that is very important is child poverty. Our 
government has been promoting policies to fight child poverty. 
It is important for every child to enjoy equal opportunity right 
from birth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have programs to help mothers even before the birth of their 
child. For single and low income families, the government of 
Canada has introduced benefits to help mothers and mostly 
children. We all know that when children are born, their brain 
is made up of billions of neurones that are not yet 
interconnected. Children need the right stimulation to make sure 
that when they start school, they are ready for it. If they are, 
they will experience less problems during their teens. They will 
not drop out and will have fewer run-ins with the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For us Liberals, policies are there to ensure that in the long 
run children will become good citizens.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I met 
with the representatives of 250 women from Peterborough who were 
on Parliament Hill yesterday.  I was struck by the universality 
of the issues they mentioned, many of which my colleague has 
addressed:  homelessness, poverty, and the disparity between rich 
and poor here and overseas.  They also mentioned in particular 
education, higher education and access to higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could my colleague could comment on what has been done in Quebec 
as compared with what has been done in Ontario to improve access 
to college and university for all students but particularly for 
women? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very important to 
mention that at the end of the past millennium, instead of 
erecting statues to the glory of our Prime Minister or the 
Liberal government, this government decided to invest in our 
youth and provide them with grants to go to university or 
college. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, 23,000 students have received bursaries from the 
federal government. This is important, because it means we have 
faith in our country's future.

will be a précis version of a number of the things I want to say.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I want to congratulate the hon. member for 
Laurier—Saint-Marie for bringing forward this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to congratulate women everywhere in Canada, and 
especially the Fédération des femmes du Québec, who played a 
leadership role in holding the march of women in Canada and 
throughout the world and who are responsible for the truly 
extraordinary and impressive show given on Parliament Hill 
yesterday. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have long believed that women will only have social and 
political equality when they have economic equality.  I trust the 
House will indulge me as I talk a bit about some of the measures 
that have been taken to improve the economic status of women in 
our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refer to a number of measures in the budget for the 
year 2000-01.  It is a budget that very much builds on steps 
begun in past budgets.  It is a budget that has been made 
possible by the sacrifices of a lot of Canadians.  Because women 
are among the lowest income Canadians, that means particularly by 
Canadian women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we see now that low and middle income earners in 
particular will benefit most from a number of measures in the 
last couple of budgets with reductions in their net personal 
income tax reaching an average of at least 18% annually.  Again, 
the majority of those low and very moderate income earners are 
women and especially those with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also seen the reindexing of many tax measures which 
means that people at a lower income will now see their incomes 
rise without them becoming taxable or without increasing their 
tax burdens.  It means that benefits such as the national child 
benefit and the GST credit for low income Canadians will also be 
indexed to inflation so that those benefits will not erode over 
time.  For senior women it means that inflation will no longer 
compromise the real value of the age credit for old age security 
or the income level at with OAS begins to be reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of measures with respect to business are of particular 
interest to women and their economic status as well.  Women are 
now starting up four times as many small businesses, women under 
30 compared with men under 30.  They are increasingly involved in 
trade so a number of the tax measures and initiatives with 
respect to developing trade and with respect to reducing the tax 
burden of small businesses will therefore benefit a large number 
of women. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I truly see the irony in what I just said, 
which is that women will benefit from the measures announced in 
the budget because their income is lower than that of men in 
Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize very well that there is a great deal still to be 
done.  The majority of those living in poverty in Canada are 
women.  Ninety per cent of senior women on their own are living 
in poverty.  That is a shameful statement to have to make about a 
country like ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations calls us the best country in the world in 
which to live, and we are, but women in this country only rank 
ninth in the world.  I will not be satisfied, nor will the 
government, until we have taken more measures to improve the 
equality of women and to ensure they benefit to a greater extent 
from the opportunities that a growing and prospering economy 
which we have now offers them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those responsible for yesterday's march, I express my 
personal appreciation because it certainly lends support to 
public awareness of the need to improve the economic status of 
women and assist the efforts of all of us in the House who are 
working toward that end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It being 6.15 p.m. it is my duty to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to follow up on my question to the minister with respect to the 
national infrastructure program for which funds were provided in 
the last federal budget.  My question had to do with the 
situation of agreements between the provinces and the federal 
government and, in particular, with the lack of agreement for 
such an infrastructure program with the municipalities in the 
province of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard right up to today that agreements have now been 
signed for flexible infrastructure programs involving the 
provinces and the municipalities in British Columbia, 
Saskatchewan, Manitoba, even in Alberta and in all the maritime 
provinces.  There is still no agreement with the province of 
Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first national infrastructure program initiated by the 
government was an enormous success in the Peterborough riding. In 
both the city and the county, it was very well received.  We had 
almost 100 projects.  They were projects of all sorts, ranging 
from buildings to highways, bridges and things of that sort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key, I believe, to the success of that program was that in 
the end, subject to the approval of the province and the 
Government of Canada, the choice of infrastructure project was 
made by the municipality.  It was the municipalities of 
Peterborough that defined what was important from the point of 
view of infrastructure for them at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the debate that is going on with the province of 
Ontario is one in which Ontario wants to dictate what is 
infrastructure.  I have heard different rumours.  It has been 
suggested that because of the tragedy of Walkerton the province 
of Ontario wants to stress sewer and water facilities.  I have 
heard also that the province of Ontario wants to stress highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like to say is, why should we, the upper levels of 
government, define what is important for the infrastructure of a 
township or city?  Only that township or city has a sense of what 
is important for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, let us say we defined, as Ontario appears to want, 
that all the money should go to water projects.  Let us say there 
is a municipality that has been consistently, right up to now, 
investing in water and sewer projects. 
Why should we penalize it in a national infrastructure program 
when its priority might be something else?  It might be bridges 
or a building of some sort.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only the municipalities know what is important for 
infrastructure at this time.  From here in Ottawa we cannot look 
across all the provinces to the thousands of municipalities and 
make judgments on what is important for each of them.  The only 
way we can do it is to trust the municipal level of government, 
the local level of government, as we did in the first national 
infrastructure program and have the municipalities pick the 
projects, submit them to a panel of provincial and federal people 
which will have established criteria, and then move the projects 
along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, in Peterborough the last time that method worked 
extremely well for almost 100 projects.  I could take the hon. 
members to any of those projects and they would agree with me 
that they were well worthwhile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are looking for is a program that will improve the 
infrastructure of municipalities all the way across Canada.  The 
municipalities have asked us again and again for this project. 
The federal government, the federal cabinet, our government, has 
agreed that this is a priority.  The money was earmarked and ready 
to flow in our spring budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have mentioned, the majority of provinces in Canada have 
now signed on.  I have read those agreements.  There are 
particular emphases in different provinces but there are 
possibilities for infrastructure projects of all sorts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the minister the question again.  Where do we 
stand with an infrastructure agreement in Ontario?  Can we expect 
such a program soon? 
<P><A NAME="LINK269"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, at the 
outset, I want to compliment the hon. member for Peterborough who 
has worked so very tirelessly advocating on behalf of an 
infrastructure program in Canada.  Certainly his success in 
bringing in infrastructure programs for the benefit of his 
community is evidence of their importance to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The infrastructure Canada program was announced in the Speech 
from the Throne last fall.  The Minister of Finance also 
allocated $2.65 billion to the program in his February budget, 
with a pledge to have the program in place by the end of the 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member pointed out, we now have agreements in eight 
jurisdictions.  Agreements signed to date represent a total 
federal investment of some $740 million.  Combined with the 
contributions of our partners in other orders of government, the 
total investment climbs to $2.2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This infrastructure program was designed in consultation with 
groups like the Federation of Canadian Municipalities and with 
the provinces and territories which established the priorities. 
The majority of the projects will be submitted by the 
municipalities themselves.  As the member for Peterborough has 
indicated, it has turned out to be a very successful approach to 
infrastructure programming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first priority is green municipal infrastructure, such as 
water and waste management treatment and solid waste management. 
Secondary priorities include:  local transportation; 
infrastructure supporting culture, tourism and recreation; rural 
and remote telecommunications; high speed Internet access for 
local institutions; and affordable housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiations between the Government of Canada and the remaining 
provinces, particularly Ontario, are continuing.  We are very 
hopeful that we will reach agreements soon with all the 
remaining jurisdictions and, indeed, have them in place before 
the end of the year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The motion to adjourn the House is 
now deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly the House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.24 p.m.)
