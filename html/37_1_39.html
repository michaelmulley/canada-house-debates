<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION REPORT 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege this morning as my 
rights as a member of parliament have been abused again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak of the annual report of the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission which you just tabled in the House immediately prior 
to my speaking, but which has been reported extensively in the 
press this morning.  For example, the Toronto <I>Star</I> and 
other papers have reported it at length. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This contempt of parliament by this unelected and unaccountable 
commission and the Minister of Justice is quite obvious.  This is 
the second time in a month and a half that the commission has 
leaked one of its reports to the media prior to it being tabled 
in the House of Commons.  I raised this as a question of 
privilege on February 15, 2001 at page 714. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to government doing business, I sometimes have to 
wonder if this House means anything to it or is it just a 
superfluous adjunct as it jumps over the heads of this 
institution to communicate directly with Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I ask that you speak out and protect the privileges 
of this House and its members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Erskine May describes contempt as: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either House of 
Parliament in the performance of its functions, or which 
obstructs or impedes any Member or officer of such House in the 
discharge of his duty, or which has a tendency, directly or 
indirectly, to produce such results may be treated as a contempt 
even though there is no precedent for the offence. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do have precedence here.  There are news articles, as I have 
referred to, the Toronto <I>Star</I>, the Hamilton <I>Spectator</I> 
and the London <I>Free Press</I>, detailing the exact contents of 
the annual report of the Canadian Human Rights Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Annual reports to parliament are to remain secret and 
confidential until tabled in the House of Commons.  Other 
agencies, crown corporations, the auditor general and so on are 
able to respect this tenet.  Why is it that the Canadian Human 
Rights Commission believes that it is above the normal protocols 
and trashes them instead of respecting them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member of parliament for Provencher raised a similar point 
of order on March 14, 2001 at page 1646 of <I>Hansard</I> when he 
argued that his rights as a member of parliament were breached 
because of the contempt shown by the Minister of Justice to this 
House in excluding members of parliament from briefings on a bill 
prior to it being tabled in the House.  Yet the media had the 
contents and substance of the bill published prior to its 
tabling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you ruled on March 19, 2001, at page 1839, that the 
member for Provencher had a prima facie case of privilege.  Today 
we have a repeat of the same situation.  The media had the 
contents and substance of the annual report while the members of 
parliament are in the dark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Human Rights Commission falls under the purview of 
the Minister of Justice.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the commission is a quasi-judicial body, it still has to 
answer to both the minister and to parliament.  There is a 
pattern here where the minister has contempt for this honourable 
and venerable institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, the situation is becoming intolerable.  I ask that 
you find that there is prima facie case of the breach of my 
privileges.  Since you ruled that way so recently, and it was 
obviously ignored, I ask that you recommend that the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs deal with the matter 
sternly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree generally with what the 
hon. member has said.  It is unfortunate, though, that he has 
chosen to trivialize such an important issue by somehow alleging 
that this has something to do with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the commission reports to parliament.  The Speaker just 
rose and tabled the report.  This has nothing to do with an 
action of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An action of the government, which I regret, occurred some days 
ago in the House for which instructions were clearly given about 
a protocol and giving these kinds of media briefings under 
embargo, which, as we now know, were not respected by members of 
the media.  The Chair indicated to ministers that these things 
could only be done if done in a secure way, which I read to be a 
lockup or some such thing, but that was a different issue 
altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker ruled on the previous item and we accepted the 
ruling that he gave of prima facie and it is still before a 
parliamentary committee for further study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case today, this was not a report that was given for the 
government to table.  This was a report given directly to 
parliament and tabled in the House by the Speaker of the House. 
If someone has breached that, which obviously has happened, then 
I agree with the hon. member across.  I do not object to what he 
has raised in the sense that it indicates rules were broken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where I do disagree with the hon. member is on the personal 
comment he made about the Minister of Justice, alleging that she 
was personally involved.  He should retract his comment as he has 
no proof of that.  The hon. member knows that the minister does 
not report that document.  He knows that the minister is 
responsible for the estimates of that organization.  That would 
be the same as alleging that because I am responsible for the 
estimates of Elections Canada, I am somehow responsible for the 
tabling or non-tabling, or the actions or non-actions of the 
Chief Electoral Officer, or that somehow the Minister of Justice 
would be responsible for adjudication of the supreme court.  That 
is inappropriate and the hon. member knows that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I agree with the principle of what he has raised, the 
gratuitous accusations against the Minister of Justice and 
against the government are wrong and should be withdrawn.  That 
being said, I agree with the point that he has raised about the 
inappropriateness of the commission or anyone who by negligence 
wilfully allows a report to leak out. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have to sit here with some amusement watching the 
feigned indignation of the government House leader over these 
personal comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that because of the 
proximity in time, given your ruling, there is an opportunity 
here to bring this matter also before the procedure and house 
affairs committee to look at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader is right.  The Minister of Justice 
is not personally responsible, but this goes to the principles of 
governmental and ministerial responsibility. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We have a situation here where a report, 
which was prepared by an officer of the House of Commons, a 
person who reports to the House of Commons directly, has 
obviously been given to the media, based on the information I am 
hearing in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report stands permanently referred to the justice and human 
rights committee of the House.  It seems to me that the 
appropriate course in the circumstances is for that committee to 
undertake its study of the report, as I am sure it will in due 
course.  It is free to call the head of the commission and anyone 
else it sees fit to come and explain what has happened and the 
circumstances.  It seems to me that would be the appropriate 
course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the procedure and House affairs committee, as part of the 
work it is doing on the question of release of documents that has 
come to it as a result of my previous ruling, want to look at the 
matter, it is of course free to do so.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would suggest to the hon. member for St. Albert, the 
government House leader, the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough and all hon. members is that we 
let this go to the justice and legal affairs committee.  If the 
committee has concerns about what has happened and feels that 
something inappropriate happened, I will allow the hon. member 
for St. Albert, if he wishes, to bring this matter back to the 
House.  We will treat it as a matter of privilege and deal with 
it at that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think that since this is a matter involving an 
officer of the House, I do not see that today there has been 
necessarily a breach of the privileges.  The matter can be 
investigated by a committee.  The committee can come back to the 
House or the member can come back to the House and raise it as a 
question of privilege when we have heard the evidence on it. 
There will be evidence.  This matter is before the committee and 
making a finding today that sends it to the committee again is 
unhelpful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware that the procedure and House affairs committee is 
looking at the other matter as a result of my ruling and I am 
sure that should it choose to do so, it could look into this 
matter also, but certainly the justice and legal affairs 
committee can do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that hon. members can deal with it there and then, if we 
have to, we will come back to the House and deal with it here.

for our veterans but the statement by the minister is that the

as Thursday with regard to allowing benefits for those Canadians 
who served in the gulf war or Balkans.  They are to be awarded 
full veteran status.

right, to demand that all announcements be made here.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, could the 
parliamentary secretary inform the House when he will be 
providing an answer to Question No. 31, which asked the 
government to announce the date upon which it will finalize a 
just and full settlement for our merchant navy veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Question No. 31 is of course

<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the government tabled a response to my questions, 
Question Nos. 1 and 2, regarding Huey helicopters and Challenger 
jets, for which I waited close to a year.  There are gaping holes 
in those responses.  Some of those questions have not been 
answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess, Mr. Speaker, I am looking for guidance from the Chair. 
Where do individual members of parliament go from here when 
questions are not answered on the order paper?  I waited almost a 
year only to find out they had not been answered.  That is a 
violation of our individual rights as members of parliament.  It 
does not allow us to effectively do our jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member has a wonderful remedy under 
the rules.  He could put down the questions that were not 
answered on the order paper and right after that have them 
transferred for debate.  He could have a great time at 6.30 some 
evening with a four minute speech on the subject and a two minute 
reply from a parliamentary secretary.  I am sure he would find 
that experience rich and rewarding.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
that point of order, I could not help listen to your suggestion 
to my hon. colleague about putting it on the late show.  That in 
itself presents a problem.  When we raise a question on the late 
show we expect the minister to be there to discuss the details of 
the question.  However we have a parliamentary secretary 
sometimes— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member.  It 
is not for the Chair to defend who speaks and when.  I am sure 
that if the hon. member pleaded with the minister he might get 
it.  I have seen ministers here at late shows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B>  When was that?

committee. 
I will agree to hear such arguments and I encourage hon. members 
to examine this type of motion with my representatives as soon 
as the bill is returned to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we are all aware, there is often a very tight timeframe for 
the report stage, which may be a hindrance to debate.  I am 
relying on the cooperation of hon. members to ensure that the

opinions when it examines each preliminary decision at report

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to be able to speak to  Bill 
C-2 at report stage, not so much for the amendments that are 
included therein, apart from the one on clause 9, but rather 
because the debate in committee clearly demonstrated that Bill 
C-2 did not meet the needs of those who appeared before the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of putting forward an indepth reform of the employment 
insurance plan, Bill C-2 proposes no more than a few amendments 
that have been called for for a long time, particularly the 
suppression of the intensity rule. Since 1997 this rule 
penalizes all seasonal workers. We are telling them that if we 
take away 1% of their benefits every 20 weeks, they should be 
more encouraged to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government always assumed that seasonal workers preferred to 
collect EI instead of working. After denouncing that for many 
years, a statistical study finally proved that there was no 
correlation between the two. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1025"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Workers in seasonal industries want to work but unfortunately 
their jobs do not last the entire year, and the fact of 
penalizing these people by taking away up to 5% of their 
benefits after three years would not in any way make them work 
any harder as there were no more jobs for these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people often work in natural resources such as forestry, 
fisheries, tourism or in areas where they cannot be readily 
trained for work in other sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 did not really meet the requirements set out by over 
60 groups that systematically came to tell us it was vital to 
reform the system much more thoroughly.  Fortunately the 
committee unanimously adopted a motion I proposed, which 
provides: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development and 
the Status of Persons with Disabilities report to the House of 
Commons all other amendments to the Employment Insurance Act and 
that this report be tabled to the House no later than June 1, 2001. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee will do the work the government refused to do 
during the period between the election and the reconvening of 
parliament. The government could have avoided this delay of 
several months and introduced a Bill C-2 that really reformed the 
employment insurance system.  It did not do so, but all 
members of the committee assumed their responsibilities, 
listened to the evidence presented and clearly said they wanted 
to recommend other changes to the employment insurance system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the current bill must be improved as much as 
possible, and this is what we are doing with the amendments 
proposed.  There is one that is much more important, and 
we will discuss it later. It concerns the elimination of clause 
9, the one that would, if the bill were passed as it stands, 
make it legal to misappropriate funds from the employment 
insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that it has now grown to between $34 billion and $35 
billion. With the provision in the bill that would allow the 
government to set the premium rate instead of letting the EI 
commission do it, the government could evade the application of 
the act and not have to put the money back in the EI fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we get to the discussion on this clause, people will see 
that all the opposition parties have a common position in this 
regard, a position set out by the Bloc Quebecois but also 
supported by the auditor general who stated in committee that he 
preferred section 66 of the current act, in spite of its 
weaknesses, to this clause, which would allow the government to 
determine the premium rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are at report stage on a bill we have to improve as much 
as possible, a bill we were unable to amend substantively to 
really reform the employment insurance system because this is 
impossible at the parliamentary level. Once Bill C-2 was 
introduced we could only amend its clauses as they stood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, we are not allowed to deal with important issues 
such as eliminating the waiting period. Those who have been on 
employment insurance know what we are talking about.  It is the 
first two weeks after one has stopped working, when one has no 
income. That is an archaic rule dating back to the time when 
people qualified only after a number of weeks of benefits. Now 
they start paying premiums from their first hour of work. We 
have a system that is generating a huge surplus, so why could we 
not deal with this issue and eliminate the waiting period? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also, the fundamental issue of the creation 
of an independent EI fund. I think this will give rise to a 
major debate that should be held in committee for its June 1 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the increase in coverage from 55% to 60%. We know we now 
have an employment insurance system where about $18 billion in 
premiums is collected year after year and about $12 billion is 
put back into the system. There is a surplus of about $6 
billion, which is used to cover the government's general 
expenditures. This is being done by collecting premiums from 
people earning wages or a salary of less than $39,000. This 
means that people earning more, or those who do not pay into the 
system, do not contribute their share toward this portion of the 
government's general expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, considers the EI system as a payroll 
tax. This is a very regressive tax, because not everyone pays 
into the system. Even though he had been a member of parliament 
for about 20 years, it is here in the House that the Prime 
Minister found out that he pay, EI premiums. Such people are 
not paying their share. There should be a substantive debate on 
this issue to ensure that since the surplus is so high 
premiums are lowered or the conditions that apply in the system 
are improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a basic condition that could be amended: benefits could 
be raised from 55% to 60% of average earnings.

910 hours to qualify. The government's logic is the same here as 
with the intensity rule. It is saying to young people “If the 
requirement is 910 hours, you will have to work harder to 
qualify”.  Under the intensity rule it said “If benefits 
are reduced, people will be more anxious to work”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics show this was not the case with the intensity rule.

and that today they are the victims of intolerable 
discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we revisit this issue before long because 
we have no right to discriminate against our young people. We 
have no right to treat them like second class citizens, 
particularly as we are experiencing a period of economic growth. 
They must be able to reap the benefits of the effort that has 
been made to fight the deficit.  We must not continue to take 
their money from them since they contribute right from the 
first hour of work without qualifying. Only some 25% of our 
young people qualify for benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as all the conditions are concerned, these are 
examples of issues that should have been dealt with in Bill C-2 
but were not. 
That shows the extent to which a thorough reform of EI is needed 
to make it more adequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many amendments were proposed but they were rejected. I give 
the example of the retroactivity of the intensity rule. 
According to our proposal, the retroactive period would have 
gone back to January 1, 1997, instead of to October 1, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, since it has been clearly established that 
rule was inefficient and that its only result was to penalize 
seasonal workers and frequent claimants, why not give these 
workers their money back? It is becoming obvious that they have 
been penalized without reason and that they should have received 
that money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We introduced an amendment to make the payment retroactive to 
January 1, 1997, but the government rejected it because it would 
cost $250 million, which is not 
even 1% of the $35 billion surplus. If that is so much money for 
the government, think what this represents for seasonal workers, 
for people who contributed to the financing of the government 
due to an infamous and unacceptable rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the reason Bill C-2 must be amended. Everybody must 
realize that in the next few months the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources will be making a special effort to make 
recommendations for a thorough reform of EI to the government, 
one that will go a lot further than this half-baked Bill C-2.

Commission in the House.  The commission, as an office of 
parliament, reports directly to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rose immediately thereafter, pointing out that my privileges 
had been breached by the fact that the report was all over the

should have been confidential until tabled in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After I left the House at 10.25 a.m. I asked one of the pages to 
obtain the report for me.  The page went to Journals and Journals 
said that it did not have the report.  Journals checked with

a.m. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At 11 o'clock the chair of the Human Rights Commission is having 
a press conference to speak about the report at the press 
conference centre.  At 10.30 a.m. we do not have the report in 
the House available for members even though the chair is going to 
have a press conference to speak to Canadians.  We have been 
denied a copy of the report that has been tabled in the House 
already.  There are none available.  None have been delivered.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK47">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-2, an act to amend the 
Employment Insurance Act and the Employment Insurance (Fishing) 
Regulations, as reported (with amendment) from the committee, and 
of the motions in Group No. 1. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to raise a few issues 
based on the amendments that have been placed before the House at 
report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance is very much in support of an employment 
insurance program.  We feel the government is justified in 
providing support to the unemployed to help them in times of 
stress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard many of the witnesses who have appeared before the 
committee over the last four or five weeks.  We have heard many 
witnesses talking about the government's approach to making some 
minor amendments to the Employment Insurance Act through Bill 
C-2.  In looking at the motions that have been allowed, with all 
due respect to the Chair, I have some concern with the process of 
limiting members on how they would present amendments on 
legislation, whether it would be through a more public process in 
the House or a more limited public exposure process in committee. 
I do want to point out that I have a concern with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would like to make a few comments on a number of the 
motions that have been allowed to amend Bill C-2 at report stage. 
In my understanding, Motion No. 4 adds an exemption for a person 
who is considered to be a return claimant or a new entrant.  We 
recognize that there are some exemptions such as maternity and 
paternal reasons.  There is an omission that we agree needs to be 
addressed, and that is the omission of benefits for claimants by 
reason of illness, injury or quarantine.  We have no problem in 
rectifying that omission in the amendments to the legislation. We 
feel it is justified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just flipping through the pages of those amendments that have 
not been allowed, we come to an amendment that is trying to 
address what is considered to be an unfairness.  The feeling 
seems to be that someone who has fraudulently misrepresented the 
facts should not be penalized and should be treated the same as 
any other claimant under the EI program.  We have difficulty with 
that, because one of the changes the government has put in is 
that those who have made a claim for employment benefits of more 
than a week in the last 10 years fall into the category of having 
30% clawed back if they make more than $48,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If somebody who collected two weeks of insurable earnings 10 
years ago is put under this 30% clawback for any income over 
$48,000, it is hard to justify not penalizing someone who has 
misrepresented the facts and who perhaps fraudulently claimed 
earnings he or she did not make.  It is hard to imagine that 
people would not be penalized for doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not be supporting that amendment.  We find it very 
difficult to justify supporting somebody who deliberately scams 
the system while penalizing people who may have collected 
employment insurance 10 years ago for a couple of weeks.  We are 
not prepared to support this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I want to give most of my attention to clause 9 in this 
legislation, which causes us great concern.  Clause 9 just 
supports the trend of the Liberal government, ever since I came 
to the House seven and a half years ago, of removing 
responsibility from the House of Commons, from parliament, and 
putting it into the hands of the cabinet, into the executive 
branch of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been a consistent trend in legislation.  Through 
regulations, through using orders in council or through 
legislation itself, the Liberal government is transferring the 
responsibilities of the House of Commons, of parliament or of an 
independent commission to the hands of a handful of people in 
cabinet.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from almost every witness that this is not acceptable. 
They had great difficulty with cabinet setting the rates of the 
employment insurance fund.  They saw it as an intrusion of 
government into something that government should be removing 
itself from.  They saw it as a grab for the wealth that has been 
created through surpluses in the EI fund.  They felt it was a 
means for the government to try to control where the surplus 
goes.  They felt that the surplus would not go where it is 
intended to go and where legislation says it must go, which is to 
the workers and the employers who contribute to that fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the fund has a $35 billion surplus to date.  There is 
concern that the government wants to get its hands on that 
surplus and take it out of the EI account.  There is concern that 
the government wants to control rate setting so it can control 
this unwarranted increase in surplus in the EI fund.  The chief 
actuary for the employment insurance fund has said that the 
surplus is unnecessary, that $35 billion is far too much and $15 
billion would sustain the employment insurance program even at a 
time of recession, and that lowering rates to $1.75 for the 
employee would still sustain the employment insurance fund at a 
level during a recessionary period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the evidence is there that this $35 billion surplus is not 
necessary.  Yet we have a cabinet that wants to take control of 
rate setting so it can maintain that surplus fund to use for 
purposes outside the Employment Insurance Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We very much oppose this clause and support the amendment put 
forward by both the Bloc and the Canadian Alliance to delete that 
clause from the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noted with interest an amendment that was put forward by the 
Conservative Party.  Unfortunately, we in our party only got it 
this morning and did not have time to deal with it.  We noted 
with interest that the Conservatives have proposed an amendment 
to that clause which details how we would treat rate setting and 
how we would re-establish the commission's authority.  However, 
although we like the concept, there is no evidence to support the 
numbers that have been proposed.  Nothing suggests they are the 
right numbers, so we would not at this time be prepared to 
support that amendment.  We feel that more time is needed and we 
feel that more evidence is needed to support the numbers brought 
before us for consideration today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My remarks have been a brief summary of where the Canadian 
Alliance stands on the amendments being proposed at report stage. 
I want to reiterate my concern that the Chair is going to take 
away from members of parliament their discretion in regard to 
when they want amendments to be dealt with, whether that is in 
less public circumstances like committees or a more public 
situation such as the House of Commons during report stage.  I 
want it to be noted that I have a problem with this. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to participate in the debate on Bill C-2 today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately my Motion No. 5 on increasing from four to five 
years the authorized period of absence was rejected.  This is 
unfortunate because the purpose of the motion was to harmonize 
our system with what the government grants its own employees 
who are authorized a period of absence of five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that can be said about the bill on employment 
insurance is that the more than 60 witnesses we heard at the 
Standing Committee on Human Resources Development did not talk 
about what was in Bill C-2 but mostly about what Bill C-2 
was not providing for Canadians and workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, on the issue of the divisor rule there is the 
period during which the unemployed receive employment insurance 
benefits.  The amount they receive; is now equal 
to 50% of their wages or salary, but even 55% would not be 
enough. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1045"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT10"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT10"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1045

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must keep in mind that 55% of $7 is only $3.75.  This is 
less than welfare; it is less than social assistance.  That is 
our employment insurance plan in Canada, a plan which is funded 
by Canadian workers.  The federal government grabbed the cash in 
the fund to pay its own debt and balance the budget, at the 
expense of people who had lost their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is crystal clear. 
During the committee hearings all Canadians who came to 
Ottawa to testify and express their views on behalf of the 
Prince Edward Island chamber of commerce, labour federations or 
municipalities with many seasonal workers described how workers 
were hurt by employment insurance changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the government brings us Bill C-2, a clone of Bill C-44. 
This is mere cloning, a procedure which should not be legal 
in Canada. The government did not make a single change in Bill 
C-2 which is before the House. During the election campaign the 
Liberals themselves promised some changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember my colleague for Madawaska—Restigouche stating that he 
would run as a Liberal because he wanted to be elected as a 
member for the governing party. He felt Bill C-44 did not go far 
enough and he wanted to make changes to the employment 
insurance plan. What kind of changes did we get? None, if we 
compare Bill C-2 with Bill C-44. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok 
boasted about wanting to be on the government's side to make 
changes to the employment insurance because the changes brought 
in by the Liberals were hurting workers in the Gaspé.  I remember 
the first meeting with the minister when he said “I make a heartfelt 
appeal to the minister”. This was broadcast in all news programs: 
he wanted to change the EI plan. Precious little has changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result is a measly 5% for the poor and the clawback rule for 
full time workers. This is what we got, but this is not what we 
need. The problem lies in the fact that some families are 
without any income from February to May. When families are 
suffering there is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two members who ran as Liberal candidates, as did the member for 
Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, said “I want to be on the 
government side like my father, so as to be able to bring about 
changes”. However we have yet to hear from him since his election. 
We have never heard him. We have never heard from him state his 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I am pleased that the committee, regardless of the party 
to which his members belong, approved a motion from the hon. 
member for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, whose 
objective is that a report be submitted to parliament by June 1. 
We hope that the members who made promises in their ridings will 
have enough backbone to make the Liberals change their mind, 
including the Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister who 
know that they are hurting Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that when there is a father or mother whose 
EI benefits run out and is without any income in February there 
are children involved. If we want to eliminate poverty in 
Canada, we should begin at that level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am ashamed when I think that there are 800,000 people who 
cannot qualify for employment insurance and that government 
investigators harass workers, call them into their offices and 
tell them behind closed doors “You realize that if you do not 
tell me the truth you could end up in jail”, something which 
the police itself cannot do with criminals on the street. That 
is shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am ashamed of the way the Departement of Human Resources 
Development is run. A thorough clean-up is in order in that 
department because this plan belongs to the workers and businesses 
that contribute to it. Seasonal work in Canada is a fact of life.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want our loggers, our factory workers and our tourism 
industry workers to be forced to rely on social assistance. The 
same goes for people working in peat bogs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it the only solution that the government can propose to us? I 
do not accept that. I do not agree with the way the Liberals are 
handling the employment insurance issue. Their robbery is the 
biggest ever covered in Canada by an insurance company. This is 
unbelievable and unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the cry from the heart of the hon. member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok will touch the heart of 
the Prime Minister once and for all and will cause him to change 
his position and do something.  We know that the Liberals 
are under dictatorship. Before retiring after 38 years of 
service to the House of Commons the Prime Minister could do a 
good thing for Canadians for once by taking care of the most 
disadvantaged in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people who worked all their life as loggers, in fish plants 
and in peat bogs see their electrical service cut off because 
they cannot even pay their bills from February to May, we must 
realize that action is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said it often, almost every day, in committee that one cannot 
catch lobster on Yonge Street in Toronto or cod on St. Catherine 
Street in Montreal. One has to go to Chaleur Bay or to the 
Pacific.  These jobs are seasonal jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who do not know, Chaleur Bay freezes over in winter. 
One cannot catch cod as if it were sportfishing, by making a 
hole in the ice. This is not the way it works. One needs boats 
plying the waters of Chaleur Bay to catch this fish.  People 
like to have this fish on their table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are happy to have products from the farm, but it is quite 
difficult to grow carrots under snow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have to acknowledge the fact that there are seasonal 
jobs in Canada. 
There is not a single seasonal worker in our country but 
there are seasonal jobs. Workers are not the ones who decide. 
There is nothing they can do if a week before their employer 
tells them that there is no more work for them because he has 
reached his lumber quota and can no longer cut down trees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Workers are not responsible if their employer tells them, after 
August 15, which is the feast of the Acadians and when there are no 
tourists left, that he now has to lay them off for winter. The 
employee is not the one who decides. He is not seasonal, but 
jobs are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that some members across believe what I say. It is not a 
coincidence if sometimes when we leave the House some 
Liberals shake our hands and say “Continue the 
fight, go on. We must make the government aware of the issue”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to draw the government's attention to the fact that 
that money is not its own to spend. I have full confidence in 
Canadians. I can say very confidently that there are no 
lazybones in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said once that if my predecessor, Doug Young, had been paid 
$5.50 an hour, he too would have been lazy and unwilling to 
work. If we had good jobs for people they would be happy to get 
up in the morning, go to work and get their paycheque at the 
end of the week in order to pay their bills and take part in 
activities with their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members across the way went so far as to call the unemployed 
lazybones unwilling to work, something I never accepted. I said 
I would never accept such statements as long as I represented 
the people of Acadie—Bathurst in the House. I know that my time 
has expired, but I could talk for hours about the injustices 
committed by the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now conclude by saying that today I am asking the 
Liberals to listen to what I have said in the name of workers 
across Canada, those of Quebec as well as all the others, to 
change their mind about employment insurance by the end of June 
and to ensure that we have a bill that is good for workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I request unanimous 
consent of the House to allow my friend, the member for 
Acadie—Bathurst, to carry on with his speech.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am not sure I can be as entertaining as the member 
from Bathurst, but I will do my best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the bill before us.  We will not hold up the 
legislation.  There are many deficiencies in it, as pointed out 
by many members.  However the truth is that some of the changes 
they are bringing in, especially the elimination of the intensity 
rule which discriminates against and penalizes workers who have 
drawn unemployment over a series of years, would eliminate some 
of those deficiencies.  The intensity rule amounts to about 5% of 
a person's benefit if he or she has collected employment 
insurance in the past.  We support its elimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some things should have been addressed in the bill which are 
important to the people of Canada, especially in communities 
where seasonal work is a reality.  That is where the bill falls 
down.  As members of the opposition we cannot have everything our 
way, and we understand that.  However one thing that should be 
considered in future legislation is a better identification of 
areas that depend on seasonal workers.  Those areas are penalized 
under the existing rules which determine the unemployment rate in 
regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in southwestern New Brunswick communities that 
depend on seasonal workers are lumped in with bigger communities 
like Saint John and Fredericton which have their own problems in 
terms of unemployment.  It makes the number artificially low in 
some areas where it is in fact a lot higher.  The government has 
the capacity to more accurately measure the unemployment rate 
within those communities.  That is important because the number 
of hours people must work to qualify for employment insurance 
varies depending on the rate of unemployment within their area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in the last official census, which I believe was in 
1996, the unemployment rate in communities in and around Black's 
Harbour, New Brunswick, and some of the Fundy Islands was as high 
as 45%.  However when lumped in with bigger centres the 
unemployment rate in those communities is disguised, in a sense, 
or not obvious.  It goes from 45% down to 7% or 8% because of the 
larger population in the city areas.  That is unfair and it 
punishes seasonal workers.  It is not addressed in the bill and 
it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point with regard to seasonal workers is the premium 
rate.  The premium rate is the money we all pay in Canada as 
employees, and it is much higher than it should be.  Between an 
employee and an employer about $5 is paid in for every $100 of 
earnings.  That is too high.  As evidence of exactly how high it 
is, the government now has a surplus of $35 billion in the 
employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's own chief actuary has told us the premium rate 
should be lower.  For example, employees across the country are 
paying in $2.25 on $100 of earnings.  The chief actuary has told 
the government the rate could be as low as $1.75.  That does not 
seem like a lot of money except when we see that the total figure 
between an employee and an employer is $5 on $100 of earnings. 
That is 5%.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one of the reasons every man, woman and child in the 
country who is contributing is making the finance minister look a 
lot better than what he would have been.  The surplus is being 
used to balance the books and to make debt reduction more of a 
success than it otherwise would have been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a $35 billion surplus in the fund.  None of that is 
addressed in the bill, except in the perverse sense that the 
government wants to keep the $35 billion and enhance it.  It 
wants to take away the right of the commission to set the rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have moved an amendment today that we are discussing, Motion 
No. 10.  The amendment says that the commission should be left 
intact. It should be provided with the ability to set the rate. 
In the bill the government would take away the right of the 
commission to set the rate.  It is blatantly attempting to 
politicize the EI fund.  It is a question of greed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Keep all the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Keep the money, as the member for 
Saint John says.  The $35 billion is just a notational entry in 
the finance minister's books.  The government says the money is 
from the EI fund and it is for the finance minister to keep. 
However it is the workers and the employers, rich and poor, who 
contributed to that $35 billion.  The government has the audacity 
to want to keep the rate as high as it is for its own purposes, 
for its own bookkeeping purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what my amendment addresses.  It says to let the 
commission do its job.  The chief actuary should do his job, and 
when he makes a recommendation to the government or to the 
commission it should be acted upon.  Up to now it has not been 
able to do anything because the government is stripping away its 
power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time the government wants to do something, the commission 
kowtows to the power of the government.  That is even more 
blatant in the act.  It would completely take away the power of 
the commission which is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's intent is to maximize premiums and minimize 
benefits.  It has a great record for doing that and the bill 
would allow it to continue doing that.  That is one of our 
problems as an opposition party.  We do not want to hold up the 
bill because there are some good parts in it that we support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The danger in opposition is that if we hold up the bill or stall 
it, the government will then accuse us of holding up a bill that 
will do some good, which is true.  Some things are right in the 
bill, but the truth is that the bill should have been a little 
wider in scope.  It should not take away the power of the 
commission to set the rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has said the same.  It is wrong for the 
government to take away the powers of the commission and to 
ignore the reality that the rate could be a lot lower than it is 
today.  The rate could be as low as $1.75 per $100 of earnings. 
That $1.75 could sustain the fund even during a downturn in the 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants to take away the powers of the commission, 
which we feel is wrong.  It has to take a look at its internal 
guidelines in terms of how it interprets the employment insurance 
act and be a little more considerate of those people who need 
employment insurance.  The auditor general has mentioned this as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The investigative powers, the proficiency and the knowledge 
level of some of the people within the department have to be 
addressed.  A lot of people are being unfairly discriminated 
against in terms of their abilities to collect employment 
insurance, which was borne out last night in a CBC documentary 
film called <I>Country Canada</I>.  The headline story was 
“P.E.I. fishers fight government to clear their names”.  The 
same thing is taking place in other parts of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carol Skelton (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are debating report stage of Bill 
C-2, the minor reforms to the existing EI legislation that the 
government brought forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw a large number of witnesses in committee, all of whom 
contributed their time and input to give us a better 
understanding of the potential impact of the legislation.  We 
heard from business and labour, from fishermen from both coasts, 
from restaurateurs, and from a host of others.  Not one of them 
could bring themselves to support the bill in its entirety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague and chief critic from South Surrey—White 
Rock—Langley and I, together with the witnesses, agree that the 
bill is tinkering at its best.  It addresses what the government 
considers flaws in the 1996 EI reforms, but it fails even at that 
small task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than continue what it began in 1996, that is to 
discourage repeat users of the EI as a wage supplement program, 
the bill actually takes a step backward.  During the testimony in 
committee most of the witnesses were looking for a more indepth 
review of the entire employment insurance system.  We concur that 
the bill is not broad enough to cover their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At report stage we deal with amendments.  My colleague has moved 
an amendment calling for the deletion of clause 9 of the bill and 
our colleagues from the Bloc have essentially moved the same 
amendment as well.  I hope all hon. members support the 
amendment.  The clause as written would give EI premium rate 
setting powers to the governor in council for the next two years. 
Clause 9 is a blatant hijacking of the rights of the employment 
insurance commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government indicates that it is only giving rate setting 
powers to the cabinet for two years.  If hon. members believe 
that the cabinet would give the powers back after those two 
years, I have some land in Shawinigan that they may want to have 
a look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will explain what the clause means.  It is an issue that has 
widespread opposition from both employers and unions.  They may 
have different objectives with the rates, but they all have 
problems with the way the government uses EI premiums in general 
revenue.  Employers and unions objected that cabinet was taking 
control of the EI rate setting process since the Liberal 
government balanced the EI books on the backs of employers and 
employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants complete control over the billions in the 
EI surplus.  It is one more unhealthy, undemocratic example of 
the government consolidating control in cabinet.  The Canadian 
business community is in almost unanimous opposition to the bill. 
It is not that it feels that people in seasonal industries do not 
need assistance.  It feels it should not come from the EI fund to 
which it provides 60% of the funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Chamber of Commerce thinks Bill C-2 is inconsistent 
with the development of advanced skills or entrepreneurial spirit 
and that it does not advance competitiveness.  Catherine Swift of 
the Canadian Federation of Independent Business had this to say 
about the legislation: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After several years of making some steps in the right direction 
on EI policy, this is a U-turn that hearkens back to the 1970s—a 
big spending government promoting dependency on programs, instead 
of solid economic growth.  We thought they had learned something 
from the mistakes of the past. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a flawed bill which seeks only to roll back earlier 
reforms and enhance the power of cabinet.  What are the 
alternatives? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT15"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT15"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1110

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, we must state that seasonal industries are 
just that, seasonal.  Seasonal industries are very important and 
those involved in them must be supported.  Those who are rendered 
unemployed for other reasons must also be supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There needs to be an acknowledgement that the two are not the 
same.  The solution to the seasonal work dilemma must lie in the 
direction of education and training.  Young people in communities 
which traditionally rely on seasonal employment must be properly 
equipped with the job skills for the workplace of the 21st 
century.  We must provide training for those currently involved 
in traditionally seasonal employment as an alternative to EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, as the first bill introduced in this parliament 
it is quite a disappointment.  Bill C-2 attempts to address flaws 
in the EI system but succeeds at only minor tweaking.  The 
government was moving in the right direction before but has taken 
an about-face with the legislation.  I encourage all hon. 
colleagues to join with us in opposition to the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to 
rise to speak to Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I want to tell members how deeply moving I found the 60 
statements or so that we heard during the committee's hearings. 
They disturbed me because they were a cold and profound 
reflection of the needs of the Canadian and Quebec societies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To briefly resume the situation, we now have before us Bill C-2, 
the former Bill C-40 introduced in 1996. 
This bill does not bring about the radical changes requested by 
Canadians as a whole, unions, women's groups, young people, 
boards of trade, employers and all the representatives of the 
Canadian and Quebec populations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote parts of some briefs tabled by people who 
appeared before the committee. I think it is important to read 
them into the record and to remember what those people had to 
say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House knows, and I would like to congratulate my Bloc 
colleague who introduced this motion, in committee we succeeded, 
with the assistance of the government, in asking for a report from 
the committee which will be able to examine all the briefs and 
report back to the House before June 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that it will advance the cause of unemployed workers and 
not just ease the government's conscience.  This report has to 
lead to something concrete, to major changes in the EI plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to come back to certain labour unions, including the CSN, 
which represents a good 250,000 workers in Quebec.  The 
following is a short passage from its brief: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the amendments in Bill C-2, the CSN feels that these are 
half measures which will not result in access for those workers 
who have lost their job because of changes in the work place. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now read a few lines from the FTQ brief. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>FTQ members would have hoped for much more from EI reform.  We 
feel that the legislator does not go far enough to right the 
wrongs of past reforms. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was what the FTQ had to say.  Another labour confederation 
in Quebec, the CSD, put it this way: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A decent reform would not give the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and the Minister of Finance the authority to set 
premium rates, when it was the employment insurance commission 
that used to have this authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an unacceptable ploy that will give the government 
unfettered access to surpluses in the EI fund, because premium 
rates will no longer hinge on self-funding but on the 
government's financial needs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not the ones saying so; the CSD is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My last quotations will be from the auditor general, in whom we 
have the utmost confidence. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2, an act to amend the Employment Insurance Act, and 
Chapter 34 of the December 2000 Report, lack clarity on the 
basis used in setting employment insurance rates. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A little later on in his statement the auditor general adds: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The introduction of Bill C-2 has not alleviated our concern. 
There is no requirement for the interim rate-setting process to 
be more transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, unlike the introduction of 
Bill C-44, there is no information on, or commitment to review, 
the rate-setting process while section 66 is suspended.  In other 
words, the scope and nature of the review, if any, are unclear. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the committee met with the various witnesses our awareness 
of a number of areas was greatly improved.  Perhaps I do not 
have enough time in my 10 minutes to give them all, but I shall 
try to touch on them briefly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was discussion of the seasonal industries, for the truth 
is that it is the work that is seasonal and not the workers.  I 
can speak with authority on this because my riding depends on 
tourism, which is a seasonal industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the snow is gone, so are the jobs.  People have to wait 
until the summer tourist season comes along to work in golf 
clubs and the like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between those two seasons, however, they have no work.  They 
go off to apply for employment insurance.  They are faced with a 
two week penalty because every time a person applies he or she 
has to wait two weeks before drawing maybe a month of benefits. 
These people return to the labour market for the summer, and 
with the arrival of fall they are again penalized for two 
weeks because they apply for employment insurance for three or 
four weeks while looking for work for the winter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this what these people want?  Do we 
think they go out of their way to get half their salary twice a 
year for two months?  They lose a month's salary, a month of 
income in their budget.  They have to live with that.  They have 
to plan their lives around it.  These people depend on this 
industry.  Why are they penalized?  This is totally 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we think that the women working in seasonal industry are 
happy at losing their spots in day care?  Not at all. 
They have to continue sending their children to day care while 
they are not working to make sure they do not lose their place. 
They pay for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not true that people are encouraged to go on employment 
insurance.  It is totally false.  If these people could do 
without it, they would do a lot better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the whole issue of self-employed workers.  In 
Quebec there are a lot of small businesses.  Elsewhere in 
Canada too, but primarily in Quebec, a lot of small and medium 
size businesses have been established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Self-employed workers have become a fact of life.  There were 
perhaps fewer of them in the past than there are now, but it is 
a fact of life in Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people often work very hard for long hours and they are 
not protected by any system. 
They represent perhaps 18% of the population.  That is a lot of 
people.  They would like to be included in the employment insurance 
plan if possible or in something like it.  They want to be part 
of a plan that would allow them to have employment insurance. 
They are prepared to pay the money necessary for the protection. 
They need it just as much as the person working for a business.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will increasingly be the case in Quebec and in the rest of 
Canada. These people cannot be excluded. Yet there is 
absolutely nothing in the bill for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another very important issue for me is the case of young 
workers. It almost makes no sense to require young workers to 
work 910 hours. It is absurd. They are penalized because they 
are part of the labour market. Does the government realize 
the result of this? It leads some employers to abuse, to tell 
a young person “You better work and do your job, otherwise you 
will not get employment insurance benefits”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could have elaborated on other issues such as the case of 
pregnant women. Why are pregnant women penalized when a newborn 
child should be the most wonderful thing that can happen to a 
family? Pregnant women are being penalized. From now on, women 
may decide to have children or not based on whether they qualify 
for employment insurance benefits.  Otherwise they will 
not be able to afford it. This does not make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is $35 billion in a fund that belongs to people who 
have contributed to it throughout their lives but who will not 
qualify. This is totally absurd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to end with clause 9. We asked that this clause be 
deleted. It is the most important one in the bill. It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding section 66, the premium rate for each of the 
years 2002 and 2003 is the rate set for the year by the Governor 
in Council on the recommendation of the Minister and the 
Minister of Finance. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want that clause deleted. We do not want it. We do not want 
these people to set the premium rate and to decide who will be 
entitled to employment insurance benefits.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the hon. member and understand the major concerns. 
Having lived in the province of New Brunswick and having grown up 
there all my life, it hurts when I hear someone refer to our 
seasonal workers in a negative way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this matter was being discussed before, the hon. member for 
Calgary—Nose Hill stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that he is about to call an election, the Prime Minister has 
decided to increase EI payments to seasonal workers who already 
earn a comfortable annual income. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the member for Calgary—Nose Hill revealed her party's 
position on low income seasonal workers when she said again that 
seasonal workers already earned a comfortable income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to present some figures to the House.  In 1996, before 
the Liberals slashed the EI program, 75% of seasonal workers in 
New Brunswick made less than $10,000 a year.  How could anyone 
say they have a comfortable income on $10,000 a year?  Everyone 
in the House knows that anyone making $10,000 a year cannot live 
in a comfortable manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was mentioned by the hon. member from the NDP, over 800,000 
people are not eligible for EI.  Seasonal workers could be 
fishermen or lumberjacks.  They could work in tourism.  They 
could be construction workers.  When the snow comes and the frost 
hits the ground they are not working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want to work.  They do not want to sit on their hands, and 
they do not.  Most of them work for the United Way.  If their 
next door neighbour is having a problem, they are right there to 
help.  That is the kind of people there are in the maritime 
provinces.  Hopefully that is the way it is across the whole 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of what has been happening and because of the changes 
that have negatively impacted on our people back home, a lot of 
them have had to leave.  In the city of Saint John, the largest 
city in the province, people travel by bus for one hour in the 
morning to work at one of the fish farms in another county. 
Because they live in Saint John, New Brunswick, and because the 
government says our unemployment rate is so low, they pay a 
higher EI rate.  Yet they are working in another county where the 
rate is lower for the people who live there.  That is wrong and 
needs to be corrected.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank God for those men and women who do it because they do not 
want to be on welfare.  They want to show their children and 
their families that they have their dignity.  That is why they do 
what they do.  Our people are like that back home.  They want to 
have dignity.  They want to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One member in the Bloc mentioned about the independent 
businessman, that small businessman who is out there.  I know 
about that because my son is one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past winter a man came to the door of Stephen's TV shop and 
said that he did not have any money to pay for a TV but he would 
like to have one.  He had not been working for almost six months 
but wanted the TV for his children for Christmas.  My son said 
that he could have it and asked whether his mother made mincemeat 
pies.  He said yes, his mother made mincemeat pies, that he had 
deer meat that he could give her to make the pies, and asked 
whether that would pay for the TV. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are people who care, who want to go to work.  The 
government has over $35 billion of their money in its pockets to 
make the government look good.  It says that it will pay down the 
debt.  That money should be in the pockets of men, women and 
employers who put it there.  It should be an independent fund 
which no one could touch.  It should be there for them so that 
they will have quality lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premiums taken from their paycheques are far too high, yet 
the government has increased them and reduced the benefits to the 
people.  It has put more money into the bank account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It tugs at my heart when people come to me and say they want to 
go to work.  It tugs at my heart when I see our shipbuilders, 
4,000 men, many of whom are now on welfare.  A lot of them are 
down in Louisiana.  The Trudeau government built and put money 
into the shipyard.  The Mulroney government also put money into 
the shipyard.  We have the most modern shipyard anywhere in the 
world sitting idle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be building the ships for our military right here, not 
buying new submarines from London, England, and then spending 
$800 million to make them float.  We should be doing it through 
the Davie shipyard and the Saint John shipyard.  Those two 
shipyards built the frigates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those men do not know where to go.  They do not know where to 
turn.  All they are saying is that they want to contribute to the 
economy.  They want to contribute to Canada.  They want to work. 
They want their dignity.  The sooner we give them their dignity, 
the sooner they will do more in their communities to make a 
better way of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at our young people today.  We educate them.  They want 
to work where their moms and dads are, where their families, 
their sisters, their brothers, their nannies and their grampies 
are.  They do not want to have to go away.  We do not want them 
to go away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A person from Vancouver came to our city market in Saint John. 
It is the oldest open common market of its kind in Canada.  I was 
walking down the aisle and she came over to me and said that my 
people were very special, the friendliest people she had ever 
met.  I told her that was the way we were back east.  Our people 
are friendly, outreaching and generous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the commission, the commission should stay in 
place.  The commission should handle the funds.  We must get the 
politics out of the EI fund.  We must leave it with that 
independent commission and then deal with it.  The commission is 
not there to play politics.  It has to be there to do what is 
right.  That is why the hon. member from Charlotte county said 
the commission should remain.

commission we will have politics again.  Heaven knows what the 
men and the employers will be paying for premiums and how little 
they will have in their pockets to feed their little families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say please, every one of us here, let us take the politics out 
of the bill.  Let us do what is right for the man and the woman 
of Canada, right from Vancouver and the Northwest Territories 
through to Newfoundland and Labrador.  Let us do what is right 
for our people.  Let us all be Canadians today.  Let us all be 
equal in the House of Commons.

watching what the government does with that $37 billion, which 
those men and women worked so hard for to put in a bank account 
where they knew there was security for their future.

react to the comments of my colleagues. 
Before commenting on what my colleagues said about Bill C-2, I 
wish to thank the members of the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development and the Status of Persons with 
Disabilities. 
As several members across the way have said, thanks to our 
spirit of co-operation almost all members of the committee 
recognized the importance of this bill. They also recognized 
that it was important to pass this bill as quickly as possible 
in this House and also in the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having acknowledged this spirit of co-operation in committee, I 
would also like to clarify certain comments made by my 
colleagues, especially regarding the motions on Bill C-2 brought 
forward in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Motion No. 4, by my the Bloc Quebecois colleague, 
proposes to include sickness benefits in the retroactivity 
period for parents who are going back to work. 
The government designed this provision after concerns were 
expressed about the possibility of parents staying at home with 
their children and going back on the labour market later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, people are eligible for 15 weeks of sickness 
benefits. As far as the retroactivity period is concerned, we 
had promised to introduce Bill C-2 in September. Therefore, a 
retroactivity cheque will be sent to those eligible as soon as 
this bill is enacted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is aware of the needs and 
concerns of Canadians, especially those who are too sick to 
work. This is why the government has improved access to sickness 
benefits by reducing from 700 to 600 the number of hours people 
have to work to be eligible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like any member of a government that gives thought to what it 
does, I, as well as the government and the minister, would like 
to proceed carefully and understand all aspects of the issue, 
which is an extremely complex one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, this system is designed to provide assistance to 
workers during temporary absences from the labour market.  I 
believe that a decision about the level of support we should 
offer Canadians who are out of the labour market for an extended 
period is one which requires a much deeper and comprehensive 
analysis, one which will probably take in more than the EI 
system.  For instance, assistance is available from the Canada 
pension plan.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Benefits from workers compensation programs, as well as the 
taxation system, also play a role.  We should therefore approach 
this problem comprehensively and this is the direction in which 
the government is headed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second motion, which was deemed debatable here in the House, 
has to do with the clawback provision, which would not apply to 
fraudulent claims for benefit weeks.  The member who moved this 
amendment in the House is suggesting that we should be more 
tolerant of those who defraud the EI system. 
His proposal would mean that Canadians who made honest claims 
for benefits would be required to give back a portion of their 
benefits, while those who made fraudulent claims would be exempt 
from having to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect, the member is suggesting that we introduce an 
incentive for people to defraud the EI system.  I cannot believe 
that this is the intention of the member who moved this 
amendment, but it is the potential impact of the amendment if 
ever it were passed.  It is obvious that the government cannot 
go along with such an amendment to Bill C-2, and we therefore 
reject it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, I would like to dwell on the famous clause 9 discussed 
earnestly by several members opposite. The purpose is to delete 
clause 9 of the bill that would change the way the premium rate 
is set in relation with the role of the EI commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the facts. What is the bill saying? It is 
saying that the government wishes to suspend the commission's 
role in the determination of the premium rate, but contrary to 
what my hon. colleague of the Canadian Alliance said, it is not a 
suspension forever. It is a suspension for a period limited to 
two years in order to allow the government to review the way the 
rate is set. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we asking for that? It is because we too happen to 
follow the advice of the auditor general who, as my hon. 
colleague said, is well accepted and recognized in this House. We 
are following the advice of the auditor general who indicated 
that the premium rate determination process was not clear enough. 
The Standing Committee on Finance of the House of Commons has 
also indicated that the mechanism should be reviewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in the perspective of a review aimed at making the rates 
fairer that we want to suspend the role of the commission. I 
repeat that the suspension would be extremely limited and would 
not exceed a two year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The review will deal with rates and premium rate determination. 
We believe, on the government side, that it is not appropriate to 
have the commission keep on setting the rates under those 
conditions. We want to review the system. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Motion No. 10, which was proposed by my colleague from 
the Progressive Conservative Party and also addresses clause 9, 
would fundamentally change the purpose of clause 9.  I would like 
to remind hon. members that clause 9 relates to the role of the 
commission in fixing the premium rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, as I have just said in French, we are suspending the EI 
commission's role in rate setting for two years to allow time for 
the government to review how the rate is set. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I will say in answer to my colleague from the 
Progressive Conservative that it is the auditor general who 
suggested that rate setting is not clear enough and hon. members 
on the other side of the House have said it before.  The finance 
committee has also said that it needs to be revised. 
I remind all members that the finance committee of the House of 
Commons is made up of all parties present in the House.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These issues need to be addressed in the review.  It is not 
appropriate to ask the commission to continue to set rates in 
these circumstances.  Therefore, we are suspending their rate 
setting role while we conduct the review. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I would like to address an extremely important point 
that was raised by several members of this House, particularly 
members of the New Democratic Party and the Bloc Quebecois, 
about the fact that Bill C-2 does not respond to the needs of the 
people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has already made the commitment at the standing 
committee of this House to start examining suggestions made to 
us by witnesses who appeared before the committee and to make 
some recommendations to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would like to quote once again the auditor general, 
who said to us on February 22, while appearing before the 
Standing Committee on Public Accounts: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—in the next two years—work will be done on how this should be 
done in the future. So I think the bill buys some time to come 
up with a better way of calculating the rates paid by the 
workers and their employers. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We thus have the support of the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before concluding, I have two other quotations. The first is 
from Mr. Robert Blakely, director of Canadian affairs, building 
and construction trades department, AFL-CIO, who said “In 
general, we support the reforms proposed under Bill C-2”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another quotation— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B> I regret to interrupt the 
parliamentary secretary, but, to be fair to all of our 
colleagues, I must. The hon. member for St. John's West. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to say a few words about this bill, which I look upon as 
a blackmail bill, to a degree, simply because government is 
throwing out enough to the people involved to encourage all of us 
to support the bill, yet is holding back so many other changes 
that are so necessary we are torn between supporting the bill and 
voting against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, our party is supporting the bill simply because we in 
our party know that if we do not accept the changes offered right 
now, small as they are, those affected may have to wait for 
prolonged periods, as they did during the fall, of course, when 
the bill was first introduced.  It should have been passed before 
the election was called but was not and people have suffered 
decreased incomes throughout this winter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate some of the members who spoke this morning.  I 
agree with everything, I think, that was said on this side and I 
can appreciate exactly where these hon. members are coming from. 
I especially was impressed with the speech given by my colleague 
from the NDP who did a magnificent job in outlining some of the 
concerns his constituents face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the rules that has not been touched at all in this new 
piece of legislation is the divisor rule.  We ask why it has been 
there from the beginning.  If some seasonal employee is fortunate 
enough to find <I>x</I> number of weeks of work, why should it be 
divided by a larger number to directly increase his income? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill deals with the intensity rule, again a rule that should 
never have been brought in.  It seems the government has been 
looking at people who are contributing to a fund well in excess 
of what is required and has been taking money from employers well 
in excess of what is required, to the extent that we have a 
surplus of some $32 billion, instead of asking how we could use 
this money to help the people who were meant to be helped in the 
beginning, the people who contribute and the employers who 
contribute on their behalf. 
We say to the employers that we will not allow their advisory 
council to have any say in rate setting.  That is how we treat 
them.  We say to the employees that we will try to find as many 
ways as we can to reduce their benefits.  We will increase the 
number of hours of employment needed to qualify.  We will bring 
in the intensity rule which reduces their payment every year.  We 
will bring in the divisor rule which artificially divides their 
income.  Consequently we end up with 50% of nothing being nothing 
which is what an awful lot of seasonal employees have been 
getting over the last few years.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intensity rule change is a positive one, and we agree with 
it.  We also agree with assisting some people to get back into 
the workforce without having the heavy onus of paying in 
excessive hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In relation to the required hours, if we go back, the original 
changes were brought in to offset what was always referred to as 
the 10-42 syndrome.  People would work 10 weeks, get 15 or 20 
hours of work a week and get stamps, as they used to say then, to 
draw unemployment for the next 42 weeks.  Nobody was happy with 
that system.  However it is like everything else the government 
does.  Once it starts swinging the pendulum, it lets it go from 
one end to the other and the people who suffer in this case are 
seasonal employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have regions where the economy has been disastrous during the 
last few years, in particular, the ground fishery in Atlantic 
Canada.  The bottom has fallen right out of it.  This not only 
affects people involved in the fishery, it affects an awful lot 
of people who work in the processing industry, the fish plants 
and associated back up activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is a shortage of resource, as we have seen in recent 
years, and when we have demands from the market, especially the 
Japanese market, looking for product that requires little or no 
processing, the opportunity for the people working in that 
industry to obtain employment becomes less and less and the hours 
are fewer and fewer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made no provision to address times of disaster.  Earlier 
in the year I remember some of my colleagues from the Bloc Party 
talking about people employed in the forest industry.  They 
were having the same problem.  When the work was scarce, they had 
a problem finding the number of hours required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to go back to the old 10-42 syndrome, a handful 
of hours and a person can draw on the employment insurance all 
year.  That is not the case.   However there has to be some 
special provisions made for individuals who live in areas that 
have been devastated by lack of resource, or slowdowns in the 
industry, or lack of construction, or major strikes or whatever 
the case might be.  We do not have that flexibility and people 
are suffering.  Ironically, they are suffering while they 
themselves have contributed to a fund that was supposed to look 
them, a fund in the amount of $32 billion which the government 
lumped in with general revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the way we are supposed to look after the people in 
our country.  This is certainly not the way we are supposed to 
look after people who really need our help, people who in trying 
to help themselves get the door slammed in their face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill needs to be amended in several ways and there are 
amendments on the floor.  Certainly, we will be supporting many 
of them, and perhaps all of them.  However amendments should not 
have been necessary.  A government with a conscience, a 
government that is supposed to know what is going on should have 
brought in a full bill to deal with all the issues.  It is not 
enough to placate a few and bribe politicians into supporting it 
so that these people will at least have some benefits, while 
completely rejecting other benefits that are necessary.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the EI funding and the Department of Human 
Resources Development.  There are provinces which have a lot of 
seasonal workers.  This in itself creates high unemployment in 
those areas.  These people are looking for work and asking 
government to help out.  At the same time we see the end of March 
approaching, which is the fiscal year end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some provinces use the word dump, which in this case means 
millions of dollars from small, poor provinces are being dumped 
back into government coffers because of the tight reins the 
government has on local offices.  The flexibility is not there to 
deliver even the meagre amounts that are assigned to the various 
regions.  It is amazing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first half of this year and part of the previous year, 
most of the employees of HRDC were busy trying to correct 
mistakes of the past as a result of the looseness of the 
government.  With the reduction in staff in the department, the 
manpower was not there to educate people on what was involved in 
putting forward good, solid proposals which could generate 
activity in the communities and create employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The local offices have been hammered by their own department. 
What happened?  Through no fault of their own, they have not been 
able to deliver the funds available.  Money has been sent back to 
government.  It is unheard of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time the government become aware of what is happening, 
especially in the rural areas.  Somebody mentioned today that 
small communities adjacent to bigger ones have been lumped 
together.  The small communities are paying the price because 
they live near areas of high employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these things have to be looked at.  Hopefully we will see 
changes before the final vote and will be only too glad to see 
such changes occur.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
begin my speech by asking a question, and I am sure the answer will be yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would imagine that you are quite familiar with the works of 
Jean de La Fontaine. I see that you are nodding your approval. I 
am convinced that everyone in the House knows Jean de La 
Fontaine, a famous French poet who lived from 1621 to 1695. He 
is particularly well known all over the world for his <I>Fables</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Jean de La Fontaine were still living today, he would find 
that the ideal conditions, the winning conditions for writing a 
new fable, are all brought together in the employment insurance 
plan. Let me explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Jean de La Fontaine personified an animal, he did it for 
two very specific reasons. First, it underlines human and social 
behaviours and helps us understand how they work. Second, it is a 
means by which to draw attention to the sensitivity and 
intelligence of animals that should at times be a source of 
inspiration for us. We would be better off. I can easily imagine 
a fable he could have entitled the nasty chickens and the nice 
geese”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, just like me, you were once small, even though it 
does not show any more, and young. When I was a child there was 
a tradition which still exists. At Easter, my brothers would go 
out and buy cute little chicks. Spring being the time of 
renewal, of rebirth, we used to love to buy these animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was six or seven years younger than my brothers. 
Who do you think had to feed the chickens every morning? Me, of 
course. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1155"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT24"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT24"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1155

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As time went by, the chickens got bigger. However, I had noticed 
that one was a  bit smaller than the others. I wondered what was 
happening. I began to observe it. I realized that the smaller 
chicken was excluded by the others until one day it finally 
died. We know how it is when one chicken is weaker than the 
others. They begin pecking at it and hurt it until it dies. That 
is the first part of the fable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the second part. I was a little older at that time. My 
brothers took me fishing and hunting.  One day, they showed me a 
flight of Canada geese. We know that these birds travel over 
fairly long distances. We also know how it is with Canada geese. 
When one of them becomes too weak or too tired, the strongest 
goose will go just under it and support it in flight. When that 
goose gets tired another one takes its place, and in the end 
the weak goose reaches its destination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw that nasty chickens exclude whereas nice geese 
include. That is a very good illustration of how EI works at 
present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is pretty serious business to lose a job.  People have 
responsibilities.  They feel helpless.  Then the nasty chickens 
come along to peck at them.  Here we have someone who has lost a 
job.  What is the first question we ask? “Eligible or not 
eligible?” Then we pick, pick, pick away at eligibility.  We 
make sure that the rules are as strict as possible.  If we find a 
person is eligible that bugs us, so we pick, pick, pick away 
again, adding the two week waiting period.  Tactics of exclusion 
are constantly being used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one point benefits were 60% of earnings.  We say that is too 
much, so we pick away some more and bring it down to 55%.  Then 
we pick away again at the seasonal workers because they apply 
every year and reduce benefits by 1% per year.  The 
institutional tactic of exclusion is obvious. I could go on, in 
fact I will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Construction workers are also seasonal workers.  They 
have to be looking for work, however.  The department says that 
construction workers who go through their unions, their 
construction board where all the available jobs are posted, are 
not considered to have been looking for work.  We are picking 
away again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are the young workers, women who are excluded from 
eligibility, parental leave.  Earlier in my introduction I 
spoke of spring, which is a call to life.  A man and a woman who 
decide to have a child are again virtually excluded.  They are 
not eligible under the terms of employment insurance.  If the 
expectant mother has to make use of preventive withdrawal from 
the workplace, here there is another exclusion.  In this 
employment insurance system, it is exclusion from A to Z. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, there are the older workers.  It is certainly 
difficult when a person is 55 and has been in one job for 35 
years.  Here again we exclude them.  Assistance programs which 
could help them until retirement are taken away.  As far as I 
know, there was a commitment to reinstate such a program.  It has 
not yet appeared.  Once again exclusion is the rule.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically the Bloc Quebecois and the opposition believe that we 
are doing what we are doing because of what we are. We are the 
nice geese. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If for some reason someone is going through hard times, such as 
the loss of a job, there must be some system somewhere to help 
him, to support him until he gets back on his feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the amendments brought forward by my colleagues in the Bloc 
Quebecois and other colleagues in the opposition are along that 
line.  We do not want the employment insurance system to be 
exclusive.  We want it to be an inclusive plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could go on for hours about various issues. We could add 
amendments. However now they are restricting debate partially 
in this case, but it will probably come to total closure very 
soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure Jean de La Fontaine would have been delighted to write 
a fable about the nasty chickens and the nice geese.  This does 
not only apply to employment insurance.  We could also apply it 
to federalism and sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are nasty chickens that are leading us, the nice geese, to 
support sovereignty in Quebec. We want a nation that once it 
fully controls its own employment insurance fund will be able to 
include persons who are going through hard times so that they are 
not excluded from society but are helped and can later return to 
society with pride and dignity, thanks to the assistance they 
received from support programs, just like a nice goose would do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B> That was a fairly picturesque 
speech. The hon. member for Windsor—St. Clair. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—St. Clair, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise to reiterate the points made by my colleague from the 
Progressive Conservative Party about the inadequacies of the 
legislation being proposed, specifically the short list of the 
amendments and changes that would be made, depending upon the 
outcome of the vote.  Many more issues need to be addressed and I 
will draw them to the attention of the House at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One issue that has been of particular import to my riding in the 
last few months is the change concerning the 85% rule that is 
required in one of the regulations under the act.  It establishes 
that if an employee does not return to work in a strike lockout 
situation, the reason must be because of lack of work and not 
because of lack of work or production generated as a result of 
the strike lockout. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rule is wide open to abuse on the part of employers if after 
the strike lockout they wish to be vindictive.  The offensive 
part of the regulation is that the employer is the one who is 
sought out and asked for information on whether the 85% rule is 
being met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to make a side point here.  The 85% rule is not only with 
regard to 85% of the employees being called back to work but also 
85% of production being restored.  It is a double opportunity for 
the employer to have the final decision on whether individual 
employees will qualify.  We had two recent situations in Windsor 
where this specific situation arose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting part is that as a result of work done by the CAW 
union and my office, the department reversed the original 
decision disqualifying all those workers.  Literally hundreds of 
them were disqualified. 
I still have not had a response from the minister in terms of the 
interpretation placed on the rule, but there seems to be some 
policy where during certain periods of time the rule is not 
enforced.  Our party's position is that the rule should be done 
away with completely.  The general application of the act and the 
regulations should flow once a strike lockout situation has 
terminated.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern I have, and one that I run across in my riding 
repeatedly, is with one of the penalties under the legislation. 
It is in regard to individuals who know that they will be 
unemployed and they make arrangements in all good faith to seek 
retraining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is actively pressing individuals who are 
unemployed to upgrade themselves.  It constantly publishes 
figures about the need for people to recognize that in the course 
of their working career they will be repeatedly required to 
return to some educational or retraining program in order to 
maintain full employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the figures that we have all seen, and the position 
that the government is taking, individuals who wish to return to 
work by way of upgrading their skills and knowing that they will 
need to do that in order to get favourable employment situations, 
are in effect penalized by being required to go without 
employment benefits for a full two week period.  They leave the 
workforce, usually not voluntarily, and then they are without any 
form of income for a full two weeks while in an educational 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is particularly offensive to single parent families with 
children who rely on that income to have a waiting period of two 
weeks.  It has a very negative effect, particularly for women in 
the workforce, as it forces them to go on social service benefits 
rather than get the retraining that they really require. 
Retraining would be much better for them as it would enhance the 
overall economy and it would be good of society.  That is another 
change that is required and we see no signs of the government 
moving on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final point deals with the inaction on the part of the 
government to deal with the taking of the money that has been 
paid for by both employees and employers to the tune of $35 
billion.  It has also refused to even acknowledge a 
responsibility to replace those funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government returned those funds, there is no question 
that the amount the employer or employee would have to contribute 
would be significantly reduced.  We need those funds available in 
case of a significant economic downturn, which we may be 
confronting at this period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need action on the part the government on each one of those 
items.  As Bill C-2 and the proposed amendments show, we are not 
getting it at this time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean—Saguenay, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am always very interested in talking about the employment 
insurance bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1210"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT27"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT27"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1210

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say that I opposed the bill.  I opposed it and I still 
oppose it, but a little less today because now I have hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will first explain why the Bloc Quebecois and I oppose this 
bill as currently defined.  First off, clause 9 of the bill 
gives the government the power to set the premium rates for 2002 
and 2003, on the recommendation of the Minister of Human 
Resources Development and the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the existing act the premium rates are set by the 
commission, with the approval of the governor in council, on the 
recommendation of the Minister of Human Resources Development 
and the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nuance is significant since with the ousting of the 
commission for the rate setting process the rates could be 
adjusted according to the needs of the government and its 
deficit, rather than according to the needs of the unemployed 
and the amount of contributions received, as the chief actuary 
recommends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If passed, clause 9 would legalize theft and the government's 
having full possession of the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning people talked about a real employment insurance 
fund.  However, with clause 9, we are making it legal for the 
government to draw from the fund surplus as it wishes.  I 
therefore appeal to this government to have this clause 
repealed. If it were, I would vote in favour.  The Bloc 
Quebecois would vote for the bill.  Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members read over my last speech concerning Bill C-2, 
they will find that I was very critical of that bill, which had 
nothing to do with the reality of the area I represent where 
seasonal work is a fact of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why am I less critical today?  It is because I have hope. Nevertheless, 
I remain concerned. I have hope, given the fact that a motion was 
adopted by the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development which was put forward by the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques and which said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development and 
the Status of Persons with Disabilities report to the House of 
Commons other recommendations related to the Employment 
Insurance Act and that this report be tabled to the House no 
later than June 1, 2001. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hearings were held and people from Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean gave 
testimony before the committee. We were very happy about that. 
Several witnesses said that the actual reform was nonsense 
since it does not answer the needs of our fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am still concerned today, but I see a glimmer of hope. What 
will be the content of the report tabled on June 1? I do not 
know. However my colleague from 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques has all my 
confidence, because he is a man full of compassion and 
understanding toward Quebec workers. 
There are many things I would like to see in this report, and I 
hope it can generate major changes in the present plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Employment Insurance Act as it stands now has a negative 
impact on my region and that of the hon. member for Charlevoix, 
because we both experienced the same kind of situation on July 
1. This is not a problem affecting all our colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act provides for a review of EI zones every five years. The 
number of hours and the number of weeks of benefits vary between 
an area with high unemployment and an area with a strong 
economy. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT28"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT28"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1215
<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the zoning is sensibly done it reflects the reality of 
regions. A new zone was established on July 1 last year without 
any real consultation. There were token consultations. I wrote 
to the minister to tell her I disagreed with this new EI zone. 
In Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean her officials told her to keep the 
status quo. In spite of it all, the chief actuary established 
the new zone. Actually I do not know whether the actuary or the 
minister was involved, but that is not relevant. 
Still, a major change was made in that instead of having to 
work 420 hours to qualify workers from the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean 
region will now need 525 hours to get a maximum of 22 weeks of 
benefits, instead of 31. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may be of little significance to us, in the comfort of 
our seats. This morning, I listened to the passionate speech 
made by the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst on the realities 
experienced by the families and workers who will not qualify, or 
who will qualify but will only receive benefits until February. 
How will these people survive? From February to May when the 
tourist season starts and seasonal economic activities resume, 
these people will have to rely on income security, on welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do hon. members think this is what these people want? Absolutely 
not, particularly since they often have a house or a car, which 
is perfectly normal and something I wish on everyone.  Because of 
that they cannot qualify for provincial income 
security. These people then find themselves without any income, 
and governments wonder why people turn to the underground 
economy. There comes a point where people have to get into 
survival mode. When the government comes up with measures like 
this one, with measures that do not reflect the workers' 
reality, some turn to the underground economy because they need 
to put bread and butter on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the minister, faced with an outcry from workers in 
our regions before the election was called, agreed to change the 
rules to propose transitional measures so that workers would 
have the time, the minister put it, to get used to the new EI 
rules which restrict eligibility and decrease the number of 
benefit weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People do not get used to poverty.  Even if we wanted to 
extend the tourism season, and we are working on it, the 
weather must be factored in.  When the ground is frozen it is 
frozen, with the result that there are certain activities which 
are impossible during the winter season.  Seasonal work is a 
reality in this country and must be taken into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier that I hoped the committee would submit 
a report and that it would lead to amendments so that the 
Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean and North Shore regions would see a 
return to measures reflecting the economic reality of the 
Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean area.  The result would be that seasonal 
workers could make both ends meet and that they would not find 
themselves facing poverty.  This does not mean that they do not 
want to work.  Far from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I listened to the speech by the member for 
Acadie—Bathurst who had heard in the House that some people are 
lazy and want to live off income security.  There may be a 
percentage who do, but it is not true of most workers. Far from 
it.  What people want are working conditions, work and decent 
pay, to which everyone is entitled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the existing rules are not amended the impact on the economy 
of my region and on businesses will be disastrous.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned workers who will face a gap in benefits in the 
spring.  Businesses will be affected as well.

<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased today to speak to Bill C-2 which really hurts seasonal 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign the Prime Minister claimed loud 
and clear throughout Quebec that as soon as he was back in 
office in Ottawa his government would undertake an indepth 
reform of the EI plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some regions Canadian voters believed him and in others 
they did not. In the Gaspé peninsula people believed that the 
Prime Minister, having finally wiped out the deficit, was 
promising in his red book to completely overhaul the EI plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The citizens of the Gaspé and the islands were fooled again. 
They were wrong in voting Liberal, even if the Liberal member 
made a heartfelt appeal to the Prime Minister during the 
campaign, asking him to finally listen and keep the election 
promises he had personally made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister will not be easily moved by the heartfelt cry 
from my colleague from 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok. The Prime 
Minister has been in politics for 35 years. He has seen and 
done all kinds of things. He made promises and even acknowledged 
that he was mistaken when he had seasonal workers, women and 
students pitch in to help wipe out the deficit by cutting their 
EI benefits from 55% to 50%. This had a double effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister thought these cuts in their benefits would 
encourage them to improve their skills and work longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several members mentioned that in several areas of Quebec such 
as Charlevoix and the North Shore there were a lot of seasonal 
jobs. Workers would like to have permanent jobs. Employers would 
like to be able to give them permanent jobs. As we know, if 
employers cannot guarantee a high enough number of hours of work 
to allow workers to qualify for employment insurance benefits, 
they tend to leave. It is very expensive for employers to have 
to constantly train new workers for these seasonal jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-44 was on the table before the election campaign. The 
Prime Minister promised an indepth reform when parliament 
reconvened. He introduced Bill C-2. Bill C-2 is a photocopy of 
Bill C-44. 
If Bill C-44 was not acceptable, Bill C-2 is even less so 
because again it does not meet the commitments made by the 
government during the election campaign. The government was 
re-elected on these promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would take some major changes right away. There was no need 
for Bill C-2 to go through all the stages: introduction and 
first reading, second reading, committee review to hear 
witnesses, back to the House for third reading and 
finally royal assent. I am convinced the Prime Minister 
would have had the unanimous consent of the House, of both 
government and opposition members, to split Bill C-2 into two 
separate parts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have unanimously agreed to it if only the government 
had promised to immediately and retroactively give back all the 
money it took from the unemployed through the intensity rule, to 
bring in an increase from 50% to 55% to eliminate the clawback 
effect, and to bring in an increase from $28,000 to $38,000 to allow, 
mothers to stay on maternity leave instead of being 
unemployed for two or four years. We would have agreed 
unanimously to split the bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government would have also made the commitment to proceed to 
a true reform of the employment insurance plan. The Prime 
Minister knows what a true reform of the EI plan is, and so do 
the Minister of Human Resources Development and the Minister of 
Finance since there was such a reform in 1996, the Axworthy 
reform, when drastic cuts were made to the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, when the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance and 
the then Minister of Human Resources Development decided to 
reform the EI plan, their goal was to take in as much as possible 
and give out as little as possible. With eligibility requirements 
set at 910 hours, six persons out of ten who paid EI 
contributions were not eligible for benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need is in our ridings but the money is in Ottawa. The 
unemployed need the money but the Minister of Finance has it in 
his pockets. Of course the intensity rule made no sense 
at all. The Prime Minister recognized that fact following a 
question from the Bloc Quebecois and undertook to review the rule 
and change it. However we are asking for a lot more than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least 60 to 70 witnesses came to say unanimously to the 
Standing Committee on Human Resources Development and the Status of 
Persons with Disabilities that Bill C-2 did not go far enough. 
The two week waiting period should also be abolished. 
We know that employment insurance is an insurance that employees 
and employers pay into in case there is a job loss or 
termination. It is part of the social benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not because people apply for EI benefits that they must be 
penalized with a two week waiting period. Why keep the 910 hour 
requirement for seasonal workers? Whether they are temporary or 
part time employees, these people pay premiums and never receive 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A seasonal worker status should be recognized. This would 
prevent regions from quarrelling among themselves. This would 
also somewhat prevent businesses, employers and employees from 
being in a difficult situation compared to others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the ferry, the boat belonging to the Société des traversiers 
du Québec which sails between Baie Sainte-Catherine and 
Tadoussac in my riding, I have seen Tadoussac and Baie 
Sainte-Catherine residents who did not have the same EI coverage. 
This is illogical because they have the same employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, when a seasonal employee was lucky enough to get some work 
in the last two or three years, he needed 420 hours to qualify for 
32 insurable weeks. The minister wants to come back with her 
project in 2003-04. However this is done increasingly. In 
2000-01, today, 420 hours are required to qualify for 32 weeks. 
In 2001-02 someone will have to work 420 hours to qualify for 28 
weeks. Already next year four weeks will be cut. 
In 2002-03 it will be 455 hours for 24 weeks and in 2003-04 
525 hours for 21 weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time of year, at the end of March, we will be reading in 
the papers or hearing on the TV that according to Statistics 
Canada the unemployment rate has dropped in Quebec and Canada. 
Why has the unemployment rate dropped?  It is because people are no 
longer covered by employment insurance.  The government is not 
paying money out any more.  It is paying out a lot less. 
Statistics Canada says the unemployment rate has dropped.  It is 
not because people have entered the labour market.  It is because 
they no longer get employment insurance cheques.  At this point 
it is something like the principle of communicating vessels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If people do not get EI cheques social assistance goes up. Who 
pays for social assistance?  The workers do, through their taxes. 
The workers of Quebec pay for this assistance which provides 
some income security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thirty-six billion dollars have been in the government coffers 
since the 1996 reform.  Six people in ten are not entitled to EI. 
The needs are in ridings and the money is in Ottawa.  The 
unemployed need money, and the money is in the Minister of 
Finance's pockets.

signatures on petitions—I have tabled some 10—and meetings 
with native communities, unions, Charlevoix—Côte-Nord coalitions 
in an effort to appeal to the minister.  We almost had to wring 
her arm to get a meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She promised a bill, training and programs, but unfortunately 
the transitional measures were empty because there is no money 
in the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, we want a thorough reform by the government as soon 
as possible, because the unemployed have been penalized enough by 
Liberal government reforms. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to speak about Bill C-2 and the whole employment 
insurance saga. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the reforms in the employment insurance program 
have made victims and that some people cannot collect insurance 
benefits any more when they loose their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are asking for real action.  We are asking for a real 
reform that will give more people access to employment insurance. 
Six people in ten are currently excluded. Such an insurance 
should allow any worker who loses his or her job to collect 
employment insurance benefits, but it is not the case any more 
since the 1996 reform of the employment insurance program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some changes were introduced through various bills, including 
Bill C-44 which only brought minor improvements. I cannot 
understand how the government could not respond to people's 
expectations. Our committee had several meetings to look at a 
real indepth reform of the employment insurance bill. We have 
heard groups that were very representative of the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois went on a few fact finding tours to try and 
understand what was happening in the various areas, what 
impact this unfair and unwarranted reform was having. It has 
already hurt many, people who could not find work in time 
to go back to work within a reasonable time frame. We were 
talking about the spring gap. Many seasonal workers do not 
qualify for EI because their insurable period has been shortened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the elections they were talking about true employment 
insurance reform, but now they are back with Bill C-2. It does 
not go far enough. It will hurt the unemployed without really 
overhauling the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our critic on human resources development, the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, has really 
worked hard in committee. He is very familiar with this issue. 
After listening to the concerns of the various witnesses, he came 
back with amendments to the overall Employment Insurance Act and 
asked the government to consider them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About 60 organizations appeared before the committee to talk 
about the reality faced by the unemployed, by all those who lose 
their jobs and can no longer qualify. The legislation limits 
access to EI benefits. The Bloc Quebecois is bringing forward all 
the changes he has been asking for. The Bloc's concern is not 
new. This has been an issue for the Bloc ever since 1993, because 
we are very much aware of the hardship faced by the people who 
were discriminated against because they cannot qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can also talk about eliminating the waiting period, something 
that was set to target workers who were claiming UI benefits too 
often.  They were not doing so out of malice but because they 
were unable to find work. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the 1996 reform, which was unprecedented in this 
government, made it even harder for workers to qualify. Those who 
used EI too often were penalized and saw their benefit rate 
reduced by as much as 5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During those five years recipients could no longer get benefits 
at a rate of 55% of insurable earnings since they could lose up 
to 50% of their benefit rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we calling for the establishment of a separate 
employment insurance fund?  It is because what is happening right now is 
unacceptable. The government is dipping into the EI fund. It is 
doing it to eliminate the deficit, which makes it look like a 
government that has a lot of money to hand out in grants to 
friends of the party or in grants with no particular objective in 
terms of helping the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there is $36 billion in the EI fund today. We could have 
a separate fund administered by those who contribute to it, 
namely workers and employers. That fund must be managed 
separately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are calling for an increase in insurable earnings from 55% to 
60% to respond to the rising cost of living. Right now the rate 
is 55%. This increase is totally justified to give the unemployed 
slightly higher benefits to help them make ends meet while they 
look for a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are requesting a change in the definition of the rate 
calculation period from 26 weeks to 52 weeks. At present, those who 
qualify are few and they have fewer weeks of insurable 
employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord keeps saying that we 
should be fair with the regions. Often workers in some areas 
depend on seasonal or unstable jobs. Twenty-six weeks is clearly 
not enough in a context where there may not be any jobs 
available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another serious change we would like to see is the insurability 
of independent workers through a voluntary plan. Had the reform 
of employment insurance been tailored to the needs of the labour 
market, an assessment of the impact on independent workers would 
have been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also know, because I was told about it, that the cultural 
industry should have been taken into consideration 
Human resources people in the cultural industry have formed a 
coalition, asking for a pilot project for cultural workers. 
These are very often independent workers, with incomes at or 
below the poverty level. That is another aspect of the labour 
market which has not been taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wanted to bring down to 300 hours the eligibility requirement 
for special benefits. In some areas those who want to take a 
maternal or parental leave with special benefits, or those who 
are sick, have to work more hours. They need 600 hours before 
they qualify for EI benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to bring that figure down to 300 hours. In some 
areas workers need 420 hours to be eligible. It is unacceptable 
that people who experience very special conditions cannot be 
treated just like other workers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning the increase in the duration of benefits I believe 
that if we do not take into account what is really going on in the 
field, some people will find themselves without any EI benefits 
and that their duration is too insignificant to meet their 
needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Harmonizing to 25% the earnings of all claimants before EI 
benefits are cut, this is a main theme of the Bloc Quebecois. 
Members can be assured that all the reforms asked for by the Bloc 
are shared by all the people who testified before the committee 
on human resources development and the status of people with 
disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Insurable yearly earnings must be indexed and raised to $41,500. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the government has a lot of work to do to correct this 
inequity going back to the 1996 reform, which resulted in several 
poverty level people having to apply for welfare. Finally, the 
provincial governments had to step in and take over the federal 
government's responsibility.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to address the bill before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by saying that in my opinion the employment 
insurance issue has evolved somewhat, but in a negative way. Let 
me explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time when the federal government contributed to the 
employment insurance fund, then called the unemployment insurance 
fund, to the tune of about 25%. Of course the rest of the money 
came from employers and workers. All of a sudden in the 1980s, 
the government said “We will no longer contribute to the 
employment insurance fund. We will no longer put in our 25%. 
From now on all the money will come from employers and 
workers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of economic and financial studies have shown that our 
businesses have since lost a degree of competitivity, because 
they must make greater contributions to the employment insurance 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That decision has been a costly one. At the same time that the 
government was withdrawing from the plan in the 1980s a number 
of bills were introduced to make it harder for people to qualify 
for benefits. Before these changes seven or eight people in ten 
who would lose their jobs would qualify for EI benefits, 
compared to only four now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is putting less money into the fund. 
In fact, it is not putting any and it is tightening eligibility 
rules and a whole set of other rules, which my colleague 
described very well. 
These will, if I understand correctly, be raised before the 
House on June 1, 2001, when the standing committee tables a 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules were tightened and made stricter.  The government 
withdrew and contributed less money while at the same time 
wanting more control.  Hon. members will tell me there is 
nothing new about that.  That is more or less what the federal 
government has been doing for several years.  It wants to 
contribute less and less but to centralize more and more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has had repercussions.  In my riding of Saint-Jean a PSAC 
survey has shown clearly that Saint-Jean was losing $21 million 
yearly because of all the restrictions relating to employment 
insurance: restrictions on eligibility, on the number of weeks, 
on what the federal government contributes. 
Saint-Jean has received $21 million less than it did under the 
generous, previous plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saint-Jean is not alone.  In all ridings of Quebec and all 
ridings of Canada similar things have been happening.  As a 
result, people losing their jobs have found themselves dependent 
on provincial welfare once they were no longer eligible for 
employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hardly need point out that Ottawa has also reduced the amounts 
earmarked for transfer payments to the provinces for health, 
education and social assistance.  Thus the provinces are hit 
with exorbitantly heavy costs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we against this bill at the moment? It is because of 
clause 9. If the government agreed to delete clause 9 there 
would be no problem. Under the current legislation the premium 
rate is set by the Employment Insurance Commission on the 
recommendation of the Minister of Human Resources Development and 
the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us goes further. The Minister of Human Resources 
Development and the Minister of Finance will make their 
recommendations directly to the government. They will no longer 
have to go through the commission. As I was saying earlier, the 
government no longer contributes to the EI fund. This means that 
from now on there is a great risk that the decisions made by the 
department, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Human 
Resources Development in terms of setting the premium rate will 
be based on government needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people question the legitimacy of a fund like the one 
we now have, with a $6 to $7 billion a year surplus for a 
cumulative total of about $25 billion over the last few years, 
when that money is used for purposes other than the one for which 
it was intended, namely helping people who lose their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a major problem with clause 9 and we cannot agree to 
it. Many people have criticized this clause. 
In Quebec businesses and employers have spoken out against this 
because they have realized that they are now paying more without 
getting anything out of it, practically. They know that by 
paying more surpluses are building up in Ottawa and that part of 
what they are paying is used by the government to meet its own 
needs, which is not what the EI fund was designed to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employees who pay premiums every week have come to the same 
conclusion. They are saying that it does not only provide a 
safety net for those who lose their jobs.  They 
understand that with what the government is taking out of the 
fund it can pay back its debts or inject money in its daily 
operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a big problem. If the government could come to terms 
with this issue and say that it will forget about clause 9 and 
leave it up the commission to set the rate, then it could have 
the support of the Bloc Quebecois.  Until it change its mind, 
it will have to do without our support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to commend our colleague for making a list of very 
specific items that are not in the bill but that will eventually 
have be considered. Let me review some of them. There is the 
elimination of the waiting period, which is very important to us. 
During the 1998 ice storm in my riding of Saint-Jean people who 
had paid EI premiums all their lives and were laid off when 
their employers had to close shop because they were out of power 
were told “You have to wait two weeks”. I thought that was too 
much. 
These people had been paying in all their lives and needed these 
benefits, but the federal government had found a way to turn 
them down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way I see it, it is not an employee's fault when there are 
no longer any jobs.  Employment insurance is a safety net.  The 
only purpose I can see for the government in a waiting period is 
to ensure a supply of additional funds or fewer expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same with the creation of older workers' benefits. 
Since the government wrapped up the POWA program, which was 
designed to help older workers, we have had terrible problems in 
our ridings.  People regularly come to my office telling me 
“Listen, I am 55 or 58, and I swear to you that when I apply for 
work people look at me in an odd way and I never get an 
interview”.  This is only normal. 
Employers are going to select from a much younger pool.  They 
feel that even though older workers have accumulated a lot of 
experience, they will not be with the company as long.  They do 
not tell them “We are not going to hire you”.  They say “We are 
sorry, but we have selected someone else.  We are not able to 
hire you, but we will keep your name on file”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be that as it may, these people are unable to find another job, 
and this causes a problem.  This is one of the things that must 
be looked at a little later on, I imagine, when the standing 
committee submits its report on June 1.  For now, there are a 
whole series of issues that have not been resolved.  One of 
these is the benefit rate.  It is now 55% instead of the 60% it 
used to be.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is part of what I was saying earlier, that the government 
has tightened and tightened in order to go on increasing its 
surpluses for its own needs.  This is something that is 
difficult to accept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to the government's sense of reason.  If it wants the 
support of the Bloc Quebecois, all it has to do is delete clause 
9 and arrange things so that the commission, which sets premium 
rates on the recommendation of the two ministers, is maintained, 
so that it at least avoids the appearance of the government 
wanting to help itself to the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government withdraws clause 9 the Bloc Quebecois would 
be pleased to support Bill C-2.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak 
during report stage of Bill C-2 and in particular to address my 
remarks to the amendments the House is now dealing with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The perspective I bring to the Chamber this afternoon is one of 
equality for women and parents.  In my view if one addressed and 
analyzed the bill from the point of view of gender fairness and 
non-discrimination it would fail the test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have, as do I think many others in the House, a question for 
the government.  Was a gender analysis done for the bill?  Were 
the concerns of Canadians about the discriminatory features of 
the existing Employment Insurance Act addressed in preparation 
for Bill C-2? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem that on every count and in every instance the 
government has failed to address those concerns and has 
perpetuated the enormous inequalities and discriminatory features 
of the act and of the legislation before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have raised before in the House our concerns about the 
changes introduced by the government in 1997.  We have raised the 
concern that the government has taken important revenue away from 
workers and unemployed Canadians to deal with its preoccupation 
of balancing the budget and addressing the debt and deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had hoped, in this time of surplus and given the intentions 
of the government to redress its previous mistakes, that the bill 
would be a step forward.  Unfortunately that is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a particularly sad day for us to be here addressing the 
bill when at this very moment and as we speak a charter challenge 
is being heard in the courts.  It is a charter challenge that 
could have been avoided had the government put its money where 
its mouth was.  If it had adhered to and respected its own 
rhetoric the challenge would not be before the courts today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The witnesses and testimonies for the charter challenge were 
heard on February 19.  It is expected that we will soon hear the 
results of the challenge.  All expectations are that it will be 
successful and that the government will need to deal with the 
situation.  It will need to deal with its neglect in terms of 
equality for women, part time workers and parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge the work and contribution to the country by the 
Community Unemployed Help Centre of Winnipeg, which has taken up 
the challenge and supported a woman by the name of Kelly Lesiuk 
in her charter challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the 1997 changes, the Community Unemployed Help Centre 
of Winnipeg surveyed organizations and individuals to determine 
how the act might be improved.  It heard very clearly from 
participants that the present act was having a profound effect on 
workers with the most tenuous attachment to the labour force, 
including part time workers, new entrants and re-entrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who responded to the survey felt that unless the 
government addressed those concerns a charter challenge was 
perfectly in order and that there was incredible merit for such a 
case.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kelly Lesiuk, a part time nurse from Winnipeg, came forward with 
her situation.  I will describe her case briefly so members can 
see how the act and the bill before us fail to address a 
fundamental right and freedom in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kelly Lesiuk worked part time for five years while also raising 
a child.  When Kelly's husband found alternate employment in 
Winnipeg the family moved from Brandon, Manitoba and were faced 
with a difficult situation.  Kelly was five months pregnant with 
her second child.  She applied for employment insurance in 
Winnipeg. It was her justifiable expectation to obtain regular EI 
benefits while seeking employment.  She expected that when she 
was no longer able to work she could switch her claim to 
maternity and then to parental benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say, the Lesiuks were shocked to find that Kelly 
failed to qualify for benefits because she had fallen 33 hours 
short of the 700 hours required at the time of her application. 
As Kelly said in an interview in the spring of 1999: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make it through, we've had to deplete our savings, RRSPs, max 
out our credit cards and borrow money.  I have had to return to 
work just six weeks after having my baby boy by cesarean section. 
The safety net that we felt was there for us was not. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kelly is not alone in the situation she experienced.  Hundreds 
of other women, part time workers and parents are in similar 
situations.  Some 60 other cases based on similar circumstances 
are waiting to be heard pending the final word on the charter 
challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a shame that women like Kelly must go through such a 
lengthy legal process.  It is a shame that when the government 
had an opportunity to act so many other women are left waiting to 
hear how things will unfold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with a failure on the part of the government to 
address a systemic problem.  The government and society must 
recognize that today women represent 70% of part time workers. 
That means they bear a disproportionate negative impact under the 
government's approach to employment insurance.  They are the 
hardest hit by the Liberals' rules on employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To drive home the point, let us remember that seven out of ten 
unemployed women have no access to benefits.  Let us also remind 
ourselves that only 15% of young women now qualify for employment 
insurance.  Finally, let us recognize that only half of women who 
give birth receive maternity benefits under existing EI rules. 
This is because so many women are in part time, temporary or on 
call contracts that the government cannot meet the requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been very important for the government at this 
opportune moment to address those concerns and bring forward 
appropriate amendments to ensure there is no discriminatory 
impact on women in our society today.  For goodness' sake, we are 
in the year 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some 30 years women and women's movements across Canada have 
been fighting for legislation that has no gender bias.  They have 
been fighting for pay equity, recognition under employment 
insurance rules and fair treatment with respect to pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women have asked the government over and over again to ensure 
that every law is looked at from the point of view of its impact 
on women and that every proposal before the House comes with a 
gender based analysis.  There could not have been a gender based 
analysis with respect to this bill, or we would not be here today 
talking about its impact on women.  It is a matter of acting on 
the facts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the government has talked a lot about equality 
and about redressing the problems it created through its changes 
to the Employment Insurance Act in 1997.  This is the moment and the 
opportune time to make those changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a bill before us that could correct both problems and 
ensure that women, particularly women who work part time and 
women who continue to have the primary responsibility for the 
raising of children, are not discriminated against by actions of 
the government.  That is the fair, the just and the right thing 
to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane Bourgeois (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I would like to bring to your attention the fact that with 
regard to this debate dealing, with the status of 
women, among other things, there are still only a few of us in 
the House to advance the status of women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to bring to the attention of the 
House, not out of some mean-spiritedness, that every time there is a 
major debate in the House on women's issues I see very few 
women rising on the other side.  Instead I see quite a few 
men. This saddens me a little. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had not planned to take part in today's debate on EI. 
I will be speaking off the cuff, straight from the heart. This 
is a unique opportunity for me to raise the awareness of members 
of this House on the impact of some of the provisions of the 
Employment Insurance Act on the living conditions of women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the weekend and again on Monday and Tuesday, I was fortunate 
to take part in a national forum on birth and rebirth. It dealt 
with the time in the life of a woman between the moment when she 
becomes pregnant and 18 or 24 months after the birth of her 
child. The lack of tools available to women to escape poverty 
when they have a child was among the topics discussed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another topic was how through the whole process women find 
themselves isolated from everyone except perhaps the father. 
Quite often fathers, and increasingly so with young fathers, are 
present and involved. 
However, when we talk about single parent, people with children 
living in poverty, we are talking about women. When we talk 
about precarious jobs, we are talking about women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that 70% of precarious jobs, and probably even more, are 
held by women. They bear the brunt of precarious employment. Of 
course when they have not worked enough hours to qualify for EI 
benefits they do not get any.  What do they do?  That is the 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also thinking about self-employed women. Often women have 
been taken for a ride in this whole situation. They are often 
told “Become self-employed, work at home and you will be able to 
care for your children at the same time”. 
However self-employed women are not eligible for employment 
insurance benefits and they will not have access to parental 
leave either, because there is nothing about that in the bill. 
Moreover, they often do not make enough money to be eligible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last weekend, I was very surprised to find out that there is a 
committee of mothers who are being denied their maternity and 
parental leave. It is true. I have the brochure right here. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These women decided to form a group a few years ago 
because they are not eligible for leave or benefits. They asked 
that changes be made to the Employment Insurance Act.  I Hope the 
committee in charge of reviewing the EI plan 
heard them. Everything revolves around the eligibility criterion 
and the extension of parental leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a good thing that the government was able to take this 
eligibility criterion into account. It helps a little, except 
that when the benefit period was extended some of the negative 
effects were ignored. Some workers are not eligible. 
I will give an example and I will try to be very specific 
because it is a complex situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a pregnant woman who is on preventive withdrawal 
because her health or the baby's health is in danger and who 
receives benefits from the CSST is not eligible for EI benefits. 
That is a delicate situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These women are penalized because they received money from the 
CSST. They are penalized because they used preventive withdrawal 
to ensure their safety and the safety of their unborn baby. In 
doing that they cannot accumulate the required number of hours 
to qualify for maternity or parental leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are denied benefits; they are denied their rights. They are 
forced to choose, which I think is totally unacceptable. 
I believe this puts the government in a very awkward position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says “We will help mothers because we believe the 
first years of life are the most important. We will help parents 
get closer to their children”.  What about the women who 
cannot get employment insurance benefits and who are not 
entitled to parental leave?  They are forced to go back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately in Quebec we have a child care program. It helps a 
little. It offers support, but day care centres will never 
replace parents. The mother has a choice to make. She either 
takes parental leave at her own expense or she goes back to 
work. It is one of the bad elements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give another example. In the former Employment Insurance 
Act a woman was entitled to collect employment insurance 
benefits from the moment she had delivered the baby or at the 
expected time of delivery. 
The new act now says that a woman who has delivered a baby on or 
after January 1, 2000, is entitled to parental leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I have heard that you are aware of this problem. 
I am personally trying to collect signatures. As a member of 
parliament you might be doing an excellent job in this regard. 
What I am saying is that under the new act a woman who was 
expected to deliver her baby on January 5, 2001, but who did so 
on December 12, 2000, is not entitled to extended parental leave. 
She is not allowed the maximum period under the new legislation.

for the status of women I will do my best to explain, to change 
and to improve women's living conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this should be taken into account, if possible, because women 
represent 52% of the population in Canada. Women are in charge 
of bringing children up. It is the women who make Canada and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am very happy to speak today in the House to Bill C-2 and, in 
particular, to the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first like to pay tribute to the incredible amount of 
work that has taken place to bring the bill to where it is today, 
limited as it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I along with many of my colleagues were elected in 1997.  From 
day one of being elected to parliament, members of the New 
Democratic Party took up the issue of the discrimination and 
unfairness in the Employment Insurance Act which was brought in 
1996.  In particular, our spokesperson on unemployment insurance, 
the member for Acadie—Bathurst, has taken this issue up with an 
absolute passion and is an advocate for the unemployed men and 
women in this country.  It is the work of that member and of 
other members in the opposition that has forced this issue on to 
the political agenda.  It is quite ironic to see the amount of 
effort that was needed to force the government to bring forward 
even the very limited changes that are before us today in Bill 
C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In looking over the bill and the amendments, there is no 
question that if the bill is approved in its present form it 
would still act as a discriminatory piece of legislation and hurt 
those members of society who need the most protection and 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A glaring contradiction to the bill are the statements the 
government side has made in the House professing to be concerned 
about the increase in child poverty.  I remember the unanimous 
resolution that was approved by the House in 1989, moved by the 
then leader of the NDP, Mr. Ed Broadbent, calling for the 
elimination of child poverty by the year 2000.  It was a noble 
goal.  Not only have we not reached that goal, we have fallen 
further behind.  We now have more children living in poverty as a 
result of public policies.  One of those public policies is what 
has taken place with employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Winnipeg North Centre spoke very eloquently on 
how the bill historically, and even today, would have a very 
negative impact on women.  When we look at the provisions of the 
bill we realize that even though women pay into employment 
insurance they will not qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, with great respect, we have come to this point 
only because of the absolute determination of members in our 
party and other parties to bring this forward.  On the other 
hand, it is with a note of frustration and anxiety when I see 
that the bill still does not fundamentally address the inequities 
that exist within the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Winnipeg North Centre noted earlier, if the 
bill had come forward with a gender based analysis, as the 
government side said that it would, we would not be debating the 
bill in its current form today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that the provisions before us today will not help 
part time workers.  They will not help women and they will not 
help all new parents.  One of the positive things about the bill 
is that it does provide new provisions for new parents, but not 
all new parents will qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell members, and I am sure it is true for other members 
of the House, about the phone calls I am getting in my 
constituency office in Vancouver East from people who are 
desperate for support for their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents hear about the debate in the House of Commons. 
They look with a sense of hope that some changes could be coming 
to provide them with some relief to pay the rent, to put food on 
the table, and to have bus fare to go to school and to go to 
various activities in the community.  Constituents phone and ask 
whether the bill would help them, whether they would qualify for 
employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reading the fine print we find that there are still huge numbers 
of people, particularly women, part time workers and seasonal 
workers, who will be left behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party is concerned that Bill C-2, the 
employment insurance bill, further entrenches growing inequality. 
Members have an opportunity to recognize that the moneys that 
flow into the fund come from the workers of Canada. We have a 
financial, social and political responsibility to make sure that 
unemployed workers, parents who are seeking re-entry into the 
workforce and members of our society are protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a responsibility to ensure that they are treated with 
fairness and that they are not penalized by clawback measures 
which still exist in the current bill.  Unfortunately that is not 
the case.  The changes in the bill are so limited that the number 
of people who would be affected is very small. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party and I know we are joined by other 
members who understand that the political process is determined 
and resolved in its efforts to make sure the issue stays at the 
top of the political agenda.  It is about fairness and equality. 
It is about recognizing how women have been discriminated 
against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in the charter of rights and in equality.  We believe 
that when workers pay into a fund they have a right to income 
security when they are either unemployed, laid off or seasonal 
workers.  New parents should have access to parental leave.  They 
have a right to a certain level of comfort and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to work very hard to make sure that the 
amendments before us today that deal with some of the worst 
aspects of the bill and try to improve it are passed. There is no 
question that a much more indepth analysis is required on the 
whole question of employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of the House to support the amendments before 
us today that deal with some of the problems in the bill.  It 
must not stop there.  It is only one small step.  We must be 
committed to ensuring there are further changes to the system to 
end discrimination against unemployed people and women.  We must 
accept a very basic premise that unemployed people in Canada have 
a right to access their own insurance funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the worst scandals is how the fund has been raided over 
the years by the Government of Canada.  Thirty-five billion 
dollars has been taken in tax cuts to balance the books.  That 
does not help poor people.  In any other instance this would be a 
completely intolerable situation, yet it has been allowed to 
happen here.

accumulated in the surplus fund and the money will not go to the 
people who most desperately need it.  There is no other example 
that is as outrageous, as discriminatory and as unfair as this 
one.

fight what appears to be the agenda of the government, to ensure 
that unemployed people do not get what they deserve.  We want to 
make sure they have full access to income security and are 
treated with fairness and without discrimination.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ): </B>Madam Speaker, it 
is passing strange that we should still be discussing this EI 
reform in 2001. When I was the secretary general of the CSN back 
in 1995-96 we were discussing exactly the same issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Mr. Axworthy brought in this reform as human 
resources minister we warned him that it would penalize many 
workers, and it did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this very moment 6 out of 10 workers who contribute and then 
lose their jobs do not qualify. It is totally unacceptable in a 
society that is supposed to be democratic and value its safety 
net. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the bill before us does not correct the fundamental 
flaws we pointed out in 1995-96 and still condemn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Joliette, for example, there are many farm 
workers. Because of the kind of harvesting they are hired for, 
many of them do not work a sufficient number of weeks to qualify 
for benefits.  They leave for big cities like Montreal to find 
jobs and make ends meet. We are therefore losing highly skilled 
farm workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the federal government thinks anybody can be turned into 
a farm worker when the harvesting season comes. 
This is not the way it works. It takes people who, after several 
years of experience, know when it is appropriate to harvest. If 
there are no experienced workers, choices will have to be made. 
They will cost thousands of dollars, sometimes even millions 
of dollars, in terms of farm income. This will penalize not only 
farm producers but also the region as a whole, like my region 
of Joliette. Lanaudière is also a region where there are more 
independent workers than the Canadian average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember quite well Mr. Axworthy saying at the time that this 
reform was precisely aimed at adapting the EI plan to make it 
more compatible with the new realities in the labour market. We 
see that since 1995-96 the number of independent workers has 
increased and our plan is still not adapted to this new reality 
in the labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are people who do extremely important work in terms of 
general economic activity. These people are needed, but they are 
excluded from the social safety net and unduly penalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be very easy to find ways to include in the EI plan 
some protection for independent workers. Indeed, Quebec was able 
to do so in its—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I hope it is 
not my fiery comments that triggered the alarm.  Anyway my 
mother would be very pleased with my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To pick up where I left off, I was saying that the debate we are 
having today is somewhat preposterous because the flaws and the 
adverse impact of the EI reform have now been experienced for 
more than five years throughout Quebec and Canada.  It has 
penalized farm workers, as I mentioned with regard to my 
riding, self-employed workers who are excluded and young families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Terrebonne—Blainville talked about this at 
length a while ago, but it is important for me to mention it 
again, as my riding of Joliette includes suburbs such as Le 
Gardeur and L'Assomption where many young families are finding 
it extremely difficult to get their lives organized, to combine 
work and family, and who should have access to sensible parental 
leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, as I was winding up my speech when the 
alarm sounded I was saying that in Quebec we were imaginative 
enough to include self-employed workers in the parental leave 
program introduced by the minister of the day. Therefore, if the 
federal government had any imagination, we could solve all the 
problems that have been identified in the EI reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that Bill C-2, just like its predecessor Bill 
C-44, solves none of the basic problems which have been identified 
by everybody. I am happy that the committee unanimously adopted 
the motion by my colleague, the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, asking that it 
report back on all these aspects by June 1.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will concentrate on a particular aspect of Bill C-2 that we on 
this side consider fundamental, that is clause 9 in which the 
government claims the right to set the rate of EI premiums 
currently set by the Employment Insurance Commission with the 
approval of the governor in council and under the recommendation 
of the Minister of Human Resources Development and the Minister 
of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the Minister of Finance has repeatedly ignored the 
commission's recommendations over the last few years, but there 
is at least a debate held regularly on the rate required to 
finance the measures provided for in the employment insurance 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With clause 9 of Bill C-2 the government is trying to legalize 
what it is doing already, that is to legalize the 
misappropriation of funds we are witnessing with the creation of 
a surplus completely unrelated to the needs of the EI fund, a 
$35 billion surplus accumulated since 1995.  This is totally 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premiums are paid by the workers and by the employers.  We 
believe that it should be up to them, and only them, to set the 
rates needed for funding the measures provided for in the 
employment insurance plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government accomplished quite a feat, and it is not 
the first time, when it achieved a consensus in Quebec among all 
partners in the labour market against clause 9, indeed 
against Bill C-2. 
When we see that the FTQ and the Conseil du patronat both 
denounce clause 9 by which the government is giving itself the 
right to establish contribution rates, I think there is a 
problem and the government should do something right now to 
convince us not to vote against Bill C-2. Obviously the Bloc 
finds the bill totally unacceptable because of clause 9. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we must go further. How can the government justify 
giving itself the right to set premium rates under clause 9? I 
believe the government does not see the full impact of that 
provision because there are relatively few social consensus 
building fora in Canada. We know that labour relations have been 
rather stormy in the past and still are today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our unionization rate is not as high as I would like it to be 
but it is still one of the highest in the western world. In 
Quebec, for example, it is about 40% while in Canada it is 
around 34%. A government must have a social relation vision in 
order to be able to make labour market partners accountable on a 
number of issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With workers and employers each having a representative the EI 
commission was a consensus building forum. It encouraged 
social dialogue. By eliminating that forum through clause 9 the 
government is directly depriving labour market partners of their 
responsibilities and giving itself the right to decide the 
contribution rate of a plan to which it is not giving a cent. 
By taking that responsibility away from partners on the labour 
market it contributes to creating, I would even say generating, a 
vision of confrontation in terms of labour relations. In that 
regard I think the federal government is not acting 
responsibly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of doing what everyone is trying to do now in the 
western world, that is creating forums for social dialogue, it 
is eliminating one by giving itself the right to set the premium 
rates. I think that the approach taken in clause 9 goes beyond, 
and far beyond, the issue of employment insurance, even though 
that is already unacceptable. It goes to show that the 
government has no vision as far as the development of social 
relations within our society is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard I urge the government to accept the amendment we 
brought in to delete clause 9 so that we can vote for Bill C-2, 
although we are aware that the legislation does not resolve the 
problems I have pointed out concerning admissibility. I hope 
this can be addressed after the committee tables its report in 
early June.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
with great pleasure that I will say a few words on this 
important but incomplete bill which obviously does not answer 
the needs of workers in Quebec and Canada in terms of improving 
on the Axworthy reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Joliette said, we have been discussing the 
issue of employment insurance, formerly unemployment 
insurance, reform for ages. 
We have been discussing it since the days of Mr. Axworthy, who 
was replaced by the current Minister for International Trade, 
who was himself replaced by Mr. Dingwall, then by Mr. Doug 
Young, and finally by the incredible current Minister of Human 
Resources Development who had some problems we are all familiar 
with. Thus it is not the first time that members opposite 
are proposing major changes. They already did that with the 
disastrous impact we are all too familiar with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a riding like Trois-Rivières, in 1989 83% of workers 
were eligible for unemployment insurance benefits in the unhappy 
event that they lost their jobs because they contributed to the 
UI fund.  Now only 34% of those who contribute to the EI fund 
qualify. This is what this government has managed to do. It is a 
scandal we are faced with daily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that the Mauricie, which includes the ridings of 
Trois-Rivières, Champlain and Saint-Maurice, the Prime Minister's 
riding, is being short-changed by tens of millions of dollars in 
funds that could have been invested to keep the economy going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bit ironic to hear the member for Saint-Maurice, the 
Prime Minister, with all the problems he is experiencing with 
the Auberge Grand-Mère, say that it was to maintain and create 
jobs that he invested there and that consequently he is 
entitled to get his money back.  We know that he was involved in 
some of the administrative measures taken by his own government, 
which have deprived our region of hundreds of millions of 
dollars since 1994.  Therefore it is indecent on his part to say 
such irresponsible things, which show a lack of respect and 
contempt for the workers of his own riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some very serious omissions in this reform, as we can 
see from what happened to the surplus in the employment 
insurance fund.  We know that in less than 10 years the 
surplus has grown to the point where it now stands at $35 
billion.  The government had maintained the 1997 decision 
to abolish the program for older worker adjustment, better known 
as POWA. This program was the result of cutbacks to a more 
generous program, work adjustment training or WAT. This program 
was designed specifically for the workers in the Canadian 
textile industry which fell victim to decisions made in 
Ottawa concerning a foreign trade deal with countries less 
developed than ours whereby we would exchange wheat for 
textiles.  This measure affected the economy in Quebec where 
70% of the textiles were produced in those days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a program specifically created for the closing of 
textile plants, and it was known as WAT. 
It was designed for all textile workers. The program was 
fundamentally changed and became the program for older worker 
adjustment, POWA, which was more universal but had more 
stringent rules. In 1997 the federal government had too 
much on its plate in its fight against the deficit on the backs 
of poor people, so it decided to completely abolish POWA 
without any reservations and any further compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, despite the $35 billion surplus, we still have to live 
with the same administrative decision. When plants close, 
sometimes ruthlessly or for external reasons of non- 
profitability compared to foreign competition or management 
negligence, workers are footing the bill and those who are 55 
years of age and over are not receiving any compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Trois-Rivières this has had the following result: the Tripaq 
plant, despite considerable assistance from the Fonds de 
solidarité des travailleurs du Québec, which should be 
recognized, that did everything in its power to save it, had to 
close its doors for objective reasons. The federal government 
totally washed its hands of the matter. However much we appeal 
to the government as we do on other issues, it was useless, 
I am thinking of my colleague from Drummond who on the issue of the 
Celanese plant had some people come here to show their frustration 
and express their hope of being able to rely on public funds 
they themselves contributed to, it was useless.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the House that the federal government has no 
money in the EI fund. It is $35 billion that belongs to workers 
and employers. Today the federal government wants to maintain 
the rates it talked about during its totally demagogic election 
campaign because the Bloc courageously opposed this before the 
campaign. It wants to maintain control as if this was its own 
money, and this is totally indecent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members were to ask workers and business people if they 
wanted POWA to be reintroduced, with all the financial help and 
social solidarity this program entailed, I am sure that they 
would agree to have substantial help provided to older workers 
who lose their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a riding like Trois-Rivières this can be devastating. Despite 
all its promises and all its billions of dollars, the 
federal government's lack of concern and understanding is quite 
shameful. What we are talking about here is a hidden tax, a 
special tax paid by workers earning $39,000 or less. With only 
34% instead of 83% of the people getting benefits, this is a 
misappropriation of funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will keep on criticizing the federal government for not 
spending public funds most effectively, for not showing more 
compassion to fathers, mothers and children facing hard times, 
and for not strengthening the social fabric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we go from 83% to 34% women working part time and seasonal 
workers are hard hit. I thought it was shameful and totally 
immoral for the federal government to stop talking about 
seasonal jobs and start talking about seasonal workers. 
These workers are full time workers who unfortunately have 
seasonal jobs. This is something we should remind the people in 
charge of the EI system and their minister of. We have to adapt 
the system to the realities these workers are facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, this legislation goes after the students. 
They have summer jobs and pay EI premiums, and yet they know they 
will never be able to collect any benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of concern of the federal government applies also to 
the POWA file, as I mentioned, but in view of the government's 
surplus it also applies to an issue that has to do with the 
pulp and paper industry, the existence of which I am pleased to 
mention today. I am referring to the integrated centre for pulp 
and paper technology, a natural field for the Saint Maurice 
valley, which is vital to how we have traditionally defined 
ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a plan to merge the research centre of the Université 
du Québec in Trois-Rivières with the Centre for Pulp and Paper 
Technology at the cégep de Trois-Rivières. The Quebec government 
has already announced its intention to be financially involved 
in this project, pledging tens of millions of dollars. It is a 
$85 million to $100 million project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully this afternoon the minister of finance of Quebec is 
going to reaffirm her intention to support this project. 
However the federal government is stalling. The infamous Canada 
Foundation for Innovation, set up by the current Minister of 
Finance with $1.3 billion of taxpayer money, has so far said no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this day nobody in this government has cared to make up for 
this seemingly totally arbitrary decision. This project, which 
is a top priority in Quebec, does not even register on Canada's 
radar screen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue is the perfect illustration of our two solitudes. It 
reflects two different ways of seeing things. It shows that our 
priorities are very seldom the same. Hopefully Quebecers will 
understand that they have no future in this country, and that it 
is only when we are masters of our own destiny once and for all 
that we will be able to work within a true partnership between 
Quebec and Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Lanctôt (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise to 
express my opposition to Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues presented many aspects of the legislation that 
show that the government has no respect for employees as well as 
employers by not addressing their problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is hurting workers by refusing to address 
urgent situations and to correct the deficiencies of the current 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Bloc Quebecois is asking for is clear. 
The measures the Bloc Quebecois is asking for are meant to 
correct flaws in the plan by taking into account the day to day 
condition of workers and a labour market that keeps changing, 
with students who have to combine a job and studying and an 
increasing number of independent workers. These two groups are 
not taken into account in the bill, but they will have to be 
soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the duty of the federal government to address the issue 
right away so that these two groups of workers are included just 
like other workers already covered by the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is asking the federal government to respond 
to the hopes of workers, to further improve 
the EI plan and to eliminate discrimination in EI requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to abolish the definition of labour force, because it 
penalizes directly the young and women in that they have to 
work a total of 910 hours in 52 weeks to qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A women who re-enters the labour market after two years is 
considered a new entrant and not a member of the labour market. 
What a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same is true of young people who are also considered new 
entrants, because they are in their first job. This same 
definition allows certain workers to be eligible for the same 
plan with no more than 420 hours accumulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The self-employed have been completely forgotten.  It might even 
be said that this segment does not exist at all, or worse, is 
not worth the bother to the government.  Self-employed workers 
represented 12% of the total workforce in 1976.  They 
represented 18% in 1999. The government cannot deny this segment 
of the population which now represents one worker in five.  The 
figure is huge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must absolutely not forget that this sector of workers is 
growing.  The federal government must, right now, include these 
workers fully in the employment insurance plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another group penalized by this bill is that of young people. 
It creates a dichotomy in that students must go to school as 
well as work in order to survive and in the hopes of finding 
well paid work.  However the standards in this bill give them no 
help at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The latest census in 1996 reported over 2.8 million full time 
students.  According to the monitoring and assessment report one 
million individuals earned less than $2,000 and were therefore 
entitled to a refund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, only 40% of these people applied for a refund and 42% 
of them were under 25 years of age.  In short, 2.6 million 
students are being taxed to study.  Young people—

in my constituency this weekend.  The 12th annual Vince Ryan Old 
Timers Hockey Tournament is being held in Cape Breton beginning 
today and will see 125 teams from across Canada and the United 
States converge on my community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tournament's namesake, Vince Ryan, was recognized throughout 
Cape Breton and indeed the Atlantic provinces as a skilled 
athlete, a fierce competitor and a man who held high a sense of 
fair play and sportsmanship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upward of 2,000 players will compete in the spirit of fellowship 
in the country's national winter pastime in what has become one 
of Atlantic Canada's premier adult recreational sporting events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank Duddy Ryan, the entire Ryan family, Ritchie Warren and 
his committed group of volunteers for ensuring that this annual 
event continues to be a highlight of our Cape Breton winters.  I 
wish them all the very best in this week's tournament.

Speaker, on Saturday, March 31, Denis Desautels, the Auditor 
General of Canada, will retire after 10 years of dedicated 
service as an officer of parliament.  I rise today to acknowledge 
his contribution as one of Canada's most dedicated and trusted 
public servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has served our country well.  As members of parliament our 
integrity is often questioned in the House, but his integrity is 
beyond question.  He has been our conscience and our watchdog. 
When he speaks, the nation listens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of his reports have highlighted the problems of waste and 
mismanagement in government and the need for transparency and 
openness in government.  At times he fundamentally disagreed with 
government and held his ground, but they all speak amply of his 
dedication to improving the service Canadians receive from their 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of all members of parliament and senators, I thank the 
auditor general.  We wish him a happy retirement or a new career, 
but whatever the future holds and wherever it may take him, he 
goes with the best wishes of all in the House and indeed of all 
Canadians whom he has served so well.

out, but the Canadian Alliance says it will not go.  Instead we 
will be relegated to hearing people who can get to Ottawa and to 
teleconferencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance now wants to hijack committees the same 
way it has hijacked parliament.  Canadians are fed up with these 
tactics.  Instead of listening to concerns from across the 
country, the Canadian Alliance would rather throw mud and destroy

opposition members are silent on the important events taking 
place in the country, I would like to draw the attention of this 
House to the impressive job done by our police forces to fight 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By launching Operation Printemps 2001, police forces have 
destabilized criminal motorcycle gangs. In all, over 200

following an investigation that lasted over two years. Let us 
acknowledge the remarkable work done by our police officers.

concerned about the activities of criminal gangs. Our

that what the Liberals said during the election has nothing to do 
with their actions once elected.  There is a long list of broken 
promises, from scrapping the GST and eliminating child poverty to 
an independent ethics counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are Liberal members doing that they never talked about 
during the election?  They never said a word about toll roads, 
but now the transport minister cannot wait for Canadians to start 
paying to use their own highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is airport fees.  It already costs an arm and a 
leg to fly.  Now the Liberal government is letting airports jack 
up landing fees, taking even more money out of the pockets of 
travellers.  The transport minister states that people voted for 
this when they voted in the Liberals.  I wonder why the red book 
did not say a word about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Toll roads and airport fees would not be necessary if the 
Liberal government adequately funded infrastructure.  Canadians 
expect their taxes to fund public infrastructure.  They should 
not have to pay even more in the form of road tolls and landing 
fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has the money and it should commit the necessary 
funding for our highways and infrastructure.  That is what 
Canadians deserve, not more Liberal neglect.

the existing consensus about its existence as a nation and its 
legitimate aspirations having to be recognized as such by the

2001 is being called the biggest anti-gang operation in Canada's

clear to the criminal element that we will be vigilant in 
demonstrating that these kinds of underworld activities are not 
tolerated in our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday's raids came after many months of investigations and 
groundwork conducted by our police forces.  One of the many tools 
used by police forces was the broader powers granted to them by 
the anti-gang law passed by the government in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Putting an end to organized crime remains a key concern of the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member must have gone to the same law school as 
the leader of the Conservative Party.  A binding contract does 
not need a letterhead.  It can be in handwriting.  The basic 
thing is to show the intentions of the parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intention was that the Prime Minister, before he became 
Prime Minister, sold all his shares to Mr. Prince's company. That 
is what happened.  Those are the facts, and the hon. member ought 
to admit it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that the 
date of the bill of the sale is the very date that the Prime 
Minister chose his first cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the Prime Minister could have found at least one 
individual who was confident enough to draft a proper legal 
document.  What circumstances forced the Prime Minister to sign 
such a dubious piece of paper? 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I apologize to the law schools which the Conservative 
leader flunked out of.  I am sure that the hon. member is 
following the same practice.  Her legal advice is equally 
unsound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The document is a legally binding one.  This is confirmed in a 
later agreement between Mr. Prince's company and Mr. Michaud's 
company when Mr. Prince signed that document which contained a 
statement that he, Mr. Prince, had owned the shares all along 
from and after November 1993. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister is still claiming that he sold his shares in the 
Grand-Mère Golf Club to Jonas Prince in November 1993.  But, in 
the September 1999 agreement, it is J&AC Consultants, the 
Prime Minister's company, which, under article 2.2, indemnifies 
and saves harmless the new buyer against potential “losses, 
damages, and expenses” arising from this sale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it the Prime Minister's company that is providing this 
guarantee and not Jonas Prince, the supposed owner of the 
shares? 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
facts are clear.  The Prime Minister sold his shares before he 
became Prime Minister and the shares were sold by Mr. Prince to 
Mr. Michaud. The facts are clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the hon. member not prepared to accept these facts?  He 
must accept them because they are the facts and they are true. 
<P><A NAME="LINK116"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we must accept 
them because the Prime Minister tells us to.  This is a powerful 
argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the Prime Minister who is providing the vendor's guarantee 
to the new buyer, Mr. Michaud.  It seems to me that to provide a 
vendor's guarantee, the Prime Minister would have to admit that 
he had something to sell.  Otherwise, he would not be providing 
such a guarantee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that, in 1999, it was not Jonas Prince providing the 
vendor's guarantee but the Prime Minister's company?  Let him 
explain that to us, rather than complacently believing what his 
leader tells him. 
<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
according to the advice I have received, the documents contain 
the usual clauses found in such transactions. It is a fact that 
Mr. Prince and his company sold all their shares to Mr. Michaud's 
company.  This proves that the Prime Minister was not a 
shareholder at the necessary times. 
<P><A NAME="LINK118"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister told this House that he had sold his shares in 1993. 
The ethics counsellor backed up the Prime Minister by saying 
that it was a sale without right of reversion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime Minister and the ethics counsellor were speaking 
the truth, what was the Prime Minister doing in the 1999 
transaction?  How can a person sell something that has not been

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, they would be 
all too happy to have the Prime Minister exhonerated when he is 
in it up to here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 2.1 of the 1999 agreement confirms that the Prime 
Minister's company “or any third party will have no further 
property rights or interest in the shares”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime Minister signed this document and stated that he 
had no further property rights, it means that just before 
signing the 1999 agreement he had an interest, he had property 
rights and he is in conflict of interest.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

it was sold, here is the record of sale”'.  And that is exactly 
what the Prime Minister said “Here is the record of sale”.

the premier of Newfoundland has said that he intends to export

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the Deputy Prime Minister.  The NDP 
believes it is very important for the federal government today to 
repudiate in the strongest possible way, not just rhetorically 
but legislatively if possible, what the premier of Newfoundland 
has said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Deputy Prime Minister indicate today that they will

apparent to everyone.  He also knows that it is quite 
unparliamentary to use that kind of language in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that he would be perhaps more discrete in his

language and carry out the proper decorum of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I asked the Deputy Prime

of Canada get up and repudiate the premier of Newfoundland who 
intends to jeopardize, thanks to NAFTA which does not have an 
exemption for water despite what the Liberals say, the entire 
country's water supply? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will they repudiate that today and bring in a ban? 
<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I think I had better get up before the hon. member does 
himself some damage.  Canadians agree that we need to protect the 
integrity of Canada's water resources.  It is our strategy, as 
indicated by the hon. House leader, to prohibit bulk water 
removal from major drainage basins in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that the new premier of Newfoundland has 
simply said that he is thinking about the issue and he will not 
do anything about it until the fall.  This gives us time to 
confirm through the legislation our position on behalf of all 
Canadians.  We are working on behalf of all Canadians, on this 
water issue.  We will continue to do so and I am sure—

The Prime Minister claims that he had sold his shares, while Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 2.1 provides that the Prime Minister waives his 
ownership rights over the shares. This means he had to have them

provide such a guarantee. Under article 2.3, he waives his right 
to any recourse, while in article 3.6 he says “I will pay if

the Judges Act amendments, and Bill C-9, the elections bill. 
If we have the time, I will also suggest completing Bill C-4, 
respecting the Sustainable Development Foundation, before 
adjourning for Easter.

<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Rajotte (Edmonton Southwest, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today on a question of privilege with regard 
to a committee matter that is so unique and extraordinary that I 
must bring it directly to the attention of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question of privilege charges the chair of the Standing 
Committee on Industry, Science and Technology with contempt. This 
morning at the standing committee's meeting, the chair abused her 
authority by ruling out of order a motion concerning her 
decisions as chair of the committee.  Such motions are in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Referring to Marleau and Montpetit, on page 858 it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Disorder and misconduct in a committee may arise as a result of 
the failure to abide by the rules and practices of a 
committee...If a committee desires that some action be taken...it 
must report the situation to the House.  The House may make a 
decision on disorder upon receiving such a report. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what I was attempting to do.  How can the 
committee comply with the practices of the House if the chair 
rules such motions out of order?  What I find most objectionable 
is the fact that the motion was concerning the actions of the 
chair.

<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion was to report to the House the matter of the chair's 
rulings regarding numerous motions concerning the ethics 
counsellor to the House.  Her refusal to allow a motion to report 
her own actions to the House is a conflict of interest and 
impedes the committee from being master of its own proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would gladly ask the committee to report this conflict of 
interest to the House, but the chair, based on her decision 
today, does not entertain motions concerning her decisions.  As 
you can see, Mr. Speaker, my only recourse is to bring the matter 
to the House directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House is entitled to all reports and has a duty to deal with 
contempts or misconducts that occur in committee.  Since that is 
not possible, since the chair has impeded the committee's ability 
to decide to report the matter to the House, I must submit the 
chair's actions directly to the House.  The chair's rulings 
regarding certain motions were biased and inconsistent with the 
practices of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final motion she disallowed was a motion to report her 
rulings to the House.  That goes to the very heart of the 
question of privilege.  The member cannot procedurally or 
legitimately disallow a motion that might jeopardize her position 
as chair.  She cannot silence criticism against her authority and 
refuse to implement the wishes of those who elected her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 119 of Erskine May there is a reference regarding a 
select committee that was appointed in 1977 to inquire into the 
conduct and activities of members and to consider whether any 
such conduct or activities amounted to a contempt of the House 
and whether any such activities were “conduct inconsistent with 
the standards the House was entitled to expect from its 
members”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I consider the chair's decisions at the Standing Committee on 
Industry, Science and Technology to be conduct inconsistent with 
the standards that the House and the public expect from a member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a great deal at stake here.  We cannot let the matter 
go unresolved.  The hon. member for Essex must be found in 
contempt by the House.  While my rights as a member of the 
standing committee are immediately at stake, ultimately the 
threat is to the democratic rights and freedoms of all members of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is contributing to the inability of the House to 
resolve the matter of the appearance of a conflict of interest 
regarding the Prime Minister's involvement with the Grand-Mère 
Golf Club and Grand-Mère Inn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her role as chair is not to protect the Prime Minister but to 
protect the rights of all members of the committee and to uphold 
the rules and practices of the House.  In that regard she has 
failed, and she has no right to impede my efforts to report those 
decisions to the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the issue we are referring to 
occurred over two days.  In the first incident some members of 
the committee attempted to bring in witnesses to review the 
activities of a member of the House.  Obviously members know that 
cannot be done.  It is quite clear under our rules and under 
Maingot's advice that one cannot do that.  At the first meeting 
the chair ruled that was out of order and that was sustained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the second meeting, the information I have is that an hon. 
member who was dissatisfied with both the ruling at first reading 
and the sustaining of the chair's ruling tried to bring a motion 
to report that to the House.  When that was ruled out of order by 
the committee chair the ruling was appealed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has failed to indicate that the ruling he refers 
to was appealed and that the appeal was sustained by a vote of 
the committee.  He neglected, either skilfully or perhaps he 
forgot, that very important element.  The ruling was sustained. I 
suggest that this issue should not be before the House at all. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I do not think the Chair need hear any 
more on this point.  The point appears to me to be clear.  I 
received the letter from the hon. member for Edmonton Southwest 
and have heard his arguments.  I have heard the arguments put 
forward by the hon. government House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the committee is master of its own procedure. 
The fact that the committee made a decision to uphold the 
decision of its chair renders it impossible for this Chair to 
intervene.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the committee, being master of its own procedure, has decided 
that is the way it wishes to proceed, I do not believe it is in 
order for the hon. member to come to the House under the guise of 
a question of privilege and attempt to challenge the ruling of 
the chairman of the committee.  In the circumstances, I find there 
is no question of privilege raised here.

Speaker, I have something to which the Chair and the Secretary of 
State for Multiculturalism should be made aware given the events 
of last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to table the secretary of state's press release 
dated March 8, 2000.  It may help her to answer a question I 
asked her in question period.  Her response to the question I had 
asked was “I do not know what the member is alluding to”.  Her 
response to my second question was “I will not make a comment on 
something that I know nothing about”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would find that hard to believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  It does not sound like a point of order to 
me.  This sounds like an argument.  The hon. member for 
Edmonton North is requesting consent to table some documents.  Is 
there consent?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, during question period I referenced a letter signed by a 
Canadian immigration official, dated March 6, 2001, which clearly 
stated “Unfortunately, the occupational demand for a nurse is 
currently zero”.  I would like to seek unanimous consent from 
the House to table the letter.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am tempting fate a little bit here, but there have been 
consultations and I think you might find unanimous consent to 
revert to presenting reports from committees for the purpose of 
introducing a report from the procedure and House affairs 
committee on votable items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent to revert to
