<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>COMMENTS DURING QUESTION PERIOD

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Colleagues, before we begin with orders of 
the day, I have received notification from the hon. member for 
Burnaby—Douglas.  Yesterday we had an incident in the House 
where the word treasonous was used by a member putting a question 
to a minister.  At that time I asked the hon. member for 
Burnaby—Douglas to withdraw his comments.  At that time his 
answer was no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that the hon. member for Burnaby—Douglas is in the House 
this morning.  Rather than have any kind of a long statement or 
explanation, as far as the House is concerned I have a question 
to put to the hon. member and it will be quite direct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member wish to withdraw the word treasonous which 
he refused to withdraw yesterday? 
<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, yes.  Out of respect for the traditions of the House I 
do withdraw the word treasonous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I consider this matter closed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Wild Rose raised a 
question of privilege on September 30.  At that time I heard 
argument not only from the member but from other members in the 
House.  This morning the hon. minister of Indian affairs will be 
making a statement, giving us further information on this 
question of privilege. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you for the 
opportunity to provide additional information for your 
consideration of the question of privilege raised by the member 
for Wild Rose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Wild Rose alleges that an official of the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
deliberately misled him and subsequently denied him information 
to which he was entitled as a member of Parliament, thus 
constituting a contempt of Parliament. This is not the case.  I 
wish to put before the House an outline of my understanding of 
what occurred that day and the rationale for the official's 
actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On August 29, 1997 my staff offered to have senior departmental 
officials from the Alberta region provide the member for Wild 
Rose with a briefing on the initiatives being undertaken by the 
department in the Stony community.  While I cannot speak to the 
specifics of the hon. member's expectations, there was no promise 
at that time to release confidential financial information of the 
band to him.  The meeting was subsequently arranged for September 
16, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few days prior to the meeting Indian affairs officials learned 
that members of the Stony band would be attending with the hon. 
member.  On the day of the meeting the departmental regional 
office became aware that members of other bands in Alberta were 
also accompanying the member to the meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 16 the hon. member for Wild Rose arrived by bus for 
the meeting accompanied by two assistants and approximately 20 
members from three different Alberta bands. 
The member conducted at least one interview via telephone with 
the media while on route to the meeting.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representatives of the media also arrived at the building that 
afternoon, apparently at the invitation of the hon. member. 
Despite this development the participants at the meeting were 
advised that they could be present for the general briefing but 
that DIAND officials were not at liberty to reveal to non-band 
members financial information confidential to the Stony band. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position taken by DIAND officials was guided by restrictions 
of the Access to Information Act and the Privacy Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is acknowledged that the information sought was not requested 
under the Access to Information Act.  However, given the 
government's potential liability over inappropriate disclosure of 
confidential information to third parties, the Access to 
Information Act is used for guidance on the informal release of 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Confidential financial information relative to the band is 
mandatorily protected by the Access to Information Act.  As such, 
it can only be released to third parties after a consultation 
process.  Consultations are with the chief and council or duly 
authorized officials of the band. Some of the information can be 
provided, however, to individual members of the band, as they are 
entitled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that point the largest contingent at the meeting, primarily 
members of the Samson band, agreed to leave the briefing and 
requested a separate meeting with DIAND officials immediately 
following the meeting with Stony band members.  That request was 
granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Wild Rose and one other member of another 
First Nation protested the position being taken by DIAND 
officials.  An assistant to the hon. member then drafted a 
handwritten note at the meeting which he had signed by members of 
the accompanying group.  This note appointed the member as their 
financial advisor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Wild Rose claimed that as their financial 
advisor he was entitled to the same information as the band 
members themselves.  DIAND officials were unsure of the legal 
implications of releasing the information under these 
circumstances or the rights of a financial advisor to receive 
such information.  As such, he advised those present that if they 
pursued the matter legal advice would have to be sought before 
the meeting could continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member agreed to leave the meeting to allow a 
discussion of financial issues with the members of the Stony 
tribe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Wild Rose was not present during the discussion 
of financial issues which was provided to individual members of 
the Stony band, but he was present during the briefing by DIAND 
staff of the initiatives being taken to address the situation at 
Stony.  These initiatives include the appointment of a third 
party manager to manage the day to day operations of the Stony 
First Nation, the initiation of a forensic audit of the band 
operations and the establishment of a joint task force to examine 
the conditions on reserve and develop proposals to address them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the meeting the hon. member asked if the department could 
contribute to the cost of the bus which was used to bring the 
group to the briefing.  The member was advised at that point that 
this was not possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometime after the meeting the hon. member's assistant contacted 
the DIAND regional office.  He stated that he had a conversation 
with an official in the office of the access to information 
commissioner and claimed he was advised that the member was 
entitled to the information he had sought as a representative of 
the individual band members present.  The member's assistant was 
advised by DIAND to submit a formal access to information 
request.  This would allow the member to specifically state what 
information he required and it would enable the department to 
obtain legal advice on a specific request for information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These events appear to have led to the hon. member's question of 
privilege. I wish to submit the following points for 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the member for Wild Rose alleges that officials 
deliberately misled him and withheld information.  The fact is 
there was no intention to deliberately mislead or withhold 
information.  It was my staff that offered the briefing and 
regional officials provided the briefing as promised.  The 
regional official involved did not provide information which he 
felt was confidential and protected under acts of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I do not believe that the official's actions indicate a 
contempt of this Parliament.  The fact that he said he would not 
release the requested information under unusual circumstances 
without first obtaining legal advice was, I believe, the prudent 
course of action and demonstrated no contempt for Parliament 
or the member's rights as a parliamentarian. His emphasis on 
prudence with respect to confidential information demonstrates 
his respect for Parliament and the laws that it develops.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, in this question of privilege the hon. member refers to 
regulations governing disclosure of information.  While it is not 
clear to which regulations he is referring I wish to make the 
following points.  The member for Wild Rose claims that the 
released confidential financial information is permitted if 
written consent is received. The member argues that he had such 
consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it appears that he had the consent of a few band members, 
the information being sought related to the entire band and was 
not specific to those members.  He did not have the consent of 
the band.  He also claims that as a member of Parliament he is 
entitled to confidential information.  If he is referring to the 
Privacy Act, section 8.1(g) does allow that personal information 
can be released to a member of Parliament “for the purpose of 
assisting the individual to whom the information relates in 
resolving a problem”.  Again, in this case the information 
requested was not specific to the individuals but related to the 
entire band. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My department arranged a briefing in good faith, provided the 
briefing and attempted to accommodate the request for information 
within the law.  The official involved acted prudently by not 
revealing confidential information without seeking legal advice. 
I am sure the hon. member would not want officials of the 
department of Indian affairs or any public servant to risk 
releasing confidential information or violating the spirit of an 
act of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate this opportunity to outline the circumstances 
surrounding the point of privilege raised by the hon. member for 
Wild Rose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I see the hon. member for Wild Rose is 
seeking the floor.  I presume it is on this same matter. I do not 
want a debate to go back and forth.  I am looking for the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member for Wild Rose feels he has some additional 
facts, new facts, that he has not laid on the table already to 
add to this discussion, then of course I would recognize him at 
this time.  If he does not have any new facts I will proceed from 
there.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr.  Speaker, I am 
going to put it in the form of a question more than anything 
else. The minister states that a member of Parliament cannot 
receive this information based on the signatories of the band 
present authorizing me to do so.  Yet in the same breath when I 
left the bureaucrat in question was willing to give that 
information to those very few band members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I am required to get the entire band's permission, then 
surely the bureaucrat would not be allowed to give just a handful 
of people that information.  It must go to the whole band. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really confused as to exactly what the minister means by 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Once again, this is put in the form of a 
question and of course it is one of the questions that this House 
has asked me to take into consideration and which will be taken 
into consideration. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, you suggested that if one had any new information that 
might help you would receive this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know of this particular official.  I spent 20 years in the 
consulting business in Alberta.  One of our areas of work was 
trying to improve relations between aboriginal people and oil 
companies.  In the conduct of that work I had encounters with 
this official.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real problem—and the minister simply does not address 
it—is that many bureaucrats in this department started out 
idealistic and got into this matter to try to help aboriginal 
people.  Because of the difficulties of the problems being dealt 
with and the machinery they had to work with, they have become 
utterly cynical about whether there is anything they can do. They 
now no longer try to help.  They simply play by the bureaucratic 
rules and the more bureaucratic the better. Those are the real 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's response does not address those problems at all. 
Perhaps the minister could think for a moment.  If we were first 
nations people who were pulled in from that band, 15 to 25 of us, 
could she put herself into their shoes and listen to her own 
statement?  It is utter bureaucratic nonsense that does not 
address the concerns of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the hon. member was endeavouring to get beyond by 
arranging this meeting.  The minister's response takes the side 
of the bureaucrats, not just against this member of Parliament 
but against the interests of ordinary people who would find her 
answer utterly incomprehensible, as do the members on this side 
of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We are getting a little more into debate 
rather than facts.  If there are pertinent facts that have not 
been laid on the table as opposed to opinions in terms of 
personalities, I will permit interventions.  They must deal with 
facts and if they do not deal with facts I will intervene on the 
statements. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, when 
you look into this instance in its entirety I know you will 
review all the discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This question affects not only the hon. member for Wild Rose but 
many of us who have bands in our ridings—and in my case I have 
over 20 of them—that face similar problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should look at the privileges of a member of Parliament with 
regard to the Access to Information Act and other problems.  The 
minister says that information cannot be given out without the 
consent of chief and council, and the chief and council are the 
ones the aboriginal people with whom I deal want me to 
investigate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the dilemma the member for Wild Rose and I are in.  The 
access to information people are now at the point where they will 
have to proceed to court to try to get this stuff, because the 
member of Parliament cannot represent the people who sent him 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief and council, the very ones grassroots aboriginal 
people have come to me for help on because they have a problem 
with them, are told they cannot get the information because it is 
the chief.  But it is the chief who is the problem.  What are we 
to do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Once again, we are sort of enlarging on the 
whole question.  I ask hon. members to be very diligent in their 
remarks.  If there are other facts, let us stick to the facts and 
I will hear them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I return to the hon. member for Wild Rose, and this will be the 
final intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to point to 
one thing stated by the minister.  She said that I was acting on 
behalf of these people from the Stony reserve as a financial 
adviser.  That is false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not a financial expert in the slightest.  I am the MP for 
that riding.  I am their elected official.  I was there at their 
request and was trying to serve on their behalf.  That is why I 
was there and not as a financial adviser.  That is hogwash. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Many times we have situations where we 
have disputes and different interpretations of the facts on what 
really happened.  One person will look at it one way and another 
person will look at it another way.

I will have a look at the statements on both sides.  I will have 
a look at whatever information the member has laid before me. 
After I have studied it to my satisfaction, I will come back to 
the House with a decision on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. leader of the Reform Party in the House have some 
facts to add? 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is for a point of information.  I ask whether the Speaker will 
be willing to accept more information, statements and depositions 
to help your decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point I am not sure whether the Speaker has all the 
information.  You could request witnesses or anything that would 
help your decision in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  When members raise questions of privilege 
they usually lay whatever information they have on the table. The 
words of hon. members are taken as hon. members, and I will deal 
with the situation as presented to me by hon. members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should I need any other information I will inform the House that 
I need it to make my decision.  If not and if I can come to a 
fair decision for all of us, I will do so and I will base it on 
the facts that hon. members from both sides have laid before me 
and before the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am rising on a point of order with respect to this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Is the hon. member rising on a point of 
order on this issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  I am not sure.  I would like to make one 
observation with respect to what I have heard.  I request that 
you consider this issue in the context of—because I do not think 
it has been very well expressed—members' privileges under the 
Privacy Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would appear from what I have heard that this issue pertains 
to the Privacy Act more than to the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I thank the hon. member for that 
intervention.  I assure the House that I will look at all aspects 
of the matter because the privileges of a member and the 
privileges of members are at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take as broad a view as possible, but I will bring to 
bear precisely on the issues raised by the hon. member for Wild 
Rose and the response by the hon. minister.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my distinct pleasure to rise in the House today as the 
newly elected member for the riding of Oak Ridges.  The riding is 
named after the Oak Ridges moraine which intersects nine 
municipalities.  It is made up of the communities of Richmond 
Hill, the home of the largest observatory east of the Rocky 
Mountains and the home of Elvis Stoyko, world championship 
skater; the town of Whitchurch-Stouffville, the home of the 
largest strawberry festival in Canada; and the northern Markham 
area, the high tech capital of southern Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The residents of the riding have placed their trust and faith in 
me.  I will not let them down.  Public office is a sacred trust 
and I believe that our role as parliamentarians is to listen to 
the people, act with fairness and wisdom, and to never forget 
that we are here to serve the interests of Canada.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The road to democracy is not a freeway.  It is a toll road on

</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have accepted our civic responsibilities as members of this 
House.  I believe that Canadians now more than ever expect and 
even demand that our nation's leaders try to work toward 
consensus on issues.  The days of political attack and rancour 
have not served this nation well, in my view.  Political parties 
and governments need to work more co-operatively if we are to 
achieve the best for our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there will be fundamental issues on which we will disagree, 
but where there is an opportunity for us to work together to 
achieve solutions, let us do it, in the words of Nike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne is the government blueprint for the 
coming term.  I would like to focus on three areas which are of 
concern to me:  youth, national unity, and investment in 
knowledge and creativity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order for Canada to be truly a land of opportunity we must 
develop an economic atmosphere which speaks to young Canadians, 
which tells them they have a future in Canada.  They need to be 
able to dream and to reach for the stars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has stated very clearly that the level of 
unemployment among our young people is far too high.  We have the 
best educated young people in our history and we need to create 
the conditions that will position them to thrive in our knowledge 
based economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February the government announced the youth employment 
strategy which consolidated over $2 billion in new and existing 
funding for programs and services that young people need to 
acquire the skills and work experience to find jobs and lasting 
careers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the three priorities of the government in this area: 
to make sure that young people make a successful transition to 
the world of work; to make sure that our young people who want to 
continue to learn have access to education; and finally to make 
sure that our young people who have found it difficult to get 
started in the workplace get a second chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former educator I have worked closely with students.  I 
know their concerns and their aspirations.  Canada is the land of 
opportunity and the government has committed itself to making the 
vision of tomorrow a reality for Canadian youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of internship programs has been particularly successful 
in helping young people get started.  The government has 
committed itself to expand these programs.  Enhanced funding for 
student summer placements will continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Working with the private sector and provincial governments, a 
Canada-wide mentorship program will be developed. 
I believe that the greatest investment we can make in Canada is 
in our young people.  The government has listened and is 
responding to the needs and concerns of young Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Speech from the Throne the government has indicated that 
the most important commitment is to keep Canada together.  It is 
our duty.  It is our responsibility.  The overriding goal is to 
strengthen and unite the country by joining in the common purpose 
of keeping Canada as one of the best places in the world in which 
to live. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a proud and rich history. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of geography, we have shaped a society that reflects 
our cultural values as a nation; tolerance, understanding, 
recognition of the vital role that two languages, generosity of 
spirit and respect for the individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those in this House who would fail to adhere to the 
words of Sir John A. Macdonald:  “Let us be English or let us be 
French but let us always remain loyal and above all, let us be 
Canadian”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Canada exists because its people can work together. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are destined for greatness because of the Canadian spirit. 
That spirit was shown on the battlefields of Ypres in 1915 and 
Vimy Ridge in 1917.  Canadians acted as one: French, English, 
people of many backgrounds united in a common goal.  The 
Canadians who risked their lives in 1942 in their raid on Dieppe 
and in June 1944 on the beaches of Normandy understood that.  My 
late father was wounded on those beaches in Normandy.  He 
believed, as did those of his generation, that Canada was worth 
protecting and that Canada and our way of life was worth saving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The forces of disunity are the forces of despair, the forces of 
gloom.  Men like Sir George Etienne Cartier believed that French 
speaking Canadians would survive as a people within the larger 
nation.  His belief has proven to be well founded.  The French 
language and culture is protected by the Constitution, the 
charter of rights and freedoms.  The use of two official 
languages, the thriving of the French language not only in Quebec 
but the unparalleled demand for the language in our schools 
across the country is a testimony to Cartier and his vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe sincerely that Prime Minister Laurier was correct that 
the 20th century does belong to Canada.  Our leadership on the 
elimination of land mines is another example of how Canada is 
recognized around the world for its compassion and concern for 
others.  Canada is my home.  It is my passion.  I believe the 
issue of unity can only be addressed by people of goodwill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there are issues of alienation that must and will be 
addressed by people who are unified in the belief that this 
country is worth preserving.  I am reminded of the words of 
Macdonald on the fate of our nation when he stated “whatever you 
do adhere to the union.  We are a great country and shall become 
one of the greatest in the universe if we preserve it.  We shall 
sink into insignificance and adversity if we suffer it to be 
broken”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come to reawaken Canadians to our history, to 
remind them of our roots and to acknowledge the contribution of 
men and women across this country, men like Sir John A. Macdonald 
and Sir Wilfrid Laurier.  I believe the time has come to proclaim 
our faith in their work and to declare two national holidays in 
their honour to recognize their contributions to Canada and to 
the building of our nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the government for having the wisdom to invest in 
knowledge and creativity.  We live in a changing technological 
world.  To quote from the Speech from the Throne, “With the 
nation's finances in good shape, we will soon be positioned to 
make choices and investments that support innovation and risk 
taking in Canada, and to attract more foreign investment in 
knowledge based industries”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has targeted growth strategies that focus on 
knowledge intensive sectors where we are stronger and have good 
prospects for new growth and global leadership, areas such as 
biopharmaceuticals, the environment and information and 
telecommunications.  SchoolNet is another good example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased the government has focused its efforts in these 
areas.  I believe that together we can achieve the greatness that 
Laurier and Macdonald spoke of 100 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Long live a united and strong Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, my distinguished colleague from Oak Ridges, who describes 
himself as a teacher, has had much to say about youth, Canadian 
youth in particular.  I would like to ask him a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As he is well aware, barely 4 percent of our electorate trusts 
politicians and many of that number are members of our own 
immediate families or friends of ours. However, our young people's 
trust in politicians is pretty close to 0 percent. In order to give 
Canadian young people more faith in parliaments and in elected 
representatives particularly, would the hon. member not agree to 
try to convince his colleagues in the Liberal party to propose a 
bill similar to the one in Quebec? 
This legislation would allow only voters to contribute to political 
parties, so big business would no longer be telling them what to 
do.  Fundraisers would not be allowed to twist the arms of company 
CEOs in order to get $10,000, $20,000 or $100,000 in exchange for 
certain recompenses from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see several Liberal members of this House who are 
nodding to indicate that they would be in agreement with such a 
bill.  However, I would like to hear it from this hon. member's 
lips.  Would he be agreeable to the Liberals and the Bloc Quebecois 
joining forces to look at what is being done in Quebec in order to 
improve finances at the present time, not just government finances, 
but also those of the political parties? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see things like what we saw on last night's news—this 
morning, when I called my riding office, they reported a number of 
constituents' calls still coming in, along the lines of “Is that 
what is happening in our fine riding of Frontenac—Mégantic, as it 
is in Drummond and Trois-Rivières, where Liberal fundraisers are 
forcing company CEOs to pay up $10,000 or $20,000 if they want any 
recognition?” This is scandalous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the hon. member for Bourassa will want to rise in his 
place and— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> I have a point of order, Madam Speaker. I 
object to a member making false allegations leading to unfounded 
accusations.  I ask that the member withdraw his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It is in all the newspapers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> He said the Liberal Party was putting pressure 
on certain company CEOs in several ridings.  It is unacceptable and I 
ask that he withdraw that statement.

to do so. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Madam Speaker, I want to thank the 
member for his question.  Although I did not raise that issue, I 
certainly agree with him that we want to restore confidence in 
our youth.  I believe this government is certainly doing that 
with some of the programs that I outlined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member raised a concern about campaign financing.  We 
do have spending limits.  We do have a process of disclosure.  If 
there are suggestions that the member wants to put forward, I am 
all ears.  I think the process we have in place is a good one. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am honoured and delighted 
to rise today on behalf of my constituents and reply to the 
Speech from the Throne for this 36th Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is truly an honour to be sent by the people to this House to 
represent their concerns and aspirations.  I therefore seize this 
opportunity of my first debate in this Parliament to once more 
thank the people of Winnipeg North—St. Paul for their trust and 
confidence in me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank those from the former riding of Winnipeg North who now 
constitute nearly half of my adjusted riding of Winnipeg 
North—St. Paul.  I thank them for the continued confidence which 
they first entrusted in me in 1988, renewed in 1993 and again 
last June 2.  I also thank those who are my constituents for the 
first time.  I assure them that I will continue to discharge my 
duties and responsibilities as their member of Parliament with 
the same dutiful and careful attention I have served the people 
in the past.  I shall consult with them and will continue to use 
my best judgment at all times taking the collective interests of 
our constituency and our country as my guidepost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I share with my colleagues in this House and with my 
constituents that I feel a special sense of honour and privilege 
as I debate today knowing that this new Parliament will be the 
last Parliament for the departing 20th century and the first 
Parliament of the 21st century as the throne speech so aptly 
noted. I am sure we collectively share this special moment in 
Canadian history just as we collectively share a special sense of 
duty to serve our country, the country of birth for most of us 
but the adopted country for some of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nearly 30 years ago I became an adopted son of this country 
believing I was to begin a new life for my family and myself.  As 
soon as I landed on its soil I felt at once a sense of security. 
I knew this would be a country where I could build a home, a 
career and most importantly yes, a future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the future that became the driving force in building my 
family.  Had I not believed that there was something good in this 
country to build upon, there would have been no inspiration there 
to pioneer the way for our children in order that they would have 
as equal if not a greater opportunity for success as their father 
has had.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now look at my family, my four sons:  Reis, Advin, Sherwin and 
Christopher.  I ask myself, have I done what I set out to do in 
being the best leading example of fatherhood to my family.  My 
wife Gloria would ask too, has she done what she set out to do in 
being the best leading example of motherhood to our sons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like any parent, father or mother, perhaps there is a need for 
insurance that the future for our children will continue to 
advance.  On this earth there is no insurance of longevity, only 
the belief, the faith that what we have contributed in our 
lifetime can be an assurance of a future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence we are only caretakers of this world.  This is the 
directive of our humanity to which we are all instinctively 
called.  And so it was with our First Nations people who began 
building Canada's first communities thousands of years ago. And 
so it was with the pioneers of Canada today who brought this 
nation together just over 100 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must have been something great in creating a country of 
such immense promise. They could never know that future but they 
could ensure that it would happen by putting in place those 
building blocks upon which its future could be founded. They 
built our Confederation, the physical structure of our nation and 
the social infrastructure for our citizens, pensions and medicare 
just to mention a couple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put forth to hon. members this challenge, that we face up to 
the responsibility of ensuring our nation's continued future into 
the next millennium.  This country has spent over a century 
discussing nation building. It is now up to us to project that 
history into this new millennium by securing and sustaining that 
nation Canada which has been built. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must as members of Parliament in partnership with the 
government be prepared now to answer to the future needs of our 
children or else in this 36th session of Parliament we will have 
failed in contributing to this period of Canadian history 
entrusted to us. This is why our government strongly believes in 
seeing our youth educated and therefore empowered to be creative 
and innovative in facing the social, economic and political 
challenges of our fast growing world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize the need for an education that is responsive to 
these challenges by committing an endowment fund for scholarship. 
I am indeed delighted that the prime minister announced in his 
reply to the throne speech the millennium scholarship endowment 
fund. What will it do for young Canadians? The fund will help in 
at least two key priority areas, investing in the knowledge and 
creativity of Canadians and giving young Canadians a chance to 
thrive in the new economy by ensuring that post-secondary 
education is accessible and affordable to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I said I am delighted to rise and speak.  I am delighted 
because this government has restored our nation's finances to 
order.  The deficit has been reduced significantly and in a year 
or two we will have a balanced budget. The inflation rate is low. 
The interest rate is low.  The unemployment rate is going down. 
But the work must continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also delighted because we have a government that believes 
that each Canadian child existing now and hereafter is guaranteed 
a future beyond the year 2000. It is a call for our government to 
be accountable to each member of its citizenship who is entitled 
to the fullest exercise of Canadian rights and privileges, and we 
have responded with the introduction of the national child tax 
benefits program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why above all when this government speaks of Canada's 
future, it will deliver its message with one united voice for all 
Canadians, that in the true spirit of Canadianism what we ensure 
for one we must be prepared to ensure for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we continue this 36th session of Parliament our job is to 
secure the future of this great nation.  At times it may seem a 
daunting task. 
Yet, we must ask, can we afford to doubt ourselves when the 
future of our country is in our hands?

Parliament representing the constituents of Winnipeg North and 
that in my third election as the member of Parliament for 
Winnipeg North—St. Paul, I would reclaim my seat; and had I been 
told that amidst the devastation of my province plagued with the 
natural disaster of floods, its citizens would rise to the task 
of meeting the needs of our communities, I could never have 
doubted that the challenge would have to be met, not just out of 
necessity but because the vision of our nation's future was at 
stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I ask, are we prepared to take this country into the 
next millennium?  If so, what is the government ready to do about 
it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to be part of this government which has restored an 
infrastructure of hope and confidence for Canadians since it took 
office in 1993, because it understands the changing world.  I am 
proud as well to be part of the government that has now set an 
agenda for the Canadian people that truly will bring us to the 
new millennium.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate the member on his eloquent 
speech in reply to the Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the member's comments he indicated that he felt the 
government had restored health to the nation's finances.  I 
wonder if the member could comment on what his definition of 
economic and fiscal health is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does it include 9 percent stagnant unemployment, shrinking family 
incomes, 17 percent youth unemployment, 100 billion additional dollars 
in the national debt, the highest personal income tax rates in 
the industrialized world, a $600 billion Canada pension plan 
unfunded liability that future Canadians will have to pay for? 
Is this his idea of giving hope to young Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am always entertained to hear members opposite talk with such 
great passion about the future and youth. This is a caucus that 
does not have a single member under the age of 30 talking 
condescendingly about hope for future generations, which it has 
forever indebted and made poorer because of the choices of the 
government to add $100 billion to the public debt and the 
previous government, of which this Prime Minister was an integral 
member, created the debt to begin with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this minister think that debt and that kind of serious 
economic problem creates hope for young Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth:</B>   No vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>   Madam Speaker, I am delighted to 
respond. In 1993 the whole nation knew that the deficit was $42 
billion. In another two years the budget will be balanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  If the hon. member would allow me 
to reply and not ask questions to his questions, perhaps he may 
share in the real facts and figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>   He did not ask about the deficit.  Answer 
his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>   Madam Speaker, if the member would 
be courteous and respectful of the House— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>   You be courteous enough to answer the 
question then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have not yet 
finished answering the question.  The member is prejudging my 
answer. How could the member say that I am not answering the 
question when he does not give me the opportunity to answer the 
question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the deficit has been reduced from $42 billion to nearly 
zero and the budget will be balanced in two years, that is a sign 
of fiscal health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that there is still a debt. We do not deny that. 
That is why we continue to work to increase the economy of the 
country so that we will have the revenues and eventually we will 
be able to repay the debt. The government has stated that when we 
have the fiscal dividend we will spend half of it for the 
repayment of debt and reduction of taxes.  However, in contrast 
to the Reform Party we will spend half of our fiscal dividend for 
social and economic programs for the country, for medicare, 
education and for research and development. 
The Reform Party does not care about the essence of politics.  It 
does not care about the essence of government.  Government is for 
the people.  It is not only for the reduction of debt.  A 
reduction of debt is not the ultimate essence of our obligation. 
We will reduce the debt. We will reduce the deficit because we 
would like to serve the people.  Meanwhile we need a balanced 
approach.  The Canadian people gave us that mandate and so I am 
pleased to be part of the government.

listened with interest to my hon. friend.  He spoke with a great 
deal of eloquence about how well the government has done in his 
view. I suspect, knowing his constituency well, that he deals 
with a great number of immigration problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Years ago one of the dark sides of Canadian history was the head 
tax on Asians.  We have rejected that as one of the darkest 
moments in our history as a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His government recently imposed a major head tax on all new 
Canadians.  He will know that this poses an incredible burden, in 
particular on poor families coming from developing countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be curious to know what my hon. friend says to new 
Canadians who are applying to have relatives, friends and 
extended families come to Canada and have to pay these exorbitant 
head taxes now as a result of the taxes imposed by his government 
on new Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  Madam Speaker, when the issue was 
emerging a couple of years ago I consulted with my constituents. 
Every new Canadian that I spoke to understood that we are in a 
tight financial situation.  They understood that they would have 
to pay the $975 landing fee, but what they did not understand, 
and for which I fought with them, is that the fee must be paid at 
the time of landing and not before.  On that we succeeded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might inform the hon. member from the NDP that even the NDP 
member of the Manitoba Legislative Assembly signed the petition 
accepting the landing fee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I need to 
challenge the hon. member.  Of course we ask questions about the 
diversion of the taxpayers' dollars to paying interest which 
really is what happens when we have a $600 billion debt. 
One-third of every dollar that taxpayers send to Ottawa is simply 
transferred to financial organizations that have lent the 
government money.  That is money that is not available for 
government programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can this member claim success for the government's fiscal 
policies when what it is doing is arranging to spend one-third of 
the taxpayers' dollars on things that have nothing to do at all 
with delivering government programs to needy people in this 
country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  Madam Speaker, perhaps the best way 
to answer the question would be with another question so that the 
members could get the meaning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let assume for a moment that we spend all the revenues of Canada 
to pay our debt. What would happen to the people of Canada?  What 
would happen to the people who get sick?  What would happen to 
the children who are hungry?  What would happen to the children 
who would like to get an education? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have placed our priorities.  I consulted at the doorsteps 
during the last election.  I presented the program of the Reform, 
the program of the NDP.  Canadians shared their confidence with 
us because they believe a balanced approach is the way to govern 
the country.

the beginning of the 36th Parliament, I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank the people of Drummond for once again 
demonstrating their faith in me.  They can count on my 
co-operation and be assured that I will defend the interests of 
this riding with a booming economy, which is also referred to as 
the heart of Quebec. As I did at the beginning of the 35th 
Parliament, I want to offer my constituents my full co-operation 
and promise them that I will do my utmost to promote their 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I will continue to act as health critic, my comments today 
will pertain mainly to the throne speech sections that touched on health 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But first, I must condemn this Speech from the Throne for promoting 
nothing less than a Pierre Elliott Trudeau style of federalism with all 
its consequences.  This overbearing and centralizing federalism 
adamantly refuses to recognize the equality of the two founding peoples, 
thus thwarting the legitimate ambitions of the Quebec people.  This type 
of federalism wants Quebeckers to choose between being unique like the 
Pacific salmon or facing the threats of plan B if they want to assert 
themselves. Never before has a Speech from the Throne so openly 
threatened Quebeckers' right to decide their own future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the face of this spurious choice of a renewed federalism 
provided everyone fits the same mold, we say that our aspirations are 
legitimate, that they are imbued with the spirit of democracy and that 
we are marching down that road to freedom and to our future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the issue of health care and the government's plans 
as stated in the throne speech, I would like to talk about the way the 
cuts were distributed. The Liberals go around preening and busting their 
britches over their balancing the budget by next year. However they are 
not saying how they got to that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not mention that for the most part cuts have been made at 
the expense of the poorest of the poor. Nor do they boast about the fact 
that they cut $4.5 billion in transfer payments to the provinces, 
including $1.3 billion to Quebec alone. Also, they neglect to mention 
that the government has grabbed the surpluses in the unemployment 
insurance fund, to which it stopped contributing several years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not a word either about the federal departments' expenditures, 
which were supposed to be cut by 19 percent but were reduced by 
only 9 percent, or less than half the Liberals' rather modest 
goal. Moreover they hide the fact that 54 percent of the cuts 
made were to social programs, health care and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we in the Bloc Quebecois are going to tell it all. We are not 
going to let the Prime Minister and his finance minister get credit for 
the sacrifices made by others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is typical of Liberal smoke and mirrors. Governments in Quebec 
and the other provinces are made to look like heavies, because they have 
been forced to make cuts and not Ottawa, which in turn steps in as a 
saviour using the money it took from workers and the neediest and 
reinvesting mere crumbs in areas which are not even under its 
jurisdiction, namely social programs, education and once again health 
care. I say “once again” because this is not the first time the Liberals 
have tried to intrude on health care.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They date back to the first red book, which called for the 
creation of a national forum on health, raising objections from all 
of the provinces because they had no representation on it. No 
provincial minister was allowed to take part.  And anyway, a number 
of them had already carried out a similar exercise.  Here, once 
again, they were having standards and views dictated to them, while 
the provinces were the ones that knew what they needed in the area 
of health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Forum cost $12 million at the very least.  They are 
shoving the unemployed onto welfare because of the cuts, but paying 
$12 million for a national forum which leaves no room for the 
provinces. They tabled a condescending report which was a total 
endorsement of federal interference in the health field. This 
report went beyond the Prime Minister's expectations, and here he 
is ready to spread his tentacles further out into this area of 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They found new ways to interfere.  Take tax credits for 
home-based care, for example. Not only are they interfering but 
they are adding to what has already been put into place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In red book II, the Liberals promised to create a new credit 
for home-based care.  In the Speech from the Throne, they say they 
want to follow up on this promise of interference. 
Having seen the Liberals make cuts in transfer payments for social 
programs that could reach a total of $42 billion between 1995 and 
2003, what are we to think when we see them announcing a new annual 
program worth some one hundred million dollars?  This is nothing 
more and nothing less than hypocrisy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than including that amount in the transfer payments to 
the provinces, the federal government is using its powers of 
taxation to interfere in the delivery of home care, an area that 
comes under provincial jurisdiction.  The federal government wants 
to see its maple leaf logo on the cheques, rather than leaving the 
provinces alone to manage their own areas of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what about another attempt at interference, the 
integration of a federal drug plan? 
According to the throne speech, the federal government will 
establish a national plan, with national standards, a timetable and 
a fiscal framework to set up its new discovery in the area of 
meddling and duplication: drug insurance.  This meddling and 
duplication is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is out of the question for the federal government to come 
along and impose its own standards, when the whole thing is already 
set up.  The Liberals must promise to provide a system whereby 
those provinces not interested in participating or already having 
such a program, like Quebec, can withdraw from the program, with 
full compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the Canadian information system.  The Canadian 
health information system is another example of the federal 
government's centralizing tendencies. 
Here come the Liberals again with the announcement they made in the 
latest budget on the Canadian health information system, a fund 
worth $50 million over three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, you are telling me I have only a minute left, 
but I still have a lot to say.  However, I will move to my 
conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we in the Bloc Quebecois object to is that this is the 
Liberal government's tactic of smoke and mirrors, of doing anything 
to save face.  We in the Bloc, however, have news for the Prime 
Minister.  People are no longer being taken in by this sort of 
antic. 
Quebecers are increasingly aware of what goes on here and can count 
on the 44 members of the Bloc Quebecois, who will be here every 
day, in every debate, to reveal the pretence and go beyond 
appearances, to show people what really goes on here, even though 
that may not be to the liking of the other side of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with great interest to the member from the Bloc 
Quebecois and there are a few things I would like to point out. 
We have to accept in this House the comments from the opposition 
party on how it feels about our programs and our achievements. 
However, I believe the best judge of that is the people of 
Canada. They reflected this in the last election by not only 
renewing our mandate but by sending the message to the Bloc 
Quebecois, because its numbers went from 54 to 44. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about the national forum on health. 
Consultation was done well before the election and when its 
recommendation came back one of its highlights was to restore 
funding to a base of $12.5 billion.  Without hesitation the prime 
minister and the government took the initiative to restore the 
funding and accepted the recommendation of the committee.  At the 
same time they went beyond and added $50 million over the next 
three years, which the member also pointed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to comment on the point the member made about the 
aspirations and the path to freedom.  I am puzzled about the use 
of the word freedom.  I feel I and the rest of Canada are being 
told we are hostages held in a ball and chain.  As a Canadian, 
whether I live Quebec, Ontario or British Columbia, I like to 
believe I have freedom.  I have the freedom to vote, I have the 
freedom to select, I have the freedom to travel, I have the 
freedom to choose.  Maybe in Quebec I am restricted as to the 
schools I can send my children, but that is for the Quebec people 
to decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what the member means by the path of freedom. As 
Canadians we are all free citizens. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
respond to the last comment made by the hon. member. I should remind him 
that what we have been saying for the past 30 and perhaps even 300 years 
is that we are one of the two founding peoples of this country and that 
we want to be recognized as such. That is what we call freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to comment on some of my hon. colleague's remarks 
regarding the National Forum on Health. This forum was established 
following the last throne speech. 
The government was committed to travelling across Canada to find out 
what works and what does not work in each province's health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was to be done in co-operation with provincial ministers and 
representatives. The ministers and their representatives said no, as 
they considered this to be outright interference in an area of 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Constitution—which you like to bring up when it suits 
your purpose—the federal government is only required to transfer tax 
revenues. These amounts are to be distributed among the provinces on the 
basis of population, and the federal government is required to transfer 
some of the money to help the provinces carry out their responsibilities 
in the area of health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need I remind the House that health care management is the 
responsibility of each province. Health is an exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction. I hope that is clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the Canada social transfer, we read on page 58 of red book 
II: “A new Liberal government will raise the CHST cash floor to $12.5 
billion beginning in 1998-99”. The $6 billion increase in health 
spending announced by the Liberals is a sham. This is not new money; it 
comes from the cancellation of cuts the Liberals had planned to make. 
This money is spread over five years. It is definitely not extra money 
the federal government will be transferring to the provinces every year. 
So, don't tell us—

hon. member. Resuming debate with the hon. member for Louis-Hébert. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is with a 
great deal of respect that I take part in the debate on the throne 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I wish to congratulate you on your appointment as assistant 
deputy chairman of committees of the whole House, and I also want to 
take a few moments to thank the voters of Louis-Hébert for putting their 
trust in me, and also the numerous volunteers without whose support I 
would not be here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody agrees that research and development is a key component 
for any society wishing to be fully prepared for the 21st century. 
Economic prosperity is increasingly the result of research and 
technological development, rather than the development of natural 
resources. The government opposite may be full of good intentions in its 
speeches, but we are still waiting for concrete action. 
For instance, the throne speech is extremely vague on the government's 
approach regarding this strategic sector. The government only included 
a few paragraphs to affirm its supposedly crucial role in that area. It 
is so ironic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Science and technology are at the core of a modern country's 
prosperity. The government claims to recognize the primary role of 
science and technology in preserving the public's health and well-being. 
It claims to recognize it has a contribution to make to job creation and 
economic growth. In their red book, before the 1993 election, the 
Liberals promised to double funding for research and development. 
However, as always, these commitments turned into cuts of 50 percent to 
research budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this government truly cared about research and development, it 
would at least restore research funding to its pre-1993 level, and as 
quickly as possible. 
Even then, Canada would still be trailing far behind other OECD 
countries. This is how serious this Liberal government is, in its throne 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Mr. Tavanas, the Rector of Université Laval in Quebec City, 
recently pointed out, “because of the globalization of knowledge-based 
economies, particularly in the developed world, knowledge is finally 
recognized for what it is, namely a collective wealth, a tool for 
economic and social progress, and a competitive asset for nations. The 
role of universities is particularly important in Quebec, where research 
and industrial development still lag behind what is being done in other 
developed countries with which, unfortunately, we must compete”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last February, in full pre-election mode, the Liberals, with their 
sense of the dramatic, announced with much fanfare the creation of the 
Canadian Foundation for Innovation.  One election and a few months 
later, the Bloc Quebecois is still waiting for more information on this 
tool to modernize research infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Questions come to mind.  Will there be funding with which to pay 
researchers?  This is vital to ensure the quality of research and stop 
the brain drain.  The question remains unanswered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole scientific community is impatient to see this much 
heralded foundation become reality.  It is not known when it will 
actually be up and running. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has already identified a number of weak points. 
The new foundation's mandate excludes social sciences, a key sector that 
is seen as secondary to research. 
The preferred emphasis was on “hard sciences”, leaving universities like 
the Université du Québec à Montréal, which does not have a medical or 
engineering faculty, out of luck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the $800 million investment, an annual contribution of $180 
million announced by the Minister of Finance in the February 1997 
budget, it is clear that it will not offset the deep cuts made by the 
Liberals in recent years in R&D. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has not forgotten that the federal research 
councils sustained cuts of close to $100 million, or 10 to 14 
percent of their budget, and that funding for health and 
post-secondary education was slashed by $3.3 billion, with a 
direct negative impact on research in these two sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These blithe cuts in transfers to the provinces, as well as 
departmental budgets, the latter having lost half a billion for R&D, 
have been detrimental to the activities of all the country's research 
laboratories, centres and agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this throne speech, the government is trying to look generous, 
but it is in fact interfering in three areas of provincial jurisdiction: 
health, universities and social programs.  This is a sure way to 
irritate provincial governments, which in turn are forced to make 
corresponding cuts in these same areas, in response to dramatic cuts in 
federal transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who are in any doubt, from 1994 to 1997 federal cash 
transfers for health, welfare and post-secondary education dropped from 
$19.3 billion to $14.9 billion.  They will drop by another $2.4 billion 
this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The selection of R&D projects will be the responsibility of the 
Canadian Foundation for Innovation, which may, if necessary, resort to 
peer evaluation. 
Universities have already expressed their views on the matter by 
demanding this particular selection process, peer evaluation, without 
receiving any guarantees in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, for new programs, the foundation will require partners 
to contribute 50 percent or 60 percent of total funding. It is 
hard to imagine how universities and hospitals, already faced 
with considerable budget constraints resulting from cuts in 
transfers to the provinces, will manage to meet this major 
challenge. We do not know how this foundation will distribute the 
available funds among the provinces. Can we hope that Quebec's 
share will be proportionate to its population? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering what is at stake here, namely our ability to 
participate fully in the economy of the next millennium, the 
shortsighted vision favoured by the Liberal government is cause for 
concern. 
Yet there is a sense of urgency because of the fierce competition that 
exists at the international level in the area of research and 
development. Therefore, I call upon the government to stop talking and 
start acting before it is too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should advise the government that, as my party's critic for 
science, research and development, I will monitor the 
establishment of this foundation and the funds that will be 
invested in these areas. I will act as a watchdog for that 
community, which has contributed more than its share to the 
government's struggle to put its fiscal house in order. I will be 
all the more vigilant since my own riding of Louis-Hébert 
includes universities, CEGEPs, research hospitals and a thriving 
high tech sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this activity, of which I am very proud, will pave the way 
for the new economy in our region and in the national capital of a sovereign 
Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate the hon. member on what I believe is 
her first speech in the House and I welcome her.  I am 
particularly pleased when we have members opposite who are 
interested in the science and technology files.  I welcome a lot 
of the remarks which she made today and I would like to ask her 
one question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent a large university in my riding.  Research and 
development, the development of new technologies and the building 
of research infrastructure which will be a part of the product of 
this new foundation is of great interest to me.  We are 
constantly seeking out new partnerships and new forms of 
investment in order to build the kind of research strength which 
we would all like to see.  As the member has recognized, it 
creates jobs and a secure future for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However in discussions with some of the larger firms, the 
political instability in Canada particularly in the province of 
Quebec is a significant disincentive to investment. 
I just wonder how as a new member in this House with experience 
and an interest in this very important area she answers that. 
Would we not be better off if we resolved the unity question, if 
we put that aside and got on with the work of investing in this 
country together and building a future for all of us?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie:</B> Madam Speaker, fortunately, my hon. colleague's 
concerns are not shared by investors around the world. We are 
experiencing healthy growth in investment, and hence in the number of 
potential partners in research and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may refer to the terms recently used by the metropolitan 
Quebec chamber of commerce, concerning an investigation on the job 
losses in the public service resulting from early retirement policies, 
it said that the research and development sector was so vibrant in the 
Quebec City area that those jobs losses were gradually being offset by 
new jobs in research and development. 
This is what we call the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time, everything is fine and investors from around the 
world—I will not go through the list of the most recent investments, 
although I could if you were to ask me to—are much more concerned with 
the quality of researchers and the development sector than they are with 
any other problem. For the time being, they are very positive about 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I would like to say that each dollar invested in 
research and development creates jobs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, first of all, 
I would like to congratulate the new member for Louis-Hébert on her 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for her. I have often visited the great city of 
Montreal, and I remember Montreal used to be the most important city in 
Canada, and it was booming. In the last 20 years, Montreal has 
experienced high unemployment and a great deal of poverty. Over that 
period a Parti Quebecois government has been in office in Quebec City 
for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that, with a Parti Quebecois government, in Montreal 
there is high unemployment, poverty is on the rise and prosperity is a 
thing of the past? Does the hon. member have an explanation for this? 
This is really sad, because Montreal used to be the most important city 
in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, my answer will 
be very brief indeed. If it were not for all these cuts to transfer 
payments, maybe poverty would not be so acute in the Montreal area. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate you again on your apppointment. I will be sharing my time 
with the hon. member for Scarborough-Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must confess that it is with some pride that I rise today in this 
House as the new Liberal member for Bourassa. You undoubtedly know that 
I lost three previous elections before winning on June 2. All those 
years of relentless efforts have earned me the nickname of Mr. Tenacity. 
My colleagues opposite will surely have the opportunity to find out why 
real soon, if they have not done so already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since June 2, the voters in Bourassa have, for the first time in 
four years, a real member of Parliament, a true federalist voice in the 
House of Commons, a good representative who will fight to protect their 
interests and express their viewpoints in Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, my first words in this House will be for the voters of 
Bourassa. I want to thank them from the bottom of my heart for letting 
me live my dream, which is to represent them in the Parliament of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The taxpayers of the wonderful riding of Bourassa, in Quebec, have 
elected me to take part in the building of a strong Canada for the year 
2000, a strong Canada for our children, a strong and united Canada 
proudly looking to the future. That is what I will be trying to achieve 
in the next four or five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me assure you that the mandate the people of Bourassa have 
given me is something near and dear to my heart and that I take it very 
seriously, because I am very much aware of my responsibilities and the 
trust these people have put in me.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in that spirit that I intend to contribute, in my limited 
capacity, to the reflection on the trust which must exist between the 
citizens and their elected representatives in a healthy democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I asked for the floor in this venerable House today, it is to 
talk about the priorities of our government.  By the way, some of my 
colleagues on the other side of the House would do well to listen.  They 
could learn how to go about taking this country beyond the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. members across the floor have frequently accused us of not 
going to the people with a book full of promises and undertakings to 
cure all the ills of Canada. 
Had we done so, nobody would have believed us and we would not have been 
re-elected with a majority, as we were on June 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had we said that the federal government could solve all the 
problems, we would have been lying through our teeth.  We chose to 
concentrate on a few clear, essential priorities we can deal with 
vigorously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You probably recall the sorry state of the country's finances a 
mere four years ago.  Need I remind you that within a single mandate, 
the Minister of Finance, the Hon. Paul Martin, did a tremendous job of 
turning things around?  So much so that we will reach a balanced budget, 
a zero deficit, earlier than forecasted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now possible to think about reinvesting in social programs. 
As a matter of fact, the government will increase its financial 
assistance to provinces beyond the budgeted level. We will 
introduce a bill that will bring up to $12.5 billion the guaranteed 
annual cash payments to provinces and territories within the 
framework of the Canada health and social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is certainly good news for all Canadians. Interest rates 
are the lowest in 30 years, inflation is under control, the dollar 
is stable and investment is constantly increasing. Even consumers 
are starting to believe again in the strength of our economy, and 
this is a very good sign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The good news as we are pulling out a difficult period of 
downsizing is that while putting our house in order to reduce our 
costs, we have also changed our methods and approaches in order to 
get better results. 
The reforms that we have initiated and that we are pursuing will 
allow us not only to save money, but also to get our money's worth, 
to pay for services that Canadians really need, in a flexible and 
efficient manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, we made all the changes needed to develop a less 
costly model, but also a more modern and efficient model. Now that 
the health of our public finances is progressively improving, we 
have to put forward an action plan for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government's action plan is based on our highest 
priority, employment, that is to make sure that this good health is 
also reflected in the quality of life of all our citizens. This is 
why we intend to intensify our efforts in the development of job 
opportunities, for young Canadians especially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our young people are enterprising, well educated and ready to take 
over from us and contribute to the development of Canada. We must ensure 
that conditions are such that they can find their place in the sun. It 
was to that end that, last week, the Prime Minister announced in this 
House the establishment of the millennium scholarship fund to provide 
financial assistance to young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the years to come, our government will be spending $800 million 
to stimulate youth employment. That is positive, concrete action, not 
empty promises. With the economic indicators forecasting continued 
recovery in consumer spending, the basic conditions for the private 
sector to increase its hiring level are in place. But to get a job when 
jobs are increasingly specialized, one must first get appropriate 
training. Our government plans to focus its energies on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are confident that we can work toward ensuring that as many 
Canadians as possible have the necessary skills to get the jobs opening 
up in high tech areas. The changes to employment insurance were designed 
with that in mind. It is also with that in mind and to demonstrate 
flexibility that we signed with the Government of Quebec an agreement 
ensuring that the management of training assistance is brought closer to 
the people concerned. This is proof that the federal system does work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the changes we are thinking about making to the financial 
support to families are along the same lines. We intend to increase the 
federal government's contribution to the child tax credit by at least 
$850 million over the course of this mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude by summing up our priorities for the next four 
years. 
We are committed to building a prosperous country, through careful and 
responsible policies aimed at reducing underemployment and child 
poverty, and a healthy country that will remain healthy thanks to better 
organized health care services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To these two main priorities I must add a third one, without which 
implementation of the other would be impossible.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our third priority, therefore, is to promote national unity and it 
is also why we have picked the right way to go about it:  deliver good, 
flexible, honest and effective government to all Canadians, government 
that stays the course during hard times, government that manages the 
public purse wisely and works to eliminate the deficit and the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that our government will approach the whole issue of 
national unity in a spirit of co-operation and partnership with the 
provinces.  We will do everything it takes to make Canada a strong and 
united country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Bourassa, like all Quebeckers and all Canadians, want 
a federal system that works better and that meets their needs. 
During this term of office, I will personally and with pride promote 
Quebec's interests within the Liberal Party of Canada and campaign 
tirelessly for the French fact in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, and more particularly, our determination to serve our 
fellow Quebeckers well can be seen in our desire to take action to help 
the greater Montreal area make the transition to the new economy. 
Behind the statistics on unemployment and poverty, there is still lots 
of good news for the area's economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout greater Montreal, there are business that are 
innovating, discovering new markets, and expanding; in a word, hiring. 
Better news yet:  these businesses are not all in high tech sectors. 
Whether it be textiles, tourism, retail sales or home care, there are 
businesses doing well and hiring people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government thinks that the best way to offset job losses in 
slower growth areas is to encourage the creation of more new jobs in 
emerging sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already invested heavily in research support and 
infrastructure renewal, and we intend to continue our role of supporting 
and jump starting the Montreal economy in the years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Change, prosperity, responsibility, flexibility and honesty; this 
is the best guarantee of a united Canada where Quebeckers like myself 
can be proud to be what they are:  full-fledged Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the new member for Bourassa, who until recently was the assistant 
director general of his party, the Liberal Party of Canada, in Quebec 
said it would be effective and desirable to forge bonds of trust between 
him and his voters, between the Liberal Party of Canada and Canadian 
voters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be extremely difficult to build up trust, given that, as 
a whole, members of this Parliament do not enjoy a great degree of 
credibility among the public. According to a poll conducted last year, 
barely 4 percent of voters have some confidence in members of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Bourassa spoke about promises, promises which, need 
I remind him, were not kept. During the 1993 election campaign, his 
government promised to abolish the GST. That promise was broken. His 
government also pledged to set up a $5-a-day child care program from 
coast to coast. Another broken promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the member believe he can promote trust when, yesterday, 
the headlines of every newspaper in the country revealed that 
fundraisers from the Liberal Party had twisted the arms of 
businesspeople throughout Quebec to collect funds for the last election 
campaign, not to the tune of $5, $10 or $50 but, rather, $10,000, 
$50,000 or $100,000. As we all know, when Bombardier, for example, or 
the CIBC gives $100,000 to the Liberal Party, it is because it will make 
five times that amount. Theirs is not an investment that will bring in 
a mere 3 percent in interest; it is a lot more profitable than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very difficult to build up trust between voters and MPs when 
some Liberal members behave in this fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, the Conservative Party experienced problems of its 
own. Today, unfortunately, it is the Liberal Party. The former director 
general of its Quebec wing certainly did not provide a good example if 
his goal is to promote trust. It is just empty rhetoric.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> This is laughable, Madam Speaker, because 
regarding credibility, if you look at the facts, I won the election by 
9,000 votes. The Bloc Quebecois lost more than 500,000 votes altogether. 
We have increased the number of our members in Quebec. We are everywhere 
or almost in the Quebec area. Federalists won a majority of votes 
compared to 38 percent for the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member wants to make allegations, if he has new facts 
to disclose—because that concerns me as much as it concerns all of us 
as members of Parliament—he should tell the RCMP, which, according to 
the news release, is conducting an investigation at the request of the 
human resources minister. They should stop reading newspapers and making 
allegations. If the hon. member has some new facts to reveal, he should 
do so outside the House so he will not be protected by parliamentary 
immunity. If he knows of anyone engaging in such practices, he should 
disclose their names. 
I have been in the Liberal Party of Canada for 15 years and I know 
everyone. But if he is in a position to name names, he should do so. I 
myself have never witnessed anything like that and I find this kind of 
thing appalling— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> Are you ready to put your seat on the line? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Madam Speaker, if the member for Frontenac has 
new facts to reveal, he should do so. We in this party have forged a 
link of trust. The hon. member for Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies won the 
election by almost 8,000 votes. I won by 9,000 votes. In the riding of 
Ahuntsic, we won by more than 10,000 votes. We chose job creation, 
investment and financial credibility instead of playing the same old 
record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have played that old record so much that, as the Cyniques, an 
old comedy group of the 70s, used to say, you can hear the other side of 
it. This is terrible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the sake of all of us in this House, I hope that if the hon. 
member knows names, because he seems to know some things, he should 
leave the House and say what he has to say during a scrum. I too would 
like to know who is collecting money. This would be helpful to all of 
us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me today to have the opportunity in 
the 36th Parliament to join in the debate on the Speech from the 
Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by thanking the residents of Scarborough Centre for once 
again entrusting me with their vote and their confidence.  It was 
a privilege and an honour for me to have represented them during 
the 35th Parliament.  That I find myself today in the 36th 
Parliament I owe it to them and I thank them.  I pledge to them 
that I will once again do my utmost to bring their concerns to 
this honourable House.  I also thank my volunteers, for had it 
not been for their support and commitment the excellent result we 
achieved would not have happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also take this opportunity to thank my staff: Costas, Effy, 
Sandra and Kathy for keeping our office in an excellent working 
mode and serving our constituents during the election period.  I 
thank my entire family, especially my two sisters, Nomike and 
Kathy, for their love and support. Also a very special thanks 
goes out to our riding president, Ernie Chaplin, for his 
dedication and continued support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last but not least I thank my children, Irene, Paul and Daniel, 
and my partner and loving wife, Mary.  I say “Thank you, Kohani, 
for your love and support.  You are my Rock of Gibraltar”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the debate began last week many members have spoken on the 
throne speech.  They brought forth many issues and many 
statistics.  They dissected, analysed and commented on the throne 
speech in a way they chose to interpret it.  I am sure every 
member in this honourable House respects each other's views 
whether we agree or disagree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the arena where we all come to debate, to state our 
position, to bring forth the concerns of our constituency and our 
region.  Because time does not permit I do not want to go into an 
in depth analysis and talk about how, when the Liberal government 
took office in 1993, the unemployment rate was at 11.5 percent and today 
as we all know it is 9 percent and dropping; how we inherited a $42 
billion deficit from a Conservative government that had never met 
its budget targets; or how we inherited a country so weakened 
from all aspects that we were being described as a third world 
economy. 
Our social safety net was also falling apart, not being able to 
address our needs today let alone the needs of the future.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within just a few short years and as a result of prudent 
initiatives, we have restored our economic sovereignty and have 
put our country on a solid footing.  We are once again a nation 
and all of us as Canadians, whether we live in Ontario, Quebec, 
British Columbia, Manitoba or wherever, can realistically see the 
light at the end of the tunnel.  These initiatives are well known 
and the results are well documented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally do not want to gloat about them.  I choose to leave 
it up to the economists, the statisticians, the pundits and, yes, 
even the international community.  Mostly I leave it up to the 
people of Canada to be the judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was canvassing during the election the households I 
visited in my riding often confronted me with various issues such 
as our pension system, our health system, our deficit, our job 
initiatives, crime issues, moral issues and issues such as the 
fiasco of topless women, which I might add I do not support and 
find unacceptable.  I hope the government will do something to 
right that wrong.  As members can see there are a variety of 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there was a common issue in each and every household, 
the issue of Canadian unity and how our country today is being 
torn apart.  I was constantly asked what was happening to our 
country and why, when we have the privilege of living in the best 
country in the world, we would want to destroy it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was told a small group of separatists wanted to break up a 
country which on more than one occasion has been recognized as 
the best country in the world to live in.  It is beyond me and 
the constituents of Scarborough Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A strong message given to me in the last election, to do 
whatever I can to make sure the country stays united.  I pledge 
to my constituents and to everybody else that I will do 
everything within my power to make sure not only us and our 
children but generations to come will inherit a country that is 
strong financially and indeed united. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It takes more than the member for Scarborough Centre and the 
constituents of Scarborough Centre.  It takes more than just 
rhetoric.  It takes goodwill and understanding from all 
Canadians.  It will take political will and not the political 
rhetoric often used to exploit the weak and the vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents—and I know I speak for a vast number of 
Canadians—have recently been greatly disturbed by the comments 
of an unelected member of the Senate, Pat Carney.  She suggested 
that separation be left on the negotiating table and that there 
was a bias shown by the federal government toward B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the senator that six Liberal members were elected 
from British Columbia and four of them are ministers of the crown 
and one is a parliamentary secretary.  That is a hell of a lot 
better than what her and her boss, Brian Mulroney, did during 
their mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not all.  Even the Reform member from South Surrey, 
B.C., in an article I read just the other day agrees with Ms. 
Carney that separation will be on the table when B.C. attempts to 
negotiate a new deal with Canada.  The article goes on to state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While she agreed that Ms. Carney's comments were irresponsible, 
she said the senator was only expressing the concerns of British 
Columbia. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a flip-flop.  This is what they call their new style of 
politics, saying one thing one day and another the next, 
tailoring the message for one region and changing it for another 
region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the Conservative Party used that tactic during the 
last election and we all know how it backfired.  Therefore I 
suggest members of the Reform Party take note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have the NDP.  One of its senior members, the member for 
Burnaby—Kingsway, is ready to tie himself to a fishing vessel 
and at the same time advocate the same type of tactics. The 
Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois are simply saying their way 
or the highway.  That is not the approach to recommend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am appalled at the tactics being used here.  Why is it that 
before we sit down to negotiate we first threaten separation? 
For example, when a family problem comes up, does the husband and 
wife first talk about separating or do they for the love of their 
family and children sit down and rationally work things out? 
They comprise if they have to because we all know there is no 
perfect solution.

special family.  This past year we had two unfortunate and tragic 
incidents in Canada, the Saguenay and the Manitoba floods.  It 
was that special Canadian family that lived in Scarborough, 
Saskatoon, Vancouver, Trois Rivieres and Charlottetown.  Together 
they came, cared, reached out and helped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall one interview in which a gentleman from the Saguenay 
region, with tears in his eyes, said how moved he was by the 
response from the rest of Canada.  He went on to say how he voted 
yes in the last referendum.  But he said that in the next 
referendum, and he hoped there would never be another referendum, 
he would vote for Canada because he now saw the light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are about, a caring and loving country.  This is 
the country that is admired worldwide.  That is what makes us all 
proud and different Canadians.

Whatever you do, adhere to the Union.  We are a great nation and

from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were some very eloquent remarks from the member from 
Scarborough Centre on Canadian patriotism and the importance of 
national unity.  I would like to strongly second some of the 
sentiments he expressed.  I and my colleagues have always 
believed that patriotism, a genuine love for one's country, is 
better expressed through actions than through mere words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the hon. member believe his government can express 
that love and passion for Canadian unity through actions of 
fundamentally reforming the federation so that we do not hear 
the kind of remarks from Senator Carney and so we no longer have 
the presence of the secessionists in this great Chamber? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this hon. member willing to look at reforming the upper 
chamber of the House so Canada will no longer be the only major 
federal government in the developed world which does not have 
proper regional representation in its halls of power? Is the hon. 
member willing to look at concrete reforms of federal 
institutions so that all Canadians feel included and can share in 
the kind of magnificent patriotism expressed by this member? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member 
opposite for an excellent question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked the other day in an S.O. 31 of an accountable senator. 
The key work was unaccountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member knows that he and I and every individual sitting in 
this House have to go to the people every four or five years. 
The people judge us based on our performance, results, programs, 
etc. I bring back that word today in response to the question, 
unaccountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator Pat Carney is unaccountable because she does not have to 
go to the people every four years.  Maybe the time has come to 
look at the other house and make those senators accountable, 
whether it be for their attendance or what they say, for the sake 
of this country. 
follows 
They should be held accountable for what they say.  They should 
have to go to the people every four or five years and present 
themselves as candidates so that when they speak in every region 
of this country they will have to answer to the people, as we 
have to answer to the people.

properly. I think, however, that he should not question our sincerity, 
as we are democratically elected members from Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out to the hon. member that the government, 
in the throne speech, far from giving up its power to spend, the 
spending power of the federal government, has just shown that it intends 
to do the opposite. My hon. colleague said that, as with married 
couples, when things are not going very well, always threatening to 
leave does not solve any problem, and that we should not always be made 
to react because a gun is being held to our head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the hon. member opposite that several 
members on this side have risen to point out to the government what the 
priorities of Quebec are in the area of occupational or manpower 
training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we have to remind this government that, in the throne 
speech, far from giving up their power to spend, they are at it 
again, overlapping and duplicating, in the section dealing with 
young people. I will read him a brief passage from a letter I 
received from the Quebec minister, Louise Harel, as a result of a 
meeting with a youth advisory committee within the Société 
québécoise de développement de la main-d'oeuvre, the SQDM:

the youth employment strategy put forward by the federal government 
goes in the opposite direction.

when I say exploitation.  The cacophony of condemnation is so 
swift from the Bloc Quebecois it is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She talked about manpower.  This is where they confuse the 
issue. I remind the member that when the Quebec government asked 
for manpower training this government was more than willing to 
give it the responsibility for manpower training.  That has been 
done.

how to refine and use the tools which we have given them, as

least 40— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Madam Speaker, you do not have a quorum 
in the House at the present time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> We do not have a quorum. 
Call in the members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the bells having rung:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Resuming debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Madam Speaker, I was trying to make 
the point about how forgotten the people of Cape Breton feel in 
the nation today and I found myself speaking to an empty 
government, empty of ideas, empty perhaps of compassion and empty 
of concern for the people I represent. I was speaking about the 
truths that I hope to convey to some of the government members on 
the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We face a crisis in Cape Breton that has been building for 40 
years.  It has been brought to the attention of politicians of 
every stripe by every member of Parliament to come from my 
island.  To give an example I will provide a quote. On October 
11, 1962 the hon. Malcolm Vic MacInnis, the member of Parliament 
for Cape Breton South, rose in this very House to deliver his 
first speech: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last winter our people experienced unemployment at the rate of 
25 percent.  We will be the first to admit we have received assistance 
from this and other governments, but the assistance has always 
been a stop-gap measure, in times of emergency to meet each crisis 
as it comes along. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Exactly 17 years later to the day, on October 11, 1979, my 
predecessor rose in this House to deliver his first speech.  He 
commented on the suffering of Cape Bretoners faced with an 
unemployment rate of 17 percent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I rise today, 17 years later almost to the day, we face an 
unemployment crisis in Cape Breton of 20 percent minimum.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To say we have been patient is an understatement.  To say that 
we are angry is a simplification.  To say that we have been 
betrayed is perhaps the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have become the third solitude in Canada.  What worries me 
and my constituents is the growing ranks in this country of that 
third solitude.  It includes many Canadians. Men and women not 
only in Cape Breton but in New Brunswick, in Newfoundland, in the 
Gaspé, in all regions of this country.  It includes our First 
Nations people, our youth and our elderly, our farmers and our 
fishers.  It includes in short all those who have lost faith in 
the generosity of our nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who control the money markets, the free traders and 
those who sing the praises of the multilateral agreement on 
investment stand today with the absent members of the Liberal 
government indicted in the court of public opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the throne speech this government congratulated itself for 
its so-called economic recovery and for maintaining our social 
programs when in fact it is the same government that has slashed 
transfers to the provinces, cut EI benefits and failed to meet 
its commitments to the east coast fishers and has failed to 
address the concerns of our veterans from the merchant marine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this land of plenty, we have hunger.  In this land that 
should echo hope, we have despair.  In a land that should be 
strong, we have weakness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third solitude is the millions of Canadians who no longer 
believe that Canada's strengths are their strengths or that 
Canada's gains are their gains.  They are the people who have not 
benefited from the so-called economic recovery.  They are not the 
people who benefit from the bond trades and the stock market 
rallies.  They do not make transactions on their laptop computers 
or their cellphones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are the people who used to make things and it is they who 
built this nation.  They worked on the assembly lines and in the 
mines and plants and on the boats and in the fields and in the 
forests. Today it is they who make up a class that was once 
middle or called working but is no longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is 17 years since my predecessor rose in this House to give 
his first address and 36 years since his predecessor's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are angry.  Cape Bretoners are angry.  In fact they are 
enraged.  I do not rail against hard times alone.  That is 
nothing new to us in Cape Breton.  What is new is the new 
meanspiritedness of this new Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We built and worked and fought for a nation that believed in 
compassion, equality and social justice.  But persistent and 
unrelenting cuts by this and past governments to our national 
social programs have threatened the very fabric of our society 
and impacted Cape Bretoners more than most. In response, 
governments shrug their shoulders and say there is nothing they 
can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government is not powerless.  This government could act today to 
improve the lives of the people I represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could take action on the environmental disaster that is the 
Sydney tar ponds. A real commitment from this government could 
not only clean up the environment, but create new jobs and real 
growth in the environmental sector while helping to establish the 
University College of Cape Breton as a centre of excellence in 
this field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government could act immediately to develop the Donkin 
mine.  This government could stop the offloading of ports and 
docks in communities like Baddeck and Iona, communities that 
depend on these services.  This government could make a real 
commitment to the east coast fishers in towns like Ingonish and 
Pleasant Bay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this government does not move in a bold and decisive way and 
take action to develop a strategy for real economic recovery in 
Cape Breton, then they will have done nothing but to continue 
their legacy of hopelessness and despair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Cape Breton will endure.  We always have.  We will 
continue to face the adversity before us.  We ask for the support 
of our government.  It is after all the reason we have a federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have always been committed members of Confederation.  We ask 
this government to show the same commitment to the people of Cape 
Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, it is my deepest hope that years, many years from 
now when my successor rises in this House for the first time, it 
will be to speak of our natural beauty and the prosperity of our 
people and not the economic and social disparity that we face 
today.  It is to that end that I will devote my energies as a 
representative.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I acknowledge that the constituents of 
Sydney—Victoria riding are a strong and resilient people. The 
member spoke about giving and sharing rather than calculating 
what we can get from society. The Bloc often uses the word demand 
specifically rather than talking about the nation as a whole and 
how we can all flourish, be together and share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the harshness of the land, we have seen some great 
accomplishments in Canada.  It is indeed generous and has been 
aware of the solitude the member spoke about.  But what does he 
propose? Does he propose more of the same while he admits that 
what he has had in the past really does not work?  Will he not 
admit that some of the problems of the past have been that the 
people of Cape Breton have sent the wrong people to Parliament 
and when they do this they get more of the same that he is asking 
for?  He mentions 36 years of anger yet the solution I hear him 
proposing is more of the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say that he is right about the Sydney tar ponds issue. 
There is a point where things can be done.  However for him to 
say that we need more of the same and indeed much more of it will 
probably not bring the kind of solutions he is looking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
the number of questions contained in his statement.  I will try 
to deal with each one. I propose a number of possible solutions 
to the problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First would be a fairer tax system in the country which is not 
necessarily the tax breaks advocated by the party the member 
represents. Lowering individual tax rates for an individual who 
is already living below the poverty line is of little assistance. 
But a fairer tax system to tax some of those who are not paying 
taxes in the country would contribute to the national good.  That 
money could then be used to invest in places like Cape Breton. 
That could be a first step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member says that things in the past have not worked and that 
I am proposing more of the same. Some past solutions have worked. 
When they are free of political interference, the ideas are good. 
In Cape Breton we have a project called New Dawn, a community 
based developmental agency that is doing remarkable things for 
seniors and housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He asked if the people of Cape Breton have often sent the wrong 
people to represent them. Sometimes we have and sometimes we have 
not.  I would point out that we have had representatives as 
distinguished as Clarence Gillis and Malcolm MacInnis and other 
very good representatives. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague was attacking the record of the government in social 
development and other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out to him that in publications from the OECD 
and other agencies such as the United Nations, on many fronts 
such as the health and medical index as well as on the human 
development front and higher education, Canada has ranked as the 
best country in the world when it comes to taking care of its 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We spend more on health care as a percentage of GDP than any of 
the other G-7 nations with the exception of the United States. 
In terms of health care, Canada's is the best in the world.  In 
terms of human index development, Canada ranked out of 100 at 
about 95.1, which is the best in the world. 
We have the highest number of people who can enrol in 
post-secondary education.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the hon. member is not suggesting that more money 
needs to be spent.  I hope he is suggesting that we have to look 
at the way we are spending those moneys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I acknowledged the good 
things in this country. As I indicated at the beginning, if the 
member had been present for my speech, Cape Bretoners were among 
the major contributors to the good things in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says that Canada is doing well.  I would only respond that 
some people in Canada are doing much better than others.  It is 
for those people who are not that we ought to have concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, I did 
not want to interrupt once again the hon. member from Cape Breton 
as it is his first speech in the House, but we do not have a 
quorum in the House at the present time to continue on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The member for Saint 
John claims that we do not have a quorum.  If the member will 
give me a moment I will count.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> There is a quorum. 
Resuming debate, the hon. member for Vancouver East. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very proud to be here in this House in the 36th Parliament as the 
new member representing the riding of Vancouver East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say as I make my inaugural speech that I feel a very 
heavy responsibility as I struggle to find the ways and means to 
bring to the attention of this House a sense of the urgency that 
comes from the communities I represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not wealthy or affluent communities.  Vancouver East is a 
highly urban community of over 100,000 people from very diverse 
and multicultural backgrounds.  It is made up of people who are 
coping with the difficulties of everyday life.  In many ways the 
experience of my first week in this House of Commons seems very 
far removed from the sometimes harsh realities of life in east 
Vancouver. Yet despite these difficulties the pride and dignity 
in Vancouver East is a model for other communities to embrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a community with a long tradition of social activism and 
social commitment.  It is home to many of Canada's First Nations 
peoples as well as home to many new Canadians who find in east 
Vancouver a balance of Canadian roots and multicultural 
diversity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we walk up and down Commercial Drive or through bustling 
historic Chinatown or along the neighbourhood streets of 
Strathcona, one of Vancouver's oldest communities, the sense of 
unique neighbourhoods and their history and character is very 
evident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At Hastings and Nanaimo we experience the urban flavour of 
thriving small businesses that serve the community.  There is the 
landmark Carnegie Centre on one corner of Main and Hastings and 
the Four Corners Community Savings opposite.  At the Kiwassa 
Neighbourhood House the breakfast program for families is a 
welcoming start to the day.  There is also the pioneering Western 
Front artist run centre in Mount Pleasant, the Italian Cultural 
Centre and the new Chinese Cultural Centre Museum. These are only 
a few of the many community facilities and programs that serve 
and define east Vancouver as a place of strength and support for 
its residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately my riding, like many other ridings and communities 
in Canada, is also living the consequences of federal Liberal 
policies of continuing high unemployment especially among youth 
and aboriginal peoples, of growing poverty, homelessness and 
inadequate housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Vancouver East is poorer because of the failure of this 
government to aggressively deal with unemployment and declining 
wages.  At the same time this federal government has slashed our 
social programs at an unprecedented level.  There is more 
homelessness in my community because the federal government has 
callously abandoned the development of social and co-op housing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the people in my riding are never heard by those in 
power.  In the downtown east side, in one of the communities in 
Vancouver East, more than 6,000 people live in what is called 
single occupant rooms, meaning that they are living in very 
substandard accommodation.  In this same community, we are 
struggling to cope with a health crisis that results from 
poverty, an epidemic of HIV transmission among injection drug 
users. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I brought this to the attention of the Minister of Health in my 
first week in this House.  The people of Vancouver East are 
waiting for a response with hope that the government will 
demonstrate that it is willing to act.  We ask:  How many more 
deaths will there be? Already over 1,200 British Columbians have 
died from drug overdoses since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Vancouver poet and activist, Bud Osbourne, spoke to the 
community about these and other tragic deaths.  He said “But 
with these thousand crosses planted in Oppenheimer Park today, 
who really see them, feel sorrow, feel loss, feel rage?  Our 
hearts shed bitter tears.  These thousand crosses are symbols of 
the social apartheid in our culture, the segregation of those who 
deserve to live and those who are abandoned to die”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week I listened very carefully to my first throne speech. 
I listened for words of concrete action to be taken, for example, 
to assist students reeling from the burden of student loan debts 
or for real targets to reduce unemployment and eliminate poverty. 
I hoped to hear about commitment to act against violence against 
women or to hear that the government is going to introduce a 
national child care program so often promised by the Liberals, or 
for any indication that the government might finally embark on a 
campaign of fair taxation to ensure that the vast wealth in this 
country is something that benefits all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there was silence from the government on these critical 
issues.  It led me to think about what meaning there is in being 
here in this place that honours tradition and ritual and holds to 
represent the people of Canada.  The meaning, I believe, is 
created by the change that is possible if we have the will to 
act.  I know that I and my fellow New Democrats bring back to 
this House a value and tradition that has almost disappeared, a 
quest for social justice and social equality and a voice for 
those who have been silenced and shut out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in an increasingly globalized corporate economy where 
the rights of multinational corporations, about to be embodied in 
the multilateral agreement on investment and furthered by APEC, 
are seen as more important than the rights of people and 
sustainable human development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as New Democrats we believe that we can bring hope and 
change not only to this House but to Canadians who believe as 
well in the progress of nations as outlined in a 1996 UN report. 
It states “The day will come when the progress of nations will 
be judged not by their military or economic strength, nor by the 
splendour of their capital cities and public buildings, but by 
the well-being of their peoples:  by their levels of health, 
nutrition and education; by their opportunities to earn a fair 
reward for their labours; by their ability to participate in the 
decisions that affect their lives; by the respect that is shown 
for their civil and political liberties; by the provision that is 
made for those who are vulnerable and disadvantaged; and by the 
protection that is afforded to the growing minds and bodies of 
their children”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Vancouver East expect and deserve no less and I am 
honoured to represent and fight for their interests in this 
House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened

I agree with her almost 100 percent.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the members opposite, she is very sensitive to the plight of 
the destitute in our society. Unlike them, she is very sensitive to the 
concerns of the unemployed. I listened earlier to one of the members on 
the other side. He keeps saying that Canada is one of the richest 
countries in the world. However, as my colleague said so well, some 
people are in dire straits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be sensitive because what is happening in Canada is that 
the rich are getting richer at the expense of the poor. We take from the 
poor to give to the rich. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for my colleague. I know that the government is 
in a very difficult situation because multinationals are always filling 
their slush fund. 
The recipient, of course, must return the favour. As we recently saw in 
the newspapers, the situation is getting out of hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will my colleague support me when I introduce a private member's 
bill to restore fiscal health? I ask my NDP colleagues for their 
support. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his comments and his question.  He has outlined the 
sensitivity of the issues that I have raised and remarked on the 
fact that the government has been insensitive and callous in its 
treatment of poor people.  I acknowledge the comments of the hon. 
member and share his view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also agree that it is very clear that the Liberal government 
has acted in concert with multinational corporations. There is no 
question that the public finances and our taxation system have 
been designed to assist those wealthy corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the major issues which we need to address in the House, 
which my fellow New Democrats and I will raise, is the issue of 
fair taxation.  We live in a very wealthy country.  The issue is 
not whether there is enough money.  The issue is how those 
funds are distributed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member's private member's bill comes forward we 
will examine it with great seriousness and sensitivity to ensure 
the common goals that we have, are supported in the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member for Vancouver East used the 
term fair taxation a number of times.  That is typically one of 
the buzzwords or the mantras of the NDP.  Perhaps it is, from 
that particular perspective, the code word for a political 
agenda. We should really know what the hon. member means when she 
says fair taxation so that it can be revealed for what it really 
is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a grand opportunity for the member to expand on the NDP 
version of what it means to have fair taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the question. 
The NDP policy on fair taxation is not a mantra or a code word, 
it is a serious issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last few decades we have seen a significant shift in 
taxation policy from corporations to individuals.  The tax burden 
is being carried by working people and by middle income people. 
There are tens of thousands of profitable businesses and 
corporations that pay not a dime in taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a code word.  It is a basic fundamental issue that 
is the business of this House.  We must ensure that we have a 
fair and equitable taxation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say, looking at the record, that the Liberal government 
has moved us further and further away from that.  I would suggest 
to the hon. member and other members of the Reform Party that it 
would be to their credit if they would also take up the issue of 
fair taxation for Canadians, instead of their code word 
“cutbacks” which are hurting the poor people in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Nepean—Carleton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this is the first opportunity I have had to speak in the 
House, I wish to begin by thanking the people of Winnipeg South 
who sent me here.  I have been elected four times now, twice in 
the provincial legislature and twice in this Chamber.  I know of 
no greater honour.  I am proud to represent the people of 
Winnipeg South.  They take their politics seriously.  They 
consider the issues in depth and I have to convince them each 
time that I will work on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment, the Speaker 
on his election and the other members who serve the House on 
their appointments.  It is going to be a fractious House.  We see 
some of that right now.  We have been very well served by the 
leadership in this Chamber. I congratulate the new members who 
have been elected to the House and those who are returning.  It 
is an interesting place.  Members who are here for the first time 
will find it a very challenging yet a very productive place if 
they approach it properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was an interesting year for those of us who live in 
Manitoba.  As my colleague mentioned, we had two very significant 
natural disasters in Canada although we had several others in 
other parts of the country.  We had the very severe flood in the 
Saguenay region and we had the very different but equally severe 
inundation of southern Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that gratified me in the first instance, 
during the Saguenay flood, was how Manitobans and westerners—I 
am a western Canadian—rallied.  Mr. Hubert Kleysen, who lives in 
my riding, has a trucking firm.  He went throughout western 
Canada organizing truckloads of furniture and supplies which were 
sent from western Canadians into the Saguenay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the House from personal experience that the reverse 
happened during the flood in Manitoba.  The number of people from 
all across Canada who phoned, who travelled to Manitoba to help 
out, who came in to volunteer was really quite overwhelming. 
Members of this Chamber phoned regularly to offer support, 
donated money, equipment and supplies.  To this day I am 
approached by people who offer to help out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a movie that was popular about eight to twelve years 
ago called <I>Starman</I> in which the alien makes the following 
comment about humans:  “You are at your best when things are 
worst”.  That was really demonstrated during the flood in 
Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It hit right at the time of the election. What was the defining 
moment for me was when the Reform candidate, Greg Yost, a friend 
of mine and a very decent man, was going door to door during an 
election distributing literature with my name in it.  He was 
referring people to the flood centre we had set up for 
assistance. The Conservative candidate was working out of my 
office, having given his office as a storage space for people who 
had to move out of their homes.  The NDP candidate was regularly 
sandbagging on teams deployed from the office.  The two 
Conservative members of the provincial legislature that bracket 
the river on the south end of my riding formed a team with myself 
and the local city councillor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was truly a non-partisan effort that shows what we can do 
regardless of our political position and philosophy when we come 
together to work on issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were Conservative and NDP members present in the House in 
the last Parliament but I want to welcome them both back to 
official party status. I personally am delighted to see both of 
them back because they will add a dimension to the debate that 
was sadly lacking in the last Parliament.  If I have a concern 
about the debate that took place in this Chamber, it is that it 
was badly divided between two opposition parties that I believe 
fundamentally support the separation of this country. I welcome 
the emergence of two other parties that have a national view and 
a sense of what Canada can become if we can get the regions 
working together.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also delighted, I confess with a particular bias, to see 
the NDP back in some number.  I do not want to see too many of 
them in the House, but enough of them to participate in the 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last House we had extremely significant social policy 
issues that crossed the floor of this House, pieces of 
legislation that were debated in this House without ever a 
question from the other side, such as the affects of changes to 
health care, unemployment and homelessness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These issues were debated fiercely on this side of the House in 
this caucus. I chaired the social policy committee and there were 
terrible fights.  But when we came into the House expecting to 
hear debate, occasionally if a New Democrat could get to his or 
her feet there might be a question come across.  But that 
happened very rarely because of their lack of numbers in the 
House.  From our friends in the Reform Party there was never a 
question, never a concern, never an expression of interest in 
what was happening with the unemployed, the homeless or the sick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was some interest in health corporations and privatizing 
the system so they could make some money out of it, but never the 
kind of question that was raised by the member from Vancouver 
East about what happens when thousands of people are sick or 
dying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am interested to see the return of the Conservative Party.  I 
will be very interested in what it will have to say given the 
base of its support.  We have one member from Manitoba who 
carries a rather onerous responsibility of representing western 
Canada for that party.  I must confess I do not have a good sense 
of exactly where they sit on some of these issues.  I will look 
forward to what will happen in the debates to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My experience in the relatively short time I have been here has 
been that this place is fascinating and can be very important and 
productive.  There is an enormous amount of work that goes on in 
committees when members put aside some of their partisanship and 
focus on how to build an excellent health care system, on how to 
build a good research and development program and how to deal 
with issues of equity when you are looking at issues of debt 
reduction.  Some profoundly important work gets done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite members for all parties to participate in that work. 
We have a very active agenda and an enormous challenge put 
forward to us by the prime minister when he starts talking about 
what is going to happen a few years out.  The finances are coming 
together but I think we have a little further to go.  We have to 
be a little cautious. We do not want to find ourselves slipping 
back into the position we were in which robbed us of any 
flexibility in this last decade or so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some opportunities.  There is an opportunity now to 
challenge ourselves with the task of building a truly profoundly 
important future for ourselves and our kids.  I appreciate the 
criticism that comes across the floor, it is important to the 
debate and I invite more of it.  I hope it will be more focused 
on substance.  I was very disappointed to see the member from 
Burnaby do what he did yesterday because I think this debases the 
debate in the House.  I do not think that contributes to a 
discussion on how we do things better for the people we 
represent. Rather, it diminishes the view of this House.  I feel 
much the same way when a Reform member stands up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my friends in the Bloc I want to offer one comment.  It 
must be very difficult for members of the Bloc right now.  I 
have some sense compassion for them.  I know a number of the 
members of the Bloc as we worked closely together on the HRD 
committee and the transport committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great respect for most of their positions.  I differ 
very strongly on the issues sovereignty and I cannot help but 
think what it must be like sitting in opposition looking across 
at a government that has been re-elected with a majority, a 
considerable accomplishment in this country. It has increased its 
representation in the province of Quebec. It has managed to 
wrestle the finances of the country into some sense of control. 
We have begun to see a significant drop in the unemployment rate. 
We are not where we want to be but we are heading in the right 
direction.

saying they feel they would be better off within a united 
Canada.  I enjoy the participation of the members of the Bloc in 
the debate and in committee.  I invite them to participate and 
perhaps we will find some ways to make Canada better so that they 
can step aside from the one policy that we find so difficult. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
find it very offensive for this member to speak on one hand about 
co-operation in this House and raising the level of debate and 
making Canada work, and then to make accusations of the Reform 
Party that we are not a party that wants the country to keep 
together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is as if he is trying to say to me, coming from 200 years of 
United Empire Loyalists stock, someone who has lived in three 
provinces of this country, who lived 32 years in this province 
before moving west, that I am not dedicated to keeping this 
country together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are a party that wants to keep this country together.  It is 
hypocritical for the member to say on the one hand that he wants 
to have a great debate and yet to raise such provocative issues 
like this when he knows that this party is a federalist party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comment 
from the member.  I also note that the member is new in this 
House.  This is his first term here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he goes back to my remarks he will realize that I was talking 
about my experiences with his party in the last session of 
Parliament.  I hope he brings to the floor of this Chamber 
exactly the kind of debate that he is talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me pose a question to him.  If that is the kind of debate he 
is interested in, why did he campaign under a slogan that said no 
more prime ministers from Quebec?  What does that do for the 
unity of this country?  What does that do to bring us together? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the slogan that member campaigned on.  So when he wants 
to talk about the unity in this country, he should go back to his 
party bosses and do a little work within his own caucus to see 
that his message supports unity in this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to congratulate the hon. Liberal member for his throne speech.  I 
am very pleased to hear him talk about non-partisan issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hoping that he, along with a lot of members of his party, 
will help me to see that the infrastructure program, which has 
been implemented by this government, will be done in a 
non-partisan way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have real problems in the province of New Brunswick with 
political interference from the premier of the province of New 
Brunswick and those little communities that were supposed to get 
part of that infrastructure program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were all cancelled by the premier.  He took all the money 
out of the Tobique—Mactaquac area and put it into the riding of 
his previous minister, who is still in this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did that also in the other part of the northern part of the 
province.  Now he has interfered in my area.  We did it in a 
non-political way.  I would like the hon. member to tell me is 
he going to help us to take the politics out of infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I really want to thank the 
member for Saint John for that question.  I will commit to her 
today that I will do everything I can to assist in ensuring that 
is the case if she will give me the same assistance with the 
premier in Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have exactly the same problem with the Conservative premier of 
Manitoba who takes a program which we designed and operated and 
pulls it into his riding and presents it as his own. Maybe we can 
find a way to work together to ensure that does not happen in the 
future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
first let me extend my sincere congratulations on your election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with great humility and excitement that I rise today to 
deliver my maiden speech in the House of Commons. I consider it a 
great honour to stand in this House to represent the citizens of 
Nepean—Carleton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are referred to in the House by the name of our riding. That 
is an important reminder that the seat we occupy is not ours.  It 
belongs to the people of our riding, in my case the citizens of 
Nepean—Carleton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nepean—Carleton has been blessed with some excellent members of 
Parliament, both Liberals and Conservatives, people like Dick 
Bell, Gordon Blair, Walter Baker and Beryl Gaffney. They were 
people who cared deeply about their community and their country, 
people for whom politics was not merely a job but an opportunity 
to serve their fellow Canadians in one of our great national 
institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say a few words about my immediate predecessor, Beryl 
Gaffney.  As many in the House know, Beryl represented the former 
riding of Nepean over the course of two Parliaments. Beryl's 
background in municipal government kept her firmly rooted in the 
community.  In the House she was a fierce defender of the 
interests of the national capital region, a fervent advocate of 
human rights, a committed spokesperson for women's health and an 
active proponent for the municipal infrastructure program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beryl Gaffney remains a source of inspiration to those who 
confront serious illness.  Diagnosed with a serious brain tumour 
part way through her term, she endured major surgery and battled 
back to sit in the House and speak on behalf of her constituents. 
She enjoys the respect and admiration of people across the 
national capital region and across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the course of this Parliament it is my intention to devote 
myself to providing the people of Nepean—Carleton with the best 
possible representation. Although my predecessors have set a very 
high standard, I will do my utmost to give voice to the concerns 
of my constituents in the House and its committees and I will 
work to ensure that their problems and inquiries with government 
programs and services are addressed with care and efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constituency of Nepean—Carleton has been my lifelong home. 
I am very proud to say my family traces its roots in this 
community back to the 1820s and early 1830s. Nepean—Carleton is 
a riding that has changed dramatically in my own lifetime. From a 
quiet collection of farming communities it has been transformed 
with suburbanization and technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Predominantly Anglo-Saxon 30 years ago, my riding has benefited 
from the arrival of many new Canadians who have brought with them 
not only their skills and their talents but their hopes and 
dreams for a better life in the best country in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The presence of the federal government in the national capital 
region continues to be very important to Nepean—Carleton.  Many 
of my constituents are federal public servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a new kid on the block that is making its presence felt 
in a big way.  Companies which are part of the Ottawa—Carleton 
region's thriving high technology industry can be found in the 
northern part of my riding which is part of the city of Nepean. 
Many of the residents of Nepean—Carleton work for companies like 
Computing Devices, Nortel, Newbridge, Corel, Mitel and Digital, 
to name a few. They are engaged in information technology, 
environmental technologies, biotechnologies, aerospace and 
telecommunications technology. They are part of the knowledge 
based economy which has transformed Ottawa from a predominantly 
government town to Canada's high technology capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These high tech companies are selling Canadian products to every 
corner of the globe. They are competing with the world's best and 
they are winning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The southern portion of my riding contains the largely rural 
townships of Osgoode, Rideau and Goulbourn.  Many of the 
residents of these areas also work in government and high tech 
industries, but many work in the agricultural industry, dairy, 
beef and cash crops, which has itself been transformed by new 
technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many respects Nepean—Carleton offers the best of both 
worlds, urban and rural. We are close enough to the country to 
uphold the rural values of community, self-reliance and hard 
work, but we are also close enough to the city to understand the 
importance of innovation, the entrepreneurial spirit and Canada's 
place in a wider world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents understand and appreciate the past but they also 
have an eye on the future.  That is why this Speech from the 
Throne is important to them. Those who have read the throne 
speech will know that it builds on the tremendous accomplishments 
of the last Parliament. The future of every Canadian is brighter 
because of the achievements of the last four years.  I am 
thinking of things like deficit reduction, taking the deficit 
from $42 billion down to a balanced budget which is now within 
sight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interest rates are at their lowest levels in 30 years.  Almost 
one million jobs have been created since 1993.  Our economic 
growth is expected to be the best of the G-7 countries this year. 
We continue to record huge increases in our trade surpluses.  As 
we all know, the United Nations continues to rank Canada as the 
number one country in the world according to the human 
development index.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who has read the throne speech knows that it follows up 
on the commitments made by the prime minister and the Liberal 
Party during the election.  It continues the important work of 
prudent financial management while, at the same time, directing 
resources to strengthen the social and economic fabric of this 
great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me address just a few of the themes on which the throne 
speech touches.  One area which has not received much attention 
but which is important to my constituents is the reference to the 
public service.  There is no doubt that there have been some 
tough times for the public service with the downsizing and 
restructuring of recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely important to ensure that steps are taken to 
enhance the morale and the esprit de corps of our public 
servants.  They provide Canadians with important services and 
programs from search and rescue to meat inspection to trade 
promotion.  We must ensure that we maintain a well-motivated, 
professional, non-partisan and efficient public service.  I am 
pleased that the throne speech contains a reference to the people 
who day after day carry out the work of the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell the House that I was also very pleased to see the 
reference in the throne speech to investing in knowledge and 
creativity.  This is vitally important to high technology 
companies in Nepean—Carleton, the national capital region and, 
indeed, the entire country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote directly from the throne speech, “The government 
is determined to do more to support innovation and risk-taking in 
Canada and to attract more foreign investment in knowledge based 
industries to Canada.  We will build creative partnerships 
between the private and public sectors to accelerate the adoption 
of innovative technologies in all sectors of the economy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes that through small and medium size 
businesses we can develop and improve new technologies.  That is 
why we are increasing the industrial research assistance program, 
or IRAP, to promote the diffusion of technology throughout 
Canada. We have already made a good start in this direction in 
the government's last mandate.  Through programs like SchoolNet, 
Technology Partnerships Canada and the Canadian Foundation for 
Innovation we are making tremendous progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>SchoolNet, which Microsoft's Bill Gates said was “the leading 
program in the world in terms of getting kids to use computers”, 
will have every school and library in Canada connected by 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technology Partnerships Canada, an investment fund with more 
than $250 million a year, will work with business to keep the 
development, marketing and production of new technologies in 
Canada where it will create jobs and foster new growth.  There is 
also the business development bank which is providing start-up 
capital to new enterprises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech touches on many areas of importance to my 
constituents.  The sections of the throne speech which refer to 
investing in children are particularly important.  Again I would 
like to quote briefly from the throne speech. “One of our 
objectives as a country should be to ensure that all Canadian 
children have the best possible opportunity to develop their full 
potential.  We must equip our children with the capacities they 
need to be ready to learn and participate fully in our society”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the throne speech is not just about idle rhetoric. The 
government is committed to increasing its contributions to the 
Canada child tax benefit by $850 million a year with higher 
payments to families beginning in July 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to indicate my strong support for some of the other 
priorities in the throne speech, especially creating 
opportunities for young Canadians. We all heard during the last 
election about the problem with youth unemployment.  It is 
unacceptably high.  We have to address that issue in this 
Parliament and I think we have had a good start with some of the 
recent statistics and job creation figures that we have had in 
that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we also have to reduce barriers to post-secondary 
education and ensure, as well, that young people are able to get 
that all important first job. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague for his speech and I understand his wanting to express 
his pride.  However, I wonder how he can be proud since, although 
the Speech from the Throne focuses on young people, it is the 
policies of this government since 1993 that have forced a 
significant number of young people into poverty.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The OECD's human development index, as mentioned in the 
document, indicates that, here in Canada, 50 percent of the 
children in single parent families live below the poverty line. 
This index could change, because some of the criteria are being 
reviewed. With the 20 top countries in a somewhat similar 
situation, the index was not made for wealthy countries, as we 
all know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the hon. member proud of the cuts to education, the regular 
hikes in tuition fees, which led not to increased access to 
education, but to increased difficulty obtaining an education in 
the case of those who have little money? 
Perhaps the announcement of a fund, which the Prime Minister had to 
make outside the throne speech, will in some way resolve what is 
felt generally—that as far as young people are concerned, the 
speech rings hollow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member proud that, for reasons of efficiency, the 
federal government, after so many years, has decided to leave job 
training with the provinces, where it is most efficient—and I 
repeat efficient, because that was what was decided—when in the 
name of the same objective of efficiency, it is refusing to do the 
same for young people?  Why would it be effective for everyone but 
young people?  Why should the great federal mind be dealing with 
these problems, when they are local problems, and jurisdiction is 
clear, for good reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member proud that the government is announcing $850 
million for young people, $250 million of which was already 
provided for in the last budget, while the remaining $600 had been 
promised in 1993 for a national child care program that never saw 
the light of day? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no doubt my colleague wants to be proud, but he should 
have reason to be proud. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt:</B>  Madam Speaker, in the context of the 
government's overall program I do not think there is any question 
that over the last four years the government would have liked to 
have spent money on areas related to children and youth and 
aboriginals and other areas of society that in many respects have 
been neglected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly one of its primary concerns over the last four years 
has been the deficit and the impact that the huge deficit and 
increasing debt would have had on the future of young people.  If 
we had entered the next century with a debt of $700 billion or 
$800 billion, what sort of a future would that provide for our 
young people?  I can answer that question.  It would have 
provided no future at all because they would have been ground 
down by excessive debt.  The opportunities for government to do 
creative things in our society would have been reduced 
significantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's achievement in addressing the deficit was 
certainly a first step toward securing the future of young 
people, children and youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of important programs and initiatives were announced in 
the throne speech.  I referred earlier to the Canada child tax 
benefit which I think is extremely important and the government's 
focus on the need to create strong families so that the family 
unit can be strengthened as a fundamental component of our 
society. That is in the process of being done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look for instance at the initiatives related to the 
centres of excellence to deepen our understanding of children's 
development and well-being and to improve our ability to respond 
to their needs, these are good programs which will contribute 
significantly to the well-being of young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aboriginal head start program is another one that I think is 
certainly very important to the children of aboriginal parents to 
ensure that they get the best possible start in their lives.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to youth unemployment, certainly Canada's level of 
youth unemployment is extremely high.  It is higher than anyone 
in the House would like to see it.  As I mentioned earlier— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Resuming debate, the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to stand in the chamber today as the new member of 
Parliament for St. John's East.  It is a great honour and 
privilege to be here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With my first words in Parliament I want to extend my thanks and 
deep appreciation to the people of St. John's East for having 
sent me here.  Obviously I could not be here without their 
approval and support.  I am very grateful for the opportunity to 
serve in such a distinguished setting as the House of Commons of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As previous members have done, I would like to extend to you, 
Madam Speaker, my congratulations on your appointment.  I would 
also extend to the Speaker my sincere congratulations on his 
election.  I look forward to serving over the next few years 
under Madam Speaker's watchful gaze. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The riding of St. John's East is no stranger to this debating 
floor.  One of my predecessors was the Hon. Jim McGrath, an 
individual for whom I had a great deal of respect and admiration. 
He was a long serving, articulate member of the House.  I believe 
he was here for 20-odd years.  Over that time he earned the 
reputation of being a true parliamentarian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had one goal to set for myself in this chamber it would be 
that I could contribute to my province, contribute to my nation, 
in much the same way that Jim McGrath did.  I know that is a very 
difficult task, given the fact that one has to make a lot of 
sacrifices to be in public life.  However, I do know that the 
sacrifice is worth making if one wants to live in the greatest 
nation on earth.  The privilege which we in this country have is 
to live in the greatest nation on earth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have somewhat of an advantage over some of my colleagues, as I 
have a bit of experience in political life. I spent about 13 
years in the Newfoundland House of Assembly. During that time I 
ran across many occasions on which I found myself being 
frustrated with the system.  One could be very frustrated in his 
day to day duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can also inform hon. members that there are many difficulties 
involved in this job.  One of the difficulties happens to be that 
we may not always find ourselves on the same side of an issue as 
our constituents.  I believe that when we have that kind of 
experience we feel a sense of alienation from the very people who 
elected us, simply because we have a great regard for them. 
However, they may not necessarily agree with our views on how 
this world should unfold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my 13 years in the Newfoundland House of Assembly there 
were a couple of occasions on which I found myself in that kind 
of spot.  One issue which stands out in my memory happened in 
1990 when we were involved in the Meech Lake debate.  I found 
myself on the opposite side of the issue.  I recall speaking 
publicly in the Newfoundland House of Assembly in support of 
Meech.  I felt strongly about that particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had been listening to people like Peter Lougheed, Grant 
Devine, Joe Ghiz, David Peterson and Bill Bennett, people whom we 
all respect and admire.  I had been convinced by these people 
that it was in the greater public good for us to vote for Meech 
Lake. I think if we had shown a little tolerance, a little 
respect for the people with whom we share a common border we 
might not be involved in the national unity debate in which we 
are involved today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember well feeling the wrath of many people in the 
provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador because I voted in that 
way.  Many of them had been persuaded by former Premier Wells 
that if we voted for Meech Lake it might put the nation on a road 
we would soon regret. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meech lake is gone and so is Premier Wells.  I guess history 
will have to judge, make a pronouncement in due course on the 
validity of the arguments he presented.  I happen to feel that 
the people who stood in the way of Meech Lake back in 1990 will 
be judged very harshly by history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member for Burin—St. George's, was in the 
house of assembly with me at that time.  I take a great deal of 
satisfaction from knowing I voted in a way I felt was right for 
my province and for the nation.  I have no regrets about that, 
even though the people of the province may not have felt that way 
on the issue.  That is all history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strange thing about history is that the more things change, 
the more they stay the same.  I am only a couple of months into 
my term of office and I find myself on the opposite side of 
another important issue in my province, the education debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members are fully aware that a few months ago there was a 
referendum in Newfoundland.  The premier of the province received 
a mandate and 38 percent of the eligible voters in the province 
gave complete support to the premier to exercise a mandate to 
change the denominational educational system in Newfoundland to a 
full blown public secular system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last evening we had the Quebec amendment before us.  Very 
shortly the new term 17 will come to the Chamber.  That will mean 
a constitutional amendment which will wipe out, not adjust, the 
rights of certain classes of people in Newfoundland to education 
in their particular school system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the tolerant nature of the people of Newfoundland and of 
people across the country, I find that to be a little 
disappointing, to say the least.  I have very grave difficulty 
with the wiping out the rights of these classes of people.  There 
were those who had these rights since 1949 and those since 1980. 
Two separate groups of people were given rights under the 
Constitution of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do they feel that way?  Christian based religion has always 
played a very important part in the province of Newfoundland and 
Labrador, and in Newfoundland society in general.  The churches 
started schools and hospitals in Newfoundland.  Denominational 
education has been very important to the people.  Denominational 
education was front and centre in another debate long before you 
and I came to the Chamber, Mr. Speaker.  It was front and centre 
in 1949 when we joined Confederation with Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a very important part of the debate.  We became a 
province of Canada under the umbrella of a negotiated set of 
rules call the terms of union.  One of those terms happened to be 
term 17 which gave rights to certain classes of people to their 
own religious school system.  It gave rights to certain classes 
of people by religious affiliation.  Term 17 has been amended 
twice.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It was amended back in the 1980s when I was part of the 
Government of Newfoundland and Labrador.  As a province we 
extended to the Pentecostal Assemblies of Newfoundland and 
Labrador rights under the Constitution of Canada that they would 
be able to have their own particular school system.  That was not 
a long time ago, just back in 1980. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now here we are.  We are going for a third amendment to the 
Constitution of Canada, a new term 17 that will wipe out or 
completely extinguish the long held rights of these people to 
their own educational system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been very vocal and very upset about the issue over the 
last couple of months.  How did we ever get to this point?  Hon. 
members know more about the last amendment we had before the 
House.  They were here and I was not.  It called for a 
diminishing of rights in education.  To his credit Clyde Wells at 
least made some provision for those classes of people who wanted 
to retain their rights in education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provision was fair for those people.  The amendment came to 
the House of Commons.  All schools were to be declared 
interdenominational schools but where numbers warranted people 
would have the right to retain their rights in the educational 
system of the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a stormy debate in the House of Commons.  It went to 
the Senate.  There was a veto in the Senate but it passed.  I 
cannot say the churches were completely happy with that, but as 
we say in Newfoundland a half a loaf is better than none. They 
still retained their rights in the educational system of our 
province, including the right to teach their children in their 
particular faith beliefs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are back at it again in this Chamber even though over the 
last number of months in my province approximately 54,000 or 
55,000 people voted to retain their rights in education and to 
keep their 28,000 children in their particular school systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment that came to the House of Commons and was passed 
had to be implemented in Newfoundland.  As with any new amendment 
there is bound to be a bumpy start.  It had a bumpy start in 
Newfoundland as well.  The rights of these people were affected 
even after that constitutional amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the west coast of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador 
some disagreement came about which had to go to court.  The judge 
happened to say to those people that their rights had been 
affected, trampled upon.  Therefore the judge granted an 
injunction to make sure their rights got back on track again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something totally unbelievable happened after that.  Premier 
Tobin seized upon the public frustration and called a referendum. 
It was a 30 day referendum in which he decided the court case was 
over.  They were never going to be able to do that again, so he 
ensured their rights were wiped out totally and completely, 
totally extinguished.  I find that to be totally intolerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know one is not allowed to say an individual in the House 
committed a cowardly act. I know that is an unparliamentary term, 
but I will say that Mr. Tobin seized upon an opportunity that he 
should not have seized upon.  As a result he has less intestinal 
fortitude than a model leader of a province should have.  I find 
that to be terribly disappointing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He called a 30 day referendum, whipped up public sentiment, went 
to the polls and won.  How did he win?  I think it is necessary 
to tell members of the House how he won.  When he decided to call 
his referendum, term 17, a new term to be enshrined in the 
Constitution of Canada, was released to the public 16 hours 
before the advanced polls opened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new term 17 to amend the Constitution of Canada is something 
that is very important to the people of my province.  They had 16 
hours notice to examine that term before the advanced polls 
opened.  I find that to be totally intolerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that, the premier of the province spent $350,000 on a 
campaign and never advanced one penny to the opponents of the 
cause.  I find that to be intolerable as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in that kind of highly charged atmosphere that Premier 
Tobin will bring forth his version of term 17 to this honourable 
House.  He will wipe out forever and a day the long held rights 
of these groups of people, people who have held those rights 
since 1949 and others who have held them since 1980. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hold that to be a very sacred right but it is not a popular 
view to hold right now in my province.  I think it is a sacred 
right.  It is a sacred right that these parents hold as well, a 
constitutional right protected under term 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That right will be wiped out by parliament in association with 
the house of assembly of Newfoundland.  I have problems with what 
we will be doing here.  I have problems with what we will be 
doing to those people who want to exercise that right, and there 
are many who want to do so.  I have very serious concerns about 
the tolerance lacking in all of us when we use this Chamber to 
take away a religious right that is sacred and protected by the 
Constitution of Canada.  That is what we are about to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have problems when we submit the rights of a minority to the 
judgment of the majority.  The minority by definition is the 
loser so how can the minority win? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a school of thought in the country that says a 
referendum is a very blunt instrument with which to adjust or 
take away the rights of minority groups.  There is also the 
school of thought that says we should not amend the same 
constitutional clause of the Constitution of Canada twice in 
rapid succession.  Constitutional provisions need time to settle 
into the social order.  We are changing the same clause of the 
Constitution of Canada twice in the space of one year.  What time 
did it have to settle into the social order?  None. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sometimes wonder what it means to have a constitutional right 
if it can be made subject to the ebb and flow of public 
sentiment.  That is very serious.  When we as a nation or as a 
province decide to do that we do a grave disservice to the people 
not only of my province but everywhere else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To pass this kind of constitutional amendment twice in one year 
will send a very bad signal to other minority groups throughout 
the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That right of these parents to educate their children in the way 
they want to educate their children in my view is a sacred right 
and it should not be interfered with. We should never, under any 
circumstances—perhaps that is too far to go.  Perhaps there are 
circumstances under which we can take away minority rights but I 
do not think it should ever be done without the consent of those 
people who are directly affected by that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not sought to get any kind of permission from the people 
who hold those sacred rights.  There are 52,000 of those people 
who hold those rights, who have already registered their 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the Pentecostal Assemblies a week before the 
referendum took place had a poll conducted of that 7 percent 
population that is represented as Pentecostal and 95 percent of 
those people said “no, we do not want that”.  But we are 
ignoring their rights. That is not the popular view for me to 
take in my province right now, but I feel very strongly that 
ignoring the rights of those people will set a very bad precedent 
for other minority groups in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that Madam Speaker is about to cut me off so I will 
just say I appreciate the opportunity to say these few words. 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I really 
appreciated and enjoyed the speech just given by the member.  I 
suppose the reason I appreciated it is because he expressed 
sentiments which I and which members of the Reform Party hold 
very strongly.  That is the necessity to live by the rule of law 
and that the law should not be just slightly changed because of 
the whims of certain individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very pleased that the leader of our party in talking about 
the motion that was before the House yesterday tried in his 
amendment to preserve those rights.  The amendment he proposed in 
essence gave legs to this principle which this member has been 
talking about today. That is the principle that the rights of 
minorities in this country if they are entrenched in the 
Constitution ought not to be taken away without the specific 
consent of that minority group that is involved in that decision. 
I agree with this member 100 percent on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to ask that question with respect to a very broad range 
of issues that are now before this government, before this House, 
before us as members all the way from the question of Quebec 
separation to these issues of schools and the constitutional 
amendments which are being challenged by it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really like the clause which my leader quoted yesterday from 
the Manitoba Act which states “Nothing in any such law shall 
prejudicially affect any right or privilege with respect to 
denominational schools which any class of persons have by law or 
practice in the province at the union”.  That is a very good 
solid principle. It is a shame that in this Parliament we are 
running roughshod over those very strong principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of that, my question for this member is, how is it then 
that he was reluctant to support the amendment that we put 
forward on the issue that was before us yesterday since the 
principle is identical?  I think it is an important comparison. I 
am not asking him to defend his decision but I would like his 
views on that, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  Madam Speaker, I could almost support 
that amendment yesterday except for one thing. It mentioned a 
referendum and I was under the impression that again we would be 
subjecting the rights of these people, especially minority groups 
as we have in Newfoundland and Labrador on this particular issue, 
and condoning the referendum to take these rights away.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe there are times when we should have a referendum to adjust 
the Constitution of Canada.  However, when there is a minority 
group, then I do not believe that without its consent we should 
take away those rights.  That group would be the loser by 
definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very fact that those people belong to a minority group 
should keep them outside of that particular process.  Seeing the 
word referendum to me was an indication that if we had a minority 
rights issue, we would holus-bolus take it to a referendum to 
remove those rights.  I have a great concern about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other than that I thought the leader of the Reform Party made an 
excellent speech yesterday.  There were many points in his speech 
which I agreed with.  As a matter of fact, I sent him a note 
requesting a copy of his remarks because it was such a good 
speech. However, with respect to the referendum process and the 
taking away of rights of a minority group, that was of great 
concern to me. 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I listened to the speech of the hon. member for St. 
John's East and I must say with a great deal less approbation 
than has been expressed by the hon. member for Elk Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was reminded as a result of his speech of the very clear 
reason the Conservative government of Brian Mulroney was 
destroyed in the election of 1993.  It was very obvious in the 
Charlottetown accord and in the Meech Lake accord that the 
government and obviously this member who was a supporter of the 
government at that time failed to listen to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As he admits, in his area of St. John's the people spoke out 
overwhelmingly against Meech Lake and I presume the Charlottetown 
accord as they did in my region of Ontario. I was not a 
politician then, I was just an ordinary citizen, but in my 
village everyone was against Meech lake and everyone was against 
the Charlottetown accord.  What was so distressing and the reason 
I got into politics was the fact that the politicians of the day, 
especially the Conservative politicians, would not listen to the 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have the irony of the member for St. John's East telling 
us that he again is not listening to the people in his riding 
when it comes to the amendments to term 17.  He is saying he 
acknowledges that the majority of people in Newfoundland agree 
that a constitutional change must be brought forward to change 
the school system in Newfoundland, but he is prepared yet again 
to ignore the people because he knows better.  He knows better, 
like his predecessors in the Conservative Party and the previous 
prime minister who I think now has a job in the United States. 
Good luck to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not think it is about time he recognized that he 
cannot ignore the majority?  He speaks all this nonsense about 
looking after the rights of the majority when in fact he is only 
looking after his own party's platform.  Does he not think it is 
time he listened to the people?  Maybe his judgment is not 
correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  Madam Speaker, that is an interesting 
comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say to the hon. member that he has nothing to be proud 
of.  If he turned down Meech Lake, he has nothing to be proud of. 
I think history will judge him very harshly.  We would not be 
involved in the national unity debate today had we had a little 
common sense back in 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very interesting point that the hon. member makes.  I 
suppose it cuts right to the heart of whether a member of the 
House of Assembly or a member of the House of Commons has to vote 
in the same way that his constituents vote and whether we should 
follow them on all occasions.  I have to admit that I have done 
that on more than one occasion, but I have to admit that I have 
not done that on a couple of occasions as well. It is an issue 
which we are not going to solve here.  It has been ongoing for 
the last couple of hundred years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make a couple of points on this particular issue.  The 
38 percent of the people who voted yes in the referendum in 
Newfoundland are well represented on this particular issue.  We 
have all of the members of the Newfoundland House of Assembly who 
are unanimous in their view on that.  They are well represented. 
However I worry sometimes about the minority groups which are not 
well represented in the House.  I think I have a duty and an 
obligation as a parliamentarian to represent them as well.  I 
think that is a very important point.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am a little bit curious about the hon. member's 
comments about the referendum section of the amendment proposed 
yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very clear in his amendment that he was talking about a 
three-legged stool in which referendum was one leg.  The amendment 
proposed by the Leader of the Opposition was in fact not that a 
referendum alone would determine constitutional amendment but 
that there could not be a constitutional amendment without a 
referendum in addition to the other clauses that he suggested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering if the hon. member just did not understand what 
was going on or if he merely voted the way the member for 
Sherbrooke told him to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not operate that 
way.  I do not vote the way people want me to vote in this House. 
I vote according to my conscience and I vote in what I feel are 
the best interests of the people of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about a three-legged system yesterday.  I think one 
part of it was the referendum process that these things would 
have to go through.  The other was the rule of law and the other 
was determined to be within the national interest.

</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate you on your 
appointment to the position of Acting Speaker.  The job that you 
hold is of great importance as you preside over the most 
important debating Chamber in our country. You must ensure that 
we can discuss in this Chamber with civility the viewpoints of 
Canadians from coast to coast to coast in helping to guide the 
governance of this great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I must thank the constituents of Kitchener—Waterloo for 
the honour of re-electing me to serve as their representative in 
the 36th Parliament of Canada. I promise them and I promise all 
Canadians that I will do my very best to represent them in this 
crucible of democracy.  I also thank my many friends and 
supporters for their tireless labours during the last election 
campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank my staff, Dianne, Mohammed, Dan, and Tanis for 
their work in the constituency office and the Hill office prior 
to, during and after the election to ensure that we serve our 
constituency and our country well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In rising to speak on the first throne speech of the 36th 
Parliament, which will be the last parliament of this millennium 
and the first of the next millennium, I do so with humility and 
with tremendous optimism for the future of our country. We have 
people from all parts of the world coming together in Canada and 
building a nation characterized by tolerance, understanding, 
generosity and prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together we have built a country that has become a beacon of 
hope in an often troubled world torn by strife, wars, poverty, 
intolerance and lack of compassion. The fact that Canada has 
invented peacekeeping is a reflection and a demonstration of the 
ethnic diversity of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever there is a war or a disaster in the world, there are 
Canadians among us who are hurting because of troubles in their 
former homeland. Our diverse ethnic make-up must continue to be 
our social strength that nurtures our tolerance and compassion 
and does not serve the cause of disunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I vividly recall returning to the land of my birth, Hungary, for 
the first time since leaving as a refugee in 1957.  I was going 
to Budapest as an adviser to the Prime Minister of Canada at the 
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.  I was most 
impressed with the prime minister's knowledge and interest in 
these issues.

minister as a parliamentarian of the best country on this planet. 
It was very different in February 1957 when my family and I fled 
the communist dictatorship through landmines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, members can easily understand that the latest 
contribution Canada has made in the area of banning landmines has 
a very personal significance to me and to many other new 
Canadians with similar or worse experiences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the course of our trip to Budapest, I met with a group of 
family friends.  They toasted me and said “Welcome home”. With 
a great deal of emotion, I thanked them for their toast and 
stated that Hungary is the place of my birth and that I will 
always have a concern for its development and well-being. 
However, my home, where my wife Nancy, of Irish and Scottish 
background, and our 11-year-old daughter Erin are, is Canada.  I 
thank them for their love and support.  They certainly are my 
Rock of Gibraltar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I salute my parents and all those immigrants to Canada who came 
to help build this great country of ours with a commitment to 
tolerance, understanding and a burning desire to give their 
children an opportunity for a better life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians fail to realize how fortunate we really are in 
comparison to other countries.  The task of keeping together this 
country of ours, Canada, has to be our greatest priority.  To do 
otherwise, to let this country fail due to mean-spiritedness, 
intolerance and regionalism would be a crime against humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge for us as parliamentarians from across this great 
land is to ensure that we continue to build a country that 
celebrates the diversity which unites us in our resolve to 
maintain our nation as a model for the rest of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Wednesday, the prime minister, in speaking on the throne 
speech, pointed out to the House that individual parliamentarians 
working together can make a difference. With the help of the 
former minister of supply and services, I was able to leave my 
mark in a modest way by securing for Canadians the right to 
refuse ad-mail delivery by Canada Post. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I came to Parliament I was involved in community justice 
and the building of a safer and more secure community through the 
Community Safety and Crime Prevention Council of Waterloo region. 
The fruits of our experience in this area are reflected in the 
crime prevention, community safety effort contained in the throne 
speech.  This will challenge and assist communities right across 
Canada to establish local crime prevention efforts that will 
address the root causes of crime and so build safer communities 
and a safer nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also passionate about higher education, affording our youth 
an opportunity to compete successfully with the best in the world 
and building on the knowledge based industries that will define 
our economic well-being as a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Waterloo region is blessed with three excellent 
post-secondary institutions.  I am proud to have served those 
institutions, the University of Waterloo, Conestoga College and 
Wilfrid Laurier University.  I salute the pioneers who built 
these institutions.  Wilfrid Laurier opened its doors as a 
Lutheran seminary in 1911.  The University of Waterloo was 
started in 1957, the same year that my family and I came to 
Canada and it has been a very important part of my life.  In its 
40 years it has gone from mud and dreams to an institution of 
excellence and world renown. Conestoga College has 30 years of 
service to the community and a graduate job placement rate close 
to 90 percent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than 250,000 Canadians have attended these institutions. 
If one multiplies that by the $50,000 a year of wealth generated 
by each of those individuals, we have a figure of $12.5 billion 
that Waterloo region adds to the Canadian economy each year by 
the virtue of higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us continue to follow the wisdom of the pioneers who built 
our post-secondary institutions.  Let us be bold enough and 
forward-looking enough to uphold their vision by continuing the 
investment in our children's future and our nation's future.

<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and

passports are forgeries.  There are about six million Canadian 
passports out at any given time.

<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and

concern of the hon. Leader of the Opposition about the reputation 
of Canada and Canadian difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know nothing about any involvement by any Canadian in the 
matter.  We can confirm that the Canadian ambassador to Israel is 
being brought back to Canada for consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The matter is being treated very seriously.  The Minister of 
Foreign Affairs has met with the crown prince of Jordan today in 
New York and he will meet with Israeli officials.

yesterday in the House the Prime Minister said it would be 
unacceptable for foreign operatives to use the Canadian passport. 
Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs even threatened diplomatic 
retaliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these are fine words, but where are the actions to 
prevent the illegal use of Canadian passports no matter how or by 
whom they are used?

illegal use of Canadian passports, what concrete steps will it 
take to ensure that Canadian passports will not be used illegally 
in this manner in the future? 
<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and

Opposition will know that the Canadian passports require less 
visas than perhaps any other passport in the world.  It is a very 
desirable passport for people to have.  They may have been 
forged.  They may have been stolen.  As I say, there are six 
million of them out there.

by other countries.  I have just been contacted by a frightened 
Canadian in Jordan who says that all Canadians are in danger of 
repercussion.  He was told by the Canadian embassy in Jordan to 
stay indoors for his own safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Canadian government doing to protect Canadians 
travelling abroad?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and

very good one.  It is a concern to Canadians when anything like 
this happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member knows that it had nothing to do with the Government 
of Canada.  They could have been stolen.  They could have been 
forged.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A week after a major incident takes place the government is 
telling Canadians that it does not really know what is happening. 
Either that is true or our foreign affairs department is inept.

what the Minister of Human Resources Development has repeated 
today, that he informed the RCMP and the PMO that an investigation 
relating to a fund raiser was under way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the solicitor general for an explanation of how 
the Prime Minister knew, the RCMP knew, his colleague the Minister

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

<P><A NAME="LINK127"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, a few months ago, 
the former solicitor general explained in this House, in relation to the 
Airbus affair, that the way the system works, the first thing that 
happens when there is an investigation is that the RCMP informs the 
solicitor general, who then decides whether it is appropriate to advise 
the Prime Minister's office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the system provides for the RCMP to inform the solicitor 
general, how can he stand up and tell us, as he did yesterday, that he 
was not informed?

<P><A NAME="LINK129"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is an

ministers and goes right to the heart of the matter of government 
integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the solicitor general still contend that he was not 
informed by the RCMP because they did not feel it was appropriate

for the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign, the Prime Minister promised job 
creation would be a priority. In February, the Minister of Finance said 
interest rates had to be lower to promote job creation, but yesterday

interest rates.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> As you know, Mr. 
Speaker, job creation has been quite strong in the past five or six 
months, but it now has to be maintained, which means sustained and 
sustainable growth.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
unemployment is 9 percent, where it has been for seven lean 
years, and inflation is 1.8 percent.  Before the election when 
inflation was 2.2 percent the finance minister said there were no 
inflationary pressures in Canada.  Now the finance minister wants 
to choke off the bit of hope the unemployed have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister justify a policy that condemns 1.4 million 
Canadians to continuing unemployment? 
<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
anybody who follows the economy knows full well that the major 
problem of large industrial countries has been a perpetuation of 
the boom and the bust cycle.  In order to avoid that, it is very 
clear the central banks have to act with a certain degree of lag 
time.  That is what has happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one wants to talk about government policies, let us take a 
look at the private sector.  Since this government has taken 
office it has created over one million jobs.  In this year alone 
there have been 260,000 jobs, the majority of them in the private 
sector.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of Veterans Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has cut the last post fund for veterans from 
$26,000 to $12,060.  This has made it very difficult for 
veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister assure the House that he will have his 
department review the cuts it made to the last post fund and deal 
with the difficulties and injustices it has caused to the spouses 
of those families? 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Veterans Affairs and Secretary 
of State (Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency), Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for the question.  I 
know that she has worked hard, like all of us in the House, in 
support of veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been asked to assure the House that this situation will 
be reviewed.  Veterans affairs are always reviewed to see what 
can be done for veterans.  We recently overhauled the review 
board and that basically cuts the time in half.  We continue to 
review items of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member knows that a few years ago we introduced a bill 
that looked after merchant seamen.  We will continue to do this 
on a regular basis. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there 
has been $182 million cut from the Department of Veterans 
Affairs' budget.  This has made it most difficult for the 
veterans and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cuts to the last post fund have made it more difficult than some 
of the other cuts because it costs a lot more today to bury a 
veteran than it did 10 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I ask the minister to please take a look at the last 
post fund to see if there is not some way we can bring back 
dignity for the veterans.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Veterans Affairs and Secretary

veterans will be utmost and top priority for the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Minister of National Revenue dismissed allegations 
made by a 25-year customs official, Dennis Coffey, allegations of 
fraud, nepotism and abuse rampant in the Department of National 
Revenue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have obtained a sworn affidavit from Mr. Coffey which I 
am prepared to table in the House confirming his allegations and 
contradicting the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that Revenue Canada has not denied Mr. Coffey's 
allegations, is the minister prepared to investigate this matter 
and if not, why not? 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member asked this question yesterday 
and I responded.  I want to repeat that response so that it is 
clear to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said yesterday that no preferential treatment is given to 
FedEx.  Let me repeat it again.  No preferential treatment is 
given to FedEx. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member has any evidence to the contrary other than 
allegations, he should table them in the House. We have not seen 
one iota of evidence from this member other than the 
unsubstantiated allegations that he has put forward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
offered just a moment ago to table a sworn affidavit from a 
25-year veteran of this minister's department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is evidence introduced before a quasi-judicial body of the 
government.  One of the minister's top customs officers has 
threatened to muzzle and fire this officer of the minister's 
department for making these allegations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that how the minister treats employees who try to expose 
fraud, waste and corruption in his department? 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue,

the words that he uses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this hon. member wants to pretend he is a rat packer, but 
he is certainly no Brian Tobin.

about this investigation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there are two parts to the question.  He answered the part 
concerning the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask him again: Did he, in the time between question period 
yesterday and today, discuss this matter with not some but many of 
his colleagues, since almost everyone in cabinet knew about it but 
him?

question for the Minister of Finance who, I guess like everyone 
else, was surprised yesterday to learn that interest rates are 
now on the way up again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have acknowledged that inflation, at 1.8 percent, is well 
within the parameters of the Bank of Canada's monetary policy. 
The minister says he has to take action because the inflation 
rate is at 1.8 percent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How high do unemployment levels have to go before the minister 
also takes action on interest rates? 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am sure the hon. member knows that interest rates are at almost a 
30-year low.  Our interest rates are substantially lower than 
those in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not dealing with monetary tightening. The governor of the 
bank has simply eased off on the accelerator a little in order to 
maintain the tremendous economic recovery and the very strong job 
creation we are seeing.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a point of privilege.  I would like to say to other 
members of this House that I take points of privilege very 
seriously and have only decided to pursue this course of action 
after giving it a great deal of thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Tuesday, September 30 the first draw for Private Members' 
Business in the 36th Parliament was held.  A bill that I wished 
to have in that draw was not eligible because it has not gone 
through first reading yet.  There were very few changes to be 
made to this bill as it had been submitted in the last 
Parliament.  However two and a half months after I requested it, 
the bill has not materialized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My ability to discharge my parliamentary duties has been 
severely hampered due to the reduction in House staff responsible 
for the production of private members' bills.  Private Members' 
Business is a means by which public matters the government is not 
dealing with can be brought forward by private members of this 
Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 301 members in this House most of whom may wish to 
have bills drafted, but there are only two legislative counsel on 
staff plus one on contract to do all the necessary drafting. The 
support staff who translate, edit and format the bills are not 
dedicated only to the production of private members' bills. Other 
House business can take precedence, including for example 
amendments to government legislation in committee. It is possible 
that most of their time could be taken up on other business and 
Private Members' Business would literally grind to a halt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On July 9 I notified the House that I wished to reintroduce two 
bills from the last Parliament with minor or no modifications. 
Because House staff worked a great deal of overtime while the 
House was sitting, they were on holidays over the summer.  This 
means no one was available to work on these requests for two 
months.  During that time numerous other members also submitted 
requests for the drafting of private members' bills creating an 
enormous backlog.  At the time of the draw there were around 170 
private members' bills in the system with only 23 of them having 
reached the stage where they could be introduced in the House to 
be eligible for the draw.  That means that there were almost 150 
bills tied up in the backlog.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to stress that I am in no way finding fault with the 
existing staff. To the contrary, they have done an extremely 
exemplary job under the circumstances and deserve to be commended 
in the highest manner possible. However despite their best 
efforts this happens every year and even more so at the beginning 
of a new Parliament or a new session. The House knows it is going 
to happen, yet this dire state of Private Members' Business has 
not been addressed.  The inadequate resources devoted to private 
members' bills especially at peak periods adversely affects the 
ability of all members of this House to perform their 
parliamentary duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would request that the House immediately allocate additional 
resources so this backlog of Private Members' Business can be 
cleared up as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude that this is not a point of privilege only for me. It 
is for all private members in this House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  This is not a problem which is absolutely 
new to the House.  I would find at this point that this is not a 
question of privilege.  However might I suggest that the hon. 
member speak with his representative on the Board of Internal 
Economy because this could probably more properly be discussed 
there.  I would respectfully make that suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to whether it is a question of privilege or not, my judgment 
is that it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this on another point of privilege? 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B> On the same 
point of privilege, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I would take it that there is probably new 
information because this is not a point of privilege.  Do you 
wish to raise a point of privilege? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to convince 
you that it is a point of privilege and support my colleague in 
that manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I think, my colleague, that this could more 
properly be discussed in the Board of Internal Economy.  Might I 
request that his intervention be put off perhaps to another time. 
Are you agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am now going to deal with points of order.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal infrastructure program brought under $12 million to 
Etobicoke—Lakeshore with an estimated 178 direct construction 
jobs.  This resulted in improvements to roads, sewers and other 
infrastructure of the riding.  The federal job strategy program 
has also had some positive impact on commercial activity and some 
of the social institutions in the community. I commend these 
economic initiatives by the government. However, there is still 
room for greater economic growth in Etobicoke—Lakeshore.  The 
need is still there for job creation opportunities for older 
workers and for young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In last week's Speech from the Throne the government noted that 
it will continue to take further action to encourage new 
investments, to create new jobs and to generate the national 
wealth necessary to assure Canadians a stable and secure future. 
I am very pleased that the government has made this commitment. 
There is hope and optimism for the industries and for my 
constituents in Etobicoke—Lakeshore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a consultation meeting with my constituents which I held 
fairly recently with a mixture of small and medium size 
businesses in Etobicoke—Lakeshore, I heard that the people of 
Etobicoke—Lakeshore want a country that is fiscally strong, safe 
and tolerant.  They want a country where youth and adults can 
find gainful decent employment, a country where young people can 
realize their dreams.  The commitment to invest 50 percent of the 
budgetary process to these social and economic initiatives shows 
the government's willingness to practise fiscal responsibility 
while it addresses these pressing problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the prime minister and the finance minister they 
will have my support and my constituents' support to stay the 
course of fiscal prudence and to find opportunities for young 
people.  Our young people are the future of this country. As we 
head into the new millennium we must ensure that our youth have 
the opportunity to develop their abilities through education and 
adequate job training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Speech from the Throne the government placed strong 
emphasis on these critical issues of concern to young people. 
Partner initiatives such as the youth internship program with the 
YMCA and career edge are steps in the right direction in assuring 
the youth of this nation get on track and stay on track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am equally proud that this Liberal government will establish a 
Canada millennium scholarship endowment fund and will work to 
reduce barriers to post-secondary education for young people by 
making further changes to Canada student loans programs.  Our 
commitment to invest in knowledge and creativity must begin with 
the youth of this nation.  Youth in my riding and across the 
country must be prepared to meet the challenges that lie ahead in 
a globally competitive economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A safe and just society is valued by my constituents and by all 
Canadians.  I have heard from my constituents of 
Etobicoke—Lakeshore that they want to feel secure in their homes 
and in their communities.

person who is just an ordinary citizen, not particularly 
interested in politics, who turns on the TV to find our colleague 
across the way on the screen, praising the youth program being 
developed by the Minister of Human Resources Development, as I 
heard him doing—the minister seems to be confirming my 
words—that it is important for people to understand that the 
youth programs, the Human Resources Development programs, must 
reflect youth problems as much as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What must be understood is that the problems very often differ 
from one region to the next.  When the federal government comes up 
with programs, very often the problem is that it bases them on a 
single reality. 
I do not know if it is the reality as perceived by public servants 
or by politicians, but it is the reality of people with a view of 
the country that is very— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Outdated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay:</B> Outdated, perhaps, but a very global and 
very uniform view of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask one question of the hon. member across the way. 
Does she not consider that all of the youth initiatives taken by 
the government are merely interference in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Jean Augustine:</B>  Mr. Speaker, until the member's last 
statement I thought he was asking for some way in which we could 
have uniform programs across the country that would address the 
needs of young people.  I was really applauding him for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent a constituency which has young people who attend 
colleges and universities right across this great land from one 
province to another. They must have their credits transferred. 
They need the programs of uniformity of credentials.  I 
understood he was referring to the fact that our young people 
must be given opportunities in all parts of the country to reach 
their full potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to separate out the kinds of squabbles that are 
occurring right now which do not benefit our young people.  While 
we are involved in these kinds of squabbles our young people are 
finding it difficult to have their own issues addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to compliment the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was listening to the member from across the way. She mentioned 
she has many manufacturing businesses, many retail businesses, 
small businesses and large businesses in her constituency, as I

happy with what is going on.  They are thriving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what I heard when I was campaigning and talking to these 
people in businesses in Lethbridge. They would really appreciate

their businesses, they would expand and they would start new

that.

kind of discussion that takes place once small business and

we have job creation in business?  What can we do to help our own

out the bureaucracy, ensuring there are incentives within

are the issues that I bring to the fore, that I share with my 
colleagues in the various forums and that the ministers use in 
their programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their programs are good examples of what we need to do and more

have heard from many other members, you enjoy the confidence of 
this House and we look forward to having you preside over some of 
these debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to take the opportunity to thank my 
constituents of Calgary—Nose Hill for their confidence in me and 
for returning me to this position as their elected representative 
in the Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take my duties to them very seriously and want to do a good 
job of representing their interests and of being their voice in 
these debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my constituents in Calgary—Nose Hill, a profound thank you 
and a commitment to them to act in their interests over the next 
term of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the opposition critic for Human Resources Development, 
a very large portfolio of government which handles and 
administers the social programs of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because social issues are extremely important to Canadians, we 
have a very important job as official opposition in this House to 
hold the government accountable for what it is doing on behalf of 
Canadians and for the administration of their security and their 
futures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians take very great pride in our country's social 
stability and in the security that we enjoy.  When we are sick we 
feel we can be looked after.  When we are old we have hope that 
we will have enough income to have our needs met and to have a 
comfortable life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are only two of many areas where Canadians are proud that 
there is not the want and the disadvantage and the need as in 
other countries of the world that are not as fortunate as we have 
been.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party places a very great emphasis on the social 
safety net for Canadians.  Reformers have children to educate. 
Reformers get sick.  Reformers have disasters happen where we 
become disabled and need additional assistance.  Reformers get 
old and want to have pensions.  We are vitally concerned as a 
party and as Canadians about this important area of Canadian 
society and Canadian life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of what we have been doing over the last 10 years in trying 
to emphasize and push Canadian governments into getting our 
economic affairs under some sort of rational control is targeted 
to sustain the social security we have enjoyed in the past and 
enjoy now.  Many Canadians see this security slipping away as we 
are crippled by debt, deficit, runaway programs, and waste and 
abuse of the resources of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The focus or end target of our strong fiscal message is security 
and sustaining of the social safety net we enjoy. Sometimes as 
Reformers we talk a lot about the means but not so much about the 
end which is vitally important to all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have a history of hard work, thrift, saving part of 
our income for a rainy day and investing for the future.  These 
characteristics were essential to the settlement, development and 
enrichment of this great country.  These characteristics are 
exhibited today by new Canadians, people who continue to come to 
this country from all over the world to become citizens of Canada 
in order to build strong futures for themselves and for their 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians also have a sense of fairness.  We like to see those 
who are disabled, disadvantaged or have experienced unexpected 
hardships succeed.  We like to see the young given a fair start. 
We like to see those who work, who contribute and who save be 
rewarded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians dislike waste.  They dislike seeing our tax dollars 
foolishly spent or abused.  Canadians dislike seeing those in 
greatest need receive too little from the rest of society while 
some with substantial means receive too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak for a party committed to a political process which 
reflects the views and interests of regular Canadians rather than 
the political elites, a party whose principles and policies are 
formulated at the constituency level and must be approved by the 
membership, a party that publishes its principles and policies 
called the blue book for all to read and to consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They know what they are buying when they vote Reform.  Often our 
policies and principles are distorted and misrepresented by 
opponents, but as we grow in maturity and in strength as a party 
more and more Canadians know the common sense and the solid 
policy underlying what we are doing as a party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also speak for a party whose leader consults with real people, 
not imaginary ones, about their interests and needs and has a 
long term vision for the country based on openness and 
compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform Party principles and policies support a secure and 
sustainable social safety net including secure retirement 
incomes, insurance against unexpected job loss, and promotion of 
research and educational excellence.  They ensure that families 
have the resources to care for their children.  Reformers 
strongly believe that social benefits must be focused on those 
who truly need them and must be delivered in a compassionate 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers also stress that programs must be soundly designed and 
managed.  They must be financially sustainable and administered 
as much as possible without huge bureaucracies, masses of rules 
and regulations such as supposed universal benefits which are 
then followed by complex clawback rules.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these traditional Liberal practices need to be reduced or 
eliminated.  Co-operative arrangements with provinces, 
communities and the private sector need to be encouraged and 
expanded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians and Reformers are realistic.  New realities emerge and 
Canadians see and understand them.  The Liberal Party and the 
government are slow to recognize new things and even slower to 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canada's opposition party, Reform has a duty and a 
responsibility to point out areas where the government is not 
adequately serving the interests of Canadians and to urge 
government to take corrective action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is failing to grapple successfully with 
at least three emerging realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is that Canadians increasingly understand personal 
income taxes in Canada are unjustly high.  The after tax income 
of Canadian families has declined by 7 percent since 1989.  This 
translates to a drop in the income of the average Canadian family 
since the Liberals were elected in 1993 of $3,000.  Yet the 
government continues to waste money and to think up additional 
non-essential programs while Canadian families increasingly must 
go without. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has failed to be specific or to 
demonstrate convincing determination about cutting taxes for 
Canadians, allowing them to keep their own resources to care for 
their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second reality is the consequences of Canada's federal debt. 
Liberal and Tory governments have gleefully borrowed everything 
they could get their hands on for the past 25 years.  Borrowed 
money outstanding now stands at $600 billion, with an annual 
interest bill of $46 billion.  This is the largest single item in 
the government's budget and it looms as a long term threat to 
Canadian social security.  It is a mortgage on our children's 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third reality is that Canada's social programs need reform. 
Many of them are badly designed, unsustainable and even 
dysfunctional.  The traditional Liberal, NDP and Tory approaches 
of throwing additional billions at problems is no longer a 
realistic solution, even though we see the government continuing 
to attempt to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are concerned by what they see happening.  How did we 
get into this fix?  Who was asleep at the switch?  How will our 
social programs be repaired?  Who will pay for the errors of the 
past?  What is reasonable and fair?  These are important 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about fairness for a moment.  Government revenues to 
pay for social programs such as educating the young or paying for 
non-contributory benefits for the elderly come largely from taxes 
levied on those who are working.  Canadians have always been 
willing to support the transfer of funds between generations. 
Intergenerational transfers, however, must be seen to be fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are the excessive EI premiums levied on workers and businesses 
today fair?  The answer in the minds of many Canadians is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the excessive tax hike and the resulting burden placed on 
generations <I>x</I> and even <I>y</I> fair?  Again the answer 
coming back is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government can be evaluated on many things including on how well 
it looks after the interests of all our citizens and how well it 
designs and manages programs, especially social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech led us to expect government legislation during 
the 36th Parliament on proposed changes to the Canada pension 
plan, the new seniors benefit, a national child benefit system, 
the Canadian Labour Code, as well as new programs for people with 
disabilities, youth training, education and employment, expanding 
opportunities for aboriginals and health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the key blocks in our social safety net affecting every 
working Canadian is the Canada pension plan, so I would like to 
talk about it for a moment.  The Canada pension plan has been 
with us since January 1, 1966 or almost 32 years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are in favour of a contributory public pension plan. 
That is assuming that such a plan is well designed and managed. 
Unfortunately the CPP is neither.  It is neither well designed 
nor has it been well managed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The combined contribution rate for CPP was just 3.6 percent of earnings 
for the first 20 years of the plan, moved up to 5.6 percent by the 30th 
year, and will be 9.9 percent prior to its 40th birthday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The architects of the plan promised Canadians that contributions 
would never exceed 5.5 percent.  Already we see a margin of error 
of 80 percent in the forecast of the contribution rate.  The 
inevitable conclusion is that the plan has been either badly 
designed or poorly managed, and in fact it is both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Designers made huge errors in their projections of birth rate, 
numbers of contributors and rates of economic growth.  The 
managers, subsequent Liberal and Tory governments, enriched 
benefits, added new benefits and invested the fund at low yields 
without adjusting contribution rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first beneficiaries of the CPP received benefits averaging 
over 11 times greater than the value of their contributions, 
while those entering the plan today will receive a return of less 
than one-half of the value of their contributions.  One 
generation receives a return over 20 times greater than another 
generation, and we have a difficult situation because of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform introduced a modern new redesign of this important plan 
which would provide good and fair pensions for all contributors 
at retirement.  Our plan calls for individualized accounts which 
means that individuals own all the assets in their account and 
can leave them to their survivors, while still protecting the 
benefits of retired and near retired Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If young Canadians knew that each dollar they put into CPP would 
go into their own personal account and that they would receive it 
all back, including a fair market return on their investment, 
they would gladly support the plan.  Our plan reduces 
intergenerational transfers which will become a major source of 
social stress.  We see that already beginning with the current 
debate on changes to the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our plan would be open and transparent.  Thus each individual 
would know the value of their assets in the plan at all times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transition from the present CPP to our super RRSP, which is 
what we have called our Reform plan, would take some time. 
Middle aged Canadians would have to be given options to stay in 
their present arrangements or transfer to the new plan.  Several 
countries have already made this transition and we believe Canada 
can do so as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am suggesting to the government is not to just keep going 
down the same old road of poor plan design and eventual failure 
and crisis but to look around, look at new ideas and adopt a plan 
that would deliver fairness to future generations of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole matter of the Canada pension plan will be debated in 
the House starting on Monday.  I urge Canadians who are watching 
the debate today, if they do not watch any other debate the rest 
of the year—and some of us wonder why they would—to watch the 
one on Monday.  It will affect every working Canadian, especially 
our children and our grandchildren.  It will be a very important 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The latest product of the Liberal spin doctors is the seniors 
benefit which we understand will be introduced in this 
parliament.  Apparently the program is designed partly by 
officials in the Department of Human Resources Development and 
partly by a number of focus groups under the direction of a 
political consulting firm.  The political consulting firm 
essentially gave the government advice on what was politically 
saleable, but it appears that no one provided advice on what 
makes sense for Canadian seniors, for Canadian taxpayers or for 
future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other things, in order to deliver extra dollars to the 
finance department so it could claim great success in its deficit 
fighting measures, some believe the tax back rates on this new 
federal seniors benefit will be irrational but certainly 
excessive.  It will force Canadians to change their economic 
behaviour in other ways to avoid this penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people change their economic behaviour and hide retirement 
income, it simply increases the load on government with more 
demand for social programs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measure will be debated in the House and I urge Canadians to 
be alert to these changes.  We believe there are many flaws in 
this proposed seniors benefit. For example, the provinces will 
lose a fairly large source of future tax revenue because the 
present old age security is taxable and the new seniors benefit 
is not taxable by the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Reform Party will work hard in the committee and in 
the House to ensure that the seniors benefit legislation is right 
for seniors, taxpayers and for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are seeking a fresh new vision and plan to replace the 
failed directions of the past. The Reform Party was formed 
because the old parties no longer serve our interests.  I am sad 
to say that includes four of the parties in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party was formed because the people want good jobs 
with good incomes as their best social security. They want 
generous help to be there for the disabled and those in need. 
However, they are fed up with programs that reward not need, but 
greed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Younger Canadians want affordable education and fairness in 
their tax load.  All of us want prompt, caring medical help when 
illness or accidents strike. We want a safety net if disaster 
befalls us, but believe we could better protect ourselves and our 
families against that if there was less government meddling in 
our lives, however well intentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is finding new and better ways to deliver these 
results for Canadians. We are seeking out the best thinking and 
creative alternatives, both here and internationally, to preserve 
the security and well-being Canadians want and deserve.  We will 
be a positive voice of new ideas and fresh directions as our 
country moves into the next century.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today we heard a member from the NDP talk about fairness

buzzword.  We know the buzzword of fair taxation from that party

corporate welfare bums and all the philosophy that goes with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, now there is a Reformer talking about fairness in tax

difference between the Reform approach to tax fairness versus the 
typical NDP approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is what is called

</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member just pointed out, the former debate was on what 
would be a fair transfer from people who have more resources to 
people who have fewer resources. There is now a shift on the axis 
of the debate because the transfers increasingly have been coming 
to Canadians who are older from Canadians who are younger and who 
are just entering the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The simple fact is that Canadians are an aging population right 
now.  Being one of them I hesitate to belabour the point, however 
it does need to be made.  By the year 2030 I understand there 
will be 40 percent more seniors than there are now.  That means 
that 40 percent more of the Canadian public will be looking for 
publicly funded pensions and seniors benefits that have been 
promised.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Forty percent more Canadians will be making increased demands 
on our health system. I have already noticed that as you get 
older a few rust spots appear and you need more body work.  This 
is one of the new realities we have been talking about.  There 
will be some real tension if we do not realize there has been a 
paradigm shift. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the generous social programs, older Canadians have 
had a lot of advantages that younger Canadians cannot even hope 
to have.  I urge the government to be very clear.  We need to 
sort this out and to balance it out quickly before there is some 
real social stress that will cause difficulty in our country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, does 
the hon. member really believe that we have tax fairness in this 
country, that the Conrad Blacks and other wealthy people pay 
their fair share of taxes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  They pay more than their fair share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Now they are saying they pay more than 
their fair share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member for Calgary—Nose Hill agree that the 
millionaires pay more than their fair share in taxes?  Does she 
agree with that position?  Is that the official position of the 
Reform Party, that the millionaires in Canada pay more than they 
should be paying?  Is that the kind of party that is representing 
people in this House?  How can that relate to the ordinary people 
in my riding that live in the inner core of the city, that are 
suffering from day to day to put milk and food on the table? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet here is the Reform Party saying that millionaires pay too 
much in taxes.  Millionaires pay too much in taxes is what they 
are saying.  Does she agree with her fellow member that 
millionaires pay too much in taxes, those poor Conrad Blacks, 
those poor Frank Stronachs?  Does she agree with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think I got the gist 
of the question in the first 30 seconds but I am sure with the 
additional rhetoric that we really got it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP unfortunately is really out of touch with reality.  NDP 
members keep going on and on about the Conrad Blacks.  The fact 
of the matter is there is a bare handful of individuals like the 
person referred to by the member.  These entrepreneurs and risk 
takers employ hundreds if not thousands of Canadians and pay 
enormous amounts of taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member cares to look at some of the figures from the 
government he will see that the top 10 percent of income earners 
in this country pay half of the taxes.  Mr. Speaker, do you know 
how much you have to earn to be in the top 10 percent of earners 
in this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  That's not true, Diane. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>   I hope the member is listening to 
me.  I hear some noise back there but I assume he does want to 
hear this information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be in the top 10 percent of earners in this country you have 
to earn $50,000.  If the member thinks that is big money then 
perhaps he should try to look at the cost of living.  The people 
in this country who earn $50,000 and more pay over half the taxes 
and they are in the top 10 percent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the NDP needs to be a little more realistic when it 
comes out with some of this— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Questions and 
comments, the hon. member for Provencher. 
<P><A NAME="LINK250"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
my pleasure to join this debate.  I have a two-part question for 
the member from Calgary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently it was reported in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> that the 
good people of Alberta had been consulted on the proposed 
spending changes by the Klein government.  I know that on the 
first round there were focus groups.  The second round of 
discussions occurred at a forum.  I saw people such as the former 
minister of finance, Don Mazankowski, as well as others, there. 
Average people from Alberta were consulted in this three day 
session.  The conclusion was that they advised the Government of 
Alberta not to go for tax cuts.  They said that they wanted 
instead more focus on health care and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having gone through this exercise in Alberta and consulted with 
the people of Alberta, does the member from Calgary agree with 
the conclusions of this conference that the people of Alberta do 
not want any more tax cuts, that they want expenditures in 
health?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are people wrong in their evaluation and how does she sit with 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure that 
Albertans would be too flattered to be classed in with Don 
Mazankowski as an average Albertan.  I am happy to correct the 
hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consultation with Albertans did not lead to the results and 
direction that he says they did.  The majority of Albertans in 
the consultation said that any surpluses in the Alberta 
government coffers should go toward paying the debt of the 
province.  They do not want a mortgage on the province, on our 
children and on our future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member may be referring to a particular group or interest 
lobby that held a meeting and came out with those other 
conclusions. There may be such groups, but the majority of 
Albertans in the consultation done with every household in the 
province came down four square for using that money to get rid of 
the mortgage on our future and our children's future.  This is 
the way Canadians across the country would want the government to 
act and I urge them to consider that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the average income in the hon. member's riding of Calgary—Nose 
Hill is about $63,000.  In my riding in northern Saskatchewan the 
average income is about half of that, but the high prices of 
living in northern Saskatchewan is a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four litres of milk in some locations in northern Saskatchewan 
cost $8.50.  To try and supplement people's education and future 
is sometimes out of touch.  Any hard time that we feel, there is 
always warmth and compassion with the New Democratic Party.  We 
will find this in history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the minister consider a fair and equitable portion of a 
tuition free education for all Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, warmth and compassion 
are good commodities but they do not put milk on the table.  What 
puts milk on the table is money and money comes from having a 
good job with a good income.  It also comes from having a fair 
tax burden so you can keep enough money to look after your 
family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thing that will not put milk on the table is the emerging 
multitude of government programs that take money away from 
working Canadians and leave little for them and their families.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion for an Address to 
His Excellency the Governor General in reply to his Speech at the 
opening of the session. 
<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is an honour for me, as the 
member for Papineau—Saint-Denis, to take part in this debate on 
the throne speech that marks the beginning of our government's 
second term in office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank my constituents in Saint-Michel, Villeray and 
Parc Extension for their vote of confidence, and I can tell them today 
in the House that I will make sure I represent them well and with the 
respect they deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new wind of optimism is blowing across Canada.  Canadians are 
feeling renewed confidence.  They are realizing that it is time to 
accomplish many things when governments and citizens undertake together 
to build a stronger Canada.  I am proud to be a member of a Parliament 
that, for the first time in 20 years, will see Canada achieve a balanced 
budget, a zero deficit, and eventually a surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This turnaround of the country's financial situation is the doing 
of Canadians all the way from Saint John's to Victoria, who rolled up 
their sleeves to regain their freedom to choose, which had been 
threatened by increasingly higher deficits. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together we progressed from what the international financial 
community once called a basket case to one of the most robust 
economies in the industrialized world.  We are poised to have the 
strongest growth among the world's largest economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we have not lost sight of the human needs of 
Canadians.  Canada's population is among the healthiest in the 
world and most Canadians enjoy a unparalleled quality of life. 
Both of these achievements, one social and the other economic, 
are testimony to the fact that we did not sacrifice our vision of 
Canada, a country that is strong and united, a country that 
values healthy children and strong families living in safe 
communities, a country where everyone believes in the dignity of 
work and the importance of self-reliance, a country in which 
young people have hope for a better future, a country where we 
share responsibility for each other, especially the most 
vulnerable among us, and a country where diversity is seen as a 
great source of strength. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a vision that inspires our government.  It is the vision 
captured in the Speech from the Throne. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to build a society that holds dear the 
fundamental values of equity and equality.  The pursuit of equity 
and equality enables Canadians to strike a balance in our twofold 
commitment to promote independence and responsibility to one 
another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, we do not believe a choice must be made between 
independence and responsibility to one another.  And as we 
progress, we must never lessen our vigilance.  We must never 
neglect any individual or any region.  This, to my mind, is the 
thrust of the throne speech:  Canada works for all Canadians and 
continues to evolve in response to the increasingly changing needs 
of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Minister of Human Resources Development, every day I see 
the interdependence of social and economic policy. 
They are in fact inseparable.  Economic growth does not occur in a 
vacuum.  It is a human activity.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has represented Canadians with an integration 
plan of action, a measured and deliberate plan.  It is a plan 
that invests in the social and economic priorities of Canadians, 
children and youth, health and knowledge, and it is a plan that 
respects Canadians' determination to see governments live within 
their means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our success depends on harnessing the energies of all Canadians, 
of all governments, federal, provincial and territorial, of the 
voluntary sector and of the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how we turn values into action.  We can continue to 
build a country of which we can all be proud.  This is how this 
government will continue to work to keep our country together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the new optimism is Canadians' renewed confidence in our 
capacity as a society to expand opportunity.  Young people are 
looking for jobs with a future.  Canadians with disabilities want 
the opportunity to participate fully in the economic and social 
life of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents are trying to give their children what they need to 
flourish.  Older Canadians want secure income support in 
retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Businesses, large and small, are trying to secure a competitive 
advantage in an increasingly global marketplace.  Men and women 
want an economy that creates jobs, not sheds them.  Canadians in 
all regions want to ensure that people in need are not forgotten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our last mandate we took action to deal with these issues. In 
this mandate we will add the essential building blocks that are 
already in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building Canada is the work of every day and it is the 
responsibility of all Canadians in every part of the country. 
That is why the Speech from the Throne stresses partnership. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A society that invests in its children can look to the future 
with confidence.  Renowned experts in child development have 
established a link between economic performance and investment in 
human resources and children, in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we fail to invest sufficiently in the early years of 
child development, the country's future economic prosperity may 
suffer in two ways.  First, economic growth may be frozen because 
the necessary human resources cannot be counted on.  Second, 
society may have to assume higher costs later on as a direct 
consequence of the failure to invest in the early years. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the prime minister and provincial and territorial first 
ministers made a commitment to improve the way governments work 
together to help children in poverty.  The 1997 budget announced 
the first down payment of the Government of Canada toward a 
better way of providing income tax benefits and services to 
children in poor families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new Canada child tax benefit is the federal government's 
contribution to a new and exciting partnership with provincial 
and territorial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national child benefit system will provide more support to 
low income families struggling to provide their children with a 
good start in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to work but our current support system produces 
some strange results.  Parents on social assistance can stand to 
lose thousands of dollars in benefits for their children when 
they make the decision to leave welfare for work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This built-in disincentive is called the welfare wall.  The new 
national child benefit will help tear down this wall.  Over time 
it will help reduce child poverty, strengthen families and enable 
governments to work further for Canada's children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to say that during the course of this mandate the 
Government of Canada will at least double its initial investment 
of $850 million in this innovative program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By investing in the national child benefit, Canadians are 
sharing the responsibility to get our children off to a good 
start in life.  They are helping parents get into the workforce.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will continue to work with provincial and territorial 
governments as they redirect some of their social assistance 
resources into complementary benefits and services to help 
children in low income families, especially the working poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By working together we are tackling a problem which no one order 
of government can solve alone.  We have achieved a most 
significant advance in joint federal, provincial and territorial 
social policy in the last 30 years. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech stresses the importance of co-operation in 
partnerships. The national child benefit represents the best that this 
type of co-operation has to offer. It is not a mere example of 
federal-provincial co-operation, but the result of efforts 
by governments of all 
political stripes, whether Liberal, New Democratic or Conservative, 
working together to improve the well-being of our children and prepare 
a better future for them. 
When I look at this remarkable achievement, I realize why Canadians are 
more optimistic. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money is only part of the answer.  Children need a large 
investment of time and attention for healthy development.  They 
grow up not just in a household but in a society.  They need 
strong families and they need safe communities, good schools, 
good health care and opportunities to develop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have begun working with provincial governments to develop a 
national children's agenda to improve the well-being of Canada's 
children. We will continue to do that with businesses, voluntary 
groups and unions, with aboriginal groups and communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This exciting new agenda will make a difference to the lives of 
hundreds of thousands of Canadian children, and by improving 
their lives we are laying the foundation for a better future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another key element of our plan is addressing the needs of 
youth.  Canada's young people are the best educated, the most 
literate and the most technologically adept in our history. Their 
potential is as limitless as Canada itself.  However, to succeed 
in today's economy young people need more education, better 
skills and relevant experience.  They have to be prepared to 
learn throughout their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of this fact let me share with the House three trends 
which have developed among young Canadians, as well as what the 
Government of Canada is doing to help them along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first trend is that a large portion of young Canadians can 
and will succeed on their own.  They are staying in school.  They 
are getting varied part time and summer work experience.  They 
are starting their own businesses, or perhaps they are doing 
voluntary community work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only assistance these young people will likely need is 
access to information which will help them make wise decisions in 
their education and career choices.  Through the government's 
youth employment strategy we can provide them with the 
information, services and support they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada will create a Canada-wide mentorship 
program.  This program is based on the success of local 
mentorship programs where a young person can get connected on 
line or in person with a mentor who has professional experience 
in the field the young person wishes to explore. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there are young Canadians who, after completing their 
studies, cannot find the work that would enable them to make a full 
contribution to society. Experience shows that when young Canadians are 
looking for that first job, they are confronted with a vicious circle: 
no experience, no job; no job, no experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why, we are providing, through programs such as our 
internship program and our summer student employment initiative, work 
experience for over 100,000 young Canadians, to make it easier for them 
to find permanent jobs. This is the boost they need to overcome this 
lack of experience and thus meet employers' requirements.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the hand up the Government of Canada and Human Resources 
Development Canada are prepared to give them. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a third group of young Canadians whose prospect of 
finding work in today's labour market has deteriorated 
dramatically.  These are young Canadians who have low levels of 
education and skills.  They need an opportunity to learn new 
skills such as literacy.  These young people require social 
supports that can best be provided by their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first step is equipping them with these basic skills.  Then 
they need their first job break. The Government of Canada can 
help them by bringing together those who can best provide these 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal of many of our programs such as youth service Canada is 
to work with community and voluntary organizations in assisting 
young Canadians who had previously lost hope to become 
self-reliant members of society, and we are doing our very best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Education is the key to success and we will work hard on 
post-secondary education to reduce barriers for so many of them 
with further changes to the Canada student loans program with 
increased assistance for students with dependants and new 
scholarships such as the Canada millennium scholarship endowment 
fund as announced by the prime minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also made a commitment to do more to see that Canadians 
with disabilities play a larger role in our economy.  I want to 
tap into the enormous potential of people who can and want to 
contribute to our economy and society but who do need some 
support to do so.  That is why we have committed to work with 
the provinces to redesign the vocational rehabilitation of 
disabled persons program so that it does what it is supposed to 
do, give Canadians with disabilities a greater opportunity 
to participate in the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also introduced the opportunities fund to further 
the economic integration of persons with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe very much in investing in Canada's human capital. 
These initiatives are tied together by a common thread.  They are 
about getting the best we can from Canadians and they are about 
giving the best we can to Canadians.  They are about balancing 
our commitment to self-reliance and our belief in mutual 
responsibility. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before concluding, I would like to add a few words concerning how 
well the issue of the renewal of the Canadian social union is 
progressing. Every day, Quebeckers tell me how satisfied they are with 
the progress made in renewing Canada's social union, of which a few of 
the main characteristics were mentioned earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to hear these comments, as they show that our 
approach is successful in ensuring the best quality of life possible for 
all our fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social union is an essential feature of Canada. It has 
contributed greatly to making Canada the best country in the world in 
which to live. 
A vast majority of Quebeckers would really like—as polls indicate 
time and time again—Canada to work efficiently and harmoniously, 
would like co-operation and partnership to replace unproductive fights 
and what I call federal-provincial turf wars, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social union is the ideal testing ground for our ability to 
work in partnership, modernize our programs, clarify the various roles 
played by the Government of Canada, share equitably our country's 
resources and strengthen our economic union. The various levels of 
government are also capable of reaching agreement when they are 
motivated by a clear desire to succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers are fully aware of the fact that no economic union is 
possible without a social union to give it harmony, structure and 
strength. In fact, true economic union and social union go hand in hand. 
That is why the modernization of Canada's social union is in the 
immediate best interests of Quebeckers and Canadians alike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, I find the Quebec premier's attitude toward the 
renewal of the social union deplorable. It is a marked departure from 
Quebec's traditional approach, from the grand tradition of Jean Lesage 
and Robert Bourassa, an approach traditionally characterized by a 
pragmatic approach, co-operation and striving toward results that will 
great benefit Quebeckers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne does chart a course for entering the 
21st century.  It calls on all governments and all Canadians to 
work together.  It provides a plan for investing in our future, a 
future that reflects Canadians' determination to build a society 
based on fairness and equality.  The cost of exclusion is far 
greater than the amounts we have committed to these programs. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope all the hon. members of this House will continue working 
with us for their own constituents and for all Canadians to ensure that 
our society remains not only one of the most prosperous in the world, 
but also one of the most progressive, most generous and most responsive 
to the needs of all its members, and the most vulnerable in particular.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to the 
Minister of Human Resources Development, and I noticed the tone he used. 
It was so melodious, it could almost be compared to a symphony 
orchestra. But it was not melodious enough to lull me, because it rang 
false all the way through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any observer of the Quebec reality can see that the Minister of 
Human Resources Development does not visit certain parts of Quebec very 
often. He carefully avoids those ridings he used to visit with his 
predecessor at HRDC. We all remember Minister Young—whom I can name 
since he is no longer a minister. There was also Minister Dingwall. 
Liberal members from the maritimes were all voted out of office, or 
almost. Poof, they disappeared just like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the member for Bonaventure—Îles-de-la-Madeleine, who 
played a leadership role in this House in the last Parliament and who 
backed the Employment Insurance Act, did not get re-elected either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It takes some gall to come and talk about the future and how 
Canadian society is the best in the world when there are now 500,000 
more children living in poverty than there were when the Liberals took 
office. It takes some gall on the part of a minister who is from Quebec 
to talk about the youth strategy and job creation. It takes some gall to 
talk about an even tighter social union and education, when, like this 
minister, one has sat in the National Assembly as an assistant to a 
former education minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But knowing all that, he discourses melodiously in both official 
languages, expecting us to applaud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end on a question that is still topical. In light of the 
questions that the House heard today on the subject of party 
fundraising, as a Quebecker, would the minister agree, yes or no, that 
the federal government should take Quebec's lead and pass legislation 
limiting the funding of political parties to that provided by 
individuals? That would save the Liberal Party's skin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I find it very interesting 
that my colleague opposite, a member of the Bloc Quebecois, is telling 
us what to make of the election results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out to him that our political party made 
gains in Quebec, while his lost 11 seats, dropping from 49 to 38, is in 
disarray, is rejected by our fellow Quebeckers, and now represents only 
a part of the province.  I think the member should be a great deal more 
modest in his analysis of the election results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must, however, thank him for his very kind comments about my 
speech.  He found that it was harmonious and elevated and had vision. 
I must tell him I am deeply touched by his kind words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy that my work follows in the great footsteps of the 
likes of Lesage and Bourassa. 
I draw his attention to the magnificent passage written by Claude 
Castonguay recently, taking Quebec's premier to task for breaking with 
Quebeckers' great tradition of pragmatism in matters of social union, 
for not following in the steps of people like Jean Lesage and Robert 
Bourassa, who worked for the well-being of Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I can reassure the member that, when it comes to current 
events, he has before him a minister who did his duty by informing the 
RCMP minutes after learning of certain allegations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to congratulate the minister on his remarks.  This 
minister is a very accomplished and distinguished minister who 
has set a tone of constructiveness in his government.  While I 
disagree with much of what he said, I believe that he is a 
constructive force for federalism in this country and I commend 
him on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This minister does talk a great deal about children and 
families, which is nice to hear.  Liberals do like to talk about 
those issues but the unfortunate thing is they do not like 
to act very much on them. In particular, this minister talked 
about the child tax credit, a commendable albeit very 
modest effort on the part of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask this minister if he thinks it would not be a 
laudable public policy for the government to pursue tax fairness 
for families, that is to say to remove the intrinsic penalty that 
exists in the current code against single income families, 
families that choose to keep one parent at home to raise their 
children.  There are millions of such Canadian families penalized 
by the fact that the child care deduction is limited to double 
income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the minister support measures such as converting the child 
care deduction into a refundable credit available to all 
families?  Would he also agree in principle to raising the basic 
spousal exemption in the tax code to a level equivalent to the 
basic personal exemption so that stay at home parents are no 
longer penalized by this government's tax code? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member 
for his very generous words about the work I am trying to do in 
favour of renewing Canadian federalism.  It is very generous of 
him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My job in the government is to provide programs and services to a 
number of people who are most vulnerable.  The Department of 
Human Resources Development has about six million Canadian 
clients to whom we are trying to give a break which will allow 
them to have a better quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There could be a number of other measures that he can certainly 
discuss with the finance minister but my job in the government is 
to provide certain programs and services.  I am glad that the 
member does actually recognize the benefit of the Canada child 
tax benefit. I was extremely sensitive to his remark about this 
maybe not being enough.  Maybe we could get the support of the 
Reform Party in order to do more with the Canada child tax 
benefit. 
<P><A NAME="LINK260"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was rather taken by the hon. minister's comments about 
the revenue departments of the provinces and the federal 
government working together.  That sounds like a partnership 
between John Dillinger and Lucky Luciano. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was talking about how literate Canadian youth are.  This is a 
bit of a contradiction because he also remarked about the 
programs to increase literacy in the population.  If he thinks 
Canadian youth now are more literate than they were in the past, 
I would say he is betraying his academic origins.  He is not 
aware of what is out there.  He has not tried to hire anybody 
lately, to try to find somebody who can write a coherent 
paragraph, who can spell and who knows a thing about grammar. 
That is not his department, that is for the provincial 
departments of education. However, I wish he would not make 
statements about the high degree of literacy of our population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the Canada millennium endowment fund, I 
understand that access to these funds is not going to be based on 
merit but on something called need which will be defined by the 
bureaucrats in whatever way they choose. 
Now if that is wrong I would like to be corrected.  If it is not 
based on merit then this thing is going to be a very useful 
educational tool because it means the young people will be taught 
at a very early age how to work the system the Canadian way.

Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will take great 
pleasure in addressing you.  You are a gentleman and I should 
have congratulated you on your appointment to the Chair when we 
began.  You know that I was very pleased by your nomination.  I 
must congratulate you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to clarify one thing that I said.  The gentleman 
does see a contradiction between two of my paragraphs.  I did say 
that this generation of Canadians is the best educated one.  It 
is the one that has developed the most skills in computers, in so 
many other technical aspects that were not available to us and 
they are doing well.  I am extremely proud of Canadian youth. 
They are doing well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not stop us from recognizing across the land that some 
youth unfortunately have not been well served in school or did 
not find in their families or in their societies the support that 
allowed them to go far enough in school.  Indeed there are 
problems related to illiteracy.  The government is committed to 
giving these youth a second chance.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Lotbinière and, 
following that, all Bloc Quebecois speakers will do the same with a 
colleague from our party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I have already criticized the government since the June 2 
election, this is my first formal speech in this new Parliament. While 
taking part in the debate on the address in reply to the throne speech, 
I want to thank my organizers, my supporters and especially the voters 
of Berthier—Montcalm, who have renewed their trust in me in a 
proportion almost identical to that of 1993. Thanks to them and to a 
wonderful team I have the honour of representing them once again in this 
House. 
They can count on my undivided attention, on my availability and on my 
friendship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must also thank my wife and my children for their support and for 
allowing me to be here to represent the Bloc Quebecois of course, but 
more importantly to look out for the interests of the Quebec people. In 
my way, I want to contribute, in this House, to the creation of a 
country that we can call our own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the throne speech, the Prime Minister said it would probably 
be the last one before the celebrations marking the new millennium. 
I will tell the Prime Minister—and I hope he will also make sure of 
it—that we will do our utmost to ensure that this is indeed the last 
throne speech before the next millennium. Because what we Bloc Quebecois 
members want first and foremost is to have a country by the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the throne speech tell us? Many things were said, but I 
can think of two essential points: first, all the allusions made in the 
two previous throne speeches of the Liberals to devolution, change, 
respect and realignment of federal-provincial powers have disappeared. 
These words are no longer used by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it started making cuts to transfers, to social programs, to 
health, to education and to social assistance, the government talked 
about devolution and about respecting the powers of the provinces.

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But today, because we are seeing that there may possibly be a 
budget surplus, because of the slashes the Liberal government has 
made in these programs and because the taxpayers are in the process 
of getting this government out of the red, now the Liberals are 
back to their old bad habits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the expected budget surplus, they are paying out big 
bucks for the right to trample over provincial jurisdictions.  I 
will not go into all of the examples there are in the Speech from 
the Throne, because my ten minutes would not be enough, but I will 
list three of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, they want to measure the academic readiness of our 
children.  Today is not the first time they are being told that 
education is none of their business. 
Mr. Duplessis did battle on this in 1950.  This is not yesterday's 
news.  It is not just those wicked separatists, that awful Bloc, 
who are demanding this.  It dates back to the fifties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also make no bones about wanting to get back into 
manpower training.  Yet I thought they had just handed that over to 
the provinces.  Now they want to make resources available to help 
young people get back in the work force.  That has no concern of 
theirs.  If they have money left over in their budget, let them 
give it back to the provinces from whom they stole it in the last 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also want to set up some ten or twelve programs with a 
national slant, what they call Canada-wide programs.  They have 
been told for more than 30 years that we in Quebec want nothing 
more to do with Canada-wide programs.  Programs from sea to sea do 
not apply to Quebec.  But they persist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where I come from, in my country of Quebec, we call that 
provocation.  This federalist propaganda whose aim is visibility 
over efficiency has caused the leader of the Bloc Quebecois to say 
justifiably in his response to the throne speech that the speech 
was nothing more than big federalist talk.  Unfortunately, that is 
the sad reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After bringing misery to the families of seasonal workers, 
after cutting payments to provinces and scuttling their budgets, 
the hangman becomes the generous lord of the manor distributing 
money over the heads of the provinces.  It is disgusting and 
hypocritical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the Liberal government is realizing that it cut too much 
and too quickly.  Why not analyze the situation seriously? 
Why, with the expected budget surplus, does it not mend its ways by 
returning the money it took from the provinces in the area of 
health care, social assistance and education; why does it not lower 
taxes, lower employment insurance contributions and reform personal 
and corporate income tax as proposed in the 35th Parliament, as the 
Bloc put forward in its proposal, which was well received? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not go after poverty with a vengeance, improve the 
employment insurance plan and reverse all the cuts that were made? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The repayment of the debt should be debated.  I agree with 
some members who have proposed a debate on the repayment of the 
debt.  I think we should have a very serious debate on the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the time being, however, the focus should be on health, 
education, employment and the eradication of child poverty during this 
36th Parliament. However, for this to be successful, the federal 
government should not meddle in these areas. It should give the money 
back to the provinces, as they know much better how to use this money 
where it is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second element of the throne speech that stands out in my mind, 
and it is of particular concern to me as justice critic, is the federal 
government's willingness to score political points by taking the hard 
line with Quebec. Why do I say hard line? Because the federal government 
intends to continue with its reference to the Supreme Court. It will 
carry on with its strategy of instilling fear about what might happen 
following a yes victory in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, the Liberals praise the merits of Canada, while on 
the other hand, they are trying to deny one of the most fundamental 
principles of democracy: the right to decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is worse yet, and this took place after the Speech from the 
Throne was read. At his swearing-in ceremony, responding to journalists 
who asked him if there were plans for the Canadian armed forces to take 
action in Quebec following a majority vote in favour of sovereignty, the 
new chief of defence staff, General Maurice Baril, did not reject the 
idea out of hand. 
The general said neither yes nor no, but that the political question 
does not arise.  He should have said, in a democratic country such as 
Canada:  “There is no question of it, it is a purely political 
question”.  This is very disappointing in a country that considers 
itself a frontrunner when it comes to democracy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are all the strong-arm tactics that are still going on with 
respect to the issue of Quebec's sovereignty, and to possible 
consequences for them as well as for us.  We never say that, the day 
after a yes vote, the first people interested in sitting down with 
Quebec would be my friends across the way. 
I will not say “my friends” because I do not want my constituents to 
hate me, but the government opposite would be the first, following 
telephone calls, probably from all the financiers in the world, to want 
to negotiate with a sovereign Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that upsets me about this throne speech is that the 
Liberals take credit for the entire Calgary declaration that Quebec is 
a unique society.  We are more than that, and have been for some time. 
This is not just nasty separatists, or nasty members of the Bloc 
Quebecois saying so. I will run through a short list of premiers of 
Quebec who, over the years, have said more than once that we were more 
than the Liberals wanted us to be, that we were a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1950, during the opening speech at the federal-provincial 
constitutional conference—because that is the second national sport in 
Canada—Maurice Duplessis said:  “Canadian confederation is a pact of 
union between two great nations”.  That was in 1950. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1960, Jean Lesage said that “provincial sovereignty must not be 
a negative concept incompatible with progress.  Quebec is not defending 
the principle of provincial autonomy because a principle is involved, 
but for the more important reason that it views autonomy as the concrete 
condition not for its survival, which is henceforth assured, but for its 
affirmation as a people”.  So said Jean Lesage in 1963. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1968, Daniel Johnson senior said that “a new Constitution should 
be so devised that Canada is not just a federation of 10 provinces, but 
a federation of two nations equal in law and in fact”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude with one last quote from Mr. Johnson, again at a 
federal-provincial constitutional conference, in 1968:  “The 
Constitution should not have as its sole purpose to federate 
territories, but also to associate in equality two linguistic and 
cultural communities, two founding peoples, two societies, two nations, 
in the sociological meaning of the term”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will understand that, in Quebec, we say no, no, no and no, as 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs would say, to the Calgary 
declaration.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to know is whether the Bloc Quebecois agrees with

in Canada pay too much income tax.  On the contrary.  The rich in 
Canada do not pay enough income tax. 
There is all manner of tax evasion.  Even more than that, when it 
comes to such extremely important aspects as money laundering, who 
gains from it?  Those with money.  Canada is recognized world wide 
as the world capital for money laundering.  What are the Liberals 
doing about it? Nothing at all.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am always interested in the comments of the hon. 
member, having worked with him in the last parliament on the 
justice committee.  I know the hon. member to be a lawyer. 
Therefore I am particularly interested in a couple of the 
comments he made pertaining to the position of the Bloc 
Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I believe he said—and he can correct me if I 
misunderstood him—was that somehow the Liberal Party was denying 
the democratic rights of the people of Quebec.  I wonder if the 
hon. member even recognizes what democracy is, in view of the 
fact that the people of Quebec have very clearly expressed in two 
referenda that they wish to remain in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me it is the Bloc Quebecois that refuses to accept 
the democratic will of the people of Quebec by continually 
ignoring the results of two referenda, going back and going back 
until it hopes it will eventually get the answer it would like to 
get.  It seems to me that is ignoring the democratic rights of 
the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a lawyer I would like the member to explain why he thinks it 
is inappropriate and incorrect to seek the opinion of the Supreme 
Court of Canada on matters of international law. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I too have worked with 
the member on a number of occasions and I can confirm that he is 
highly intelligent.  I do not understand why he is asking such 
questions today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two things.  First, I did not discuss the subject of democracy 
in the matter of the two referendums in response to the throne 
speech, but I am pleased to answer.  As regards democracy, yes 
there were indeed two referendums: one in 1980 and the other in 
1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1980, and here I will give a little course in history for 
those opposite who so quickly forget, the Prime Minister was Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau.  He told Quebecers to vote no for change. 
Quebecers voted no for change.  What change was there in Quebec? 
There was a constitution, which we rejected, which the National 
Assembly unanimously rejected, and which was jammed down our 
throats.  It was shoved down our throats with the words “Shut your 
trap, you Quebeckers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why there was another referendum in 1995.  In between, 
they had their referendum on Charlottetown, which he forgot to 
mention, in which English Canada said no to Quebec because it was 
too much, and Quebec said no because it was not enough.  They 
forgot that across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, there was another referendum where—let me finish, 
I will not be long—there was no winner.  It was 50:50.  Here 
again there were promises from the Liberals, which never led 
anywhere and never will, because the federal system cannot be 
reformed.  Quebec's only option is to vote yes in the next 
referendum, it is to become sovereign.

supreme court nor the government opposite can stop a people on the 
march toward its own country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new riding is the result of major changes brought on by the 
readjustment of electoral boundaries. 
The riding is now made up of some 50 municipalities grouped in five RCMs 
which I would like to salute. There is the RCM of l'Érable, whose main 
municipalities are Plessisville and Princeville which, incidentally, is 
celebrating the 150th anniversary of its founding; the rural section of 
the RCM of Bécancour, which includes the municipalities of Sainte-Sophie 
de Lévrard and Les Becquets; the RCM of Arthabaska, which includes the 
municipality of Daveluyville; and the RCM of Lotbinière, with its scenic 
municipalities located along the St. Lawrence River, namely Leclerville, 
Lotbinière, Sainte-Croix and Saint-Antoine de Tilly, and a municipality 
of the RCM of Chutes de la Chaudière, Saint-Lambert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to salute the small community of Joly, where I 
come from. 
Even though it only has a population of 1000, on June 2, I became the 
second citizen of that municipality to get elected as a member of 
Parliament. The first one was Adrien Lambert, who sat in the House of 
Commons from 1968 to 1979. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to comment on the throne speech, a document which 
includes no firm commitment, except for the sad fact that the federal 
government intends to become a very centralizing entity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This piece of federalist propaganda clearly shows the intentions of 
the current Liberal government: an unprecedented invasion of areas 
under provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of redistributing the surplus to the provinces, which were 
hit hard with cuts during the Liberal government's first term of office, 
this government is getting ready to ignore completely its so-called 
partners, the provinces, and hand this money over to citizens directly, 
with no regard for real needs in health and education, particularly in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, Quebec does not want a return to the era of Trudeau, who, it 
will be remembered, created a Ministry of Fitness and even a Ministry of 
Urban Affairs; all to hamstring the Lévesque government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois are going to fight to put a stop to this 
sinister plan by the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The financial decisions of this government have even been felt 
directly in my riding. 
On August 25, 1,000 people marched through the streets in support of 
keeping open a seniors' residence in Saint-Flavien.  The demonstrators 
did not understand why they were being forced to make this difficult 
choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason is very simple:  the federal government's cuts in turn 
reduce the amounts earmarked by the Government of Quebec for health care 
in Quebec.  We have here another Liberal government ploy: do everything 
possible to discredit the Government of Quebec, but Quebeckers are proud 
and will continue to support Quebec's sovereignty proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now draw your attention to employment insurance.  With all the 
changes introduced by the Minister of Human Resources Development, what 
used to be unemployment insurance has now become poverty insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, in both my riding offices, in Laurier-Station and 
Plessisville, I am getting calls from people. 
They are worried, anxious about the approaching winter.  They 
do not know whether they will still be eligible for employment 
insurance; fathers, single mothers, young people who have worked 
hard to get off welfare will find themselves forced back on to it. 
The present government supports this policy. That is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years, the Liberals and Conservatives have literally 
emptied the riding of Lotbinière of all federal services.  In 
Plessiville the Employment Canada office was closed, over local 
protests.  Now unemployed people, students, have to travel up to 
100 km to get services.  Another unacceptable situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the Liberal government to correct this error and 
to restore to my riding the services to which my constituents are 
entitled. 
I am asking it to correct the errors of the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether the Liberals or the Conservatives are in power makes 
no difference.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, we saw last week where the interests of the 
Conservatives lie, when their MPs and their leader, when the 
Conservative MPs from Quebec voted against the existence of the 
Quebec people. This is the party that wanted to win over Quebeckers 
during the last campaign by pretending to be there to defend our 
interests.  The Conservatives shed their disguises this past week. 
Now we know their true colours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised, moreover, to see how the Liberal government is 
copying from Quebec: partnership, drug insurance, youth employment 
strategy—copied from Carrefour Jeunesse-Emploi. Let me tell you, 
the day is not far off when the Liberals are going to start talking 
about the sovereignty of Canada. 
I understand them. Try to find two federalist who agree on what 
federalism means. It is impossible. They are still looking for a 
definition, which as years go by is becoming increasingly ambiguous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois, we Quebeckers, know what we want and 
where we are going. Year after year, René Lévesque's plan is gaining 
ground. Between 1980 and 1995, the yes vote in Lobtbinière went from 37 percent 
to 50 percent, and in the next referendum the sovereignist vote will be even 
stronger both in Lotbinière and across the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of provincial meddling will have to find a factor 
other than 50 percent in order not to recognize the next referendum in Quebec 
because there will be an overwhelming majority in favour of the yes 
side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to tell you that we have hope on this side. We know we 
will enter the third millennium as a country, Quebec. 
We will get out of this centralizing government which is shackling us. 
Quebeckers are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, they know that 
soon they will be free from the federal yoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, let me tell you what the Bloc's priorities will be for 
the years to come: Quebec, Quebec, Quebec, and Quebec. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK266"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
just a brief comment.  I listened with great interest to the 
points made by the previous speaker from the Bloc.  Those members 
often use, as did this member, notions of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed with great interest only a few days ago that the hon. 
member from the Bloc spoke about cuts to government funding and 
services.  He used great emotion and passion to make speeches 
that a sovereign Quebec would not have these kinds of problems. 
The poor would be taken care of.  The students who he talked 
about would have free education.  The thousand people who rallied 
in the streets would never occur in the promised land of the 
separatists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member would be aware that only a few days ago the 
rural municipalities of Quebec marched publicly to demonstrate 
against the premier.  In a very undemocratic fashion he was 
imposing, in an authoritarian way, cuts to the municipalities of 
Quebec and forcing them to make these changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Quebec media asked him whether he would relent on it 
because it was a crushing blow, notwithstanding the marching in 
the streets he said “Absolutely not.  I won't be deterred.  I am 
pushing forward”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member wants that gentleman to be the first 
president of Quebec, is that what the people of rural Quebec can 
expect from him and from the premier of Quebec? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am stunned to hear my 
colleague opposite talk about this kind of imposition when, since 1993, 
the Liberal government has unilaterally and savagely cut transfers to 
the provinces, which means that if Quebec wants to balance its own 
budget, it is forced to unload part of its fiscal responsibilities onto 
the municipalities. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say to him that if the federal government paid its 
dues, including the $2 billion for the harmonization of the GST and the 
billions of dollars we have been deprived of because of the cuts, not 
only would we not be short of funds, but we would not be doing any 
unloading onto the municipalities and the Quebec government would 
already have a balanced budget, even before you did, a budget that would 
be a lot stronger than yours. 
<P><A NAME="LINK267"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not 
know whether to laugh or cry this afternoon.  The “It's the fault 
of the federal government” tape is playing once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just make one correction to what my colleague said, 
and I will be doing this often.  There should be no talk of “we the 
people of Quebec”, because I am one of the people of Quebec and 
because 62 percent of the people of Quebec voted for a federalist party in 
the last election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, it is nice for the people of Lotbinière to have you here, 
but one thing is sure, you cannot talk on behalf of “we the 
people of Quebec”.  If you want to say “we the separatists” or 
“we the people of the Bloc Quebecois”, that is all right, that 
is your problem.  But we—myself and the people in my riding of 
Bourassa—are federalist and very proud to be Canadian and we 
voted over 66 percent for the no side.  The community is over 80 
percent francophone, and we too are “we the people of Quebec”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member.  I would like to know 
whether he agrees with his friends Guy Bouthillier of the Société 
Saint-Jean-Baptiste—another extremist—and Raymond Villeneuve, 
a former FLQ member who beats up people in Ville LaSalle in the 
name of an independent Quebec, when they said at a recent press 
conference: “We have to prepare, we have to raise an army in Quebec 
and be ready for any eventuality, we have to have our guns ready if 
need be”.  Does he agree with that?  Then, we can talk about 
democracy and decent things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will answer my colleage, 
the hon. member for Bourassa, by asking him a question.  Is he in 
favour of partition?  It is the whole debate about partition that 
is firing up passions in Quebec. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK268"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me begin by 
congratulating you on your appointment as our Deputy Speaker. I 
say to you how much I am going to enjoy working with you knowing 
that you will preside with a firm and fair hand over the workings 
of this Chamber.  I would also like to thank you for giving me 
the opportunity to respond to the Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would begin by saying how proud I am of the vision and the 
commitment to Canadians that we find outlined in the Speech from 
the Throne. I would like to say how proud I am to be part of a 
government that has found a way to at once reflect the priorities 
of Canadians but in a fiscally responsible way. I would like to 
say how proud I am to be part of a country Canada that is 
proceeding toward the 21st century with a renewed optimism, with 
a sense of hope and a sense of direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was only four years ago when we could not say these things, 
when that hope and that optimism was not part of the Canadian 
psyche.  It behoves us to reflect on how indeed we have come to 
the point of optimism at which we find ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest it has a lot to do with the way in which our 
government has partnered with Canadians.  I think of the work of 
my colleague the Minister of Finance and his decision to include 
Canadians in the budgetary process, to have them sit at the table 
in prebudget consultations to debate the issues that have faced 
us as we have come to be able to manage our difficult fiscal 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Engaging Canadians in their governance, including them, has 
allowed us to make the right decisions and has now brought us to 
a point where for the first time in 30 years our government can 
begin to think about the choices that we want to make to build a 
stronger Canada for the 21st century.

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have identified the priorities of Canadians, we know 
indeed that what they want is to be able to continue to live in 
what is one of the greatest countries in the world, to find ways 
and means of increasing the democracy that has become renowned 
around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the priorities that Canadians are asking us to address? 
They want the government to focus on children and youth.  They 
want the government to focus on our health care system, a system 
that has come to define us as a nation.  Canadians want us to 
understand work and innovation and how changes in work, and 
knowledge and new technologies are impacting our economy and our 
relationship with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But members can imagine how proud I am as the Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development that in the Speech from the 
Throne we also identify the priorities that Canadians put on 
aboriginal peoples.  Canadians want us to address aboriginal 
children and youth.  They want us to understand aboriginal health 
and the impact it is having on their communities.  Canadians want 
us to understand the relationship that aboriginal people have 
with work and innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians understand and 80 percent have told us in a 1996 Angus Reid 
poll that they want aboriginal issues to be high or medium 
priority for their federal government.  They believe that the 
status quo, our approach and our relationship with aboriginal 
people is not good enough and it must change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians understand when we talk about aboriginal children and 
youth that the demographics of indigenous communities are such 
that the populations are growing at twice the rate of 
non-aboriginal communities.  They understand that fully 60 
percent of 
the population in aboriginal communities is under the age of 25. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The circumstances that present themselves to indigenous people 
are like those that we faced as non-aboriginal Canadians in the 
fifties and sixties, but the hopes and the dreams that we had in 
the fifties and sixties are not the hopes and the dreams that 
aboriginal people have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we think about aboriginal health, Canadians know that the 
suicide rate for young aboriginals is upwards of five times as 
great as it is for myself and for members.  They know that the 
life expectancy for them is six or seven years less than it is 
for us.  They know that for aboriginal people the incidence of TB 
and diabetes is two to three times higher than it is for other 
Canadians and they do not accept this.  Canadians believe that we 
can and must do better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at work and innovation and consider the 
circumstances facing indigenous communities, we know that the 
unemployment levels are upwards of 83 percent.  We know that the average 
income is somewhere around $8,800 and falling.  The circumstances 
are not good and the status quo, our approach is not good enough 
either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have had the opportunity to cross the country and engage in 
conversations with other partners, other members of Canadian 
society who want to be part of a new relationship, I am 
optimistic about the strategies that our provinces and 
territories are focusing on.  They believe that by supportive 
methods, encouraging economic development and partnering with 
aboriginal people we can make progress.  They look at the changes 
they have made for example to their social assistance programs 
that have reduced the dependency and focused on building 
trampolines so that Canadians can be partners and participate in 
the economy.  They are saying we need to do the same for 
aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provinces and territories are understanding there is a role for 
them to play as we try to make life better for aboriginal 
Canadians.  The private sector has also been most encouraging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of B.C. Hydro and some of the strategies that the 
leadership and management of that company are engaging in to 
encourage a changed relationship, a stronger partnership with 
aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the BHP mining company.  We have diamonds in the 
north. The company that is opening that new resource understands 
it can build new resource models, new mining models that 
recognize that aboriginal people who are there on the land need 
to have access to the resources and benefit from these new riches 
that are now going to be part and parcel of this Canada we know 
and love.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal people themselves believe that we need a new 
relationship.  They believe that the structural relationship the 
federal government has had with them is not good enough. Their 
commitment to this change is probably no clearer anywhere than in 
the royal commission's report on aboriginal peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not had a chance to publicly congratulate the 
commissioners of that report and I am glad to have the 
opportunity to do so now. There are different interpretations of 
the royal commission's report on aboriginal peoples.  For me 
having read it and understood it, the underlying message that 
comes out of that impressive piece of research and documentation 
is that there needs to be structural change in our relationship 
with indigenous people here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioners identify that it is no longer acceptable for 
us to continue in a paternalistic way, to provide only programs 
that create dependency.  They provide for us a model of a new 
relationship.  It is very important.  It says we must begin by 
mutually recognizing the existence of each other.  We must add to 
that a mutual respect for our similarities and our differences. 
But very much a part of that model are the words responsibility 
and sharing. The fiduciary responsibility that we have as the 
crown with aboriginal people must be reflective of responsibility 
and sharing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are very important initiatives.  The work of the royal 
commission can serve to guide us as we flesh out and build a new 
framework for the relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not starting from ground zero.  At this point I would 
like to reflect on some of the very important initiatives that 
were introduced to this House and in our relationship by the 
former Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, the 
Hon. Ron Irwin.  That minister identified that we did have to 
change our relationship.  One of the most fundamental initiatives 
he undertook was to push us toward understanding the inherent 
right to self-government that aboriginal people have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This belief is founded on an understanding of the treaty 
relationship, this very sacred relationship that the crown has 
with First Nations.  When people ask me what it means to be 
Canadian, I can tell them to look to our very beginning, to look 
to the early days when the British and the French landed on the 
shores of our country and met the First Nations, the indigenous 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was our approach?  It was not an approach that took us to 
war.  It was an approach of peace.  It was an understanding that 
through treaties, through a partnership we could all live in this 
great land and benefit and be productive.  That treaty 
relationship is fundamental because it recognizes that when my 
ancestors came here there were governments that were working 
effectively and providing for their people.  We agreed to write a 
treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In understanding that, and in reading the report of the royal 
commission and in understanding how we are going to make life 
better for aboriginal Canadians we know they have to have 
concrete autonomy.  We have to return jurisdiction so that as 
they find solutions for education, as they find solutions for 
housing, they will be reflective of tradition, of the aboriginal 
tradition, the beliefs, the attachment to the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have increasing numbers of indications that this approach is 
working.  Not only are we restoring the treaty relationship in 
provinces like Saskatchewan and Alberta but in provinces like 
British Columbia where we did not get around to writing treaties 
we are now writing modern treaties.  I look to the Nisga'a 
agreement and the strategies that are in place there to build a 
strong relationship between the people of that First Nation and 
this country Canada. We go to the Yukon where we have indeed 
signed self-government agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First Nations are joining together in appropriate ways to build 
communities that are large enough to have the capacity to 
structure important models of governance that will help build a 
strong future for their people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other initiatives which were implemented by the 
government reflective of the structural change.  We have to 
target and improve the capability of aboriginal communities to 
support themselves.  The models we build have to be reflective of 
that responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our new housing strategy that issue of responsibility is 
clear.  In partnership with the CMHC money is available. The 
aboriginal people make contributions to the development and 
building of these homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We focus on economic development.  We recognize that the old 
model of social assistance, a tool of dependency, is not good 
enough.  The modern tools of economic development are ones which 
we have to focus on and to ensure that aboriginal people have 
access to the resources that have made this country great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the relationship of building strong aboriginal 
government with a focus on developing the capacity for a 
transparent and accountable aboriginal government.  The 
importance of this is to ensure that improvement in First Nations 
communities will be seen, will be tangible and will reflect the 
needs of the members of those First Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to understand that we need to build a new fiscal 
relationship structurally different from the one we have now and 
more reflective of the need for predictable funding in an ocean 
of fiscal transfers.  We have to explore the strategies of own 
source of revenues and taxation.  We have to challenge ourselves 
to include aboriginal people's access to resources, mining and 
forestry so they something with which to develop and grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am encouraged by what I see, by the comments and the 
directions of the leadership of our First Nations and aboriginal 
people.  I am optimistic of the strength of partnerships that we 
can build between the federal government and the aboriginal 
people, including other partners such as the provinces, the 
territories, the private sector and individual Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe there has ever been a time such as now for us 
to find solutions, modern solutions, to a circumstance that none 
of us is particularly proud of, a history and a relationship that 
must change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister I am but a facilitator.  I am one partner.  Our 
challenge as members of this House will be to understand the 
roles that we as individuals can play in bringing our communities 
together, municipalities with First Nations.  We can find 
strategies that we can share and that will be effective and 
responsible, knowing that this is the best country to live in not 
only for non-aboriginal Canadians but for aboriginals as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore the members of the House to work with me as we 
identify a new framework, a new capacity to work productively, 
proactively and strategically together with First Nations 
leadership, to build a new relationship and a strong future for 
all Canadians.

thank the minister for her very impassioned comments.  They are 
consistent with some of the comments we heard from the minister 
earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find these people speak from their heart.  They have the 
ability to paint a picture which they believe in but which I do 
not think it is quite accurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask that they consider allowing the Canadian people to be the 
ones who paint the picture.  The presentations which I heard this 
afternoon, as a new member in this House, seem to imply that we 
have arrived, we are there, as a Canadian people and it is now 
time to move on to new government programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point to the throne speech with 29 new spending initiatives 
and very little reference to paying down the debt or relieving 
Canadians from the tax burden they carry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that they are talking about more government 
investment. We have had years and years of government investment 
and that has not done it for us.  I am concerned when they talk 
about partnerships, because government partnerships mean that 
somebody is left out of the partnership.  Usually the one left 
out of the partnership is the struggling entrepreneur whose tax 
dollars are paying for one who is allowed into the partnership. 
This is not going to stimulate the innovation and entrepreneurial 
drive that was referenced in the throne speech.  It is 
counterproductive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Liberals to consider what the Canadian people are 
saying and I refer them to one of their own recent polls done 
by Earnscliffe that points out that 57 percent of Canadian people feel 
the government has done a poor job in reducing government 
waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also point out that the number one priority for 
Canadians from the government's own survey is the reduction of 
government spending.  Yet we have a throne speech with 29 new 
spending increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to encourage the minister and the people on that side of 
the House to stop misleading the Canadian people with the picture 
that we have arrived. I would be much more encouraged if I had 
heard a much stronger commitment in the throne speech to 
relieving my grandchildren of the burden of this national debt, 
giving my children the opportunity that tax relief would allow 
them in a more innovative and entrepreneurial environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart:</B>  Mr. Speaker, fundamental to the Speech 
from the Throne is the underpinning that we have to build 
strategies and programs that are reflective of our fiscal means 
and which accommodate our resources.  We have not gone through 
four years of very difficult times to forget that everything we 
do must be affordable and reflective of the fiscal reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remind the hon. member that the role of government is not 
to balance the budget as an end in itself. The role of government 
is to respond to the needs of Canadians, to make life better for 
Canadians.  I suggest to him that the approach and the strategy 
we have provided allow us to take very serious account of our 
fiscal reality, of the resources available to us to make sure we 
do not ever again spend too much, but to reflect the needs of 
Canadians and make choices that are reflective of Canadian 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A hallmark of the government has been our capacity to understand 
and ensure ourselves of the priorities of Canadians and to show 
that we can respond to those in a fiscally responsible way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the aspects the hon. member reflects are part of the Speech 
from the Throne except for the understanding that the management 
of the deficit and the debt is not an end in itself.  Managing 
those is instrumental and a requirement for us to continue to 
build a great country and respond to the needs of the people of a 
great country who want to continue to have the best country in 
the world in which to live.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with great 
interest to the remarks by the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development. The tone was excellent, the kind of tone that befits the 
issues she intends to defend. I had the opportunity to hear her speak on 
other occasions, outside this House, and she displayed on those 
occasions the same attitude she is displaying today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if it comes from being a woman, but her image is 
completely different from that of the former Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development, who came across as very aggressive. This makes 
for a welcome change. 
I agree with everything she said, for instance, about poverty among 
aboriginal people in Canada, about health, suicide and so on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true. I know because, when I was sitting on the human 
resources development committee in the early part of my former mandate, 
I saw the problems she is talking about. However, the royal commission, 
which tabled an extensive report, indicated huge amounts are involved. 
I think she had better say whether or not she is prepared to go as far 
as recommended by the royal commission on Indian affairs. Is she 
prepared to act on the commission's recommendations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of understanding and this understanding attitude I 
welcome—we really need it in this House—is the minister prepared to 
recognize, in the same positive and open manner, that we are a people? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned in my 
comments, the work of the royal commission is a tremendous body 
of knowledge which is valuable not only to me as the minister 
responsible for Indian affairs but to other partners as well, the 
provinces, First Nations and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the over 440 recommendations that are a part of 
that document, really only 89 are strictly under the purview of 
the federal government.  They are much more far reaching and 
broad than saying that the federal government has this and this 
to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, while many people have different definitions of the 
work of the royal commission, fundamental to that work is a clear 
indication that the structural relationship has to change.  The 
way we have worked together in the past has not provided us with 
the benefits one might expect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their message is that we have to be much broader.  We have to 
include more people in solving the difficulties which face our 
aboriginal Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sense is that if we partner together effectively, if we 
build a relationship with First Nations and ask for their input 
and advice on taking the recommendations of the royal commission 
and building a plan of action together, engaging the provinces 
and the private sector, including Canadians in that process, we 
will find the solutions we need to ensure that aboriginal people 
are able to benefit from the wealth and prosperity of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK271"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is 
the first opportunity I have had to stand in the House.  It is a 
bit of an intimidating experience. I congratulate you, Mr. 
Speaker, on your appointment and the minister on her new 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The appointment as Conservative critic for Indian affairs and 
northern development is an appointment I take very seriously.  I 
think we should all take a moment to reflect on the 
responsibilities of a critic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The responsibility of a critic is not just to jump to their feet 
every time the government stands, or rather sits; the 
responsibility of a critic, number one, is to be positive and, 
number two, to look for defects in what the government is saying. 
Certainly a critic has an innate responsibility to be responsible 
in their comments.  I am not sure that is always recognized in 
the House.  It is something we would all look forward to seeing a 
bit more of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were a few comments made by the hon. minister about the 
royal commission on aboriginal peoples.  There were many good 
points brought up by that commission.  There were also some 
negative points.  The fact that we are individuals gives us the 
ability to disagree with certain points and to agree with certain 
points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a few things the minister referred to which bear 
reflecting on again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a number of statistics.  When we hear the word 
statistics we quite often lose sight of the fact that those 
statistics involve people, men, women and children.  They are not 
just numbers in somebody's book.  We are dealing with human lives 
and futures.

<A HREF="#LINKT90"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they understand that they are dealing with over 600 First 
Nations' communities, that there are a lot of pressing problems, 
that there is rampant child poverty, that 30 percent of the aboriginal 
community is under the age of 15 years, as politicians, if they 
do not understand anything else about that, they will understand 
that many of them will vote in the next election.  There is a 
long journey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of points we should not forget.  We have to 
proceed on this and we have to proceed together.  We have to keep 
the principles of accountability and transparency, which were 
mentioned in the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can do three things.  We can stagnate.  We can continue to do 
what we have done.  We can stand still and not move forward or we 
can move forward together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the comments of 
the critic of the Conservative Party and thank him for his 
intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He reflects precisely my point of view, that indeed we, as 
members of Parliament, have a role to play in building with First 
Nations the strategies for the future.  I look forward to working 
with him as we work together with First Nations to find that 
framework. 
<P><A NAME="LINK272"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me 
congratulate you on your appointment to your new job. We actually 
did not think this was going to happen until we occupied the 
other side of the House.  I am sure that you bring expertise and 
fairness to the position.  I look forward to a long tenure with 
you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am congratulating and thanking people, I would certainly 
like to thank the people of the grand old constituency of 
Wetaskiwin for returning me to the House of Commons for the 
second time. This is a real endorsement of our party's policies, 
our leader and our platform.  If I may be so bold, it is probably 
an endorsement of myself as the candidate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That did not come about strictly by accident.  It came about as 
a result of a lot of hard work.  I would like to thank those 
people who spent so much time, effort and shoe leather getting me 
elected.  They did an exemplary job and I would like to recognize 
them here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was going around in my constituency during the election 
campaign, I talked to a lot of people in the coffee shops, on the 
doorsteps and on the farms throughout the constituency. Their 
concern was that they felt they had more government than they 
could afford, that the debt was certainly a huge problem, that it 
was a millstone around Canadians' necks.  They told me that they 
would like a fresh start.  Coincidentally, that is exactly on 
what we campaigned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, it is incumbent on us to do our utmost to give 
Canadians a fresh start and to ease the tax burden.  As the 
labour critic for the Reform Party, I noticed that the throne 
speech was sadly lacking in the area of labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being a farmer, labour as it relates to me most directly is in 
the shipment of grain to port.  Of course, a lot of other 
products have to go to port.  We discover that these shipments 
can be interrupted either through work stoppage, that is a strike 
or a lockout. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was most disappointed that the government did not take an 
opportunity to put into the throne speech some sort of final 
offer selection dispute settlement mechanism.  I think this is of 
utmost importance. The loss of markets that we suffer each time 
there is a work disruption is an immeasurable commodity. 
Although we can measure certain amounts of lost markets, we 
cannot measure the entire impact on the economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, if it is not too late I wish to inform the House 
that I will be sharing my time with the member for Calgary West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the amendments to the Canada Labour Code?  We expect 
them to be tabled in the House very soon.  Those amendments would 
be an excellent opportunity to see a final offer selection 
arbitration settlement mechanism take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This mechanism would affect about 700,000 federal workers, 
people who do not necessarily work for the federal government but 
who come under the jurisdiction of the federal labour code.  That 
represents about 10 percent of the Canadian workforce.  These people are 
mostly involved in the movement of goods, services or capital. 
They are people who work in the airline industry, the banking 
industry, the railroads and the post office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think it is of utmost importance that we have a mechanism to 
settle these disputes and yet we are not getting any kind of 
co-operation from the federal government. The federal government 
will use final offer selection arbitration once they have 
legislated either a locked out group or a struck group back to 
work. If it is good enough to use after these people are 
legislated back to work, then why not make it available to the 
parties before the work stoppage starts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would that work?  The parties involved would agree on who 
their arbitrator was.  They would present to the arbitrator the 
matters that were agreed on, the matters that are outstanding and 
their final position on those outstanding items.  The arbitrator 
then would choose all of one position or all of the other 
position, no compromise position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me, this is a tool that can be equally used by labour or by 
management.  If it is used to its ultimate, as I have said in 
this House many times before, it will not to be used at all. 
Both parties know that they have to bargain in a most earnest 
situation. They have to arrive at the best possible bottom line. 
There would be no fudging, no hedging, just the bottom line. If 
they do not, then an arbitrator can be imposed on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people have said this takes away the right to strike and 
disrupts and interferes with the bargaining process. Quite the 
contrary.  Groups that are either locked out or on strike will 
have their bargaining process far more compromised through back 
to work legislation than they ever would with final offer 
selection arbitration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was most disappointed that we did not hear any mention of this 
during the Speech from the Throne.  It is high time we adopted 
this.  As I mentioned, Bill C-66 as it was known in the last 
Parliament, died in the Senate.  Therefore I expect that the 
minister will reintroduce it in the House in the coming weeks.  I 
am going to push very strongly to see that there are some changes 
made along the lines of final offer selection arbitration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is in a global marketplace.  We have to establish our 
reputation as a reliable supplier of goods.  Not only do we have 
to supply the best possible commodities, which we do, there is no 
problem with that, but we have to supply them on a regular, 
consistent and reliable basis.  If we do not, our customers are 
certainly going to be looking elsewhere. 
It is like being in the supermarket business, if it is not on the 
shelf, it is pretty difficult to sell.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking forward to seeing the bill come back to the House 
for debate, which I am sure will be any day now, at which time we 
will be addressing it and making all sorts of improvements to it, 
not the least of which is final offer selection arbitration. 
<P><A NAME="LINK273"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
was quite intrigued by the comments of the member opposite on the 
approach of final offer selection arbitration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member opposite has any data on the results of 
final offer arbitration or arbitration awards generally.  Do they 
generally tilt in favour of the union or do they generally tilt 
in favour of management? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The data that I have seen most recently indicated that 
arbitration tends to tilt in favour of labour. That may be a very 
good thing, but if one is looking at cost, if one is concerned 
about the fiscal ramifications, I wonder if the hon. member has 
any information which would indicate that arbitration tends to 
tilt one way or the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that certainly opens up a 
great debate.  We could probably talk about that for some time. I 
agree that I have seen some information which tends to indicate 
that final offer selection arbitration tends to favour labour 
slightly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, every work disruption and every strike results in 
labour getting some improvements in its situation, either in 
working conditions, benefits or wages.  I think that while some 
of the information does seem to tend to favour the unions, it 
would at least settle a strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having to take the drastic step of passing back to work 
legislation, which, by the way, some government members have 
already decided, and have said so in the newspapers, is the way 
to handle the postal strike which has not happened yet, will have 
a tremendous detrimental effect on the bargaining process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have some apparatus in place that is an item that 
either labour or management can put in its tool box and require 
them to bargain this situation right down to the nitty-gritty. 
<P><A NAME="LINK274"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I must 
commend the member.  The president of the United Food and 
Commercial Workers Union president, local 832, would be pleased. 
He was instrumental in bringing into law in Manitoba that 
settlement process. It was immediately repealed by the 
Conservative government because he was right.  It kept parties 
honest and the Conservative government and employers had a 
problem with that.  Without question, it was a process that did 
keep people honest and it did favour labour because government 
and employers were being dishonest in their negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did not hear a question 
there but in reply to my colleague's comments, I can only 
underscore the need to have some sort of process in place to 
encourage the parties to come to an agreement on their own.  A 
negotiated settlement is probably the best settlement.  There is 
no probably about it, it is the best settlement.  Any time that 
two parties can negotiate and settle their differences without 
any interference from outside is the best way to go.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
honoured to rise to address the Speech from the Throne, this 
being my first speech in the House.  I wish to thank the voters 
of Calgary West for choosing me to be their voice in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one drives east along Bow Trail toward city centre one 
cannot help but admire the concrete and steel of Calgary's new 
downtown rising up toward the blue sky of Alberta.  One has to 
marvel at Calgary's energy, her productivity, and take note of 
how the city has grown and prospered.  No matter how many tax 
dollars, government jobs or military bases Ottawa has deprived 
Calgary of, we still have a low unemployment rate, low taxes and 
a hunger for Canada's lowest income tax rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The meaner Ottawa gets, the leaner Calgary becomes.  We now have 
a city that thrives upon private industry, not the fat of the 
federal government.  I am proud to represent a city that still 
exemplifies the pioneer spirit from the roughnecks who drill for 
oil to the settlers who moved west in horse drawn carts made of 
wood.  Indeed my own family moved west around the turn of the 
century to plough its section of land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of my family, I would like to thank mom and dad along 
with all the others who helped in my election.  I have my father 
to thank for my start in politics.  He would let me stay up past 
my scheduled bedtime, but only if I watched the evening news with 
him and answered questions about what I had observed, to which he 
often offered the right political spin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell the House a story about when I was in diapers.  A 
mess began to develop.  It got worse over time.  Nearly $700 
billion later we call it the accumulated national debt.  The man 
who started the mess was Pierre Elliott Trudeau.  When I look 
across to the Liberal benches I see some of his accomplices.  The 
current prime minister was Trudeau's minister of finance and 
under Trudeau he learned to spend, indeed he liked to spend.  He 
taxed and he spent until his heart's content, so much so that he 
still cannot wean himself from the nasty habits he developed 
under the man who started the wave in Salmon Arm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then came the mandarin from Manitoba, the whiner from Winnipeg 
who now lavishes upon himself as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
He has begged for political pork, dined diplomats and grovelled 
for government goodies.  Who could forget the hyena from Hamilton 
who shrieked and shrilled her way under the public's skin and who 
is now eligible for her $2.8 million gold plated MP pension plan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about the department that just grew and 
grew.  His bureaucrat parents named him manpower and immigration, 
but their own rules made his first name politically incorrect so 
they changed it to citizenship and immigration.  The bureaucrats 
kept on feeding him and tending to his every gurgle, burp and 
expansion.  They proudly watched as their pet department grew 
into a strapping example of government largesse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a right of passage they named him employment and immigration, 
a title that made the bureaucrats burst with pride, but even the 
bureaucrats noticed that their fully grown program had developed 
a nasty streak.  Instead of solving the problems he was created 
to solve he actually made them worse.  Unemployment was 
permanently doubling that of our neighbours to the south. 
Multiple generations of families were beginning to get hooked on 
the spiralling dependency that he was pushing.  The bureaucrats 
changed his name to human resources development, but they could 
not hide what had happened.  Their little pet had grown into a 
$57 billion monster.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members are probably asking what went wrong when the monster 
roamed unchecked across the land.  The government renamed 
unemployment insurance, employment insurance, but that did not 
change the want for work or make good on its 1993 election 
promises.  The government tossed out band-aids, candies and 
bromides, but it got a bad case of inaction when it came to 
repairing the structural problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, UI charges repeat claimants the same premiums as 
someone who works but has never collected.  No actuarially sound 
insurance plan would have high risk users pay the same or even 
less than low risk users.  Even more UI is distributed 
disproportionately according to region.  Nova Scotia alone has 
five different regions of eligibility.  People living and working 
within an hour of one another have different eligibility 
requirements.  This begs a question.  Does the government have 
credibility on the jobs issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have presided over the highest level of 
unemployment in recent history.  They are now into their 82nd 
month of unemployment above 9 percent.  UI has become a payroll 
tax with overpayments now over $7 billion per year.  For the 
average Canadian worker that amounts to $400 a year in 
overpayments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A total of close to $14 billion has been hoarded by the Minister 
of Finance so that he can gloat about deficit reduction.  He even 
brags about his 43 tax increases and how he has taken $26 billion 
more from us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about an insurance program that is actuarially sound and 
free from political interference?  How about at least lowering 
the payroll tax that kills jobs?  Alas, there is more program 
mismanagement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we trust the Liberals with our pensions?  Canadians under 35 
years old do not believe we will have a pension.  Why?  Because 
the government has dug an unfunded pension liability of over half 
a trillion dollars.  That is why the government is so gung ho 
about RRSPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the Canada pension plan survives Liberal mismanagement, 
people my age will receive less than a 50 cents return on every dollar 
they throw into it.  The government is ripping off young people. 
They want to take 10 percent of our wages for a program that will 
not be around when we need it.  If CPP did survive under Liberal 
mismanagement it would only pay out $8,800 per year, even with 
maximum contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast the same contributions invested at a 6 percent rate of 
return, the numbers the government claims for the CPP, would 
create their own pension yielding $26,000 per year. Please do not 
ask us to trust the government.  Let us opt out of its pyramid 
scheme and wrest our money from its corrupting grasp. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet I fear there is even more.  The Liberals pride themselves on 
the political machine vote buying tactics.  Why they even preened 
about increasing the size of the bureaucracy by 3,000 temporary 
bureaucrats with $90 million of taxpayer money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there was the billion dollar student handout.  For every 
single student this handout is intended to help, the program 
hurts nine more.  Increasing debt or the size of government and 
taxes only deprives young people of work.  Young people want 
structural repairs that will create real jobs, not promises that 
result in less work and higher taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cut taxes to stimulate investment, growth and jobs.  Stop the 
pyramid scheme to burden young people with pension debt.  Link 
student loans to social insurance numbers.  This would reduce 
default problems and therefore increase the likelihood and dollar 
value ceilings on private sector student loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This story of the department that grew and grew reminds me of 
three questions that all politicians should ask before they start 
feeding a program.

</I></B></P><P align=left>First, how much should it cost?  Second, does it benefit all 
Canadians or cater to a special interest?  In other words, is it 
just a narrowly focused vote buying tactic?  Third, would fellow 
Canadians vote for the program if the question was put to them? 
<P><A NAME="LINK276"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener—Waterloo, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, let me congratulate the hon. member for Calgary West on 
his maiden speech.  Let me also disagree with the content of much 
of his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of reforming the Canada pension plan, there was an 
accrued liability and we could not afford to continue on a pay as 
you go basis.  Reform of the Canada pension plan was put in place 
by the federal government with agreement from the provincial 
governments.  It is important to note that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that the Reform Party, in its policies, would get 
rid of the Canada pension plan.  It was to turn it into a super 
RRSP.  If the people happened to have Bre-X in their super RRSPs 
they would retire with no pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear that Canadians on the whole want the Canada 
pension plan.  It was the subject of the election campaign.  The 
plan will be there for younger Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today I talked about spending some money, and I am proud 
of it.  One of the things I talked about spending money on was 
students, universities, research and development.   I think the 
member, when talking about spending money, should focus on the 
program.  The University of Waterloo and Sir Wilfrid Laurier 
University are in my riding, as well as Conestoga College. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sure, that is spending money, but it is also investing in the 
future of our young people and in the future of our country. 
Hopefully the member can make the distinction.  Most members of 
the House were not here prior to 1993.  I think he should also 
acknowledge that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad the member opposite 
admits that the CPP needs reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also talked about how the plan was improperly set up in the 
first place, in a sense, and admitted basically that it was a 
pyramid scheme.  At least with that I say he is beginning to 
address the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he talks about investment does he really mean squandering? 
With the money that has been put into the plan, he and his party 
have run up a half trillion dollar debt.  The Fraser Institute 
puts the number at $1 trillion.  His own government puts it at 
over $500 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who am I to trust?  Am I to trust the members across the way who 
have done such a poor job with the money they have been entrusted 
with, or am I to trust the people themselves to look after a 
plan?  I would trust myself and other Canadians far more than I 
would trust the government with the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I quote the statistic for those young people who are 
watching and listening today.  If they put full maximum 
contributions into the CPP they will get only $8,800 a year.  If 
they collect from 65 until 75, should they live to 75, they will 
only get $88,000 out of that plan.  If they had their own plan 
they would get $26,000 a year or $260,000 by the time they turn 
75. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is far different from what the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage will get with the $2.8 million pension she will collect 
by the time she turns 75, or the $3.4 million that Brian Tobin, 
who is now collecting money as the Premier of Newfoundland, will 
get.  It is a travesty.  They should be ashamed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would first like to congratulate you on your appointment as 
Acting Speaker.  I look forward to working within the rules of 
this House and supporting you in your role. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an honour and a pleasure for me to be able to comment on 
the recent throne speech.  For the second time in fourteen 
months, the people of Etobicoke North have given me the 
opportunity to represent them in the House of Commons.  I thank 
them for their strong vote of confidence and I promise to do 
everything I can to perform my duties with honesty during this 
36th Parliament of Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech sets the government's directional course and 
lays out the priorities for this Parliament.  I believe it has 
done this very well.  It has responded to the needs of Canadians 
and to the needs of the constituents in Etobicoke North. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in my riding frequently refer to three major concerns and 
priorities:  first, the need for the economy to generate more 
jobs so that more Canadians, in particular young Canadians, can 
re-enter the workforce; second, the need to resolve our national 
unity problem so that we can move forward and remove the last 
major impediment to economic growth in Ontario, Quebec and the 
rest of Canada; and third, the need to restore confidence in our 
health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech addresses these key issues very completely but 
before I expand on that, I would like to comment on the overall 
context of the throne speech.  That is where we are today and 
where we have come from.  When charting a course for the future, 
we really need to know where we are today and where we have been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our journey to fiscal responsibility and economic renewal has 
been a very difficult one.  The road was rough and winding.  We 
had to make difficult choices about which way to go but I am 
proud to say that our destination is in sight.  If we stay on 
this road, our children's future and Canada's future will be 
secure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing the very positive results today.  Canadian 
interest rates are at their lowest in decades.  Inflation has 
been beaten down and is firmly under control.  We are more 
competitive as a nation.  Consumer spending is up and so is 
business investment.  Make no mistake, good jobs are here and 
more are coming. In summary, the hard work of all Canadians is 
beginning to pay off, but our job is not yet complete. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding and in other regions of Canada, there are business 
representatives that tell me they are unable to recruit people 
with the necessary skills for new positions.  The tragic irony of 
all this is that this is happening at a time when many Canadians, 
and particularly young Canadians, are unable to find quality 
jobs. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was delighted therefore to note that our throne speech 
committed our government “to work with the provinces, 
universities and colleges, the high tech industry and other 
rapidly growing sectors of the economy to better forecast the 
number and types of jobs that will be available and to develop a 
plan for ensuring that young people are appropriately educated to 
fill them”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was particularly pleased to see the reference to colleges.  I 
believe that there are many opportunities available for 
technicians and people with trades in a number of our industrial 
sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I am supporting the establishment of a 
telecommunications learning institute in Etobicoke in association 
with Humber College.  Such an institute will focus on research 
and training so that our workforce skills are leading edge and we 
are prepared for the latest advancements in communications 
technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While our colleges have a major role to play, clearly our 
universities do as well.  The jobs of the future will 
increasingly be knowledge based jobs and our ability as a nation 
to foster a culture of innovation through research, development 
and entrepreneurship will determine our future economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the formation of the $800 million Canada Foundation 
for Innovation that our government established in the last budget 
is so important. So too is the recent announcement in our 
government's throne speech to establish a Canada millennium 
scholarship endowment fund.  These scholarships will make 
post-secondary education more accessible and affordable and will 
help young Canadians prepare for the knowledge based society of 
the next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another serious issue that in my view is still a threat 
when it comes to job creation and unemployment. I refer to it as 
structural unemployment. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT98"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT98"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1805

<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gone are the days when the Canadian economy was expanding and 
thousands of jobs were created automatically. Sure, our economy is 
currently vibrant and it creates many jobs. However, the country and the 
government are facing the challenge of bringing unemployment back to the 
lowest possible level. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we can never achieve an unemployment rate of 5 percent but 
perhaps we can.  We should look very carefully at those countries 
that have achieved very low rates of unemployment without 
triggering unwanted inflation, countries like the United States, 
Holland, Great Britain and others.  To be sure, because of our 
unique Canadian society we cannot transplant these solutions here 
but surely we can learn something from their experiences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes in the global economy and changes in the workplace are 
at the root of structural unemployment.  Countries that 
understand these developments are best positioned to create the 
public policy environment to deal with them. There are certainly 
many changes occurring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Automation is replacing people with technology.  We see it every 
day of our lives whether it is at the supermarket, or when we do 
computerized banking or whether it is robotics in the 
manufacturing sector. Organizations throughout the western world 
are making their organizations flatter by eliminating levels of 
management and by redesigning, re-engineering and rightsizing, as 
the term is used, their structure.  There are changes occurring 
in the workplace such as the use of overtime hours, the use of 
part time versus full time workers, more contract employees and 
there are many other trends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of these changes are characterized as necessary because of 
the increasingly competitive global economy.  At the same time 
however it is interesting to note that stock markets in Canada 
and the United States and industry analysts are discounting the 
positive impacts of downsizing initiatives.  In fact the evidence 
seems to point to the fact that companies that are focused more 
on growing their business and not so much on cost cutting have 
experienced better profitability performance over the last few 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud Canadian business leaders like Courtney Pratt, the 
president of Noranda, when they speak about business' 
multi-stakeholder responsibilities and the need for business to 
invest in people. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that in Europe, the exceptionally high unemployment rates 
in countries such as Germany and France are due to what economists call, 
and this is an understatement, the labour market's lack of flexibility. 
The expression refers to social benefits, manpower mobility, the ability 
to cope with flexible work patterns, etc. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should learn something from these experiences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of other initiatives that I believe would 
spur employment in this country.  For example in Canada we could 
introduce tax incentives at minimal cost to the federal treasury 
to encourage employees to own shares in their own company.  In 
the United States and elsewhere these schemes are referred to as 
employee share ownership plans or ESOPs.  There is a very 
aggressive and well developed tax incentive program for ESOPs in 
the United States and in the United Kingdom.  In Canada at this 
point in time we have no similar regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Studies in the United States and Canada comparing ESOP versus 
non-ESOP companies have consistently shown ESOP companies to be 
superior performers in profitability and job growth.  ESOPs if 
properly implemented across Canada would make good public policy 
and would inspire and encourage Canadians to build a better and 
more compassionate Canada for all Canadians.  The results would 
be both immediate and long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude I must say that at the same time that we move 
aggressively on the economic front we must work very hard on the 
political front to ensure that we remain a united country from 
sea to sea. Constituents in my riding are tired of this 
continuing debate and they want to put the national unity issue 
to rest. They see how the uncertainty about Quebec's future in 
Canada is having a negative impact on the economic prospects in 
Ontario, in Quebec and in the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a public meeting I called in my riding a number of months ago 
to coincide with the release of the health forum report, I was 
made very aware of the concerns many Canadians have about the 
responsiveness and the accessibility of our health care system. 
Medicare is uniquely Canadian and very worthy of our support and 
attention.  We must initiate public policies to restore the 
confidence of Canadians in our health care system and I pledge to 
do my utmost to achieve that end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I have exhausted my time and I thank you and this 
House for this opportunity.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member mentioned in his remarks the need to resolve the 
national unity problem.  I submit that the national unity problem 
will never be resolved until we deal adequately and fairly with 
our aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to hear earlier that the government is committed 
to working in partnership with our aboriginal people.  I would 
submit that there is a very practical opportunity for the 
government to do this in a very real fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Pic River First Nation submitted a land claim and this claim 
was rejected after a legal review by the Department of Justice. 
The Pic River First Nation feels that this legal review was 
seriously flawed and they are seeking an independent legal review 
of their land claim.  They have launched a court action but they 
are quite willing to forgo court action if the government will 
agree to work together with them in partnership to have an 
independent legal review of their land claim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would submit that this is an opportunity for the government to 
show and put meaning to the words in the throne speech, to work 
realistically in partnership with the First Nations, to resolve 
this outstanding land claim rather than force this First Nations 
group to go through a lengthy court action.  The deadline date 
for this would be October 9.  I would urge the government to move 
in the direction of resolving this issue before that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I further feel that for Canada to resolve the national unity 
issue we have to deal fairly with all peoples and that means 
looking at the aboriginal situation in a fair and reasonable way. 
A first step to admit that we want to obtain national unity would 
be for Canada to issue an apology to the aboriginal people for 
the manner in which we have historically treated aboriginal 
people over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have had the good fortune 
in my experience in life to have visited and worked in the Yukon, 
the Northwest Territories and other parts of Canada. I have 
developed a great respect for our native peoples and the 
contribution they make to the overall culture of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am not familiar with the specifics of the case in his 
riding, I think he probably heard the comments earlier by our 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.  If it was 
like the reaction of my own, I was moved by the compassion and 
willingness to develop models and solutions that will be workable 
into the next millennium.  I know that will involve working very 
closely and getting the co-operation of the provinces and 
territories and other stakeholder groups to make that happen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK279"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member for Etobicoke North mentioned that he is in 
favour of tax incentives.  It is a marvellous idea.  It is one 
that the Liberal government tried in the 1970s to generate 
economic growth.  Instead what it did was it helped to create a 
$600 billion debt and stagnant unemployment today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of tax incentives, why does the member not encourage his 
government to give Canadians tax relief?  Instead of picking 
winners and losers in the economy, why does the member not 
encourage his government to let Canadians decide what to do with 
their own money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this minister believe that Canadian taxpayers, small 
business people and homemakers know better how to spend an extra 
dollar than do the Liberal politicians and bureaucrats? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to the member for Calgary 
Southeast, I thank him for the promotion which I have taken note 
of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of tax relief, let us look at the United States.  I was 
down there recently at a conference on employee share ownership. 
The United States is probably the market economy of the world and 
employee share ownership plans are absolutely taking off.  It is 
a huge movement.  What it is saying is that the workers and 
people in all levels of management have a piece of the action. 
The result is there is better productivity and greater profits. 
More profits mean more growth and more growth means more jobs. 
Therefore with a tiny tweak in terms of a tax incentive which 
would have very minimal cost to the treasury, we could actually 
accomplish some great things and get a lot more Canadians back to 
work.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the constituents of Malpeque for having the 
confidence to re-elect me to this 36th Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my constituents know very well, the last four years were not 
easy in our thrust to put the country in a secure financial 
position for the future.  The reality is that in Atlantic Canada, 
where there has been a greater dependency on government programs, 
we have felt the pain of cuts and program changes more vividly 
than in other areas of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents have shown their willingness to accept what had 
to be done.  However, they are also telling me that they are at 
their limit in terms of program elimination and cost recovery. 
Constituents of Malpeque want us in this term to ensure a balance 
between our economic and social agenda.  They maintain we need a 
strong central government to carry out such initiatives. They 
welcome and support the latest initiatives of the government on 
the unity file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our plan during the election set out our values and priorities, 
a growing economy, a modernized health care system and investing 
in knowledge to equip Canadians to compete in a changing world. 
We also offered during the election a workable plan for 
enhancing the unity of our country and securing our future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech begins the task of implementing those 
commitments in quality care, increasing the cash floor which is 
of particular importance in Prince Edward Island, education, 
knowledge, innovation, the commitment of $2 billion for the youth 
employment strategy and in trade where agriculture, fisheries, 
tourism and aerospace production are of particular importance to 
my riding and to Prince Edward Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commitment of the Government of Canada to adopt its programs 
to reflect the social economic realities of rural Canada is of 
particular importance.  Given these facts, I am still both 
anxious and optimistic about the future.  I am anxious because I 
have seen the amount of pressure that those with economic power 
can place on government.  We saw that here the other day in the 
debate on supply as the right-wingers from across the floor 
argued for tax breaks for the wealthy when we should be investing 
in programs that meet the needs of ordinary Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before long we will have the ability to make decisions based on 
our people's needs rather than those of the international bankers 
and bond holders.  That gives me optimism for the future.  We 
have regained the ability to address the priorities of Canadians. 
We did it with a fair bit of pain.  We regained that ability, but 
how will the ultimate decisions be made? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we must recognize as parliamentarians what we are up 
against in making such decisions.  That is the pressure from the 
economic right and the strategies it employs to undermine our 
ability as parliamentarians to represent fairly the needs of 
people.  They some how manage to portray the needs of the economy 
above the needs of people.  We need a strong economy but it 
cannot and should not be the absolute in and of itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one sense I am speaking on the broader issue of democracy, of 
politics and of the needs of people in society to support and 
participate in our parliamentary democracy, not just those who 
have economic power and sway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last decade our various political institutions have come 
under considerable attack, often very subtly, by those who have 
much to gain if the political institutions of the land can be 
undermined.  Politicians are attacked as well and not just on 
their ideas; sometimes the person and the business itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As move toward the next millennium both within Canada and 
globally we are really in a battle of democracy versus the 
market.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me put this as concisely as I can.  With all the trade 
agreements, the linking of the markets in the financial sense, it 
has caused power to shift.  Let me put it this way and compare it 
to space.  The economic space has grown and the political space 
has narrowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe if that space is out of balance between economics and 
politics we are all in trouble in terms of meeting the needs of 
the people in our nations.  In other words, if the market has all 
the power then all we can really be is a consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is summed up best by Arthur Shafer in Peter Newman's <I>The 
Canadian Revolution</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The values of the marketplace have infiltrated every institution 
in Canada, the family, the church, the legal system.  Anti-human, 
commercial values are dominating every sphere of life.  Now that 
we're coming into economic hard times, the sense of each man for 
himself, save your own skin, get whatever advantage you can is 
going to sink public spiritedness and make it much more difficult 
to preserve our sense of obligation to the community. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This pressure on the essence of government is also explained 
appropriately by John Ralson Saul in his book <I>The 
Unconscious Civilization</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People become so obsessed by hating government that they forget 
it is meant to be their government and is the only powerful 
public force they have purchase on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what makes the neo-conservative and market force 
argument so disingenuous.  Their remarkably successful 
demonization of the public sector has turned much of the 
citizenry against their own mechanism.  They have been enrolled 
in the cause of interests that have no particular concern for 
citizen's welfare.  Instead, the citizen is reduced to the status 
of a subject at the foot of the throne of the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that the individual and the government are linked 
together by an artery.  If we act to sever that artery by 
replacing or opposing a central role for government, we cease to 
be individuals and revert to the status of subject. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have outlined the foregoing to put into context the kind of 
environment in which we will work in the House and this 
Parliament. We have to recognize from where and why that pressure 
comes.  I certainly believe in a strong role for government.  I 
believe that the public sector actually creates value in our 
society through its institutions, its programs, its public 
services and its workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the reason we see this subtle attack on this institution 
and government itself is that some in the private sector know 
that if they can shift that responsibility then they can profit 
by doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the desire of some in the corporate sector to move back to 
a time when individual problems, regardless of circumstances, 
were an individual responsibility.  We cannot allow that to 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Thomas Jefferson stated, the care of human life and happiness 
and not their destruction is the first and only legitimate object 
of good government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The corporate sector recognizes that if government can be moved 
out of the way there is a profit to be made in the offering of 
what is now a public service.  One of the best ways to achieve 
its goal is to substitute markets for those public programs now 
authorized through democratic institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put these points on the table to show what I believe is one of 
the greatest pressures on this institution.  To protect ourselves 
from being subverted by that pressure I refer members to page 140 
of <I>Hansard</I> and the remarks of my colleague from Hillsborough 
when he talked about more power being put to members of this 
assembly. That would certainly lessen the power of the 
bureaucracies within Ottawa and would also lessen the ability of 
those with economic clout to pressure cabinet ministers to make 
decisions. What we really need is real debate in this House and 
for the decisions to be made here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we can better achieve our objectives as stated in the 
throne speech by assuring, as the hon. member for Hillsborough 
had argued in his remarks, that greater power is put in the hands 
of the members of House of Commons.  I think it is one of the 
most fundamental things we must do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it was a 
pleasure to listen to the speech by the hon. member who is a 
dairy farmer.  You get some good home farm advice.  But I wonder 
whether the Liberal members are redundant. Except for their 
trained seal capacity to vote as told they have all been spewing 
the same bland stuff that was in that throne speech, and there is 
nothing there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I especially take great exception to the fact that almost every 
one of them has said, as we heard during the election campaign, 
“we have our fiscal house in order”.  We keep hearing that.  I 
do not know how to say this diplomatically or in a parliamentary 
way but it ain't true.  We do not have our fiscal house in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debt has been increasing.  I am a teacher and I would love 
to have an overhead projector here.  If we look at the size of 
the debt, instead of going up one way on a graph as it did from 
the previous government, it has now gone another way. The 
Liberals take credit for this wee little turn in the graph. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is under this government the debt still went up from 
$500 billion to $600 billion.  Instead of paying $40 billion a 
year in interest we are now paying $47 billion a year in 
interest.  They keep on repeating this and it has worked.  A lot 
of people in Canada think it is true that our fiscal house is in 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to give them a mild applause for at least making that 
little turn, but it is not good enough.  I would like to ask this 
member to respond specifically to my question.  How can he keep 
saying we are all okay when in fact they have been responsible 
for adding yet another 20 percent, another $100 billion, to the debt 
during their previous term? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  Maybe he needs some down home farm examples so 
he can understand how annual deficit and accumulated debt 
really work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me compare it to a farm.  In terms of my farm or the farm of 
any member over there, we have had capital investment in terms of 
our mortgages, equipment and so on.  We pay our interest payments 
as the year goes by.  But what is very important is the operating 
capital in terms of being able to use that capital to operate so 
we can pay the interest on our mortgages and remain in business 
in a very productive and progressive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have achieved in comparison to that is that we have paid 
off our operating debt.  We have the accumulated debt to pay in 
the future.  On an operating basis we have surpluses of moneys 
with which we can gradually pay down that debt.  As we said in 
the election campaign we can split it 50:50, put some of it 
toward debt reduction and tax reductions and with the other 50 
percent we will make investments in terms of social and economic 
programs.  That is major progress.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the member's speech and agreed with a 
great deal of it except for the first bumpy part at the beginning 
when he was doing the hail the government's throne speech 
business about modernizing the health care system and all that 
sort of stuff.  Why on earth is he still a Liberal?  Why on earth 
did he ever become a Liberal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why on earth did someone who was once the president of the 
National Farmers Union ever become a Liberal when the fact is 
everything he said with the exception of the bumps at the 
beginning is something that New Democrats have been saying day in 
and day out in this Parliament for years?  We are the only market 
critical party in this Chamber.  The government of which he is a 
part has signed free trade agreement after free trade agreement 
enshrining the very ethic that he just spoke against.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will just pick up from where I left off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to be rising pursuant to a question I asked the 
Minister for International Trade about the multilateral agreement 
on investment, which has everything to do with what the hon. 
member for Malpeque was just talking about, that is, restricting 
the power of government even further than the power of national 
governments have already been restricted by the various free 
trade agreements which the government has already entered into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day I asked the Minister for International Trade a 
question about when and how and if the government was going to 
permit the public to have some say in what the government's 
stance would be in the negotiations with respect to the 
multilateral agreement on investment.  These negotiations have 
been ongoing for two years in Paris, in the context of the OECD. 
They started in April 1995.  They were actually scheduled to end 
in April 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals had had their way we would have had a negotiated 
agreement—done, finished, fait accompli—by April 1997 and they 
would never have even let us know it was happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could not have relied on the official opposition or even the 
third party in the last Parliament to have raised such matters 
because they all bow down to the same altar of the multinational 
corporations and the global economic order that was created for 
the benefit of investors, and to hell with the workers and 
everybody else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We finally have a Parliament in which these kinds of issues can 
and will be raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to hear from the government how it intends to involve the 
Canadian public.  What will the government's stance be at the 
multilateral agreement on investment negotiations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know from the draft, as it stands, that the MAI intends to 
drastically reduce the power of governments to intervene in the 
economy on behalf of the common good, the public interest, 
regional development, research and development and all the other 
ways in which governments have sought to act in the interests of 
the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has the ability to seek certain exemptions in 
respect of social, educational, health, cultural and other areas 
of concern, such as government procurement, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to know what the government is going to do very quickly 
because the negotiations are scheduled to end in April of 1998. 
If the Canadian public is to be meaningfully involved, there 
needs to be a process now.  We do not want to be looking at an 
agreement which has already been negotiated, where the government 
has put the Canadian public in a take-it-or-leave-it position. 
We want to be able to say now to the government, in various 
public ways, what it is it should be insisting on in those 
negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government continues to insist on being at those 
negotiations, at the very least it should be doing what the 
Canadian people insist it be doing, and that is making sure that 
our ability as a people and our ability as a government to act in 
our own interests is protected by the various exemptions which 
the government should be seeking in the MAI negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to hearing from the parliamentary secretary 
exactly what the government's position on this will be.  What 
exemptions is the government seeking?

absolutely have to have or there will be no deal in Paris? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see you rising, Mr. Speaker.  Perhaps I have already exceeded 
my time.  I hope not because I have the greatest respect for the 
time limits put on me.  I will sit down and look forward to what 
the government member has to say. 
<P><A NAME="LINK286"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, foreign direct 
investment currently accounts for one in ten jobs in Canada.  It 
is estimated that each additional $1 billion in foreign direct 
investment helps to create 45,000 new jobs over five years. 
Encouraging more investment in Canada is one of the best ways to 
create jobs.  Is that not the goal of the NDP? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has in place a comprehensive, consultative 
process and is committed to ensuring the opportunity for full 
public discussion on the proposed MAI.  The member opposite has 
already been provided with a personal briefing on the MAI, as 
were all critics. In addition to a general media briefing, all 
members of Parliament and senators have been sent two copies of 
an information package on the MAI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will also be writing to the chair of the Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade to arrange 
his appearance before the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial officials are consulted through conference calls and 
negotiated debriefings.  They have full access to working 
documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The business groups that have been consulted to date include the 
Canadian Chamber of Commerce, the Canadian Council of 
International Business and the Business Council for National 
Issues. Consultations have also taken place with groups 
representing specific sectors of the Canadian economy, including 
culture, energy, mining, telecommunications and agrifood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to non-governmental organizations, the government 
has to date, consulted with the Canadian Labour Congress, the 
Canadian Auto Workers and has been in contact with the World 
Wildlife Fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the negotiations approach the deadline for completion in the 
coming year, the scope of consultations will be broadened to 
include additional NGOs, especially those concerned with labour 
and environment issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The motion to 
adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10
