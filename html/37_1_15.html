<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>ELDORADO NUCLEAR LIMITED REORGANIZATION AND DIVESTITURE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (for the Minister of Natural Resources)</B> 
moved that Bill C-3, an act to amend the Eldorado Nuclear Limited 
Reorganization and Divestiture Act and the Petro-Canada Public 
Participation Act, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on behalf of the 
Minister of Natural Resources who unfortunately cannot be with 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 is an act to amend the Eldorado Nuclear Limited 
Reorganization and Divestiture Act and the Petro-Canada Public 
Participation Act.  This is the same bill as Bill C-39 which 
received second reading last fall but died on the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, three out of four of the opposition parties in the 
House agreed to support that bill.  I do hope that we will have 
their support for the bill today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall that when the bill was first introduced, it 
was done extremely capably by the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Natural Resources, the member for 
Timiskaming—Cochrane.  He spoke eloquently of the merits of the 
bill and of our natural resource sector.  He pointed out that 
resource industries are not relics of the past.  They are 
important engines of economic growth in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Energy, mining, forestry, geomatics and related industries 
currently account for 11% of our gross domestic product and 22% 
of new capital investment.  They employ directly 780,000 
Canadians and drive the economies of over 600 of our communities 
from coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 the resource sector exported $97 billion worth of goods 
and services.  Our resource sectors are in fact dynamic and vital 
elements of not the old economy but the knowledge based economy 
of the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Resource companies are not in competition with high tech 
businesses.  They are high tech businesses.  They are investing 
$35 billion a year in leading edge technologies and other 
capital.  Their productivity is growing three times faster than 
the rest of the economy. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several factors explain the excellent performance of the 
resource industry in the world economy. The policies based on 
economic tendencies and markets which successive Liberal 
governments have implemented are good examples of this. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1005"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, this kind of work is never finished, and our 
constant challenge is to ensure that the Canadian resource 
industry remains competitive and continues to support our 
economic prosperity. We must keep fine tuning our legislative 
and strategic framework so that companies in the resource 
industry have the leeway and capacity they need to make 
strategic decisions and secure a better position on the Canadian 
and world markets. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the rationale for the bill.  The legislative amendments 
being proposed today are intended to allow two of our major 
performers in the natural resources sector, Cameco Corporation 
and Petro-Canada, to continue their record of economic growth and 
environmental stewardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quickly review the history behind these proposed 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one time both Cameco and Petro-Canada were crown corporations 
wholly owned by taxpayers.  By 1995, however, the Government of 
Canada had sold all of its shares in Cameco, which is the 
dominant company in Canada's world leading uranium industry.  As 
for Petro-Canada, although the government currently owns 18% of 
its shares, it does not influence the management of the company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time of privatization, certain ownership restrictions 
were placed on both these companies.  These restrictions were 
implemented at that time for good reasons, but circumstances have 
changed within the continuing evolution of global energy markets. 
The bottom line today is that some of these ownership 
restrictions have outlived their usefulness and are actually 
preventing these companies from taking advantage of new business 
opportunities. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes are needed, obviously. Restrictions on ownership 
provided in the two statutes do not give these companies the 
freedom enjoyed by their competitors to be able to grow and face 
competition on the world market. If Cameco and Petro-Canada are 
to continue performing well as private businesses, we have to 
ensure that the rules of the game are the same for everybody. 
The government also intends to ensure that these two 
corporations continue to make their decisions in Canada, with 
due consideration for Canadian interests. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To accomplish that, the bill will modify or remove certain 
restrictions that are limiting the ability of Cameco and 
Petro-Canada to attract new investment capital to forge new 
strategic alliances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, the bill amends the Petro-Canada Public 
Participation Act to increase the limit on individual ownership 
of shares from 10% to 20%.  It will also eliminate the 25% limit 
on the quantity of shares that could be collectively owned by 
non-residents of Canada. In other words, we are removing the 
restrictions on foreign ownership of Petro-Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Cameco, we continue to believe in the need for some 
restrictions on foreign ownership.  The bill therefore proposes 
to increase the limit on individual non-resident share ownership 
from 5% to a maximum of 15%.  Similarly, the cap on total 
non-resident ownership of Cameco will increase from 20% to 25% of 
the company's shares.  The current ownership limit for individual 
Canadians, which is 25%, will remain in place. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, the bill insists that these two corporations 
remain in Canada and be managed in Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To further ensure that Cameco remains under Canadian control, 
the legislation will continue to require that the company's head 
office be located in Saskatchewan and that the majority of its 
directors be Canadian residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation also requires that Petro-Canada's head office be 
located in Calgary and that the majority of its directors also be 
Canadian residents.  The 20% limit on individual ownership of 
voting shares of Petro-Canada will prevent a takeover by a large 
multinational. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Petro-Canada has reoriented its major activities so 
that they are truly Canadian.  They are concentrating on the east 
coast offshore and on the oil sands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 will prevent Petro-Canada from disposing of all or 
substantially all of its commercial or production assets.  The 
goal is to give Petro-Canada far greater freedom in administering 
its portfolio of assets, at the same time ensuring that it cannot 
dispose of these assets through a wind up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The outstanding Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Natural Resources made it clear in the previous debate that the 
sole intent of these changes is to give Cameco and Petro-Canada 
increased agility and better global positioning.  It does not 
reflect a major shift in energy policy.  These changes confirm 
our commitment to allow market forces to work, but within 
reasonable and responsible limits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Officials of both companies have strongly supported these 
changes, showing that they are not trying to entrench their 
management positions as some might have otherwise suspected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I should like to address briefly two of the other 
issues that were raised in debate when this matter came before 
parliament last spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let me reassure members that the proposed amendments will 
have no impact on the price of refined petroleum products. 
Gasoline and diesel oil prices in Canada rise and fall with crude 
oil prices, which in turn are set by supply and demand in a 
global market.  They are not set by ownership rules applying to 
any one company in the Canadian petroleum industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, let me assure members that Bill C-3 does not affect 
Canada's commitment to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons 
or to nuclear security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I outlined earlier in my remarks, these amendments have been 
supported and endorsed in principle by a big majority of the 
House, with most hon. members recognizing that these changes will 
be good for the two companies, will be good for investors and 
will be good for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this spirit, I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly this 
morning and I commend the bill to all members of the House, 
asking humbly that it receive quick passage at second reading and 
go to committee for full discussion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are speaking on Bill C-3 this 
morning, which pertains to the Eldorado Nuclear Limited 
Reorganization and Divestiture Act and also to the Petro-Canada 
Public Participation Act.  The enactment relates to the mandatory 
provisions in the articles of Cameco Corporation and 
Petro-Canada.  Cameco was formerly Eldorado Nuclear Limited, to 
which many Canadians can relate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment provides that the articles of Cameco Corporation 
will have to contain a 15% individual non-resident share 
ownership limit for voting shares as well as a cap of 25% on 
aggregate non-resident share ownership voting rights.  The 
enactment also provides that the articles of Petro-Canada will 
have to be amended to allow for a 20% individual share ownership 
limit, while the aggregate non-resident share ownership limits 
will be eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the prohibition on the sale, transfer or disposal 
of all or substantially all of Petro-Canada's upstream and 
downstream assets will be replaced with a similar prohibition on 
the sale, transfer or disposal of all or substantially all of its 
assets, without distinguishing between upstream and downstream 
sectors of activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a pretty concise legislative summary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what is important to many Canadians is that, one, we are 
dealing with two assets that Canadians, either historically or 
today, have considered strategic assets.  One of course is 
uranium and that is why we had special rules for Eldorado 
Nuclear.  The other is the grand experiment known as 
Petro-Canada, which was brought in by the Trudeau government in 
1975.  This all became part of the national energy program of the 
early 1980s, so as a consequence it has been very controversial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard much discussion recently about the possibility 
that Petro-Canada could be on the chopping block in terms of the 
remaining ownership of shares held by the Government of Canada. 
That is in the amount of 49.4 million shares.  As of a week ago, 
at an ownership or market price of $36.70, the shares would be 
valued at approximately $1.8 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is, is this the platform to sell off the remaining 
shares in Petro-Canada?  Bottom line, that would still not recoup 
the government's investment in Petro-Canada, but I think many 
Canadians, the international community and certainly the business 
community would be satisfied if the government was finally out of 
this business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important if we are going to take that step that the 
government does the right thing in terms of what it does with 
those moneys that would be accrued at that time.  My personal 
view is that seeing as how the taxpayer subsidized this and it 
has contributed to our previous deficits and our debt and is 
currently the subject of interest payments coming from all of us, 
the moneys should go to debt retirement automatically, without 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Cameco, this bill ensures that foreign ownership is 
capped, thereby eliminating the risk of foreign ownership of 
uranium resources. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this question I believe Canadians think very differently than 
they do about our oil, gas and other resources.  The main reason 
is the fact that uranium, obviously, is involved in nuclear 
energy and nuclear fuel.  That whole area is one that we want to 
tightly regulate and highly regulate, which is appropriate. There 
is a big difference.  If we look at the oil and gas sector, for 
example, when this whole national energy program was put into 
place Canadians were told by the government that we had less than 
20 years' worth of recoverable oil reserves and that a high 
gasoline tax burden was justified in order to conserve for future 
energy needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is in a unique position.  We know now that was an 
incorrect statement.  We now know that in northern Alberta alone 
we have 400 years' worth of recoverable oil reserves in the tar 
sands, which will obviously supply our needs well into the 
future, and that changes everything.  We are very skeptical about 
the need for government to retain any ownership in Petro-Canada 
for any purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991 the government decided that Canada no longer needed a 
crown corporation in the energy business and began the 
privatization process.  We all know that.  That is why current 
ownership is at 18%, not something much higher.  In the end it 
became clear that after fluctuations in the markets, business 
setbacks and the ever present political struggles, Petro-Canada 
ended up basically as an oil company, much like any other in 
Canada except that the taxpayer still owned 18% of the company 
and was the single largest holder of the stock.  No one but the 
government could own more than 10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 we questioned why the government would not sell off its 
national oil company while the industry was strong to recoup some 
of the billions of taxpayer dollars that were used to create 
Petro-Canada in the first place.  In 1994 we asked the government 
why it would not do something significant and use the revenue 
from the sale of Petro-Canada to reduce Canada's debt burden. We 
know there was a crushing debt burden in 1994.  It is still a 
crushing debt burden, but it was much worse in 1994 because we 
were still incurring annual deficits at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 a Liberal budget promised to totally privatize 
Petro-Canada.  We can see how reliable Liberal budget promises or 
even red book promises are.  Indeed, that is something we should 
consider deeply, particularly after the events of this week which 
saw the government say that if its members voted for a red book 
promise it would be a confidence motion and the government could 
fall if its own members voted to keep a government promise.  This 
turns parliament and parliamentary principle upside down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact remains that Petro-Canada cost Canadians over $5 
billion. 
Petro-Canada has never provided a benefit to Canadians that could 
not have been provided by the private sector, and when it was 
finally privatized, guess what?  Petro-Canada started making a 
profit and competing effectively.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments since Petro-Canada was established have never had 
the courage to admit to Canadians that they will be able to 
recover less than $2 billion, 40% of the original cost of 
Petro-Canada.  If Bill C-3 is indeed, as we think it is, the 
first step in the process of the government selling off its 
remaining shares of Petro-Canada, my only response can be that it 
is finally time, long past time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am curious about why we are getting this bill now. 
Petro-Canada's share prices have moved up in anticipation of the 
government selling off its shares.  The shares have gone up by at 
least 50% this year and there is potential for the price to go 
higher.  Also, with the bill in place, foreign ownership 
restrictions are removed, which will allow for an expanded market 
and that theoretically should expand the price once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a business proposition this was a poor one.  We are 
recovering less than 40% of what we put into the exercise and 
that is with rather inflated dollar revenues and non-inflated 
costs.  This has basically been a disastrous business 
transaction.  Since taxpayer dollars originally paid for 
Petro-Canada, I have already explained that the best way to go 
would be to put it into debt reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other things that might be considered, such as our 
looming crisis in transportation needs and the need for 
transportation improvements.  Or we could actually be really 
revolutionary.  I know when it comes to these kinds of 
initiatives that the government has great difficulty prying its 
fingers away from these revenues, but we could be really 
revolutionary and use these moneys to cut taxes.  However, that 
is a rather clear cut, simple, direct way to deal with the 
problem, so as a consequence it may not occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does some things I can support.  Referring to 
Petro-Canada, it does move toward opening up ownership of the 
company to national and international interests while still 
ensuring that the majority of the company is Canadian.  The 
legislation clearly states that resident Canadians must still 
make up the majority of the board of directors.  It also 
stipulates that the head office will remain in Calgary.  The 
Canadian Alliance supports the removal of restrictions on 
Canadian businesses to allow for both domestic and foreign 
investing.  We expect to see that Petro-Canada, once it is no 
longer manipulated by the government, will continue to show 
profits and growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the legislation does not just address issues 
surrounding Petro-Canada.  It addresses issues relating to the 
sale of shares in Cameco, Canada's largest uranium producer.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's Kyoto commitments have increased the need for Canada to 
find green energy.  One option of course is nuclear energy.  That 
needs to be examined.  At this point today I do not want to get 
into a debate about the merits or lack thereof of nuclear energy. 
However, the fact remains that uranium is a resource that, should 
nuclear energy be a factor in the world's efforts to reduce CO2 
levels, will become a very important resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all intrinsically know this.  Nuclear energy has become a 
very controversial way of providing for our energy needs, but we 
have some nations in the world that are almost singularly reliant 
upon nuclear energy.  We do not think about that from time to 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>France, for example, in the European community is over 70% 
dependent upon nuclear energy for its needs.  That has all 
occurred over a long period of time.  It continues to be the way 
that it functions.  Its operations have never created an incident 
that has been worthy of international comment.  That is a 
wonderful track record.  We need to keep our minds open and our 
options open in terms of that whole field of endeavour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill regarding Cameco raises foreign and individual 
ownership limits.  Individual non-resident ownership increases 
from 5% to 15%.  The limit on the total amount of non-resident 
ownership of shares increases from 20% to 25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to see that the legislation is still mindful of the 
possible consequences of high levels of foreign ownership of our 
uranium resources.  The lower limits on Cameco shares reflect 
across the board government restrictions on foreign activity in 
uranium mining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Canadian Alliance is all for Canadian businesses 
having the opportunity to succeed, we must also be conscious of 
the need to keep such a potentially volatile resource within 
Canadian control.  The bill in effect allows for greater 
flexibility in the selling of shares in Canadian companies.  We 
can certainly support that effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have already stated, if the legislation leads to the 
government finally selling off its remaining shares of 
Petro-Canada, it would be legislation that is long overdue.  We 
will just have to see what initiative will come next from the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point in time the government and many parts of the 
public have long since forgotten what the original purpose of 
Petro-Canada, emanating from the government of the day, was 
actually supposed to be.  Unfortunately, many taxpayers have also 
forgotten how much money was sunk into this enterprise, never 
ever to be recovered.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our policy document in regard to this whole initiative says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will foster a healthy economic environment for the benefit of 
consumers by pursuing free and open trade at home and abroad, 
including the elimination of inter-provincial trade barriers.  We 
will withdraw government from areas of the economy where the 
private sector could deliver the same services more efficiently 
and will end the unfair practice of providing subsidies to 
industries, businesses and special interest groups. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of wisdom in that statement.  If the government 
of the day had subscribed to that policy statement we would not 
have sunk money into a sinkhole.  We would not be looking at a 
multibillion dollar loss at a time when the country had a debt. 
That added to our debt and contributed to our interest payments 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even today with all the health care debate that we are going 
through on an almost daily basis, we are paying twice as much 
federally to service interest on the debt as we are in 
contributing to health care transfers to the provinces.  That is 
a very strong indictment of mismanagement of the first order and 
just displays what a country Canada could have been if we would 
have had appropriate fiscal management throughout the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people know it.  That is why they endorsed this policy when 
it was created.  As a matter of fact they were instrumental in 
creating this policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in favour of privatizing Petro-Canada.  This bill does 
set the stage for doing that.  The legislation ensures that 
foreign ownership of uranium resources will be monitored and 
capped.  It is important for us to make sure that our support of 
free market competition and access does not however give away our 
uranium resources to foreign ownership.  I want to be very clear 
on that and I think I have been consistent throughout my 
statements today that that is a direction we are simply not 
coming from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that I have not used up all the valuable time of the 
House but I certainly put across the points that I wanted to get

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I 
proceed, I request unanimous consent of the House to share 
my time with my colleague from Lotbinière-L'Érable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Is that agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with rather mixed emotions that I rise this morning to speak to 
Bill C-3. There are so many important issues that should be 
discussed with some urgency in the House that I do not see the 
point in debating the bill before us today, because it will not 
change much of anything for Canadians, in my opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There certainly is a problem in the oil industry throughout 
Canada, but the government is ignoring it and keeps on 
introducing bills that do not do anything to solve the problem. 
It is as if the government were telling us that it wants to keep 
the House busy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 is entitled an act to amend the Eldorado Nuclear Limited 
Reorganization and Divestiture Act and the Petro-Canada Public 
Participation Act 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1040"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, this enactment relates to the mandatory provisions in 
the articles of Eldorado Nuclear Limited—now Cameco 
Corporation—and Petro-Canada. It provides that the articles of 
Cameco Corporation will have to contain a 15% individual 
non-resident share ownership limit for voting shares as well as a 
cap on aggregate non-resident share ownership voting rights of 25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also provides that the articles of Petro-Canada will have to 
be amended to allow for a 20% individual share ownership limit, 
while the aggregate non-resident share ownership limit will be 
eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prohibition of the sale, transfer or disposal of all or 
substantially all of Petro-Canada's upstream and downstream 
assets will be replaced with a similar prohibition on the sale, 
transfer or disposal of all or substantially all of its assets, 
without distinguishing between the upstream and downstream 
sectors of activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I will be focusing mainly on the provisions concerning 
Petro-Canada, but I still want to say a few words about Cameco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the press release announcing the proposed changes to the 
legislation, the minister made the following statement, to 
reassure the public, I guess: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments conform to the Government of Canada's policy on 
non-resident ownership in the uranium mining sector and do not 
impair Canada's ability to fulfill its commitment to nuclear 
non-proliferation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could carry on for hours and hours about the issue of nuclear 
non-proliferation. I have the honour of having the Minister of 
the Environment in front of me this morning. The Minister of the 
Environment is currently promoting nuclear energy at the 
international level while industries throughout the world are 
opting for new approaches. I find that rather bizarre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually, it is not that bizarre when one is aware that the 
Canadian government is trying to sell its Candu reactors to 
underdeveloped countries, just to make money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went through the same thing last autumn, during the previous 
parliament, when a very hot topic, the transportation of MOX, 
gave rise to heated debate throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take this opportunity to thank all the residents of 
the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean and the hundreds of thousands of people 
who opposed the movement of MOX from Russia and the United 
States for testing in a nuclear plant. In his last report, dated 
December 2000, the auditor general says these nuclear plants are 
now very dangerous because they have not been well maintained. 
Huge investments are needed to make them properly operational. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the debate on this, the Minister of Natural Resources, 
the hon. member for Wascana, consistently refused to hear the 
voice of the ordinary people, despite what was stated in the 
Baird commission report. In this report it was said that 
before moving forward in such an important area there had to be 
public consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this week we have had yet another example of the kind of 
government we have. 
In its 1993 red book, the Liberal Party had solemnly committed 
to appointing an ethics counsellor who would be accountable to 
parliament. This week, representatives of that party broke their 
promise.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are not here to protect the environment for the future; 
they are here to work on a piecemeal, short-sighted basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned, and I think the MOX issue is a good example. I 
can tell the House that we will not give up, that we will 
scrutinize what the hon. member for Wascana says and does to 
ensure that he does what he said he would do when answering the 
questions I asked him during last parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder about the relevance of the government's approach. 
Is it really necessary to seek more foreign capital for the 
extraction of uranium?  I hope the minister will adequately 
answer our questions in committee.  However, I would be remiss 
if I did not mention that the head office of Cameco is located 
in the minister's province, Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Petro-Canada has its head office in Alberta because it used to be 
a crown corporation.  Now, the federal government owns 
approximately one fifth of its shares.  In our opinion, this 
corporation already belongs to foreign interests.  Therefore, 
even if the individual share ownership limit is increased from 
10% to 20%, this will not impact on the problem of competition 
in the gasoline market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing to see this bill being presented when the 
Conference Board is currently conducting a review of this whole 
issue. Would it not have been preferable to wait for the 
conclusions of that review before making any changes in the 
share ownership of Petro-Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report from that review, commissioned by the Minister of 
Industry during the last parliament, should be tabled soon. It 
was to be submitted at the beginning of January 2001, but we 
have not seen it yet.  The review will cost nearly three 
quarters of a million dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion it would have been better to wait for that report 
before making any commitments. Studies are now underway which 
might give us another standpoint on whatever is happening in the 
gas industry, on the issue of competition in that industry and 
on whatever is being said across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also surprising is the fact that Petro-Canada contributed a 
little over $5,000 to the campaign fund of the Liberal Party of 
Canada in 1999. I would like to give our viewers some 
information regarding other contributions made that same year. 
The Alberta Energy Company contributed $17,233 to the Liberal 
Party campaign fund; Amoco Canada, $14,433; Canadian Occidental 
Petroleum, $52,676; Golf Canada Resources, $7,233; and Imperial 
Oil, $25,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose that when the CEOs of these companies ask for changes 
to the Petro-Canada Public Participation Act, close attention is 
paid to what they have to say. All roads lead to the campaign 
fund of our friends across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the review being carried out by the Conference Board, I 
want to remind the House that a parliamentary committee examined 
Petro-Canada and the fuel industry in 1998. 
In one of its recommendations, the committee warned against a 
possible merger of Petro-Canada and another oil company. This is 
another fine example of the Prime Minister ignoring the work of 
his own members. Despite all the work that was done, he is 
trying to hide the fuel issue by commissioning the Conference 
Board to conduct a review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is not only collecting fuel taxes, it is 
grabbing part of the huge profits being registered by the oil 
companies this year. Petro-Canada's profits increased by $195 
million during the second quarter of the year 2000. That is a 
304% increase. To increase its tax revenues, the government will 
stop at nothing. 
During the next campaign, the Liberal Party theme could very 
well be “We want nothing but your good, and your goods”.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasing the foreign ownership limit to 20% will not allow an 
individual to take control of Petro-Canada. However, 20% of the 
shares of a company can give someone a lot of power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, in the Bloc, think that competition is one of the major 
problems in this industry. The federal government identified a 
dangerous level of concentration in the industry, but it decided 
against doing anything until the problem reached crisis 
proportions since the winter of 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has been demanding for some time that the 
federal government make sure there is more competition in the 
Canadian oil industry. Three refiner-marketers control 75% of the 
wholesale trade in Canada, which is reason enough to wonder if 
there is any real competition in this industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Competition Act should be amended to guarantee competitive 
prices for consumers. The House committee that has been poring 
over this legislation for a year has clearly indicated that the 
Competition Bureau had a very hard time enforcing the law. 
There are two things that could be done immediately in this 
regard: first, there could be changes made to the onus of proof 
with respect to anticompetitive behaviour and, second, the 
Competition Bureau could be given the authority to initiate 
investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite what the government says about Canada's refineries, 
right now Esso, Shell, Petro-Canada and Ultramar have a monopoly 
on distribution.  The four oil companies serving the Canadian 
market posted a record overall net profit of close to 
$2.5 billion in the first nine months of 2000. It is a bonanza 
for shareholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Petro-Canada alone made record profits of $893 million in the last 
year, almost three times more than the preceding high of 
$306 million reached in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is other problem with the federal government's attitude 
with respect to fuel price hikes. Only 17% of federal taxes on 
fuel are invested in the transportation infrastructure on a 
Canada-wide scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government then feels it has to set up 
infrastructure programs in order to gain more visibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean area who sits 
across the way was a Progressive Conservative, then an 
Independent and is now the Liberal member for Chicoutimi—Le 
Fjord.  He says that he is a regionalist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a brief comment for him.  The federal government 
collected $35 million in fuel excise taxes in the 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean in 1997-98.  Our return on this was 0.8%, 
because all the federal government reinvested was $287,000 on 
highway 175.  What happened to the other $34.3 million? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is still staying that Quebec does not look after the 
regions. 
I am going to give an idea of what is being said. The Quebec 
government collected $37 million and reinvested $30 million for 
highways in my region alone. That is an 80% return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cat is now coming out of the bag. As we say back home, the 
truth will come out, and it will, faster and faster. We will discuss 
the real issues. Right now, this government is taking money from 
the pockets of Canadian and Quebec taxpayers and using it to pay 
off its debts. That money is being used to pay for something 
other than what it is collected for.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it hard to see the relevance of this bill. I am not 
opposed to it and nor is the Bloc Quebecois. But I wonder why 
the government is introducing this bill now. Is it because some 
foreign investor who is anxious to invest in Petro-Canada and 
contribute to the Liberal Party's campaign fund needs a higher 
ceiling for foreign ownership? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose the Minister of Natural Resources will be able to 
explain to us in committee why this bill is being introduced now 
and why the government does not deal instead with the issue of 
competition in the gasoline market across Canada.

military expenditures in the last two years while using scorched 
earth warfare to secure the oil fields, but it has breached its 
promise to Canada and the international community to increase 
vital investments in agriculture and food security.  Rather, the 
warfare exposes its people to more depopulation, more human 
misery and more killing, including the warnings from the United 
Nations of a war induced famine and a genocide warning from the 
Committee on Conscience of the U.S. Holocaust Museum.

into some kind of economic downturn.  Just a month after a

layoffs.  Meanwhile, the markets are adjusting to an economic 
slowdown, as is the U.S. government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government on the other hand refuses to re-examine its 
course.  Why will the finance minister not table an updated 
budget? 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, certainly experts say that the Canadian and U.S. 
economies are headed for a slowdown.  However, there are no 
indications that there will be a recession.  The experts all say 
that we are well positioned to offset the slowdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget update of the Minister of Finance last fall

cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's mini budget was based on a booming outlook but 
things are much different now than they were four and a half 
months ago.

Canadians?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International

projections.  Yes, there is turbulence out there and Canadians 
know very well that we face many international challenges right 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are being very vigilant.  We are watching this very closely. 
I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, that should it be necessary we 
will come before the House and take whatever actions may be 
necessary.

House, like he just has, that the government is concerned about 
the future but will not act until we are actually in the trough 
of some kind of economic downturn.  At that point it is too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question again to the minister is, why is the government so 
stubborn on this issue?  We are talking about the prospect of 
jobs and prosperity for Canadians.  In the face of that, why will 
the government not be responsible and bring down a budget 
immediately? 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>

be legislated or come into effect for months or years from the

</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, the tax cuts announced by the Minister of

having a positive effect in offsetting a possible slowdown, in my 
view.  This will continue to be the case.  The Americans in my 
view are just catching up with what we are already doing.

budget just because we are suggesting it on this side of the 
House.  That will happen sooner or later.  Maybe it should be 
sooner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 10,000 jobs at Nortel are not theoretical, those jobs were 
lost.  That is continuing to happen.  It is very real to the

simple.  We are monitoring this very closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just say what the Deputy Prime Minister just said.  We 
got the jump on the Americans with the tax cuts in our October 
budget.  We brought in $100 billion of tax cuts over five years, 
a stimulus from the federal sector alone this year of $17.3 
billion.  When we combine that with provincial tax cuts, it 
amounts to about 2.3% of gross domestic product.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has a habit of saying that Canadians share 
two convictions: the first is that theirs is the best country in

its fair share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that, year after year, Statistics 
Canada reveals that Quebecers contribute about 21% of federal

corresponds to the fact that Quebec is somewhat below the 
Canadian average in terms of its wealth.  This is the

15%, although people's needs have grown spectacularly?  Does he 
realize this? 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it must be remembered that tax points were transferred 
to the provinces in 1977, so they are used by the provinces for 
basic programs such as health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, it would be an error to not take into account the 
increased value of these tax points in an attempt to evaluate 
the federal government's cost in helping the provinces with 
health care, for example.

were in 1993, before the drastic cuts made by the Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs realize that, 
since federal surpluses are accumulating at an alarming rate 
while health care and education needs are rapidly growing, it is 
time the federal government transfer new tax points to the 
Quebec government, as unanimously requested by all the parties 
in the National Assembly? 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>

the gentleman speaks of is one that we anticipated when we saw 
fuel prices going up last year.  We knew we had to act but 
according to two principles.  First, it had to be delivered 
quickly for the relief to come.  Next summer would just not do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the relief should not go to all Canadians, just to those 
who needed it most.  That is why we used the only mechanism

there is a growing outrage out there that people who do not even

this government, wait for spring?

cheques have gone out to 11 million Canadians, those of low and 
middle income.  They were the ones who needed the help the most, 
and this is the way we have delivered it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada officials have publicly stated that there is no 
scientific justification for the ban of Brazilian beef and, guess

announced to CNN on February 8 that there is no need to pull 
Brazilian beef products.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have come to the knowledge that over 5,000 head of cattle 
were imported into Brazil in the 1990s from countries in the 
European Union where there is known BSE.  Until we are 
comfortable with the tracing of that and that the end product 
from those animals has not, will not and is not in the food

Mr. Speaker, many Canadians from different regions across the

after the water problem in the Sept-Îles beaches area, a second

lies with the Department of National Defence, in Shannon, a

</I></B></P><P align=left>We now know that authorities on the Valcartier military base

How can the Minister of National Defence justify his refusal to

have in fact been spending a fair bit of money to try to 
determine the source. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, we provided information to the ministry of the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am now prepared to rule on the 
question of privilege raised last Friday by the hon. member for 
Hochelaga<B>—</B>Maisonneuve regarding comments exchanged during oral 
question period between him and the government House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Hochelaga<B>—</B>Maisonneuve contends that the 
comments made by the government House leader were abusive and 
threatening. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before addressing the question of privilege I would like to 
thank the hon. member for having drawn the matter to the 
attention of the House.  I would also like to thank the 
government House leader, the whip of the Bloc Quebecois and the 
hon. member for Brossard—La Prairie for their contributions to 
the discussion. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to remind all hon. members that anything 
said outside this House that is not directly related to the 
proceedings of the House or one of its committees is not 
protected by parliamentary privilege.  In such circumstances, 
members run the same risks and have the same rights and 
responsibilities as any other citizen.  Consequently, I do not 
wish to comment further on a matter over which the Speaker does 
not have authority. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here in the House, however, members enjoy absolute privilege.  I 
would refer the hon. members to page 74 of Marleau and 
Montpetit's <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, which 
states the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Freedom of speech permits Members to speak freely in the Chamber 
during a sitting or in committees during meetings while enjoying 
complete immunity from prosecution for any comment they might 
make. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This freedom is essential to the work done within the 
parliamentary precinct.  At the same time, such freedom implies 
great responsibilities.  We must all bear in mind the potential 
impact of our comments not just on the reputations of our 
colleagues in the House but also on those of individuals outside 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The use of provocative or threatening words, regardless of their 
meaning in absolute or abstract terms, can also hinder the 
effective conduct of House business.  For this reason, the Chair 
must pay careful attention to what is said here, especially 
during Oral Question Period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Comments which are not intended to create disorder, but which 
have that effect, should be strictly avoided. 
Previous Speakers of the House have often recalled that every 
member shares part of the responsibility for maintaining order 
in the House.  The efficient conduct of business, especially 
during Oral Question Period, requires the co-operation of all 
members from both sides of the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this matter, I have carefully reviewed the comments of both 
members.  In my view, there is simply a disagreement on the 
facts or the interpretation of the facts.  Differences of 
opinion on facts are not rare in the House and do not constitute 
a violation of parliamentary privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again thank the hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve for 
having raised this matter.  Determining the sort of behaviour 
that will enable us to conduct our business in an atmosphere of 
decorum and respect should be of the utmost concern to all of 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask for 
clarification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. I do hope, indeed. I 
wish, in the spirit of co-operation that is always necessary in 
the House, that this ruling will not be appealed. I am sure that 
there will be opportunities to bring some informal 
clarifications. However, with all due respect, decisions made 
during the proceedings of the House are final.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>ELDORADO NUCLEAR LIMITED REORGANIZATION AND DIVESTITURE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK164">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-3, an 
act to amend the Eldorado Nuclear Limited Reorganization and 
Divestiture Act and the Petro-Canada Public Participation Act, be 
read a second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK165"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière—L'Érable, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to speak today on Bill C-3, which was originally 
introduced before parliament was dissolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to make a comment. The Bloc Quebecois is not 
against this bill. However, the fact that we have to debate an 
issue that could already have been discussed, if an unnecessary 
election had not been called, leads us increasingly to 
realize with all these bills that this government has no 
legislative agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only items we have been called on to debate are bills which 
had been introduced before the House was dissolved. Those bills 
are brought back with minor technical changes and are presented 
to us as an important legislative agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shows once again that this government has no vision nor any 
clear policy. It does not know where it is heading. It is the 
first time in my short political career, and also in a previous 
life as a reporter, that I see a government with so poor a 
legislative agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I looked at Bill C-3, I hoped the government might have 
taken advantage of this opportunity to really deal with the 
problem of the oil companies. All we are asked to do is to amend 
rules and regulations in order to permit a deal involving the 
owners of Petro-Canada, those who might buy its shares. However, 
this does not get to the heart of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill does absolutely nothing to alleviate the crisis faced 
by Quebecers, especially in areas where gas prices are very 
high. There has been no change in spite of the oil 
companies' record profits. What we see is that there has been no 
change in the concentration and centralization of decision 
making. When we talk about capitalist countries, we are talking 
about the United States, of course.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the U.S., there are laws protecting companies, distributors 
and retailers, thus improving the economy within this system. 
Here, over the last 25 years, we have seen retailers and 
distributors disappear, and big companies take over the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is of great concern to me as my riding of 
Lotbinière-L'Érable is very rural. Over the past 25 years, we 
have seen the local garage disappear. We were better off when we 
had a gas station, at least then there were attendants to serve 
us. Now we are left with self-serve gas bars. They are run by the 
oil companies. 
The managers of these outlets have nothing to do with pricing 
and the profit margin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give the House a very specific example. The managers of 
two related companies, Petro-Canada and Esso, met with me to give 
me a press release issued by each of their companies. Both press 
releases were issued at 7.04 a.m. and were similar in that they 
informed their managers that both companies, Petro-Canada and 
Esso, were setting the price at a certain amount and indicating 
what their profit margin would be that day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with gas is not only at the pump. It is also a 
management problem. These people told me “Do not mention the 
municipalities. Do not try to identify us, because we will 
suffer reprisals at the hands of our companies. 
If they find out that we tried to get a little more, that we 
tried to be a bit fairer, they will reduce our profit margin”. 
These people are terrorized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to a report not yet published, but which we had an 
opportunity to get a glimpse of, “All is well in the wonderful 
world of the oil companies”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding is rather small, let us say that it is 120 kilometres 
from one end to the other along highway 20. My riding is on the 
south shore near Quebec City. The price differences can be 6, 8, 
or 10 cents. Could someone explain that to me? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it due to transportation? I doubt very much that it could 
increase the price of oil by 8 or 10 cents. 
Is it due to taxes? As far as I know, politicians, in Quebec as 
well as in Canada, explain in their budget how they manage it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not due to transportation or to taxes and, as I 
said, management has nothing to do with it neither. This means 
that oil companies are increasingly taking control of retailers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A television channel called LCN is now presenting the hit-parade 
of gas prices. Here is the hit-parade: in the Eastern Townships, 
82 cents; in Lac-Saint-Jean, 81 cents; in central Quebec, 79 
cents; in the Quebec City area, 77 cents, and so on. But this is 
ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this government tells us that everything is fine in the oil 
industry and when the Conference Board of Canada tells us 
officially, as it will soon tell us, that there is no problem, 
they are laughing at people.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are laughing at people because, as I explained with many 
examples, the retailer has no control on his profit margin nor 
on prices. In addition to that, the situation is so ridiculous, 
prices changes so much, going up and down like a yo-yo—so to 
speak—everywhere in Quebec that we now see the hit-parade of gas 
prices on LCN. This is ridiculous. Who foots the bill? It is the 
workers, both wen and women, and the small and medium size 
businesses who foot the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now move on to the heating oil issue and the $125 or $250 
that were paid. Could someone please explain to me why a person 
living alone gets $125 and two persons living together get $250. 
As far as I know, the price of fuel oil is the same.  This 
government is always determined to put forward diversionary 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been far simpler, instead of having this 
propaganda operation, this flag-waving exercise by the great 
Liberal Party of Canada, to really attack the problem at its 
source and find a means to ensure that the people paying for 
fuel oil are the ones to receive the $125 and $250, and to make 
the amounts uniform.  Prisoners got cheques.  People who have 
been bedridden for the past ten years in chronic care hospitals 
got cheques.  Young people got cheques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week, a minister announced in the House that they were 
going to get parents to have their children return the $125.  I 
am not here to promote the clothing stores, but I can tell hon. 
members that that $125 has already gone on jeans, coats and cool 
shirts. 
A person would have to be out of touch with reality to not 
realize that a kid with a cheque for $125 is going to cash it. 
He is not going to mention it to his parents.  I have had 
parents calling me to ask “What is this business of $125?”  They 
had not heard anything about it.  This is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have the government turning up here with a bill aimed at 
transactions and trying to get out of a field from which it 
ought to have pulled out a long time ago.  Much editorial ink 
has been flowed about this bill since the start of the session. 
The latest clipping I have in hand is this one of an editorial 
by Jean-Paul Gagné in <I>Les Affaires</I>.  I would advise hon. members 
to listen carefully. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Petro-Canada has just made the highest net profit in its history: 
$893 million or $3.28 a share in the year 2000, compared to its 
1999 figure of $233 million or 86 cents a share. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He goes on to tell us what Petro-Canada is about. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This company was created in 1975 by the government of Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau to enable Ottawa, so they said, to acquire an 
indicator sector in the petroleum industry, which was and 
remains dominated by foreign multinationals, and to better 
understand the industry. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals of the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s or 2000s do not 
change.  They say any old thing.  We have the proof once again 
with Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who tried to get us to believe 
that, with the creation of Petro-Canada, we would be protected 
from the multinationals.  What a monumental joke.  The 
editorialist continued, saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, this was an opportunity to plaster maple leaf 
designs throughout a vast network of gasoline sales points from 
one end of Canada to the other. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fine symbol of the maple leaf was at the heart of the 
creation of Petro-Canada.  When will this government get down to 
dealing with the real problems?  I have talked about the problem 
that stands out with the price of gasoline.  I have talked about 
the problem that stands out with heating oil and the problem of 
the fluctuations in the price of gasoline not only within 
regions but even within my riding.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also mentioned that, in the last 25 years, self-service 
stations have cropped up while service stations and small local 
garages disappeared, and all the government has to offer is Bill 
C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry and the Minister for International 
Trade keep saying “We are going to table the report of the 
Conference Board of Canada. You will see, they will come up with 
some solutions”. Nothing will be changed and once again the poor 
will foot the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find unfortunate is that we, in the Bloc Quebecois, when 
we rise in this House, we seem to be the only ones in touch with 
what is going on in our ridings, in touch with the people. 
How many times have people come to me saying “Look, Mr. 
Desrochers, if the gas price keeps going up, I will no longer be 
able to drive to work, about 10 miles away from home, because I 
already have a house, two kids, a car and I cannot make ends 
meet”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not seem to care, since it does not have any 
qualms about the oil companies getting richer on the backs of 
the ordinary citizens. The current government, which has been in 
office since 1993, has worked extra hard to make the rich richer 
and the poor poorer. We have huge debates on market 
globalization and global economic integration, but we do not get 
to the bottom of these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about concentration, as in this case with oil 
companies, and when we talk about market globalization, as we 
are doing today, people get worried. 
When they see Americans, Asians or Europeans, who have a 
different mentality than North Americans, Canadians and 
Quebecers, move into their communities, people are afraid they 
might lose their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are direct consequences of market globalization. It is a 
direct consequence of corporate concentration. These things are 
all happening under the federal government's nose. The federal 
government should closely monitor them, if it wants to maintain 
a sound economy. But no, the government would rather boast. It 
is pleased to see our heritage being sold. Who is paying for all 
this? It is ordinary workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average salary back home has nothing to do with the figure 
provided Statistics Canada, because it makes no sense. 
Back home the average salary is around $25,000 or $30,000 a 
year, and I am being generous, for a family with two children and a 
mortgage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, I saw an add showing a person who was choking and 
losing his voice. I am losing my voice today, but it is because, 
like many, I was caught off guard by the sudden changes in 
temperature. But that person was losing his voice because he 
continuously felt choked. The same thing is happening in our 
ridings. People come and see us because they feel choked. They 
do not know how they will manage to pay their bills at the end 
of the month. They do not know how they will be able to plan for 
their holidays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all because of the little games played by oil companies. 
This year, they were rather nice, they did not hit us too hard 
during the Christmas season. But I can guarantee that we will 
pay dearly when the nice weather comes, in May and June. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not for nothing that some oil companies have already begun 
changing the prices at the pumps.  It is no fluke that Ultramar, 
to take one example, has set its sights on being able to post a 
price of $1 on its pumps.  These people know what is in the 
wind.  They point to international rulings, but they have some 
leeway and they do not approve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 is not the way to sort out the whole business of 
increases in gasoline and heating oil prices.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope, through comments such as these in the House, to 
bring home to the federal government the human misery—I am not 
afraid to say it—that is taking hold in our regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not go over the entire history of Bill C-2, the employment 
insurance bill.  It has been addressed at length this week.  As 
I was saying a few minutes earlier, in everything it does, the 
federal government is overlooking the middle class.  The middle 
class is fading right out of existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet it is the middle class that paid most of the taxes levied by 
the members across the way. 
It is totally unacceptable. Will we go back to social democratic 
values, family values, values of mutual support and solidarity 
to save Quebec society? I doubt it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, I want to mention that the Bloc Quebecois is in favour 
of Bill C-3, but it condemns all of the government policies 
adopted in the last few years concerning the concentration and 
the consolidation of oil companies. It also condemns the 
government for ignoring those who always end up paying: the 
poorest among our workers. I have this to say to the Liberals: 
wake up. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK166"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to enter the debate on Bill C-3.  Most of the 
country is seized with the issue of energy as we speak.  Many 
homeowners and small businesses are reeling with the shock and 
the horror of the rising, out of control, skyrocketing fuel 
prices, so it is timely that we are having this debate now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is timely but maybe not fitting, given the content of the 
bill.  We see Bill C-3 as the death rattle of a national dream. 
There was a time when Canadians believed that the federal 
government had some role to play in looking after the interests 
of ordinary Canadians in terms of access to energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1975, the minority Trudeau government, held up by the David 
Lewis NDP, saw fit to enter into the energy industry with some 
presence, whether it was as a watchdog or a producer.  It saw 
that the whole oil and gas industry was owned by offshore 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We really did not know if Canadians were getting gouged.  We did 
not know if we were paying a fair market price or a grossly 
inflated price.  Given that Canada is, first, geographically 
challenged in that it is huge and, second, that it has a cold 
northern climate, this was no small issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in 1975 people had the vision and forethought to try to 
do something about it.  They still believed in the nation state 
of Canada that we could do something to control our own future 
and destiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we raise the subject, people look at us as if it is heresy 
to even recommend that the federal government might be able to do 
something to help Canadians.  Government shrugs its shoulders and 
says that it actually traded that away in the last free trade 
agreement it signed, that it used to be able to influence and 
dictate domestic market prices for our energy resources but it 
traded that away and cannot help us any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly that is why I think it is sad today that we are dealing 
with the death rattle of a national dream, when people with 
vision actually had some idea and some awareness of how critical 
access to reasonably priced energy resources would be to the 
economic stability of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is even more galling to Canadians when they realize that our 
energy resources are part of our common wealth.  There is that 
old term.  We used to use that word that in the name of our 
party, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation.  Our natural 
resources are part of our birthright as Canadians.  They are in 
the ground.  They are under our feet.  They are something we all 
need and we all should be able to share.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe some things should be regulated.  We all know that 
capital has no conscience as such, so it is government's role to 
introduce regulation on the free market to make sure that it 
meets ordinary people's needs.  We could certainly argue that the 
absence of any national energy strategy is not serving Canadians 
well.  We could ask any homeowner in this country what he or she 
thinks about the way the free market has served the interests of 
Canadians when it comes to energy supply.  We could ask any small 
business person or any trucking company representative how he or 
she likes waking up in the morning not knowing if the price of 
fuel has arbitrarily fluctuated by six, seven or ten cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What really annoys Canadians most is this seemingly arbitrary 
nature of the wild price fluctuations.  That is what really galls 
people.  That is why, when we did have Petro-Canada, when we did 
actually own a piece of the action, we knew what the real cost of 
production was.  Then we could tell if we were paying the real 
cost or if we were being gouged like most Canadians feel they are 
being gouged now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not at all impressed with Bill C-3.  It is a huge step 
backward.  It is the end of an era in terms of the nation state 
of Canada being able to dictate its own domestic price for energy 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a growing interest, of course, in the whole issue of 
energy resources.  As prices skyrocket there is a growing 
realization that we have to do something about energy 
conservation.  We have to get more involved in the demand side of 
our resources rather than the supply side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a carpenter by trade. I used to build hydro dams and oil 
refineries.  I worked on megaprojects of that nature.  It used to 
be heresy for a tradesperson to advocate demand side management 
because we wanted the jobs.  We wanted to build hydro dams to put 
people to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In actual fact, the more people dig into the subject, we are 
pleased to be able to say that there are far more job 
opportunities in demand side management in terms of energy 
retrofitting buildings like schools and hospitals than there are 
in building a hydro dam.  We have to start considering that a 
unit of energy harvested from the existing system by demand side 
management measures is indistinguishable from a unit of energy 
generated at a generating station except for a number of key 
things:  it is available at about one-quarter of the cost; it 
creates as much as seven times the number of person years or 
jobs; it is available and online immediately instead of the 10 
year lag time there is to build a new generating station; and it 
does not degrade the environment, but in fact rehabilitates the 
environment by reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the type of message we should be getting from our 
federal government as we enter into an era of energy supply 
crisis.  Instead of throwing money at it with a dysfunctional 
rebate system, why are we not hearing about a progressive 
approach to serving the needs of Canadians by demand side 
management energy conservation?  If I heard the government say 
that even once, it would be of some comfort.  Instead we have a 
token gesture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us start with the federal government itself as a 
demonstration pilot project.  The federal government owns 68,000 
buildings in Canada, many of which are absolute energy pigs 
because they were built in an era when people did not worry about 
energy conservation.  These buildings waste energy like crazy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the empirical evidence now shows that we can reduce the 
operating costs of those 68,000 buildings by as much as 40% by 
working on the building envelope.  I am talking about new 
insulation, smart thermostat controls, basic caulking and sealing 
of windows, and smart lighting systems that dim and light up as 
the day brightens and darkens.  All of these measures are easily 
done and would serve as a demonstration project to the private 
sector that it too can reduce its fuel consumption and operating 
costs.  We all have to realize that our energy resources are 
extremely finite and that Canada is the most wasteful country in 
the world when it comes to energy consumption.

the world to live in the same manner we do or use the same level 
of energy we do, seven more plants would be required to provide 
the raw resources. 
There are not enough energy resources in the world for every man, 
woman and child in developing nations to live the lifestyle that 
we enjoy with our energy use.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us face it.  Essentially the jig is up as far as our cheap 
access to unlimited energy use is concerned.  Conservation is 
going to be the key and will ultimately save the planet.  Sooner 
or later we are going to have to wean ourselves off fossil fuels 
altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to the demand side management I described, possibly 
there would be some optimism and hope on the part of Canadians if 
they heard our government make visionary statements like that. 
Frankly, we could show the world how to do it.  We could be a 
centre of excellence for energy retrofitting technology because 
we are a harsh northern climate and we have challenges in terms 
of energy supply now.  We could develop and export the technology 
and become world leaders in the sensible use of energy resources 
instead of showing the world just how wasteful we can be, which 
is our practice, frankly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I started by saying that there was a time within living memory 
when Canadians still believed that we were not impotent as a 
government, but now as we sign more and more trade agreements we 
are locking ourselves in deeper and deeper, to the point where we 
can no longer dictate our own domestic energy strategy.  We 
cannot give preferential pricing to our own customers, our own 
citizens, our own kids.  We are not allowed to because somebody 
traded it all away.  I call it economic treason to trade away our 
birthright and our ability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1980s and 1990s in the private sector, in the Business 
Council on National Issues and the Canadian Manufacturers' 
Association, everybody wanted to deregulate everything.  The idea 
was to let the free market prevail and get government out of 
business because it was tying up the free hand of the 
marketplace.  The government sold Petro-Canada.  It sold the 
goose that laid the golden egg.  Why did we want to get out of 
the energy sector just at a time when world prices were going 
through the ceiling?  We sold it off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, $800 million in profit would have been in the coffers 
of the federal government, but no, we had to let the free market 
handle things:  all things private, good, and all things public, 
bad, and the public sector could not organize a peanut stand. 
Although frankly, with the way the government has managed its 
energy rebate system there is not much room for confidence in its 
ability to run anything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the really galling thing is that we used to own it.  We 
used to have a piece of it.  It was called Petro-Canada.  Bill 
C-3 puts to bed any idea of ever getting involved in that kind of 
thing again because the powers that be simply will not tolerate 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not being served well.  Ask Californians with their 
energy problems how much they like deregulation.  They are trying 
to re-regulate as fast as they can to save their bacon, to save 
their industries, to save their economic base.  Ask Albertans how 
much they like deregulation.  They always say they do, until the 
price of natural gas goes up 125% in one year.  Thanks a million. 
The free market is really servicing them well.  These outrageous 
gouging costs have to be offset by energy rebates to Albertans 
every month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we never get to the root of the problem.  Rebates are 
just offsetting the profits of the oil companies.  If we are in 
fact being gouged—and we do not know if we are being gouged or 
not—rather than the government intervening to try to put some 
semblance of order into the industry, it is telling us that if we 
are being charged too much it will help us by giving us a little 
bit of money, a $125 lump sum payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not even heat one house for a week in Cambridge Bay, 
Nunavut.  I had phone calls from people in Cambridge Bay, 
Nunavut—I spoke about it in question period today—who were 
complaining that the fuel oil delivery guy will not deliver now 
unless customers have cash up front.  Many people are defaulting 
on their monthly bills.  They have to pay cash in advance to get 
oil to heat their homes.  That is a desperate situation when it 
is 40 degrees below zero or worse in Nunavut.

with what we used to consider our birthright and our property. We 
are not being well served when we cannot even afford to heat our 
homes or we are paying $500 or $600 a month for an 800 square 
foot house in Nunavut.  The $125 rebate will not even heat that 
house for a week.  One cannot be without heat for more than an 
hour in that part of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deregulation has hurt ordinary people.  The previous speaker 
from the Bloc Quebecois was saying that the average joe, the 
little guy, the working person, has suffered in all of this. 
People who own shares in the oil companies have benefited while 
the rest of us have suffered.  Who will stand up for us?  Who 
will be our champion, our advocate?  Who will say on behalf of 
the Canadian people that enough is enough? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who will say that they will find a way to produce and distribute 
energy resources in a way that is fair and equitable so that all 
Canadians can share in the benefit of what is ours, not theirs 
but ours collectively?  That was the dream of Petro-Canada.  The 
government is putting the final stake through the heart of that 
dream as we deal with Bill C-3.  That is nothing to celebrate.  I 
have heard other speakers saying it is great that we are moving 
forward with a whole new way of dealing with our energy 
resources.  We are not.  We are moving backward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People cannot survive without energy.  It is one of the 
fundamental basics.  It gets to be an economic development issue 
because he who has the energy can attract the business.  This is 
why in all the free trade agreements the Americans have been 
quite up front.  They are after our energy resources and our 
water because without those two resources no country will move 
forward.  They are two resources that we used to have in great 
abundance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, frankly, that natural gas might as well be in the United 
States because we have to sell it to our own domestic customers 
at the same price we sell it to our export partners south of the 
border, who have an insatiable appetite for our resources.  Even 
if we run short and are freezing in the dark, we are not allowed 
to turn off the tap once it is turned on.  That is the miracle of 
NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the frustration that Canadians are feeling.  They feel 
that we are no longer in control and that their freely elected 
representatives, like us in the House of Commons, cannot even 
help them.  They are right, because in my opinion somebody 
committed economic treason by signing away our economic 
sovereignty and giving it away for next to nothing in a trade 
agreement that we neither wanted nor voted for.  It does not 
serve ordinary Canadians.  It only serves the powerful and the 
elite or maybe those who have shares in oil companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are worried that we have lost the ability to have any kind of 
national energy strategy.  That is why I recently introduced a 
private member's bill calling on the government to create a 
national energy price commission.  On energy issues the 
commission would at least be an advocate on behalf of ordinary 
Canadians.  It would champion their issues, so that if the oil 
companies wanted to raise the price of gas or home heating fuel 
or whatever, they would have to come before this independent 
tribunal and justify why the increase is warranted.  What is so 
wrong with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Granted, it would be a regulation, and maybe it would be the 
first tentative step toward a new national energy policy that 
would in fact set policy which would provide for ordinary 
Canadians.  Maybe that same energy price commission would say 
that charging the GST on home heating fuel is not only wrong but 
amoral and fundamentally antithetical to anything Canadians 
should be standing for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe that energy price commission would say that we need to 
start investigating more sources of alternative energy.  Maybe it 
would be the think tank that would actually set some energy 
policy.  Perhaps it would say that the real value of a barrel of 
oil is not $25 or $27 but that the whole cost of a barrel of oil 
is about $150, because we have to factor in the price of the 
American military to keep supertankers in the Persian Gulf to get 
the oil out of there and then we have to factor in the 
environmental degradation and the cleanup afterward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the whole cost of burning fossil fuels, all other 
sources of energy seem cheap in comparison.  Even if solar energy 
and wind energy need some investment before we are ready for 
them, that seems like a bargain when we start really viewing what 
burning fossil fuels does to our planet and our environment and 
what the whole cost of that is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are ready to move on.  We would hope that most Canadians are 
also ready to move on and into an era of progress and new 
maturity about our energy resources.  That includes taking the 
bull by the horns and not saying that we cannot do it.  We are 
always making excuses about why we cannot shape our domestic 
policy.  There is a saying I heard that “there are no more 
prizes for predicting rain, that from now on we are only giving 
prizes for building arks”.   There should be no more excuses.

people have to go down to the fuel dealer with five gallon jerry

strategy, and we think that is wrong.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this topic concerns me.  I should like to address 
what I think is a deficiency in the bill, the 18% ownership by 
the Government of Canada of Petro-Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from Saskatchewan.  I should like to draw on the history 
of that province in dealing with this topic.  In 1944 we elected 
a Baptist minister as the premier of that province who embarked 
on a different way of doing things.  There was a lot of state 
intervention, state ownership and state control of the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the very same time in our sister province to the west we 
elected a Baptist minister who believed in self-reliance and the 
market system.  At that time Saskatchewan had approximately one 
and a quarter million people.  Saskatoon and Regina were far 
larger centres than Edmonton and Calgary.  Alberta had 
approximately 600,000 people.  At the end of the last century we 
now see which model has worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saskatchewan has a million people.  Many of the members sitting 
on this side of the House from Alberta are transplanted 
Saskatchewan people.  Even some of the Ontario people are 
transplanted Saskatchewan people.  We have been great at 
exporting people from our province.   Alberta has three million 
people today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This 18% ownership is a reminder of a flawed, failed policy in 
the seventies where the federal government decided to use the 
Saskatchewan model to embark in the economy in a major way.  It 
cost the Canadian economy a lot of money.  It created a lot of 
unity problems that are still lasting in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the Minister for Intergovernmental Affairs were here 
today so we could deal with some of the grievances out west which 
he says do not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the 20th century was a contest among many things.  One 
of the big contests was a contest between a free market driven 
economy and state controlled command style economies.  The 
verdict came in loud and clear— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Perhaps I did not make it clear, and 
I may be jumping in a little too early, but this is the question 
and comment period on the speech of the member who last 
intervened in the debate, the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre.  I 
would ask the member for Prince Albert to wrap up his comments, 
and if he has a question to please deliver it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, almost anyone who 
would look at the history of the 20th century would say that the 
market driven economy clearly is a superior model to a state 
command dictated type of economy. Why does my learned friend keep 
on bringing up a model that has obviously failed as an economic 
model for creating wealth, opportunity and jobs?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what has actually failed 
Canadians is the free market in terms of not being able to ensure 
a regular supply of affordable energy.  Some level of state 
intervention is necessary to regulate that market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member, in his history lesson about the former 
premiers of the two provinces, should keep in mind that the most 
significant difference between those two provinces was the fact 
that in 1947 Leduc No. 1 struck oil.  It is not rocket science to 
start showing a more balanced budget when there is gold coming 
out of the ground in Leduc, Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tommy Douglas was elected premier in 1944.  There were a number 
of things that the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation was known 
for, one of which was medicare.  He was elected on a promise to 
create socialized medicine.  Sometimes people forget that he was 
not able to do that until he had enough money.  It took about 20 
years to implement that promise.  He did it to our collective 
benefit.  It is inarguable that Canadians should thank Tommy 
Douglas for the single thing that we are most proud of. 
<P><A NAME="LINK168"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to preface my remarks with a comment on the remarks from the 
member for Winnipeg Centre.  He led us through an interesting 
discussion though I am not quite sure that he was completely on 
subject.  Still, it was a very interesting discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the question is not whether Canada wants to have a 
private crown corporation run oil firm, but how much that firm 
cost us.  Is it responsible and reasonable to continue in that 
direction today?  Is it time to get out from under that burden of 
debt? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see a tally sheet of what Petro-Canada has cost 
us on one side and the profits that we made on the other side. I 
expect to have that information before we finish the bill in 
committee.  I think then we could get into a very interesting and 
hopefully enlightening debate on whether or not we should keep 
the company in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3, an act to amend the Eldorado Nuclear Limited 
Reorganization and Divestiture Act and the Petro-Canada Public 
Participation Act, will allow for greater foreign ownership of 
the two companies, Petro-Canada and Cameco.  That is plain and 
simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As previous speakers have said, the proposed legislation would 
provide greater flexibility to both companies in their respective 
industries.  It should allow them to continue as well-respected 
participants in the oil, gas and uranium fields.  It should also 
provide them with increased opportunities for strategic 
management and positioning within those sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to repeat something that my colleague from St. 
John's West said when he spoke to the bill in its previous life 
as Bill C-39.  Speaking as a member from Newfoundland, where 
Petro-Canada has a large involvement through its development of 
the Hibernia project and other potential oil and gas fields, he 
said “Even though we can appreciate, perhaps more in 
Newfoundland than anywhere else in the country, what Petro-Canada 
has done for oil and gas development in our province, we also 
must realize that to grow, companies need investment.  We cannot 
restrict that investment or we are putting companies at a 
disadvantage.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not agree more with my colleague.  We all know that we 
operate in a global environment.  Free trade agreements, 
technological advances and developing countries and markets 
require innovative and evolving responses to new challenges and 
opportunities.  It is not in Canada's best interest to restrict 
any company from taking advantage of those opportunities or from 
moving into new and unexplored areas and markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are other issues respecting the legislation that 
still need to be studied and examined as the legislative process 
continues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Petro-Canada is an oil and gas company in a market where 
the price of crude oil has significantly increased over the past 
year.  Petro-Canada has announced record earnings for the year 
2000.  In a press release the company says “Petro-Canada's 
performance reflects both an exceptional business environment and 
our success in capitalizing on that environment.”

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one would argue that if the government is going to take steps 
to get out of the oil and gas business, now could be one of the 
best possible times to do that.  The industry is on a high and 
prices reflect that reality.  With annual net earnings in 2000 of 
$893 million, the company far exceeded its previous high of $306 
million in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the price of oil and gas has increased.  We are 
reminded of that on an almost daily basis when we fill up our 
cars and pay our heating bills.  While this points out the reason 
why companies like Petro-Canada are experiencing record highs, it 
also begs the question of what do Canadian taxpayers get out of 
this deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government has indicated that it is going to divest 
itself of the 18% stake it continues to hold in Petro-Canada, 
taxpayers who funded the purchase of this former crown 
corporation in 1975 need to benefit directly from the 
government's decision to get out of the energy sector.  Many 
Canadians are ready to let Petro-Canada be privatized completely 
and have that money either paid on our national debt or invested 
in alternative and sustainable energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can stipulate certain requirements in the privatization 
process, in this case the location of headquarters, Canadian 
directors and a limit on individual ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Nova Scotia recently announced that it is 
selling its share in Nova Scotia Resources Ltd., a company 
established in 1981 to allow the government to participate in the 
oil and gas industry.  Over the course of time a debt of almost 
$800 million has been amassed.  This is a debt that Nova Scotia 
taxpayers have had to assume.  If the $425 million deal that the 
government announced goes through it will be one less burden on 
Nova Scotia taxpayers and the government will reduce its debt 
load.  That deal allows the government to cut its losses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that now is a favourable time to get out, just 
as it is for the federal government with respect to its position 
in Petro-Canada.  If we are going to privatize, now is the time 
to do it.  It also shows that unless there are public policy 
reasons for direct involvement, the risk inherent in the oil and 
gas industry may outweigh the benefits for governmental 
involvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In both cases, Petro-Canada at the federal level and Nova Scotia 
Resources Ltd. at the provincial level, the decision to get 
directly involved in the oil and gas industry stemmed from global 
conditions of the day, namely the energy crisis.  Petro-Canada 
was established as a crown corporation in 1975 by an act of 
parliament to allow Canada to have a stake in the oil and gas 
industry and improve exploration and development of new oil and 
gas sources within Canada.  This is precisely what happened. 
Petro-Canada went on to make purchases that led to a share in the 
Hibernia project and the gas discoveries off Nova Scotia, as well 
as the tar sands in Alberta.  These are still some of the 
company's primary areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the federal government divested its interest over time 
to the point that today it controls exactly 18.2% of the shares 
but it has no management involvement.  With no public policy 
reasons for its continued participation in the company, the time 
is seen as appropriate for a complete divestiture.  This bill is 
one more step toward that objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill deals with two companies, Petro-Canada and Cameco. 
While many of the points I have already made also apply to 
Cameco, their respective industries are significantly different. 
I would like to discuss those differences for a few moments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cameco is involved in the uranium business.  In fact, it is the 
world's largest uranium company.  As I mentioned, the similarity 
with Petro-Canada is that this legislation will increase the 
percentage of foreign ownership on both an individual and 
aggregate basis, again stipulating that the head office remain in 
Canada, in this case Saskatchewan, and with Canadian directors. 
However, the nuclear industry is quite different from the oil and 
gas industry and Canadians remain skeptical about the safety 
issues surrounding nuclear power, perhaps with good reason. 
The auditor general recently reported to parliament and he 
highlighted some concerns respecting risk assessments at Canada's 
nuclear power generators.  As well, the issue of disposal of 
radioactive waste remains largely unanswered.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been told that the legislation in no way affects the 
non-proliferation policy and uranium will continue to be sold 
only to those countries that are signatory to the 
non-proliferation agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>World markets are changing dramatically, and by loosening rules 
on foreign ownership, it is anticipated that this will provide 
Cameco with increased opportunity to take advantage of new 
opportunities and new market conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What both of these companies highlight is Canada's and the 
world's dependence on energy sources, whether those sources be 
oil and gas or nuclear.  There are a lot of exciting developments 
taking place in both of these sectors.  The Mackenzie Delta 
pipeline looks like it could soon become a reality and new 
nuclear reactors have increased safeguards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada needs to be in a position to take advantage of these new 
prospects and new technologies.  I look forward to studying the 
legislation more closely at committee to see whether the 
legislation will benefit Canadian taxpayers and be one step 
toward helping these companies position themselves for future 
growth and productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, the issue here is exactly that.  Does the 
legislation benefit Canadian taxpayers?  It would be my position 
that the legislation does benefit Canadian taxpayers.  There is a 
significant difference between developments in the petrochemical 
and petroleum industry energy sector and the nuclear and uranium 
industry sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we have to take a look at in committee.  This is 
only the first time the bill has been debated.  We will have an 
opportunity to discuss it further, and we plan to have some more 
numbers to look at when we come back to parliament the next time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell (Yukon, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the last 
intervention was quite thoughtful.  I will comment on the 
ownership later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker, my colleague from the NDP, was a little 
off topic when he was talked about things in NAFTA only going to 
the elite.  That precludes all the workers who have got thousands 
upon thousands of jobs because of NAFTA.  They are not elite, 
they are every day working people.  It also precludes the 
lowering of prices because those poor people do not have to pay 
tariffs that they artificially had to pay before the agreement. 
I find it difficult that the NDP would call those poor people and 
the workers who have benefited from that elite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said that he would like to hear this side of the House 
just say once that demand management is good.  I will say that I 
think demand management is good.  In fact, if he would like to be 
positive on this point, perhaps he should consider making an 
enumeration of the hundreds of initiatives of provincial and 
federal governments that are helping save energy across this 
country.  They have for decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both he and the previous speaker were back on the topic of the 
energy program, which has been mentioned numerous times.  They 
talked about some examples where it may not have gone to the most 
appropriate person.  This is getting a bit tedious.  We got the 
message.  I do not think there has been any program in history 
dealing with millions of people that has always been right.  The 
bottom line is millions of poor people benefited from that 
program, which is good.  In fact, the argument by the member from 
the Bloc got so circuitous at one point when he complained about 
children having money to buy clothes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said there should be a more in-depth discussion on 
globalization.  He was referring to poverty again, which is 
great, admirable and a good topic to discuss.  However, maybe he 
missed my remarks yesterday when I talked about the in-depth 
analysis which showed that globalization reduces the tariff 
barriers and the customs that poor people would have to pay.  It 
reduces the control of companies that are hiding behind tariff 
barriers. 
It opens up markets for those poor and undeveloped countries. 
Poorer people can now market their goods more easily because they 
do not have to cross a huge tariff barrier.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My last comment is related to the point about the ownership of 
Petro-Canada, which has been raised by most of the Alliance 
members.  We live in a free market economy in the western world. 
We believe basically that the market in appropriate circumstances 
should work freely and bring lower prices.  Therefore, we can all 
have those lower prices.  However, the market does not always 
work perfectly by itself.  There are times when there needs to be 
government intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally believe that the effort of this bill to maintain 
Petro-Canada's 18% in government control is a good safeguard in 
the event that we need to be involved in this industry when it is 
in a oligopoly position.  When there are only a few large 
companies involved, it is good to have a player from the 
government to keep track of what is going on and to be on the 
ground in the day to day involvement of pricing and operations. 
That way we get a true picture of the on the ground situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would help the concerns of every member in the House with 
things like prices of energy, which we are all concerned about. 
A closer attachment to the operation of what is going on, such as 
the partial control of Petro-Canada, would be a benefit to us 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I realize the member is a 
new member of parliament and I welcome him to the House.  I 
understand he spoke here before, but it is the first time I have 
had an opportunity to reply to one of his questions.  We look 
forward to many more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made several points but I would like to respond to two of 
them. First, the member for Yukon made reference to the oil 
rebate and said that it helped millions of people.  Imagine how 
many people it could have helped had it been applied fairly and 
with any sense of conscience whatsoever?  I mean this was child 
simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had $1.4 billion.  It wanted to give an energy 
rebate to Canadians who needed it most.  The Liberals decided 
that the venue they would use to choose those Canadians was the 
GST rebate.  It made good sense.  All they had to do to make that 
work was ask for an energy receipt showing that people had paid 
their oil or electrical bill or bought fuel wood.  Lots of 
provinces have done it.  It is not complicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would guess, and I do not think I am too far wrong but we will 
never get the real numbers out of this crowd, that 50% of the 
$1.4 billion or $1.3 billion, or whatever it was, was wasted. 
There were double cheques, triple cheques, quadruple cheques to 
one household.  We could have a widow living on one side of the 
street in a two bedroom bungalow who received $125.  On the other 
side of the street there could be a married couple who received 
$250.  Explain to me how that got money to Canadians who needed 
it.  Explain to me how that is fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hopeless.  The government cannot even give away $1.4 
billion and do a good job at it.  It is scandalous.  Do not try 
to defend that, it is not worth it.  He made some good points but 
he should not defend the oil rebate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue is the Petro-Canada position.  Now is the time 
to get out of Petro-Canada.  Do not delay.  Sell the shares. 
There is lots of money out there.  Its shares are at a premium 
price.  The government does not have any managerial position in 
Petro-Canada.  It holds 18.2% of the shares.  It does not make 
decisions any longer on Petro-Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to put a board and a director in place.  All of 
those people will have stipends.  All of those people will get 
per diems.  All or some of those people will be on salary.  We 
are going to create a bureaucracy where there is no need to 
create one.  We have a good opportunity to sell our shares and 
get out from under a burden of debt.  Now is the time to do it. 
We can get the most money for our investment.  Let us move on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell:</B>  Mr. Speaker, who owns more than 18% in 
Petro-Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did not hear the exact 
question but it was something about who owns more than 18% in 
Petro-Canada. 
We own 18.2% of the shares.  The rest of the shares are owned 
throughout the country.  This will open them up to foreign 
ownership as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The 18.2% is a non-managerial position.  We do not make the 
decisions regarding Petro-Canada, nor should we make them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Petro-Canada had its place.  Petro-Canada helped start the 
Hibernia field.  It helped develop Panuke and Cohasset off Sable 
Island.  I worked in those oilfields for eight years as a 
driller.  Petro-Canada was needed then.  It was a wildcat 
operation with high pressure and deep wells.  It had some of the 
iffiest wells being drilled in the world at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However those days are gone.  We found the gas and oil.  We have 
better technology.  We can drill faster and cheaper and can find 
gas and oil better than we ever could before.  We no longer have 
the high risk in the energy sector that used to be there.  It is 
time to move on and sell the shares.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise on behalf of the constituents 
of Calgary East to talk about Bill C-3 pertaining to Eldorado 
Nuclear Limited Reorganization and also to Petro-Canada Public 
Participation Act, Bill C-39. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically the bill allows both companies greater access to sell 
themselves and to get more outside shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance has no problem with the bill as such.  Our 
natural resources critic will allay whatever fears he has when 
the bill goes to committee.  We will be supporting the bill as it 
now stands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also talks about Petro-Canada and the attempt by the 
government to increase individual share ownership and remove 
non-resident ownership.  I wish to draw attention to the oil 
sector as we are talking about Petro-Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometime last summer the Calgary caucus, the members of 
parliament from Calgary, showed through calculations how much 
money the federal government was taking from Canadians through 
taxes on gasoline.  It was interesting.  We highlighted that 
there was a tax on a tax.  The GST on gasoline was a tax on a 
tax.  The government levied the excise tax and whatever the other 
taxes were, and then the GST came in on top of every other tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We came out and said that it was double taxation and it should 
be removed.  We called on the federal government to reduce taxes 
on gasoline.  This was a cry that went out when gas prices went 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When gas prices went up the government resisted reducing taxes, 
despite what we showed them.  It did so because it was reaping 
benefits from the tax on gasoline prices.  Who was benefiting 
from increasing gas prices?  The federal government.  It 
benefited because of the way the tax structure is set up on 
gasoline.  As prices and the excise tax went up, the 7% GST on 
top of that started to reap windfall profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At no time did the government think it necessary to return the 
money it was getting, the windfall profits, back to the taxpayer 
by reducing taxes.  No, the government kept the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the government tried to offer what I will call a band-aid 
solution to the rise in heating oil prices.  My colleague from 
the Conservative Party indicated to the government that it was a 
very ill-conceived program.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example.  I got over 50 calls to my office from 
Canadians talking about their heating bills and how unfair they 
were.  People say that when the government wants money from them, 
it takes the money right away through Revenue Canada with no 
questions asked.  However when it comes time to give the money 
back the government brings in a stupid, ill thought program 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what happened.  The government decided that those 
eligible for the GST refund would receive the rebate.  Just for a 
second let us think about the GST refund.  It is the goods and 
services tax imposed uniformly across the country.  That is fine. 
We can understand the government giving GST rebates across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is now trying to give money to homeowners, a 
segment which is not uniform across the country, but which needs 
money to pay for heating costs.  Suddenly people who did not pay 
heating costs and had no heating bills were receiving the 
cheques.  Those who paid heating costs were not receiving the 
cheques.  Children were receiving the cheques while parents, who 
paid the heating bills, were not.  Naturally they phoned our 
offices to say it was unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point is that the GST rebate is based on the previous 
year's income.  In this case it was based upon income from 1999. 
The heating oil crisis is in the year 2001, not 1999.  Why is the 
government basing the rebate on the year 1999?  There were 
changes in 2000 where people were not earning the same amount of 
money and needed help.  However they did not qualify because 
their income from 1999 was slightly higher than it was in 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government in its haste, without thinking, brought in the 
plan.  We have heard the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Finance say that the government has given money to 11 million 
Canadians.  It may have given money to 11 million Canadians, but 
were they the 11 million who needed the relief?  Were they the 
ones paying the heating bills?  No, they were not.  That is why 
even prisoners were getting cheques.  Does the government think 
prisoners pay heating bills in penitentiaries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have an ill conceived program, as is normal.  Half the 
programs coming from that side are like that.  All my colleagues 
here have received numerous calls from their constituents on this 
foolhardy program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government gave back $1.2 billion to the Canadian public 
without thinking.  What an idiotic program.  If it wanted to 
really help there were ways it could have done so.  It has a huge 
bureaucracy.  Could all those bureaucrats and mandarins not have 
thought up a plan where those who were paying would get a cheque? 
No, they did not.  They used a quick solution without thinking 
about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has wasted $1.2 billion.  Canadians notice the 
unfairness of the system, the unfairness of the high taxes they 
pay.  The government has stated that it will reduce taxes, but 
the way taxes are being reduced is not uniform.
