34(1), I have the honour of presenting to this House, in both 
official languages, the Canada-Europe Parliamentary 
Association's report on the annual meeting of the Conference on 
Security and Co-operation in Europe, or CSCE, at its 
parliamentary assembly held in Helsinki, Finland, from July 6 to

	He said: Mr. Speaker, I have a very short explanation.
<P>
	During the discussions regarding the North American Free 
Trade Agreement questions were asked whether the passage of 
that legislation would not facilitate the sale of water from 
Canada to the United States and Mexico through interbasin 
transfers. While there may be some concerns in people's minds, 
this bill will put those to rest because it would simply prohibit 
the export of water by interbasin transfers from Canada to either 
the U.S. or Mexico.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I apologize for having to read such a lengthy motion, but I 
think there is unanimous consent for its adoption today.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Perhaps in future if the hon. member has 
motions such as these and if there is unanimous consent on all 
sides, we could agree to dispense. I am only saying that for some 
future consideration.
<P>
	I was thinking while the hon. member was going through it, 
what would have happened if he had had to repeat the whole 
thing again. That would have been something else.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	The House has heard the terms of the motion. Is it the pleasure 
of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, certainly I support the thrust of the motion.
<P>
	There is one amendment I would like to suggest that I hope 
would meet with the consent of the House. It relates to the 
proposed committee in paragraph (2)(k), the committee on 
human rights and the status of the disabled.
<P>
	The previous committee that existed that looked at this 
subject matter was a committee known as the committee on 
human rights and the status of disabled persons.
<P>
	Certainly as a member of that former committee I recall that 
people with disabilities felt very strongly that they did not wish 
to be labelled as ``the disabled''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I note that, in French, the committee's name refers to disabled 
persons.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would also note that under subparagraph 4(c) in the mandate 
of the committee it refers to: ``the proposing, promoting, 
monitoring and assessing of initiatives aimed at the integration 
and equality of disabled persons in all sectors of Canadian 
society''.
<P>
	We are talking about people fundamentally. I would hope that 
it would meet with the agreement of the House that we maintain 
the previous name of this committee which was human rights 
and the status of disabled persons.
<P>
	I would so move if that meets with the consent of the House.
<P>
	(Amendment agreed to.)

	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order to set today's debate in context.
<P>
	Today is the first of many debates to come. In recent years, 
governments have regarded Parliament as an afterthought in 
policy development or have neglected it completely.
<P>
	I made a promise to the Canadian people during the last 
federal election that I would restore respect and relevance to the 
House of Commons. That is why today we are debating the role 
of Canadian peacekeeping and tomorrow, cruise missile testing.
<P>
	Also, I would like to announce today that next week for the 
first time in Canadian history this Chamber will be used as a 
forum for pre-budget consultations with members of 
Parliament. This will be the first time members of Parliament 
will be able to discuss important budgetary issues before the 
budget is prepared.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, today's debate concerns the Bosnian issue. 
Tomorrow, we will be looking into cruise missile testing, into 
whether we should authorize Americans to test their missiles 
over Canadian soil. Next week, we will be discussing the 
budget.
<P>
	As I was saying in this House, yesterday, we are trying out an 
entirely new political process. In the past, members were always 
asked to comment after the fact which meant, for someone in the 
opposition, to oppose a decision, once it was already too late to 
have a real influence on the government's decision. This 
procedure is without precedent. I hope members will try their 
very best to make it efficient in order to allow the expression of 
views, after which the government will decide. It has been said, 
by some, that no vote will be taking place in this kind of debate. 
Since its purpose is to make views known to government before 
a decision is taken, it is quite naturally so.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	If opposition members or even members of my own party 
disagree with the decision taken, they can always, in the 
traditional way, make a motion of non-confidence against the 
government. I hope members will have,  through this new 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="262"> 262 </A></B>
<P>
procedure, better opportunity to express their views and that 
debates will be more dispassionate and less partisan.
<P>
	I take advantage of this opportunity to congratulate all 
members of the House. The press will have noted, and 
Canadians as well, I hope, that the atmosphere is much better 
than it used to be. All this evidently depends both on the 
opposition and, very much so, on the government. I have asked 
my ministers to restrain themselves since it is so easy, when one 
is the last to speak, to make that one last satisfying stab which is 
so upsetting to the members opposite.
<P>
	The new discipline demonstrated by this House is therefore 
welcome, and I wish to congratulate all members on their 
attitude. I would invite them to express their views in all candor 
during the three coming debates concerning Canada's 
peacekeeping role, the cruise missile testing and, next week, the 
preliminary debate on the budget which is to be tabled in this 
House before the end of February.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on the Prime Minister's point of order. I would like to thank 
the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs for 
making possible this debate and making it possible before the 
government arrives at a policy decision.
<P>
	I would like to make one further suggestion in the spirit of 
what the Prime Minister said and that is to suggest that in future 
we depart from the custom of having party leaders necessarily 
lead off debates. It seems to me we could make a better 
contribution by simply sitting and listening to what other 
members are saying. If we participate, we could perhaps 
participate toward the end of the debate and attempt to define the 
common ground that has been defined by members and provide a 
basis for the government's policy. Thank you, Mr. Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
also like to add my congratulations to the Prime Minister for 
undertaking these debates in the House of Commons. I think 
they are very important. The Prime Minister has said these are a 
test and something that is being tried. I would suggest the real 
test is when the government listens to a variety of points of view. 
I appreciate that the Prime Minister has undertaken this.
<P>
	As we are debating Bosnia today, I would like to say very 
briefly that I am sure that everyone in Canada shares the view of 
our party, that we appreciate the great work that the RCMP and 
the peacekeepers are doing in Bosnia.
<P>
	Again I want to thank the Prime Minister for this opportunity 
and I hope the government will listen to what I think will be a 
real range of constructive debate in the interests of the country. 
We will all have our partisan points of view but I think that all of 
us have the interest  of the country at heart both in our 
international and national roles. I look forward to these debates.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
join my colleague from Yukon, the Leader of the Reform Party 
and the Prime Minister in saying what an excellent idea it is to 
allow such debates in Parliament, so much the better if they 
contribute to more constructive exchanges in this House. For 
that matter, this purpose coincides well with the sentiments 
expressed by the government in the Throne Speech.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	This being said, while we are on the subject of the way this 
Parliament operates, I would like to add a comment.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	Since we are reflecting on how this Parliament works I do 
want to say that we welcome this opportunity to participate in 
debate and will participate actively and open up the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	I do, though, want to take this opportunity on the issue of the 
workings of this Parliament to restate our concern that even 
though the independent members in this place are considered 
independent by the Chair and number only 12, we represent 25 
per cent of the vote that was cast in the general election.
<P>
	There is still an outstanding concern that I raised with you on 
a question of privilege that really deals with two issues. One is 
what place will be left to these members of Parliament to speak 
in this House.
<P>
	It is a very fundamental issue because the Prime Minister and 
I think a lot of members who have joined with him have said that 
in this place we want to offer all members an opportunity to 
participate in a different type of debate.
<P>
	For that to happen it requires that members be able to first 
participate. If that is the spirit of this new House I welcome it. 
But I must voice some concern.
<P>
	I will leave you with one last note. On the element of the 
matter just dealt with by the House with unanimous consent, 
there was no consultation. I did not object because I do not want 
to be in this chair objecting constantly to what is coming forth 
but for me that is an example of things that do come forth that in 
more normal circumstances would require, if this is a new House 
and a new way to operate, some consultation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Mr. Speaker, I simply want to 
thank the Prime Minister for this initiative. It is a new initiative 
that I believe the previous government did not use at all in terms 
of providing an opportunity for parliamentarians to have a role 
in policy making.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has indicated in the House on a number of 
occasions that this will provide an opportunity for all members 
who are interested in the issue to state their views on behalf of 
their constituents.
<P>
	I assume that on debate today if necessary we will not see the 
clock in order that all members who wish to participate will have 
an opportunity if more time is required.
<P>

	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note of the political, humanitarian and military 
dimensionsof Canada's peacekeeping role, including in the former Yugoslavia, and of 
possible future direction in Canadian peacekeeping policy and operations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
He said: During his visit to Europe, the Prime Minister was 
asked whether the government would be maintaining Canadian 
troops in the former Yugoslavia in the spring. The Prime 
Minister replied that no decision would be made until the matter 
could be debated in this House. You will remember that when the 
previous government decided to send troops to the former 
Yugoslavia, there was no debate, Parliament was not consulted 
and at the time our party strongly opposed the fact that a 
decision as important as this could be made without consulting 
Parliament.
<P>
	Today, the motion being tabled before the House and inviting 
all members to express their views on the issue is, as the Prime 
Minister pointed out, in line with our party's commitment to 
consult with members of Parliament before making any serious 
and momentous decisions.
<P>
	Our decision, whatever it may be, will have a heavy impact on 
our future role in peacekeeping, our foreign policy and our 
defence policy.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	We must also bear in mind that the position we take will affect 
our relations with countries that are friends or allies, or with 
countries that are very deeply involved in or affected by the 
conflict raging in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	The government's position on the broad question of the place 
of peacekeeping in Canada's foreign and defence policies is well 
known. We are on record as stating that was intend to strengthen 
Canada's leadership role in international peacekeeping.
<P>
	In the upcoming foreign and defence policy reviews, we will 
be examining a variety of ways in which this can be done, many 
of which we elaborated in the red book. I know that all of you 
have had an opportunity to read it, you are all familiar with it, 
but all the same I would like, if you permit, Mr. Speaker, to cite a 
few examples for the record.
<P>
	We feel it is important, first of all, to re-examine the notion of 
stand-by forces for peacekeeping. Second, we think it is 
important to look at the training of  peacekeepers; and third, we 
think it is important to review our procurement policies.
<P>
	In any debate on peacekeeping, I feel we have to start by 
placing the issue in the context of Canada's historical 
contribution to peacekeeping, and go on to discuss the 
tremendous upheavals that affect the very nature of 
peacekeeping operations.
<P>
	Ever since the initiative taken in 1956 by former Prime 
Minister and then External Affairs Minister Lester B. Pearson, 
Canada has been closely associated in the minds of Canadians 
and of other countries with leadership and expertise in 
peacekeeping. For years we have participated in the 
overwhelming majority of peacekeeping operations mandated 
by the Security Council.
<P>
	We continue today to contribute to most of the missions, 
including, I would like to say, the most difficult ones. As you 
know, the government has clearly stated its conviction that 
peacekeeping is a very important component of Canada's 
contribution to the multilateral system and the preservation of 
peace in the world.
<P>
	Canadians have always believed in the value of promoting 
multilateral mechanisms for security and crisis management. 
Peacekeeping is one of the most important of these mechanisms. 
Our approach to peacekeeping is rooted in a wider view, which 
seeks to promote the prevention of conflicts before they begin, 
and the peaceful resolution of conflicts already under way.
<P>
	Over the years, Canada has developed guidelines governing 
its participation in peacekeeping operations. Let me summarize 
them.
<P>
	There must be a clear, achievable mandate from a competent 
political authority, such as the Security Council.
<P>
	Then, the parties to the conflict must undertake to respect a 
ceasefire and, of course, must accept the presence of Canadian 
troops.
<P>
	In addition, the peacekeeping operation must be in support of 
a process aimed at achieving a political settlement.
<P>
	Finally, the number of troops and the international 
composition of the operation must be suited to the mandate. The 
operation must be adequately funded, and have a satisfactory 
logistical structure.
<P>
	These are the broad guidelines that Canada has traditionally 
used to make its decisions on its participation in a peace 
mission. If we review each of these points, we will see that in 
some ways the previous government did not follow these criteria 
in deciding whether to commit itself, as was the case with the 
former Yugoslavia.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="264"> 264 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	In the past, it would seem that the amount of risk incurred by 
our soldiers was rarely a problem. This is no longer the case; the 
risk factor has become an essential element in our 
decision-making.
<P>
	I would invite hon. members to take this aspect, this new 
dimension, into consideration in their remarks today.
<P>
	While these guidelines are still valid, the international setting 
in which peacekeeping operations occur has changed radically 
since 1989, and will in my opinion continue to evolve. I would 
therefore welcome the views of the House in this regard.
<P>
	Traditionally, let me repeat, peacekeeping operations have 
been launched when the parties to a conflict concluded that their 
purposes would no longer be served by the continuation of an 
armed conflict but by a settlement negotiated with the aid of a 
third party. Peacekeepers were thus deployed to monitor a 
ceasefire or the withdrawal of troops from disputed zones.
<P>
	But in 1989 and 1990 far more extensive peacekeeping 
operations were introduced, designed to assist the parties 
involved to implement a negotiated settlement to a conflict. In 
Cambodia, for example, the United Nations had a mandate to 
disarm the factions, establish security throughout the country, 
repatriate refugees, ensure respect for human rights, supervise 
the key departments of the national government and organize 
provisional elections. Thus a very important civilian component 
was added to the traditional military presence.
<P>
	A new concept, that of humanitarian intervention, was 
introduced in Bosnia and Somalia. Our soldiers were not sent 
there to enforce a ceasefire or preserve a peace that obviously 
did not exist and still does not exist. Their mandate was to help 
humanitarian convoys get through. The example of Somalia in 
particular shows that this type of intervention can have very 
positive results, for despite the problems we hear about, most of 
them centred on Mogadishu, the humanitarian crisis in the rest 
of the country has been largely surmounted.
<P>
	The Secretary-General of the United Nations has 
acknowledged this process of evolution in the declaration he 
called his agenda for peace, which is based on the principle that 
conflict management requires a whole range of tools, one of 
which is peacekeeping. The international community's 
objectives have thus become much more ambitious: to prevent 
conflicts, to consolidate or restore peace by diplomatic means 
such as mediation or good offices, to keep the peace and even to 
undertake the political and social reconstruction of ruined 
societies.
<P>
	Some operations contain a mixture of these elements. The 
term ``peacekeeping'' has taken on a character I would qualify 
as rather elastic, often extending beyond the concept of forces of 
intervention, as seen in Cyprus, for example.
<P>
	It is important to note the international context that has made 
this process of evolution possible. The end of the confrontation 
between the two superpowers has opened the way-at least so 
far-for an unprecedented degree of consensus on the Security 
Council. Traditionally, the members of the Security Council 
used their right of veto to prevent intervention on a number of 
occasions.
<P>
	More recently, thanks to this new consensus, the Security 
Council has been able in the last few years to exercise an 
authority that is indeed recognized by the United Nations 
charter but that has until now existed only on paper.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	It must be recognized that this process flies in the face of our 
preconceived notions about the nature of peacekeeping and how 
the international community should respond. Without wishing 
to launch into a terminological discourse, let me point out that 
the new concepts used by the Secretary-General in the agenda 
for peace each have a specific meaning. The term 
``peacemaking'' refers to essentially diplomatic activities 
pursued to resolve a conflict, while ``peace enforcement'' is a 
situation where the international community uses force against a 
member state, as in the gulf war.
<P>
	As you will see, Mr. Speaker, what complicates things a great 
deal is that an element of force is increasingly being introduced 
in the Security Council resolutions mandating peacekeeping 
operations and, in a way, changing them into peace enforcement 
operations. This is obviously the case with Somalia and also 
with Bosnia.
<P>
	The effects of these changes on the United Nations are 
obvious. The UN suddenly finds itself in a position where it 
must manage operations involving over 68,000 soldiers 
worldwide. This increase has had a profound impact on the cost 
of peacekeeping. Canada's assessed peacekeeping 
contributions, for example, have remained at a steady 3.11 per 
cent of the total UN peacekeeping budget in the past five years. 
In absolute terms, however, Canada's contributions have risen 
from $10 million to $12 million in 1991-92 to some $130 
million today. That is a substantial contribution, which requires 
us to think and very closely review the commitments we must 
make in this field; we shall pay very close attention to any 
suggestions parliamentarians make to us in this House during 
this debate. Clearly, the UN does not have the human, financial 
or technical resources for this task.
<P>
	To make up this shortfall, the UN is relying more and more on 
regional organizations such as the Conference on Security and 
Co-operation in Europe, the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization, the Organization of American States, and the 
Organization for African Unity. This co-operation between the 
UN and regional organizations was foreseen in the charter of the 
UN,
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="265"> 265 </A></B>
<P>
but its extent in practice is new. Here again, I would like the  
House to inform us of its views on the implications of this trend.
<P>
	The sharp rise in the number of peace missions has brought 
many challenges with it. First of all, there are political 
challenges, as the international community is increasingly 
taking on responsibility for situations that, just a short time ago, 
were confined to the internal affairs of the states involved. Then 
there are military challenges, as we see a demand-which is 
growing constantly, and at an exponential rate-for soldiers 
adequately trained and equipped for missions as dangerous as 
they are complex. I will not hide the fact that, because our 
Canadian soldiers are very competent and very well trained, 
they are in demand worldwide. As soon as there is a request at 
the UN for a new peace force, people spontaneously think of 
Canadians and ask them to participate in these peace efforts. I 
am talking about challenges: political challenges and military 
challenges; but I am also talking about the financial challenges 
created by operations with personnel numbering in the tens of 
thousands, rather than the few thousands of yesteryear.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	To meet these new challenges, the UN and its member 
countries will have to thoroughly review the way peacekeeping 
operations are managed.
<P>
	At the national level, we will have to be ever more critical 
about the commitments we make, and especially about how we 
determine to make such commitments.
<P>
	At the international level, it is urgent that the UN's capacity to 
respond quickly and professionally to crises be reinforced.
<P>
	Canada responds generously to requests for experts by the 
United Nations and regional organizations. The 
Secretary-General's military advisor is a Canadian, General 
Baril, and many other Canadians have been made available to 
the United Nations and the CSCE. We pay our financial 
contributions in full and on time and have submitted to the 
Secretary-General recommendations on making the UN 
structure more effective.
<P>
	We are determined to increase this effort and to exercise the 
leadership that other countries expect from us in this field.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would say that the Canadian men and women serving under 
the United Nations banner are saving lives and relieving misery. 
None of us will forget the poignant images of the soldiers who 
aided the helpless victims in a hospital in Bosnia. It is also clear 
their living conditions are increasingly dangerous. Here another 
picture comes to mind, that of the 11 Canadian soldiers 
threatened by Serbian troops near Sarajevo last month.
<P>
	Events in Bosnia are thus very much in the public eye. The 
powerful images of the suffering of the Bosnian people and the 
challenge facing our troops have became an integral part of the 
evening news. However we must  look beyond these images to 
the larger questions which Bosnia poses.
<P>
	These questions, I submit, fall into two categories: the future 
of our commitment to the UN effort in Bosnia itself and the 
implications of this episode for our peacekeeping policy 
generally. These are the questions with which the government is 
now wrestling. The views of the House and of the public 
generally are of critical importance to our deliberations.
<P>
	In discussing events in Bosnia we must bear in mind certain 
factors that have guided our actions to date. To begin with, we 
must recognize that there are two relatively distinct operations 
taking place in the former Yugoslavia. Though both are taking 
place under the banner of one UN operation, the United Nations 
protection force, they are quite different in terms of the 
activities under way and the dangers they face.
<P>
	First, in Croatia our peacekeepers are engaged in a relatively 
traditional UN operation. There are two distinct sides and they 
have agreed to respect a stable ceasefire line while they are 
negotiating over a permanent settlement to their differences. 
While these negotiations are in progress the two sides have 
asked the UN to provide an international force to monitor the 
ceasefire and patrol the line. The situation is relatively stable 
though that stability is highly dependent upon events in Bosnia. 
I could say-and I am sure the Minister of Defence will expand 
on this-our troops there are not at high risk. This is 
peacekeeping as we understand it and have practised it for 
several decades.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	Second, in Bosnia however the situation is radically different. 
There is no ceasefire and there are certainly no lines. Even the 
desire to negotiate seems to be lacking. In these circumstances 
the UN Security Council has mandated our forces to engage in 
assisting in the provision of humanitarian relief to the civilians 
caught in the middle of the conflict and in providing protection 
through a small military presence in Srebrenica, a UN 
designated safe area.
<P>
	Our actions in Srebrenica are a perfect example of the 
evolution of peacekeeping to which I referred earlier. It remains 
an environment in which the peacekeepers require the 
permission of the parties to the conflict to go about their duties.
<P>
	The task in Bosnia is an infinitely more difficult and 
dangerous one than that which our peacekeepers have 
traditionally faced. In addition to the dangers of simply 
operating in a war zone, we must face the fact that some of the 
factions do not always want the humanitarian aid to get through.
<P>
	For all of these dangers it has been argued however that the 
UN force is making a critical contribution. The UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees and the Red Cross have confirmed 
that aid is getting through. People who would otherwise be dead 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="266"> 266 </A></B>
<P>
are alive today. Canadian troops  have played a vital role in this 
effort and continue to do so.
<P>
	Beyond this humanitarian effort it is often pointed out that 
Canada's presence in Bosnia has served to demonstrate our 
continuing commitment to act with our NATO allies in the 
promotion of European security. It also demonstrates to the 
world that Canada is a nation which is prepared to carry out its 
international obligations under difficult circumstances, while 
others are merely willing to offer advice from the sidelines.
<P>
	At the same time serious questions must be asked as we debate 
our continuing participation in these UN forces. Is there a 
reasonable prospect of any progress in the peace process in the 
foreseeable future? Will sufficient humanitarian aid continue to 
get through? At what point will the dangers to our troops 
outweigh the benefits of our presence there?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Concerning the first question, I am in constant 
communication with my colleagues who also have many troops 
in the region. I have spoken today with the French minister of 
foreign affairs about the situation and I intend in the coming 
days to speak with Secretary Hurd who has just returned from 
Bosnia and who will give us a personal evaluation of the 
situation on the ground. France, Great Britain and Canada are 
the three countries that have contributed the most troops in the 
region. It is clear that we will want to co-ordinate our efforts.
<P>
	We think that the only solution is a negotiated solution. We 
think it is essential that we pressure the factions to come to a 
negotiated solution. We will increase our diplomatic efforts in 
order to put pressure on those who are the natural friends of the 
factions so that those who are in a better position than others can 
speak to the Serbs, the Croats, the Muslims, can convince them 
that the only solution is a negotiated peace, not prolonging the 
war.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	And I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, that beyond the military 
operations involved in peacekeeping or in escorting 
humanitarian convoys, we will strive unceasingly through 
diplomatic channels to find a solution to this conflict.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to refer briefly to the recent NATO summit where 
the question of the dangers faced by our troops was the subject 
of much debate. In particular the topic of air strikes as a means 
of relieving the pressures on our troops was prominent in major 
reports of the summit.
<P>
	Because some confusion seems to exist in the public mind I 
would like to take advantage of this timely opportunity to clarify 
the government position on the subject of air strikes and our 
understanding of the procedures in place for their authorization. 
I hope these clarifications will be helpful not only to members of  
Parliament and the public at large but will also be beneficial to 
the press that have made some comments in this regard which I 
felt were sometimes out of context.
<P>
	Essentially there are two distinct scenarios for air strikes. The 
first envisages the case where UN troops are directly under 
attack. In this specific case NATO agreed in June that the 
commander of the UNPROFOR could call on the UN Secretary- 
General to authorize an air strike to assist UN troops where they 
are under attack.
<P>
	The fact that the UN Secretary-General would be the ultimate 
authority for an air strike under these conditions was insisted 
upon by Canada in view of the highly charged political 
considerations which would surround such decisions. There 
would be no debate within NATO before the strike was carried 
out as time would be of the essence.
<P>
	We agree with this procedure. We think it is appropriate that if 
our troops are under attack we should be able to respond. An air 
strike under these circumstances might be necessary and we are 
fully in agreement with this.
<P>
	The second type of air strike would be intended to remove an 
obstacle to UNPROFOR's performance of its duties in 
circumstances where there was no direct threat to UNPROFOR 
troops. The proposed air strike would thus be less time urgent. 
Under these circumstances the commander of UNPROFOR 
would submit a request for such an air strike to the 
Secretary-General of the United Nations who must give his 
authorization as in the first case. The request would also be 
discussed in the North Atlantic Council of NATO. The North 
Atlantic Council must agree to support the request.
<P>
	The North Atlantic Council operates by means of consensus. 
Therefore no decision to launch an air strike under these 
circumstances could be made unless all allies agreed to it. 
Canada's position on this question is well known and would 
guide our representative to the North Atlantic Council in such 
debate.
<P>
	We have said and we repeat that in the second case we do not 
believe that an air strike would be conducive to solving current 
situations. In fact we have said on numerous occasions that air 
strikes should be the last resort. We believe the use of an air 
strike could jeopardize the humanitarian aid process and put our 
soldiers in great danger.
<P>
	We want it abundantly clear that obviously this is a decision 
that would have to be discussed and agreed to within NATO by 
unanimous consent, including obviously the acceptance by 
Canada.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="267"> 267 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	We have said that the only reason we would agree to such use 
of air strikes would be if our military people were telling us that 
it was okay to go ahead with it. It would be done only with the 
acceptance and recommendation of our military officers.
<P>
	With respect to the second broad issue before us, the 
implications of Bosnia for our peacekeeping policy generally, it 
would seem that events in Bosnia provide a clear example of 
what I have been saying about the way in which peacekeeping is 
developing.
<P>
	We must recognize the decisions we make regarding the 
continuation of our commitment to UN operations in Bosnia 
must be taken in the context of our considerations of Canada's 
willingness to remain involved in the broadening range of 
peacekeeping activities.
<P>
	My remarks have been intended to raise several questions, 
questions about the future of peacekeeping generally and 
questions about the related subject of our future in Bosnia. In the 
immediate terms, the government must make a decision about 
the future of our commitment in Bosnia. We want to hear the 
views of this House on that subject.
<P>
	As for the longer term issue of Canada's peacekeeping policy 
generally, we intend to consult with individual Canadians as part 
of the ongoing review of our foreign and defence policies. The 
parliamentary committee on foreign affairs will be asked to 
make suggestions and recommendations on our foreign policies.
<P>
	I understand that the minister of defence will ask the 
parliamentary committee on defence and security to do a similar 
study. I suspect that these two parliamentary committees will 
hear witnesses, will travel throughout the country and will seek 
advice and opinions from Canadians on the evolution and 
revisions of our foreign policy and our defence policy. 
Therefore I am sure that the parliamentary committees in the 
general context of peacekeeping operations will certainly want 
to pursue debate and discussion and give advice to the 
government.
<P>
	On the more immediate question of whether or not in March 
we should stay in Bosnia or leave is one on which we would ask 
parliamentarians to express their views today because this is a 
decision the government will have to make in the coming weeks. 
We will want to make this decision having assessed all the 
aspects as I indicated in my earlier remarks. We will obviously 
make a decision after having consulted with our allies. It is 
important to realize that Canada is playing a very important role 
through the UN and a very important role through NATO and 
such a decision cannot be taken in isolation.
<P>
	I am pleased to move this motion today, seconded by my 
colleague, the Minister of National Defence, calling for a debate 
on peacekeeping. In particular, the government seeks the view 
of this House in two general areas: Canada's future in 
peacekeeping and our future commitment to Bosnia.
<P>
	Although we are very much interested in knowing the views 
of members about Canada's future in peacekeeping, there will 
be other occasions to talk about it at a later date, but it might be 
the last occasion to express their views on our future 
commitment to Bosnia before a decision is made by the 
government. Therefore I invite members to express openly, 
candidly and in a very constructive way their advice and 
suggestions in this regard. We are open to advice. It is a difficult 
decision and we welcome their input in this debate.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of all the members of the Official Opposition 
I would like to thank the government for deciding to hold this 
debate in the House. It will I am convinced be a non-partisan 
debate, enabling us to clarify our own and everyone else's 
thinking, so that we can make a decision that is in accord with 
our most fundamental interests.
<P>
	I think debates like this one should be repeated from time to 
time, when the subject lends itself to such an approach. I would 
like to say that for our part we have thought very seriously about 
the matter. We do not claim to have the answer, we have 
approached it modestly. Our remarks today will reflect our 
awareness for the hard reality, the complexity, of an issue that 
demands a very difficult decision.
<P>
	To the extent that we can assist the government in making a 
decision that accords with our fundamental interests, we will do 
it in all sincerity. We are therefore delighted to have this 
opportunity to participate in the debate.
<P>
	The government, we feel, would like the whole Canadian 
policy on peacekeeping to be debated, not just the current 
intervention in the former Yugoslavia, even though the latter is 
expressly referred to in the wording.
<P>
	But no one can be ignorant of the fact that it is the questions 
raised by the Bosnian intervention that have led to today's 
debate. In a way, it was inevitable that the concerns provoked by 
such a challenging mission would result in questions about 
Canada's peacekeeping role.
<P>
	So there we have the framework for the rethinking process in 
which we are called upon to participate: on the one hand we must 
tackle a thorny question of immediate and urgent concern, and 
on the other we must define attitudes for the future. Although 
the two matters are connected, it does not follow that future 
Canadian policy must be based solely on our experience in 
Yugoslavia.
<P>
	This is not Canada's first involvement in peacekeeping 
operations, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs has reminded us. 
We pioneered this type of mission. We have acquired experience 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="268"> 268 </A></B>
<P>
and expertise in the field that are respected by the whole world. 
But what is happening in Yugoslavia is without any real 
precedent. The apparent futility of our efforts, the risks our 
soldiers are running,  the astronomical figures that have 
circulated about the costs of the operation and the daunting 
complexity of the political and military situation there have 
shaken the support that public opinion has traditionally given 
this type of commitment.
<P>
	So we must take into account the difficulties faced by our 
mission in Bosnia especially, at the side of the other members of 
the peacekeepers. But if our decision is to be broadly and solidly 
based, we cannot lose our general perspective on the 
peacekeeping role Canada has assumed. This perspective is 
much more extensive in time and space than the one episode in 
the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	I would like here to pay heart-felt tribute to the courage and 
dignity with which our soldiers are carrying out the difficult 
duties entrusted to them overseas. They deserve our admiration 
and our complete support. And let us spare a thought for those 
who here in Canada are enduring trying times because of their 
anxiety for loved ones far away.
<P>
	We must bear in mind that before they started being perceived 
as a thorn in the flesh of our diplomacy and our foreign 
commitments, as they are today, Canada's peace missions were, 
like CIDA, a great source of pride for Canadians and Quebecers. 
The disinterested and humanitarian nature of our international 
interventions was hailed again and again. And did not the 
architect of Canada's peacekeeping role win the Nobel prize?
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	Indeed, more than anyone, Lester B. Pearson symbolized this 
acceptance of one's moral obligations, which is one of the duties 
of a democratic country. That is an aspect we must bear in mind 
when deciding, for example, whether we must stay on in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina, or withdraw and then establish criteria to 
govern any future participation.
<P>
	Another aspect of peace missions we must not ignore is their 
great diversity. What exactly do we mean when we talk about 
international missions carried out by Canadian soldiers under 
UN mandates? We must avoid simplifications: in fact, this 
involves a whole range of varied, and indeed disparate, actions 
and interventions.
<P>
	For 30 years, from 1949 to 1979, Canada maintained 27 
soldiers in order to monitor the ceasefire in Kashmir. Canada 
committed 9,000 soldiers to go to war in Korea from 1951 to 
1954; since that time it has kept only one on the spot to monitor 
the armistice agreements. Canada assigned 248 soldiers to 
monitor the demilitarized zone during the Vietnam war. Canada 
sent an observer mission under UN auspices to monitor the 
election that, on December 16, 1990, brought to power President 
Aristide, who visited us yesterday. In 1991, Canada sent 55 
soldiers to monitor disarmament and human rights observance 
in El Salvador. In 1991-92, Canada sent 103 soldiers to help 
clear mines in Cambodia. Then Canada doubled the personnel 
assisting the UN to disarm factions that had been at war for 
years. Most recently, Canada  sent a contingent to co-ordinate 
the delivery of food in Somalia, last year.
<P>
	Canada has participated in 44 of the operations the United 
Nations has organized since the end of World War II. It has been 
said that we have played the role of boy scouts; this is a 
picturesque term, but I feel that it casts a pejorative light on a 
remarkable effort by Canada on the international scene, an effort 
that must not be minimized.
<P>
	During those 44 operations, 98 Canadian lives were lost, 
including the eight deaths occurring in the former Yugoslavia. 
Canada lost 25 soldiers during the 30 years it was present on 
Cyprus. But the place in which Canada lost the most soldiers 
was the Middle East: 46 in Lebanon, Israel, Egypt and Syria.
<P>
	And what about the costs? Theoretically, our share should be 
3.1 per cent of expenditures; that is a percentage based on the 
GDP, population and, lastly, a complex weighting of factors. 
But, in fact, there are no set standards, because mandates change 
with situations and with the nature of agreements. On Cyprus, 
Canada alone paid the price; in the former Yugoslavia, 
theoretically-and I stress the word theoretically; we are well 
aware that this is unlikely to happen in the near future-the UN 
will reimburse Canada for a portion of the costs. Incidentally, 
many far-fetched figures on the costs of the operation in Bosnia 
have been bandied about. In particular, the figure of $1 billion 
has been mentioned. I feel that that is a rather irresponsible, I 
would even say a very irresponsible, way of providing 
information, since the true figure is nowhere near that sum. It is 
still a sizeable sum, of course, but we should be talking about 
less than $200 million in additional expenditures incurred there 
specifically, because the soldiers would have been paid and the 
equipment used here in any case. So if we are talking about a 
specific direct cost of our presence there, we should be talking 
about a figure closer to $160 million.
<P>
	Thus, although our commitment in the former Yugoslavia was 
part of a continuing program, it very quickly gave signs of being 
radically different from previous commitments. The operation 
in Slovenia and Croatia really is a peacekeeping operation, since 
our troops are responsible for ensuring that peace agreements 
already reached are observed. But Bosnia clearly differs from 
the traditional model. There, we are right in a combat zone, 
stuck between belligerents. How can we ensure that peace reigns 
in a land where peace does not exist and where all ceasefires 
have been violated? That is where things have deteriorated; in 
particular, the whole world has witnessed, through the unbear-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="269"> 269 </A></B>
<P>
able images broadcast on television, atrocities that we thought 
were no longer possible at the end of the 20th century.
<P>
	The perceived justification of our mission there has been very 
much influenced by the world situation.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	It is horror-stricken that we have witnessed and are still 
witnessing children much like our own dying in the streets, 
injured left to die in hospitals without care and without 
necessities. The world had come to hope for a new order which 
would not lead us to expect atrocities such as those we have seen 
once again in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
<P>
	The fall of the Berlin wall in November 1989 provoked a 
euphoria as sudden as it was unexpected. On December 31, 
1989, von Karajan went to what, for 42 years, was known as East 
Berlin to conduct Beethoven's Ninth. It was like living in a 
dream: Vaclav Havel had just crowned the velvet revolution in 
Prague, ``solidarnosc'' was on its way to power in Warsaw and 
Hungary was once again free. The Warsaw pact had just 
crumbled like a pack of cards, after more than 40 years of 
dullness and dictatorship. All this happened at the end of 1989; 
it happened, and this cannot be over-emphasized, without 
bloodshed, without a single gun being fired.
<P>
	As everyone else, I felt I was a witness to historic events, I felt 
a certain amount of pride at seeing some ideals such as liberty 
and democracy make giant leaps. Eighteen months later, Boris 
Yelstin was waving a three coloured Russian flag on top of a 
tank. The USSR had just collapsed.
<P>
	As soon as the cold war ended, we started thinking about 
creating new institutions to take over, to mark out what was soon 
called the new world order. In particular, all the European 
countries, the United States and Canada formed the Conference 
on Security and Co-operation in Europe designed, in the words 
of the then Secretary of State James Baker, as a new forum to 
ensure peace and dialogue from Vancouver to Vladivostok.
<P>
	What remains today of this burning hope for a new world? Of 
course, the Czech republic, Poland and Hungary seem on the 
right track. However, Russia seems to be failing. Then on our 
TV screens, we witnessed the tragic war in the former 
Yugoslavia, which has been going on for the last two years.
<P>
	In this new world order, one expected international law to be 
enforced. The relations between states would not be governed 
exclusively by the mere balance of power. The strong would no 
longer be able to bring the weak to their knees. The new order 
became reality once, in the winter of 1991, when Kuwait was 
defended against Iraqi invasion. Cynics have said there was 
something underground in Kuwait that seemed to be as valuable 
as the people living on the surface, and perhaps more valuable.
<P>
	In Bosnia-Hercegovina there are three communities: the 
Muslims, the Serbs and the Croats. The first are the descendants 
of Slavs who converted to Islam after the Ottoman conquest, 
some 500 years ago. So these are three very ancient 
communities, with equally deep roots in the same soil. 
Demographically the Muslims are the largest segment of the 
population with 1.9 million inhabitants or 44 per cent, followed 
by the Serbs at 31 per cent and the Croats at 17 per cent. But 
unlike the other two groups-and this is no small detail-the 
Muslims cannot count on a sizeable community of fellows in a 
neighbouring republic.
<P>
	After Slovenia and Croatia became independent, neither the 
Muslims nor the Croats in Bosnia wanted to stay in a reduced 
Yugoslavia where Serb predominance would be still greater. 
They called for the independence of Bosnia-Hercegovina in late 
February 1992. The Bosnian Serbs refused to be part of this new 
state.
<P>
	If the Serbs had been content to fortify their position and mark 
out a territory for themselves where they formed a majority, we 
would have seen a political impasse that would probably have 
led to long and laborious negotiations. But unfortunately that 
was not what happened. The Bosnian Serbs were quickly able, 
with the assistance of the Yugoslav army, a relatively 
well-equipped force dominated by Serbs, to take control of 70 
per cent of the territory in Bosnia-Hercegovina, including 
territories where they were only a tiny minority, to expel the 
non-Serbs systematically, especially the Muslims, and even to 
execute a certain number of them.
<P>
	We can all recall the internment-camp stories that held the 
headlines in the summer of 1992. A number of these camps still 
exist today. Moreover, cultural and religious symbols have been 
systematically blown up, including 16th century mosques that 
were part of the world's shared heritage, and houses often 
burned to the ground.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	In reaction, and this is the spiral, the same treatment has been 
inflicted by the Muslims on the Serbs and the Croats and by the 
Croats on the Serbs, obviously on a smaller scale.
<P>
	A journalist from the Paris daily <I>Le Monde</I>, Yves Heller, 
summed up the situation nicely on October 1 last, and I quote: 
``The Muslims, who are the victims of an ``ethnic cleansing'' of 
unspeakable savagery, have lost very large territories in western 
Bosnia which the Serbs have conquered with extreme 
brutality-''
<P>
	We know today that ``cleansing'' was discussed in the 
corridors of power in Belgrade, capital of Serbia, at the end of 
the eighties.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="270"> 270 </A></B>
<P>
	Judging by the history of the last century, each of the three 
communities nurtures historic grievances against the two 
others. It is not for us to allocate blame. But there is no denying 
that in 1992 and 1993 a concerted strategy was methodically 
implemented which reminds us in many ways-I say this with 
great sadness because, like the majority of people in the west, I 
thought we would never again witness such barbarity-which 
reminds us of what other peoples, including the Serbs 
themselves, suffered at the hands of Hitler's troops.
<P>
	And all this occurred in a region only a few hours away from 
Venice by car.
<P>
	We must remember this today and remember also that this is 
the judgment of the whole international community. The 
Europeans recognized Bosnia-Hercegovina's independence on 
April 6, 1992; the United States followed suit the day after and 
Bosnia was admitted to the United Nations on May 22, 1992. 
The majority in a legitimate country was attacked by a national 
minority receiving substantial help from a neighbouring 
country. This majority should have enjoyed the protection of the 
United Nations charter, but such was not the case.
<P>
	The recognized representatives of Bosnia have asked 
repeatedly for international help, but to no avail. What is the 
difference between Iraq annexing Kuwait and the Bosnian Serbs 
annexing a substantial portion of a recognized country?
<P>
	The United Nations did not vigorously come to Bosnia's aid, 
but it did name the aggressor. On May 30, 1992, the Security 
Council imposed a commercial, oil and air embargo on Serbia 
and Montenegro. On October 9, the Security Council excluded 
Serbian aircraft from Bosnia's air space, and on December 1, the 
Human Rights Commission in Geneva used for the first time the 
term ``genocide'' and condemned the policy of ethnic cleansing 
applied by the Serbian leaders in Bosnia and Croatia. That is as 
clear as one can get.
<P>
	It would not be fair to say that the United Nations have been 
totally indifferent. They have managed to take control of the 
airport at Sarajevo in order to use it for transporting 
humanitarian aid. The 30,000 or so peacekeepers have deployed 
throughout Bosnia manage, despite being harassed by the 
different factions, in transporting part of the aid destined for 
Muslim or Croat towns besieged by the Serbs and in some cases 
by the Muslims, thereby affording them a partial but 
indispensable relief. And six Muslim enclaves are under the 
protection of the United Nations. Thus, in Srebrenica, 150 
Canadian peacekeepers stand between the 45,000 people who 
are crammed into the town and the hostile Serbian environment.
<P>
	But the United Nations protection forces have spoken out. 
They say they are incapable of carrying out the missions they are 
assigned for lack of sufficient means. On the other hand, 
negotiations between the warring  factions are bogged down; 
peace seems more remote than ever. Therefore, should we stay?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The easy thing would be to throw our hands up, pack up our 
bags and leave but this is not the way Canada earned its well 
deserved reputation abroad as a steady peacemaker willing to 
walk the extra mile in the name of peace.
<P>
	Admittedly we are testing uncharted waters but we are in a 
new world. We rejoiced at the end of the cold war. The world is 
now in a state of flux and it would be unseemly of us to give up at 
this juncture.
<P>
	France in Bosnia has shouldered a heavier burden than 
Canada and has paid the price with 18 dead men and 269 
wounded. France seems willing to stay. It is going too far to say 
that there is no peacemaking whatsoever in Bosnia. There are six 
protected Muslim enclaves surrounded by Serbs with nothing 
standing between them and the Serbs but peacemakers. The 
peace is kept even if it is a peculiar kind of peace.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	There have been 150 Canadians who have preserved 45,000 
Muslims in Srebrenica from the ghastly treatment meted out to 
so many Muslims.
<P>
	Now what will happen? This is the question we have to ask. 
What would happen if all peacekeepers left Bosnia? We should 
never forget to answer this question. First, the enclaves would 
be submerged in a very short time with the exception probably of 
Sarajevo. Second, the Serbs would be targeting more strategic 
towns and villages in the hope of breaking the backbone of the 
Bosnia resistance. Third, the Croats in central Bosnia would 
have to run for their lives. In short it would be all out war and all 
out ethnic cleansing.
<P>
	The men in the peacekeepers act also as our eyes and our ears 
on the field. They justify and complete the other measures which 
have been carried out by the international community. Suppose 
they all leave at the end of their present mandate which expires 
at the end of March. We would have to suspend the arms 
embargo against Bosnia. Not doing so would be cold blooded 
cruelty. However, then how could we justify keeping operation 
Deny Flight which forbids Bosnian skies to the Serb air force?
<P>
	It would really be all out war with the very real possibility of 
sucking in, in a much deeper fashion, allies from both camps 
such as Russia and Turkey who are already in the backstage. 
Then the Balkans would then really live up to their history.
<P>
	In fact all these measures have been enacted to scale down the 
level of Serb aggression. As far as they go they are intended to 
protect the Bosnian Muslims. To turn our back on one of these 
measures, namely the UN forces on the ground, is to begin the 
unravelling of the whole patchwork. It is not an idea that is well 
thought out.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="271"> 271 </A></B>
<P>
	However, can things continue as they are now? Can we 
tolerate the harassment and the kidnapping of peacekeepers? 
No, we should not. We should give them clear engagement rules 
and not timid ones. We should give them the military means to 
do their job. If the United Nations wants to play a meaningful 
role in that part of the world then it must get its act together.
<P>
	The biggest morale booster for the UN forces would be the 
knowledge that they are not bogged down in some indefinite 
stalemate. There must be movement at the negotiating table. 
This is not for us but really for the parties involved to decide.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The truth is that the Prime Minister was imprudent, to say the 
least, when, as he was leaving Brussels at the beginning of the 
month, he mentioned the possibility of a unilateral withdrawal 
of Canada's peace mission to Bosnia. Whatever we decide, we 
must act in concert with our allies. Canada must not breach the 
solidarity pact that it has wisely, generously and courageously 
built over the years with our partners and friends of the North 
Atlantic council.
<P>
	Second, to let down a civilian population whose survival, 
until now, has been secured largely through our presence and our 
aid, and to let it fend for itself in utter deprivation and 
insecurity, would go against our interpretation of our 
humanitarian obligations.
<P>
	Third, we ourselves could not tolerate the sight of the 
massacres that would almost certainly befall the Bosnian 
people, as our retreat would likely start a chain reaction. Public 
opinion among our allies and friends would draw serious 
conclusions from such a decision. After setting an example of 
commitment and compassion, we would then set an example of 
disengagement and indifference. It is to be feared that others 
would follow in our footsteps in this second option as they did in 
the first one.
<P>
	Finally, the maintenance of the peacekeeping forces in the 
former Yugoslavia affords us our only guarantee that the 
conflict will be contained inside the territory where it is already 
raging. If the peacekeeping forces were withdrawn, the 
hostilities could then spread unabated to Macedonia and Greece 
and eventually ignite the Balkan powder keg. But if we decide to 
stay, we must take steps to see to the safety of our troops, which 
means increasing our defence and intervention capabilities.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	The peacekeepers must stay, as must Canada, even more so, if 
we wish to see the Bosnian conflict end around the negotiation 
table rather than on the battlefield, with violence and massacres. 
It is up to us really to decide if this tragedy will be resolved 
through force or through reason.
<P>
	It is imperative then for the future that we set the guidelines 
that will dictate our actions. Once in position, it is usually too 
late to consider a withdrawal. Those guidelines must be defined 
with the help of military,  diplomatic and other experts. I hope 
the government in its upcoming white paper on defence will set 
forth an analytical plan that we can study thoroughly. But for the 
moment, the main thing to do is to keep in mind that we must 
continue, insofar as our capabilities allow it, to fulfil our fair 
share of the obligations that result from our allegiance to the 
values of democracy, peace and justice, values which, given 
their universality, deserve our efforts to further them abroad.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to advise you that in this debate Reform speakers will be 
dividing their time into 10 minutes segments, allowing five 
minutes for questions and comments.
<P>
	To begin I would like to join my colleagues in congratulating 
the Speaker on his election, you on your appointment as Deputy 
Speaker and assure both of you of my full co-operation in this 
House in the days to come.
<P>
	In this my maiden speech I want to speak briefly of my 
constituency, Saanich-Gulf Islands, in beautiful British 
Columbia. Our southern border takes in a substantial portion 
Victoria, the garden city of Canada. Moving northward up the 
Saanich peninsula we encounter a delightful mix of farms and 
seaside towns and villages; urban convenience in an idyllic rural 
environment.
<P>
	Finally, it includes the southern Gulf Islands often referred to 
as the jewels in the crown of Canada's west coast. Here one will 
find some of the best fishing and sailing in the world.
<P>
	In August this year the eyes of the world will be focused on 
the 15th Commonwealth Games activities, many of which will 
take place within our boundaries.
<P>
	During the election the returning officer informed me that in 
respect to population, Saanich-Gulf Islands is the second 
largest constituency in British Columbia and the 10th largest in 
Canada. During the interval between the 1988 and the 1993 
elections the number of eligible voters grew from 77,000 to over 
93,000 representing 125,000 constituents. In fact, I believe I am 
now the proud representative of a goodly number of Canadians 
who were previously resident in the constituencies of many of 
the other members of this House.
<P>
	Perhaps because of the variety of their origins I have found 
my constituents to be intelligent, well-informed and patriotic 
Canadians, very much representative of our whole country. I 
thank them for entrusting their representation to me and pledge 
my best efforts in fulfilling that very serious obligation.
<P>
	Moving to this debate on Bosnia, I want to acknowledge the 
Minister of National Defence and the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, both of whom made members of their departments 
available to brief us on the situation in and around Bosnia. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="272"> 272 </A></B>
<P>
thank them for responding so quickly and co-operatively to our 
request.
<P>
	Furthermore we agree with the government's stated position 
on air strikes. In our view, as soon as an air strike takes place the 
peacekeepers and helmets of the UN take on the same colour as 
the helmet of the pilot who delivered the ordinance. They will be 
deemed to have taken sides, to have become antagonists and 
thus appropriate targets. Air strikes should only be authorized if 
UN forces are under or in direct danger of attack.
<P>
	Our thanks also go to Major General Lewis MacKenzie, 
former Canadian commander in the area who took time to come 
and give us his firsthand impressions and viewpoint of the 
situation in Bosnia.
<P>
	At the start I want to recognize the excellence of the Canadian 
forces personnel we have committed in the former Yugoslavia. 
These troops are well trained, well disciplined, well motivated 
and well able to carry out any reasonable task assigned to them. 
They have earned and deserve our respect and admiration.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	They have also earned and deserve our informed 
consideration for their future involvement in the convoluted 
situation to which they are presently committed. In Bosnia we 
face deeply held differences between Serbs, Croats and Muslims 
who, although they enjoy a common ethnicity, are now radically 
and violently divided, in fact opposed. Make no mistake, none 
of the belligerents have clean hands; all have been involved in 
atrocities against the others.
<P>
	Canada has a proud tradition of involvement in peacekeeping 
operations. It has cost more than 140 lives and many more 
injuries over the years but in the main I believe most Canadians 
have supported this commitment. However, the feedback I am 
now receiving from my constituents reveals their concern with 
the present Canadian involvement in Bosnia. They worry that 
Canadian lives are being put at risk in what they perceive to be a 
questionable cause. They wonder, if the people of Bosnia show 
no inclination to put aside their differences and find a peaceful 
resolution of their problems, is Canada helping to end or merely 
perpetuating this unhappy situation?
<P>
	Canadians were committed to Bosnia to provide humanitarian 
aid, and despite the difficulties, dangers and frustrations 
encountered, by and large they have succeeded in their mission. 
But let it be well understood, this is not a peacekeeping mission, 
because there is no peace to keep. Rather our forces are 
observing and operating in and around a civil war, in the full 
sense of the word.
<P>
	Canada presently has more armed forces deployed in theatres 
of operations than at any time since the Korean war. We are 
stretching our resources, particularly the infantry, to the limit, 
to the extent that should another incident such as Oka arise, it 
could very well be beyond the capacity of our armed forces to 
adequately respond.
<P>
	However, the size of the Canadian forces and the tasks 
assigned them should await the outcome of the forthcoming 
defence review. On this point, Reformers commend the 
government on its decision to conduct this study. It is long 
overdue.
<P>
	But a decision on Canadian involvement in the former 
Yugoslavia cannot await finalization of the defence review. The 
end of our present commitment in Bosnia is rapidly approaching 
and we must soon take a stand. It seems to me that Canada has 
only two options: first, to stay and prepare for a long-lasting 
involvement in the region; or second, to take the initiative by 
demanding that the belligerents commit to achievable, 
measurable and enforceable progress toward a peaceful 
resolution.
<P>
	In this second instance Canada would further state that failing 
such commitment Canadian forces will be withdrawn from the 
theatre.
<P>
	If our studies and briefings have done nothing else they have 
clearly shown us there are no easy solutions. By staying 
involved we are alleviating the suffering of tens of thousands of 
civilians. At the same time, inescapably, we are supplying the 
fighting forces and enabling or even assisting them to continue 
the war. Our presence is diminishing the fighting, but children 
are still being maimed and killed, women raped, and the general 
population indiscriminately bombarded. So increased hatred is 
continually being bred.
<P>
	Conversely a withdrawal by the UN would unleash the 
opposing forces, prompting the likelihood of an increase in 
hostilities and, in some instances, a blood bath. Furthermore, it 
would enhance the danger that this war could extend beyond its 
present boundaries. We are damned if we do and damned if we 
don't. Which way do we go?
<P>
	It strikes me, and I admit that my background as a fighter pilot 
may be influencing my reasoning, that some action is better than 
none. While we do not know what the outcome will be, it may be 
time for Canada to be hard-nosed, saying to the belligerents: ``If 
you are not willing to make some concessions and compromises 
toward a peaceful resolution of the war, we are going to 
withdraw and leave you to it.''
<P>
	If such a declaration were delivered it would be stronger if it 
came in the name of all UN forces in the theatre. However, 
considering Canada's reputation as a peacekeeper, a threat of 
unilateral Canadian withdrawal would unquestionably draw 
world attention and hopefully impact strongly on Serb, Croat 
and Muslim leaders.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="273"> 273 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	If this were to be our decision, it must be made absolutely 
clear that Canada is not withdrawing because the going is rough. 
Canadians have demonstrated their mettle in two world wars, 
the Korean war and many peacekeeping actions over the years. 
They have demonstrated it in Bosnia. Our forces have clearly 
indicated their willingness to remain involved. Continuing 
along our present path seems to give little hope of a peaceful 
settlement. Rather it gives every indication of a commitment to 
remain and observe the civil war for many years to come.
<P>
	The belligerents met in Geneva to talk on January 18 and 19, 
but proceedings collapsed. More talks are scheduled in Geneva 
on February 10. I submit that it is time for Canada to take the 
lead by hosting a conference here in Ottawa in early February, 
before that Geneva meeting, to include all countries with forces 
currently committed in the former Yugoslavia. At this 
conference, Canada should urge that the UN issue a clear and 
unequivocal ultimatum to the belligerents. Either accept moves 
to achieve and enforceable peaceful solution or accept the 
withdrawal of UN forces.
<P>
	Should the conference not agree, Canada should state that 
unless definite progress toward peace happens in Bosnia prior to 
then, it is our intention to withdraw our troops in April when our 
current commitment is completed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would just 
like to understand the comments made by my colleague from 
Saanich-Gulf Islands, particularly when he says that the 
people involved in this conflict share the same ethnicity, while 
we know they have followed quite different historical paths over 
the last 500 years. It is precisely the federal state imposed upon 
them at some point which has collapsed in the new international 
context. Their situation has been widely aknowledged by the 
United Nations which recognized Bosnia's independence; and 
the search for some form of agreement is at the heart of the peace 
efforts. Withdrawal at this juncture in the crisis would quite 
simply result in the virtual elimination of the Bosnians. I cannot 
understand the member's reasoning. I wish he would try to 
explain it to me.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> Mr. Speaker, if we go back far enough in the 
origins of the area, we find that all the residents are basically 
Slavs. Over the years, they have been affected by outside 
influences which have caused them to go in different directions 
to different religions. When I referred to their common 
ethnicity, I meant going back a long way. Obviously there are 
substantial and very violent differences between them at the 
moment. The fact that Bosnia was recognized has been 
considered by some to have been a mistake, that in fact the 
outcome which has happened was inevitable.
<P>
	It is my understanding the Muslims are acquiring quite a 
heavy weapon stock so we are soon likely to see an increase in 
armed activity on their side. While the disparity of the 
surrounding nations unquestionably bears on the numbers of 
Serbs around, I think within Bosnia itself the Muslims will be 
able to make a rather good account of themselves should it come 
to that. I hope very much that it does not.
<P>
	Unless the world, and Canada in particular, takes a stance 
which involves the requirement for these people to 
accommodate, to concede, to compromise in the Canadian 
tradition, that nothing will happen and we will see the thing go 
on forever.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I too would like to question the member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands with respect to the position that he has 
taken.
<P>
	I returned a few days ago from Croatia myself. I met not only 
with UN commanders there but also with our Canadian troops 
both in sector south and elsewhere. Our troops are profoundly 
opposed to the suggestion that Canada would simply give notice 
that we would pull out after the mandate expires at the end of 
March.
<P>
	It is their position that this would result in an incredible 
increase in the level of bloodshed and violence and that the very 
important humanitarian work they are doing in helping to bring 
in and escort NGOs and bringing in food and medicine would be 
profoundly jeopardized. Many innocent people would die and 
would starve.
<P>
	In view of the concerns of our people and NGOs on the ground 
and the United Nations about this proposal, what exactly is the 
member suggesting in terms of compromises and concessions? 
He said that all parties should make compromises and 
concessions.
<P>
	The Bosnian Serbs and Radovan Karadzic have been very 
clear. They control 70 per cent of the territory of 
Bosnia-Hercegovina. They are about a third of the population. 
What concessions are they prepared to make now?
<P>
	If Canada simply gives notice that we are going to pull out and 
other United Nations troops pull out as well then not only will 
they consolidate their position but quite clearly it seems to me 
that the risk of widespread bloodshed, destruction and 
starvation is far greater.
<P>
	My second brief question is this. What about Croatia? What is 
the hon. member suggesting with respect to the role of the UN in 
Croatia?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> Mr. Speaker, I said during my remarks there are 
no easy solutions to the dilemma that we are in. I recognize what 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="274"> 274 </A></B>
<P>
the member says and I believe that he is correct that we are in 
danger if we extract our forces of allowing the fighting there to 
intensify.
<P>
	However, if we stay involved we are also staying to observe 
constant carnage, killing, maiming and bombardment. I do not 
think there is any completely satisfactory solution to the 
dilemma. That is why I propose that perhaps firm action would 
make the difference.
<P>
	With regard to the percentage, as I mentioned a few moments 
ago, the Muslims in Bosnia and Croatia comprise over 40 per 
cent of the population. It is my understanding that they are 
getting weapons both from the Serbs and the Croats and are in a 
position to at least defend themselves.
<P>
	With regard to the second question on our troops in Croatia, 
there is sufficient interplay between the peoples in the region 
that demands should be made to everybody in the region and our 
threats should be to everyone in the region: ``If you do not 
somehow influence a peaceful resolution of this situation we are 
going to withdraw our forces''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome this 
opportunity to give my maiden speech. I never thought I would 
be doing it on such an important subject as this one which 
certainly affects us now and for a long time in the future.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate you and all other 
members. I want to particularly thank the people of my 
constituency of central Alberta. Certainly I will claim to have 
the most beautiful constituency with the greatest people who we 
possibly could have.
<P>
	I want to congratulate the Prime Minister and his ministers for 
making this day possible. This is an example of the sort of open 
Parliament that Canadians want. We have to go further with 
more free votes and constituent assemblies and as the hon. 
minister mentioned with tours around the country to find out 
what Canadians really think on such important matters.
<P>
	Peacekeeping is a very difficult subject along with what we 
should do and the decision we should make today. In getting this 
information there are a number of points that we have to 
consider. Certainly we have to realize that past wars and the 
history of places like Bosnia make it an ignition point and one 
that certainly could explode into a much more serious situation 
as has been described.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	I think we also have to recognize that there is really no will to 
settle this conflict and there will not be a will in many of the 
situations our peacekeepers get into. I think the escalation point 
we should look at is of course the great power of the Muslim 
world and what it could put behind a conflict like this.
<P>
	We should also look at Russia and its changing political 
scene, almost as we sit here. Certainly its defence of the Slavic 
races is a consideration. There is Greece and Macedonia. There 
is France and its position in the EC. There is Italy, Germany and 
Albania and their interests in this area as well. All of the recent 
history we must consider in making our decision on Bosnia.
<P>
	Something we must also consider is the presence and 
importance of television in any decision we make. Around every 
corner is CNN, BBC and of course Newsworld. They show the 
atrocities and the terrible parts of all of these conflicts right on 
the screen in your home. We cannot underestimate the power of 
this sort of influence.
<P>
	We must realize of course that we have no good guys or bad 
guys. We do not have anybody wearing a white hat or a black hat 
which is what we North Americans would like to see. There are 
atrocities occurring on all sides and we must be aware of that.
<P>
	We must also be aware that the killing will not stop. It will not 
stop whether we stay or whether we leave. This is going on. We 
must recognize the humanitarian successes that have been 
taking place and we certainly must commend our forces for what 
they have been doing.
<P>
	There are a lot of choices but what really should Canada do 
about peacekeeping? I have tried to put myself in the position of 
my constituents. I have tried to think about the people of the 
province of Alberta where we have a great many people in the 
military. I have tried to think of myself as a Canadian as to what 
I should really say.
<P>
	Initially I thought we should just pull the troops out and let the 
Serbs and Bosnians fight it out themselves. It is a civil war and 
we should not be part of it. I must admit, however, upon getting 
into further detail that there is a lot more to it than just that. 
There is the humanitarian aspect of it, the war crimes and the 
innocent civilians. Every time we turn on the television we hear 
about these things. We have to think about that in any decision 
that we make.
<P>
	We of course must realize the risk that we are putting our 
troops under. As things escalate, as there are threats of an 
increased escalation this spring, how many troops are we 
prepared as Canadians to bring home in body bags? We have to 
ask that question and we have to take this as a very serious part 
of our decision.
<P>
	We have to look at ourselves as leaders in the area of 
peacekeeping. Certainly a pull out would be an abrogation of 
some of those responsibilities. We have to ask what that does to 
us as Canadians and how we feel because of that. The cost of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="275"> 275 </A></B>
<P>
course has been mentioned and our debt and deficit are part of 
any decision when we come to spending money.
<P>
	The decision then is not easy. We have all these factors to 
consider. I tried to see if there was anything positive to this 
whole situation. Can peacekeeping have a positive part to it?
<P>
	The conclusion I came to was a feeling of nationalism that is 
part of peacekeeping. What makes Canadians feel good? Next 
month we are going to look at our athletes at the Olympics and 
we are going to feel good. When we hear that national anthem 
play we are going to feel good because they have just done 
something that made them stand out in the world.
<P>
	We are going to make Canadians feel good today because this 
is good government. This is an opportunity for all sides, it does 
not matter what one's politics are, to really have a say. Thus we 
will feel good.
<P>
	What about peacekeeping and making us feel good? We 
certainly have a reputation. All across the world we know that 
Canadians are the best trained, have the best political 
background and the best psychology, if you want, of taking care 
of peace in this world. We already have that and that is 
something we should build on and should be part of our national 
pride.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	We of course should emphasize a leadership role. We do not 
have to take a second seat to anybody when it comes to 
peacekeeping and the settling of world disputes.
<P>
	In terms of training, we should build on this. We should 
provide training for sale. What better thing could we do with the 
bases we are thinking of closing down than turn them into 
international academies for the training of peacekeepers?
<P>
	Let us go further than just peacekeeping. Let us talk about the 
settling of all kinds of disputes. Let us talk about supervising 
elections and a better understanding of the cultural elements that 
are behind peacekeeping efforts. Let us provide conflict 
management, human rights monitoring, civil administration and 
emergency measures. One cannot help but think that that could 
be useful internally as well if we had something like an 
earthquake such as that which we have just witnessed in Los 
Angeles.
<P>
	In conclusion, I think we should always maintain our role in 
peacekeeping and build on it. We should become world leaders. 
That is really where it is at. The building of that nationalism 
within us, that pride of being Canadian, I believe will even go so 
far as to make Quebecers feel that they want to stay a part of 
Canada.
<P>
	We can do so much with this whole peacekeeping situation. If 
we in this 35th Parliament succeed in building this national 
pride then I think we have gone a long way in succeeding in why 
many of us are here.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
congratulating the hon. member for Red Deer for his candid 
analysis I would like to ask him if it would be fair to conclude 
that he favours Canadian troops remaining in Bosnia? If that is 
so, does his view represent the position of his party or is the 
position of his party the one articulated earlier by the member 
for Saanich-Gulf Islands?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the wonderful 
part of this day is that we can express our points of view taking 
into consideration all of our constituents and all of our fellow 
MPs.
<P>
	I would say that withdrawal is something that is done when 
the safety of our forces cannot be guaranteed. That position is 
one that would be decided by the people in the field. I think the 
counterbalances, the humanitarian efforts that we are providing, 
offset whether we should leave or not.
<P>
	Initially, I said that we had to get out. It is a civil war and we 
should be out of there the sooner the better. However, for the 
reasons I have given I would now say I have modified that 
position to say that it is only a last ditch thing to pull out. I think 
it is good that within our caucus we have this range. Through the 
rest of the day we will hear that range being developed. The 
main thing this leads to is that we must develop an overall policy 
for Canada both short term and of course very long term. The 
minister alluded to that earlier. I believe that is really what we 
are trying to accomplish today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Red Deer for his 
comments.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member for his views with respect to 
the concern that has been raised about the tremendous gap 
between a series of resolutions by the United Nations on the one 
hand and the reality on the ground on the other, particularly in 
Bosnia. We heard about children in Mostar who were recently 
slaughtered in the snow. We heard about children in Sarajevo 
just a few days similarly out sledding and playing. These six 
children were brutally murdered. It does not take a great deal of 
courage to lob artillery from 30 kilometres away.
<P>
	I want to ask the member for Red Deer what his position is 
with respect to the plea by a number of respected United Nations 
commanding officers. God knows there have been a whole series 
of them that have made those pleas, most recently General 
Francis Briquemont who replaced General Morillon in Bosnia. 
He said: ``There's a fantastic gap between the resolutions of the 
Security Council, the will to execute those resolutions and the 
means available to commanders''.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	When we have a situation in which the Bosnian Serb leader, 
Radovan Karadzic has said, and this was just last week: 
``Sarajevans will not be counting the dead. They will be 
counting the living''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="276"> 276 </A></B>
<P>
	Does the member for Red Deer have any position with respect 
to the suggestion that has been made that we strengthen the 
mandate of the United Nations? Certainly a plea that I heard 
from a number of the soldiers on the ground in Croatia is that we 
strengthen the mandate of the United Nations to ensure that they 
have the ability not only to protect the safe havens, which are far 
from safe now, but end the artillery bombing which is taking 
place as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have to agree with an 
awful of what has been said. Of course one of the matters that 
has made this problem so difficult is that the United Nations 
does not seem to have shouldered the leadership role the way 
they should have.
<P>
	We went through probably seven or eight briefings in 
preparation for today. One of the things we heard over and over 
again, particularly from the military, was the great difficulty in 
not having someone really in charge. Other difficulties were 
having different troops, different training.
<P>
	I suppose that is where my international academy for 
peacekeepers comes in. With the United Nations having input in 
that, it might help solve some of those problems and at least the 
troops would be trained the same. If we could get the leadership 
the same, it would make the United Nations stronger.
<P>
	In defence of the United Nations, it has had great difficulty 
getting people to participate, getting other countries to provide 
troops and so on. It is a two-way street and we must solve that 
problem.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to be able to participate in the debate today on the 
motion on Canada's peacekeeping role.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	First I would like to congratulate the Leader of the Opposition 
for his sensible speech-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
-and the two members of the Reform Party to my right, the 
member for Saanich-Gulf Islands and the member for Red 
Deer for their most informed speeches.
<P>
	The debate we will hear today and tomorrow, first on 
peacekeeping and then on cruise, is a debate that will allow 
individual members to express his or her own views. There is no 
whip on this side. We are on record as being supportive of 
peacekeeping. That is in our red book and I would be very 
surprised if any of the Liberal members would disagree with our 
continuation in peacekeeping.
<P>
	However with respect to the specific mission that we are 
talking about today in the former republics of Yugoslavia or 
tomorrow, which is the deployment of further testing of cruise 
missiles under the Test and Evaluation Agreement members, on 
both sides of the House, and certainly in our party, are free to 
express  their views and the government will take those views 
into account.
<P>
	It is only appropriate that I join with the other members 
opposite in beginning my remarks by paying tribute to the men 
and women of the Canadian forces who, as we speak are working 
to bring some peace to the world's trouble spots. I know that 
members share my admiration and appreciation for the very 
difficult job they are doing, whether they are in Srebrenica in the 
Balkans, in the Far East, on the African continent, or off the 
southwest coast of Haiti. On behalf of all Canadians, merci 
beaucoup, thank you very much.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Today, Parliament has an opportunity to consider the 
activities of our peacekeepers, the various aspects of Canada's 
contribution to peacekeeping and the future direction of our 
commitment in this respect.
<P>
	Canadians are justly proud of this country's exceptional 
contribution to UN peacekeeping efforts. For 47 years, Canada 
has made a generous and sustained contribution to peacekeeping 
missions. The total number of Canadians who have served as 
peacekeepers over the years is now over 100,000.
<P>
	Canada's high level of participation is particularly impressive 
when we consider that our country has only one-half of 1 per 
cent of the world's population.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	No other country has a peacekeeping record that compares 
with Canada's. No other country knows the military operations 
aspect of peacekeeping as well as we do, and no other country 
has our expertise. This may explain why Canada is the only 
country in the world to have erected a national monument to 
peacekeeping.
<P>
	Some say that Canada invented the peacekeeping concept. 
Most observers agree it was the UN emergency force, designed 
by former Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson in 1956, which 
demonstrated the value and potential of an international UN 
force.
<P>
	During the sixties and in fact until the eighties, Canada 
increased its efforts and enhanced its reputation in the 
peacekeeping area. We were one of the few countries that were 
accepted as a neutral force to separate two belligerent parties. 
The international community has repeatedly called on Canada to 
take part in missions of many kinds throughout the world.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It was back in 1949 that Canada's first peacekeepers were 
deployed. They went to Kashmir with what was soon to become 
known as the United Nations Military Observer Group in India 
and Pakistan under the acronym UNMOGIP.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="277"> 277 </A></B>
<P>
	Regrettably it was during the first mission that Canada 
suffered its first peacekeeping casualty. Since that time almost 
100 Canadians have lost their lives while on peacekeeping duty.
<P>
	Peacekeeping has never been without risks. The Minister of 
Foreign Affairs talked about it today. Members on the other side 
have talked about it. It has always been dangerous but our forces 
are keenly aware of the danger when they enlist to serve their 
country overseas.
<P>
	Canada has a long association as well with the United Nations 
Truce Supervision Organization, UNTSO. This mission, which 
is the UN's oldest, monitors ceasefire agreements in the Middle 
East and today 13 Canadian-UN military observers are with 
UNTSO, a commitment we began in 1954.
<P>
	Canadians have served over the years in Indochina, Lebanon, 
Congo, West New Guinea, Yemen, the Middle East, Cyprus, 
Afghanistan, Namibia, Angola, Cambodia and Central America. 
That is a pretty impressive record for a country with a 
population of only 27 million.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In recent years, a new chapter was started in the history of UN 
peacekeeping operations. At the end of the eighties, when the 
confrontation between east and west ceased to exist, the UN was 
able to start operating more or less as its founders had planned in 
1945.
<P>
	Since 1988, the UN has created more peacekeeping missions 
than it did during the four previous decades.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have already mentioned our contribution to UNMOGIP in 
Kashmir and UNTSO in the Middle East. As well Canada 
provides a total of 10 staff and military police to the United 
Nations peacekeeping force in Cyprus; over 200 personnel 
assigned to a supply, transport and communications duties with 
the United Nations disengagement observer force on the Golan 
Heights between Israel and Syria. We will be hearing more of 
them as the weeks unfold in the quest to finally solve the Middle 
East dilemma. Twenty-seven Canadian forces personnel are in 
various staff, air traffic control and administrative support 
positions in Egypt at the headquarters for the multinational 
force, a non-UN mission which adheres to the 1979 Camp David 
accord. We have five military observers to the United Nations in 
the Iraq-Kuwait observation mission.
<P>
	We have two officers including the force commander for the 
United Nations mission in Rwanda. We have 30 military 
observers, officers and staff to the United Nations mission for 
the referendum in the West Sahara known by its French acronym 
as MINURSO.
<P>
	Turning to Haiti, Canada remains prepared to provide 
approximately 110 military personnel to the United Nations 
mission there. The majority of these Canadians will participate 
in construction of engineering projects among other tasks.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada also continues to be a participant in the UN 
observation mission in El Salvador, which supervised a 
ceasefire, disarmament and the human rights situation in that 
country.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	We shall continue to support the UN operation in Somalia 
through the presence of a small number of staff officers. At one 
time there were more than 1,000 Canadians in Somalia as part of 
the UN multinational force responsible for the security of 
humanitarian aid operations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I should say that despite some unfortunate incidents which are 
now being adjudicated, our people in Somalia made a real 
difference in bringing order to the country and in helping to 
rebuild the infrastructure of this very poor nation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, Canada is a participant in the UN mission in 
Mozambique which has a mandate to supervise the ceasefire and 
the elections in that country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The United Nations Command Military Armistice 
Commission in Korea has also seen the participation of 
Canadians. This is the agreement which supervises the 
implementation of the 1953 armistice accord.
<P>
	We have also been involved in the United Nations special 
commission charged with the inspection and destruction of 
Iraq's ballistic missiles as well as its chemical, nuclear and 
biological facilities.
<P>
	We have men and women on the ships enforcing the embargo 
against Serbia in Montenegro as well as on our ships off the 
coast of Haiti. Finally, there are Canadian forces personnel 
working to locate and diffuse land mines in Cambodia with the 
United Nations development programs mine technical advisory 
group.
<P>
	I mention all of these because even though we are focusing 
today on the current conflict, which is a very nasty one, we 
should not forget the hundreds of other Canadians serving with 
the United Nations forces around the world in the engagements I 
have mentioned.
<P>
	Let us take a look at the Balkans. This is a tragedy that has 
unfolded for the last 15 years since the death of former president 
Marshal Tito. While I am sure the members of the government in 
no way supported the kind of government that Mr. Tito gave to 
Yugoslavia, one thing that he did leave behind was a will and a 
determination to unite many disparate factions, religious and 
ethnic, into one nation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="278"> 278 </A></B>
<P>
	There is a lesson in Yugoslavia. It is that multi-ethnic, 
multi-religious, multi-racial states can only be kept together in 
today's world by a codification of individual rights and by their 
protection with strong national institutions. Those national 
institutions and that constitutional protection has eroded in 
Yugoslavia and it has forced the rest of the world through the 
United Nations to try to salvage some dignity, some peace and 
some sense of humanitarian obligation to the people living in the 
former republics of Yugoslavia.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As the conflict in the Balkans escalated, the UN gradually 
extended its mandate beyond the borders of Croatia. For 
instance, the mission was asked to open the airport in Sarajevo.
<P>
	I must say a few words about the President of France, François 
Mitterrand, who showed great courage when he visited Sarajevo 
two years ago.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The president of France demonstrated great courage in 
drawing the world's attention to the conflict in Yugoslavia. I 
would also join with my colleague, the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, in congratulating the people and government of France 
together with the British government for having supplied along 
with Canada the largest contingents of forces in Yugoslavia.
<P>
	Today we have about 2,000 personnel in Bosnia and Croatia 
and that is one of the focuses, perhaps the principal focus for this 
particular debate. We care about them. These are our people. 
They are doing our bidding.
<P>
	Canadians have played their part in two world wars and the 
Korean war. I do not think we want to be part of any other larger 
wars in the latter part of the century or as we go into the 21st 
century. It is the lessons that have been learned from our actions 
in those wars that lead Canadians to use their military expertise, 
their technical know-how and their understanding of conflicts 
to try to help the United Nations in bringing peace to some of the 
hot spots that we see today.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I had the honour of visiting our troops very 
briefly for a few days in December of last year. I was first in 
Croatia then in Sarajevo and Visoko and then with our ship 
HMCS <I>Iroquois</I> in the Adriatic which is enforcing the sanctions 
with other members of NATO and the United Nations.
<P>
	I was struck by the uniformity of purpose and the unity with 
which our men and women view our role in Croatia and Bosnia. I 
did not hear from them one word about whether or not they had 
any doubts about the utility of being in that very difficult spot. 
At night when we slept in the camp at Visoko and shots rang out 
and as we travelled to Sarajevo with shots all around us in our 
convoy, not one of those people exhibited any fear of the danger.
<P>
	I can say that I had some fears. However, these men and 
women live with this every single day. They are prepared to 
follow the instructions of the Canadian people as expressed in 
Parliament and by the government. If we want them to come 
home then they will come home. If we want them to stay then 
they will stay. There is, however, no dissension on the part of our 
troops.
<P>
	In fact, the deputy UN commander, General John MacInnis, is 
a Canadian and he has made some very courageous statements. 
There was one in the newspapers the other week about 
Srebrenica: ``It is not for the Serbs or any of these factions to 
dictate what battalions or groups of soldiers can relieve others. 
We are not here to be dictated to by these factions. We will 
determine whether or not there will be Ukrainians or whether 
there will be Dutch or whether there will be Nordics or 
Malaysians that will replace our troops''.
<P>
	General MacInnis has the full support of the people under his 
command and I salute him and the work that he is doing. There is 
also the work of Colonel David Moore. Many in this House have 
heard him speak on radio and television. This is the gentleman in 
charge of our forces in Visoko, right in the centre of Bosnia. This 
is the gentleman who has to worry day and night about the safety 
of his people but more about the safety of the people in the 
surrounding areas.
<P>
	Who can forget those graphic portrayals of our good work and 
our duty in keeping those hospitals open in Fojnica and 
Dakovica? When the civilians had to leave for fear of retaliation 
and death it was Canadian troops that kept those hospitals alive, 
whether it was washing laundry or whether it was bringing food. 
This was the real humanitarian side of the peacekeeping that our 
forces are doing in Bosnia.
<P>
	I find it a little odd. I do not want to be critical of the news 
media or of Canadians in general or some commentators but it 
seems that a lot of people have only just become aware of the 
heightened danger that our troops face on a daily basis when the 
<I>New York Times</I> says there was danger. Maybe that says 
something about Canadians when we have to look at the <I>New 
York Times</I> to say whether or not something is dangerous. We 
have all known on this side that it has been dangerous. Our 
troops have known it is dangerous.
<P>
	We cannot be intimidated by some of the actions that are 
going on on the ground every single day. There were two 
incidents last Sunday which we made public.
<P>
	The troops there are working hard. They are devoted and they 
will continue to be there and work as hard as they can as long as 
we want them there. Therefore the views that are expressed 
today should not be taken lightly. I am not suggesting that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="279"> 279 </A></B>
<P>
members will take it lightly because it is very important that we 
underscore our commitment for them and the aims of the United 
Nations and peacekeeping in general.
<P>
	In Canada this support for peacekeeping I believe is still 
there. We have heard about opinion polls that say Canadians 
want our people to withdraw. After hearing some of the 
comments from the other side and hopefully some from this side 
today, I think they will realize there is more to it than simple 
withdrawal and some of those concerns have already been 
expressed.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	It is up to us as elected representatives to make the hard 
decisions about what Canada, and by extension our Canadian 
forces, should do. Peacekeeping continues to dominate our 
operational activities and this poses special challenges for the 
Canadian forces who must balance their peacekeeping 
commitments with their other national and international 
commitments.
<P>
	Achieving this balance is not going to be easy. Our current 
peacekeeping and related missions are considerable in terms of 
both the sheer geographic reach of the Canadian forces and the 
different types of operation and commitment involved.
<P>
	At the same time as the complexity and the cost of 
peacekeeping missions increase, here at home we are faced with 
the hard realities of declining budgets and reductions in the 
regular force. I made statements on that earlier and members 
will be hearing more about that as the weeks go on.
<P>
	Let us face the truth. The more we cut back in our defence 
budget the more we restrict our ability to perform these essential 
peacekeeping tasks along with our other military obligations.
<P>
	If Canadians wish to continue to be leaders in the field of 
peacekeeping and continue to make this important contribution 
to stability in troubled regions then Canadian forces must be 
adequately trained and appropriately equipped. In other words, 
they must be combat capable forces.
<P>
	Finally, Canadians must accept the risk involved in sending 
our troops abroad to areas of recent or ongoing conflict.
<P>
	We have seen where UN peacekeeping has been. While we 
cannot predict where it will go in the future it seems likely there 
will be a continuing need for UN involvement in the world's hot 
spots at least for the next few years. This will pose many 
challenges for us on the government side and for all Canadians. I 
invite members to think very carefully before they advocate a 
hasty withdrawal from the former Yugoslavia and perhaps 
reflect upon the continuation of our peacekeeping in general.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are very 
happy to take part in this debate on Bosnia, but the minister of 
defence will agree that the financial aspects will be dealt with in 
a few weeks, maybe as early as next week, when the budget 
comes down. For the time being we have to limit ourselves to 
our commitment to peace in the world, and especially in Bosnia.
<P>
	Does the minister not think that considering a unilateral 
withdrawal of our troops, like the Prime Minister did, when 
those same troops under the United Nations mandate were 
responsible for disarming the Bosnian people, is rather 
unrealistic? Can we honestly say, after having disarmed the 
Bosnians, that we are seriously considering a unilateral 
withdrawal?
<P>
	I understand how difficult the situation is and how difficult it 
is to find a solution. Nevertheless, we already acted in a certain 
way, particularly toward the Bosnian people, and the minister 
will admit that it is rather difficult, indeed impossible, to 
withdraw now and leave the Bosnian people at the mercy of the 
Serbs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> I would say, Mr. Speaker, that the hon. 
member answered his own question. He underlined a very 
important point, and I hope other members will also give me 
their opinion on that point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I said a few minutes ago, when I went to Croatia, I 
met our troops in the southern part of the country where 
problems abound. The commanding officer over there, Colonel 
Marc Lessard, gave me a briefing on the situation. Once again I 
would like to pay tribute to the courage of the soldiers working 
in that region and in the other parts of Croatia and Bosnia. 
Colonel Lessard mentioned some problems which I hope the 
minister will look at closely in order to find a solution. We 
talked about three main problems: first, the insufficient number 
of soldiers at BATCAN I. According to Colonel Lessard, they 
need more people, 49 additional peacekeepers for example, to 
increase our infantry sections from 9 to 10 persons. Second, they 
need mechanics, cooks and other people if they are to do their 
work properly. Third, there seems to be a problem with the 
vehicle pool and with supplies.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	Having given the minister the details I ask him to promise he 
will seriously consider Colonel Lessard's requests concerning 
the resources our military in Croatia need to accomplish their 
important task.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member 
functioning as a go between with our members on the ground in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="280"> 280 </A></B>
<P>
Croatia and the command here, but these are comments that not 
only I have heard but have been expressed throughout the 
command structure in the armed forces and we are trying to deal 
with them.
<P>
	The problem is that some of these supply routes are very 
difficult especially in winter conditions not unlike some of the 
conditions we see outside the Parliament Buildings. They do 
not, however, have snowploughs, salt trucks and sand trucks 
which makes it very dangerous. In fact two of our members from 
le 2e Régiment de Valcartier died a few weeks ago just before 
Christmas because of traffic accidents.
<P>
	There is no question that better equipment and better 
provisions will obviously help our troops. I think the comments 
the hon. member is making are in a sense a wish list of 
improvements that any commander on the ground would like to 
see. I do not think it is any evidence of a lack of being properly 
prepared to take on the very onerous duties that they are 
undertaking.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wonder if the minister might comment on just the priority that 
the defence department itself feels should be assigned to 
international peacekeeping. As we look at the military we really 
see that it is being asked to perform four functions on about $12 
billion: the protection of Canadian sovereignty; the 
participation in European security through NATO; international 
peacekeeping; and of course the backing up of the civil authority 
in cases like Oka.
<P>
	I wonder if the minister could comment on just where he sees 
international peacekeeping and peace enforcement in that list of 
priorities. It looks like we are asking the military to do a lot of 
things.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad the hon. member for 
Calgary Southwest and leader of the Reform Party raised his 
question. As was mentioned by my colleague, the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, earlier in the debate, there will be defence and 
foreign policy reviews. These long range questions should 
really be addressed within that context. I hope that today's 
specific debates, because of the urgency of the peacekeeping 
and because of our urgency in dealing with the question of cruise 
missile tests, do not undermine those particular reviews that will 
take the balance of the year to complete.
<P>
	The questions that he posed are very valid. Hopefully the 
committee will give us in government ideas on where we should 
be emphasizing our money and personnel in the years to come.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an 
honour and a privilege for me to speak on this matter which I 
consider to be of great importance, as no doubt do all of my 
colleagues in this House.
<P>
	Representatives of the various political parties have thus far 
expressed at times similar, at times opposing, views. Technical 
explanations have also been provided about different things, 
whether it be with respect to monetary issues, to equipment or to 
adjustments in the strength of our troops abroad.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	It is my fervent wish to help this House come to an 
enlightened decision on international policy as regards UN 
missions.
<P>
	In an effort to understand this contentious mission, I, like 
each one of you I trust, reviewed the history of the former 
Yugoslavia which, over the months and years, has splintered 
into several independent nations, namely Slovenia, Croatia, 
Bosnia-Hercegovina and Macedonia, as mentioned several 
times by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of 
National Defence.
<P>
	How did a federation that had survived for more than 40 years 
come to this end? National division was undoubtedly 
emphasized by political ideals, territory and culture. What 
explanation can there be, however, for the slaughter involving 
more often than not innocent civilians? The answer is not simple 
as each warring faction believes it has the legitimate right to 
reclaim land which it feels is rightfully its own.
<P>
	The warring factions believe so strongly in their legitimate 
right to act that they sometimes feel the UN has no right to 
intervene or, at the very least, they occasionally challenge the 
UN's presence by refusing to cease hostilities.
<P>
	The nations of the world have seen on television and read in 
the press the number of casualties and rapes, to the point where 
no one can remain indifferent to this situation. And therein lies 
the problem. What steps should the United Nations and, by the 
same token Canada, take in their quest for a better, more humane 
world in order to put an end to this shameful situation?
<P>
	Following World War II, the United Nations were established 
as an organization founded on the principles of international 
peacekeeping and security. This organization is taking 
collective, effective steps to prevent threats to peace and to 
counter any act of aggression through peaceful means, in 
accordance with the principles of international law and justice.
<P>
	The United Nations supports the forging of friendly relations 
based on respect for the principle of equal rights among peoples 
and their right to self-determination.
<P>
	Canada must continue in its traditional role of peacekeeper. 
Canada's role is to maintain peace, not enforce it, as this would 
be a major shift away from Canada's historic role.
<P>
	The peacekeepers should remain in Bosnia in order to 
continue protecting humanitarian relief convoys and we should 
recognize, despite media reports, the excellent  work they are 
doing in helping to save Bosnian lives. We must also 
acknowledge the contributions of our soldiers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="281"> 281 </A></B>
<P>
	Our troops have re-opened two hospitals and kept them 
running. They have installed pumps to provide safe drinking 
water for residents. And, of course, they have escorted many 
convoys bringing relief, food and clothing to the besieged, 
helpless population.
<P>
	However, while the presence of UN forces has helped to avert 
total disaster, there is no question that a great deal more needs to 
be done. The safety of the peacekeepers must be enhanced.
<P>
	Negotiations must continue and at an accelerated pace 
because the Canadian public is beginning to get upset about the 
cost of peacekeeping operations and the majority of our 
constituents are growing tired of seeing our peacekeepers trying 
to keep the peace where there is no peace to keep. Some feel that 
we should impose peace. However, most are of the opinion that 
governments lack the political will to authorize a military strike 
and that because of this, our peacekeepers should withdraw and 
leave these peoples to decide their own fate. And this is 
precisely what the United Nations and Canada must not do.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	My colleague from Rosemont mentioned earlier that the 
United Nations had effectively disarmed the Bosnians, but it had 
also been agreed that the peacekeepers would stay on to protect 
them. That is one more reason for not withdrawing our 
peacekeeping forces.
<P>
	The loss of confidence by the Canadian people certainly 
reflects the mood, the public opinion in other UN nations. That 
is why, given Canada's leadership in peacekeeping, if we 
withdrew our forces, that could trigger a similar move on the 
part of other UN nations, which would be unfair and fatal for the 
civilian populations concerned.
<P>
	However, it would appear that recently peacekeeping has 
taken precedence at times over the real interests of the Canadian 
people, with Canada allocating military resources to several 
peacekeeping operations without seeing the need to get a clear 
and firm mandate. With regard to this peacekeeping race, 
Canada has also reduced its defence expenditures envelope, 
forcing our troops to play this role while providing them with 
less and jeopardizing their security.
<P>
	Canada will have to look over its latest missions and learn 
from them. The United Nations will have to reconsider the 
peacekeeping process, as telling figures clearly show that the 
situation has changed considerably and that UN interventions 
are not conducted in the same spirit or under the same 
circumstances as they used to be. UN statistics show that over a 
40-year period from 1948 to 1988, there were 754 casualties 
among UN peacekeepers, as compared to 197 killed in Somalia 
and Bosnia in 1993 alone. This huge difference clearly 
demonstrates that unfortunately the peacekeeping scene  has 
changed radically and that a clear and unequivocal stand will 
have to be taken before any new operation can go ahead. As a 
matter of fact, nearly all press statements by generals from the 
United Nations protection force, UNPROFOR, conveyed 
frustration and a sense of helplessness in the face of explosive 
situations they could do nothing about.
<P>
	I would like, at this point, to try to outline on what basis the 
decision should be made in Canada to participate in UN 
missions or not.
<P>
	It is clear that Canada can no longer afford to participate in all 
missions.
<P>
	The Canadian government will have to think twice before 
taking action. This action will have to meet universal criteria 
such as humanitarian, political and unfortunately economic 
considerations. Having assessed these, it will then have to set a 
deadline by which the goals specified in the assessments have to 
be reached always keeping in mind financial implications.
<P>
	As with all Canadian activities, it will be necessary to give up 
the myth of a rich and prosperous Canada and face reality.
<P>
	Our troops are proud to take part in these missions but we 
must clarify what the framework should be and what equipment 
is required and appropriate. Can we still afford this? Does the 
public still support such endeavours?
<P>
	I think that within the context of joint action within the United 
Nations as well as NATO, a system should be established by 
which each participating nation would contribute in a specific 
area.
<P>
	Joint action should be discussed in the UN, where a decision 
on the mandate of the peacekeepers from the United Nations 
protection force in Bosnia must be made by the end of April.
<P>
	This mission should never be viewed as a total failure, 
because the situation in Croatia has indeed been stabilized and, 
furthermore, the escalation of the conflict in Macedonia and 
Kosovo has effectively been halted.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, the withdrawal of the peacekeepers from 
Bosnia is not a desirable option in the present context, as the 
consequences would be disastrous for the civilian population 
and for the Bosnians, who have been almost completely 
disarmed by the UN forces protecting them.
<P>
	Obviously, a military strike would make the peacekeepers' 
job less frustrating but perhaps more dangerous. As I was saying 
earlier, we must press for further negotiations in the hope that an 
agreement can be reached before the end of the mandate next 
April and even consider tightening the embargo against the 
Bosnian Serbs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="282"> 282 </A></B>
<P>
	On the other hand, it would be unthinkable to try to clarify 
Canada's future role without undertaking a global review of our 
national defence policy.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to point out to the hon. minister of 
defence that our defence policy must be reviewed as soon as 
possible, that patience is running out among Canadians 
concerned about military spending and soldiers who need 
specific mandates in order to do a good job.
<P>
	In closing, I want to tell all Canadian peacekeepers how much 
we respect and admire the work they do in a difficult and often 
hostile environment.
<P>
	I especially want to salute the officers and troops from 
Valcartier, who account for over 80 per cent of the peacekeeping 
force in Bosnia. I am personally concerned as that base is 
located partly in my riding of Charlesbourg and partly in that of 
my colleague from Portneuf.
<P>
	Through their commitment and their work, those soldiers 
have helped preserve Canada's tradition of excellence in 
peacekeeping.
<P>
	As I said before, they can count on all the understanding and 
support that my party and myself can offer them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I request the unanimous consent of the House to 
continue sitting between one and two p.m.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Hon. members heard the 
request. Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if there is unanimous consent the government side is 
quite happy to sit through lunch.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We will now go on to the 
period of questions and comments following the intervention of 
the hon. member for Charlesbourg.
<P>
	There not being any we will resume debate with the hon. 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to congratulate you on 
your appointment as a deputy speaker since this is the first 
opportunity I have had to do so.
<P>
	I would also like to thank and congratulate the right hon. 
Prime Minister for allowing the House to have this debate on 
peacekeeping and defence issues so early in the 35th Parliament. 
We see a big difference between the 34th Parliament and the 
35th Parliament. We had requested many such debates in the 
34th Parliament and such debates never happened.
<P>
	I hope all members of all parties will take to heart the words of 
the right hon. Prime Minister when he said: ``We want to hear 
your individual views''. I know someone from the New 
Democratic Party just arrived from that region. It would be very 
important to hear what he has to say. This is an opportunity to 
put on our creative hats, not to have to worry about party 
discipline, and to express what we know from our constituents 
and what we know from our experience.
<P>
	I also take this opportunity to congratulate the constituents of 
Parkdale-High Park, especially the Canadians of Croatian, 
Serbian and Muslim descent. I must say that in my 10 years of 
representing the area and having so many Canadians of those 
backgrounds in my riding we have never had any conflicts, any 
squabbles, any fights, et cetera. The Canadians of Muslim, 
Serbian, Croatian descent are showing that these three peoples 
can live together in peace and harmony. I congratulate them 
through this forum and all Canadians across this land who are 
showing the example that we want peace and not the kind of 
thing that is ongoing in Bosnia.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	The Leader of the Official Opposition rightly took us through 
the happenings at the end of the cold war and immediately after 
the cold war, how Solidarnosc started the movement and then 
the Baltic states and other countries. However the world has 
become a more not a less complicated place since the end of the 
cold war.
<P>
	As the minister mentioned in his statement the key body in the 
international system, the United Nations, is straining to keep up 
with the increasing demands being placed on it. Canada is 
working to alleviate the pressure on the UN. Our approach is a 
broad scope. It ranges from strengthening and reforming the UN 
system itself, including providing staff to key areas such as the 
peacekeeping unit, to promoting the concept of co-operative 
security in which strengthened regional institutions and 
arrangements can play a larger role in contributing to 
international peace and security, thus relieving some of the 
burden placed on the UN system.
<P>
	In this brief intervention I would like to focus on the efforts of 
Canada to encourage and position regional organizations to play 
a more active role in support of the UN. If we put the emphasis 
on regional institutions getting into potential conflict areas this 
will alleviate the pressures of the UN and then it can do a more 
effective job in crises such as the one in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	In January 1992 the UN Secretary General launched his 
agenda for peace. As the minister mentioned in this document 
the Secretary General spoke about conflict prevention and 
preventive diplomacy. In this regard he highlighted the 
increasingly important role that regional organizations could 
take to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="283"> 283 </A></B>
<P>
prevent and resolve crises so that they need not come to the 
attention of the UN every time.
<P>
	As the House knows Canada strongly supports the agenda for 
peace and is working to implement many of the Secretary 
General's recommendations. I was pleased that our 
parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs and 
International Trade in the 34th Parliament submitted its 
recommendations and views on the agenda for peace. I was 
pleased that our Senate committee on foreign affairs also 
responded to the agenda for peace.
<P>
	We have taken to heart the Secretary General's challenge to 
regional organizations to pull their weight more effectively on 
the global scene. Let me be more specific. I would like to speak 
about three key areas in which Canadians can show leadership, 
Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America, as well as say a brief 
word about the new initiatives in the Commonwealth and the 
Francophonie.
<P>
	Post cold war Europe is a place of both enormous 
opportunities and challenges. As mentioned by the minister, 
Canada is placing considerable emphasis on strenghthening the 
ability of our key pan-European and transatlantic security 
forum, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, 
to prevent and resolve conflicts.
<P>
	Thanks largely to Canada's efforts over the past few years the 
CSCE has the most extensive framework for conflict 
management of any regional organization. We are now working 
to fine tune these mechanisms and to enhance the CSCE's ability 
to take action to prevent conflict. The key to conflict prevention 
is to deal with the root causes of tension and conflict, many of 
which are to be found in the areas of human rights, especially 
minority rights. For that reason Canada is strongly supporting 
CSCE instruments such as the CSCE High Commissioner on 
National Minorities, whose task is to serve as an early warning 
mechanism by providing a Canadian expert to the high 
commissioner's investigative team in Slovakia and Hungary.
<P>
	The CSCE also has conflict management missions in places 
such as Latvia, Estonia, Georgia, Moldova, Skopje and 
Tajikistan. Canada has participated actively in these missions. 
We have headed the mission to Moldova and have personnel in 
the former Yugoslavia as well as on shorter term missions to the 
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Nagorno-Karabakh and 
Bosnia-Hercegovina. These missions undertake fact finding 
and conciliation, investigate human rights problems, and 
generally assist these countries in making the transition to 
democracy.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Canada is continuing to refine the framework for CSCE 
peacekeeping, a Canadian initiative. This mechanism adopted at 
the 1992 Helsinki summit makes the CSCE the only regional 
organization with the ability to mandate a peaceful operation. It 
permits the CSCE to call upon the UN's expertise and assistance 
as well as that of other regional organizations, notably NATO. 
While this mechanism has not yet been used it is in place should  
CSCE states ever need to call upon it. Let us hope it does not, but 
if it does the mechanism is in place.
<P>
	As the Minister of Foreign Affairs stated to his colleagues at 
the December meeting of CSCE foreign ministers in Rome, 
Canada will promote innovative approaches to conflict 
management in the CSCE region. He underlined this 
government's commitment to the CSCE and Canada's readiness 
to play a leadership role within the organization. He also 
committed Canada to working on a comprehensive assessment 
of the CSCE's conflict management efforts to date and to make 
specific practical recommendations that will help the CSCE deal 
more effectively with future challenges.
<P>
	This organization has its failures too. I have to be very honest 
in the House. Again this is my own personal opinion. I attended 
some of the CSCE meetings and the process is decision by 
consensus. Members know what it is like in their own caucuses, 
how difficult it is to come to a consensus sometimes.
<P>
	While the politicians and the diplomats are working on 
wording that is acceptable to everyone, we see reports such as 
we saw on the CTV last night where six youngsters were killed 
last weekend, where a young lad was getting shrapnel pulled out 
of his side, and where a child was walking with only one leg. We 
heard the report about shell-shocked children, the 
psychological effects of just being injured or witnessing what is 
happening there. It talked about the Sarajevo syndrome. 
Children need tranquillizers to sleep. The same report talked 
about the high suicide rate and passive suicide. People actually 
walk into the streets to get killed. They cannot take what is going 
on in the region any more so they walk out hoping that a bullet 
will kill them and end it all.
<P>
	While the death toll reaches hundreds of thousands and with 
all that is happening daily, CSCE argues about wording 
acceptable to all member countries. Although I am placing a lot 
of emphasis on CSCE, having attended its important conference 
in Madrid 12 years ago I do have my criticism of it. I appeal to 
the international community to make the CSCE, with the help of 
Canada, more effective.
<P>
	As the House is aware Canada joined the Organization of 
American States or OAS in 1990. I stood in the House on the 
other side to criticize the government not for joining the OAS 
but for how it got Canada to join. Canada joined the OAS 
without any consultation with the Canadian people, without any 
debate in the House as we are having now, and without even 
asking the standing committee on foreign affairs to look into the 
implications of joining OAS. We were very critical not of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="284"> 284 </A></B>
<P>
OAS membership but how the former Prime Minister made the 
decision without any consultation or debate.
<P>
	Since joining, Canada has made one of its priorities 
enhancing the role of the OAS in promoting regional security 
and stability. In its short time as an OAS member Canada has 
succeeded in putting these issues firmly on the OAS agenda.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	The OAS now has a permanent committee on hemispheric 
security. Canada is focusing the committee's work on security 
questions such as conflict prevention and management, 
confidence building measures, CBMs, conventional arms and 
transfers in non-proliferation. Canada is also stressing the 
importance of strengthening co-operation between the OAS and 
the UN in conflict prevention and management.
<P>
	In March a Canadian promoted OAS meeting on confidence 
building measures will take place in Argentina. As a former 
principal of Argentina Public School in my riding of 
Parkdale-High Park and as a current member of the 
Argentine-Canadian Friendship Institute, I am pleased this 
meeting will be taking place in that part of the world. The reason 
I was principal of Argentina Public School was because we were 
twinned with Canada's school in Buenos Aires.
<P>
	When we are talking about peace I think we should begin with 
the children, with the future citizens of this planet, because our 
attitudes are difficult to change. When we started with children 
being twinned with other countries it is amazing how children as 
young as age five were learning about the language, the culture 
and the peoples of a country as far away as Argentina.
<P>
	Unfortunately because of the Falkland war the Toronto Board 
of Education decided to remove the name and it is back to 
Garden Avenue. What a sad commentary, blaming the children 
for the Falkland war. One recommendation I would toss out so 
that all members could take it to their constituents is for them to 
be on the lookout. Maybe there is a school in a riding that can be 
twinned with a school in a faraway country. We will all be richer 
for it.
<P>
	This June at the OAS general assembly Canada will be 
bringing forward new proposals to strengthen the OAS role in 
dealing with regional security challenges.
<P>
	A word on our efforts within the Commonwealth and the 
Francophonie organizations which bridge traditional 
north-south and east-west divisions in the world. Neither of 
these organizations have well developed approaches to conflict 
management. For this reason Canada submitted proposals for 
the development of conflict management mechanisms at both 
the Commonwealth and Francophonie summits this past 
summer. These ideas are very new to both organizations. Canada 
will continue to work to make these proposals a reality.
<P>
	I have outlined a wide range of initiatives which Canada is 
undertaking within regional organizations. I do not have time to 
go into the ASEAN group and other regional organizations that 
could help address conflicts arising in that part of the world.
<P>
	The House should have noticed common themes in what I 
have said so far. First, support for the UN; second, emphasis on 
conflict prevention; and, third, development of mechanisms 
which can be in place and be called on by states to assist in 
resolving problems before they erupt into conflict and before 
they require the already overtaxed resources of the United 
Nations.
<P>
	As the minister stated this government is committed to 
supporting the United Nations. This government is also 
committed to positioning regional organizations to play a more 
active and effective role in complementing the important global 
efforts of the United Nations in promoting co-operative security 
and in building international peace and stability.
<P>
	I call upon the international community with which I quite 
often have the pleasure of meeting through the diplomatic corps 
in Ottawa to do everything in its power to strengthen the various 
regional organizations and to make them more effective in 
coping with future emergencies, thus alleviating the pressures 
on the United Nations and making it more effective in 
guaranteeing international peace and security.
<P>
	If we do not follow this course then Lieutenant Colonel Ian 
Malcolm who served with the Canadian forces for 23 years and 
was involved in peacekeeping in Egypt, Iraq and Namibia may 
be correct in a recent document wherein he asks: ``Does the blue 
helmet fit?''
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
also like to commend the government for this initiative, this 
emergency debate which it has called non-partisan. Since this 
morning, we have seen how much all members on both sides of 
the House have made it a duty to speak in a completely 
non-partisan way.
<P>
	I think that this government initiative, which is definitely a 
credit to it, should be repeated on many other occasions, in 
keeping with what I think is the desire of all members, 
especially those like me who are not designated critics or do not 
have specific duties, be they on the government side or not. This 
is an opportunity for us to express our views and at the same 
time to show that different points of view can still lead to 
consensus, especially as far as major issues such as the ones we 
are studying today are concerned.
<P>
	I listened with admiration to the speech of the previous 
speaker who spoke in his own name and said that he wanted his 
government to go ahead and maintain troops to keep peace in the 
world. He spoke eloquently about children. I believe that aspect 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="285"> 285 </A></B>
<P>
cannot be over-emphasized; children are often victims of these 
wars  which benefit only arms dealers or crackpot idealists or 
people who will use any means to reach their ends.
<P>
	However, I would like to have some clarification on air raids, 
which are at the heart of the debate on Bosnia. When we go on 
peace missions, do we also have to have air raids or should it be 
the other way around: if we are attacked from the air, should we 
respond to these attacks after receiving an order from the 
commander in chief? Consultation can take about an hour. I 
would like the previous speaker to tell me more about what he 
thinks of these air raids.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments and compliments and for supporting today's process. 
If the hon. member does not see enough of such debates I hope 
he will remind us that it is time for another. In debates like this 
we see the best of every member of Parliament, all 295.
<P>
	Actually the hon. member's comments and questions coincide 
with a poll that was reported in the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I> today. The 
poll suggests that an overwhelming majority of Canadians 
favour the idea of UN peacekeeping in general, but six in 10 
respondents said that Canada's mission in Bosnia is too risky 
and should be ended in April. I quote from the poll: ``More and 
more Canadians are saying it is too damned expensive and it is 
so dangerous, why not have some other countries take on the 
job?''
<P>
	The poll also suggests that when the heat is high in Bosnia, 
meaning the military heat, attitudes toward peacekeeping are 
cool in Canada but if the shooting stops then Canadians want 
their soldiers to be there to administer humanitarian aid.
<P>
	I think when we send our troops there the one thing our 
mandate should guarantee is the safety of our Canadian forces. It 
is all right for countries to negotiate air strikes but how can air 
strikes be negotiated and mandated if the Canadian 
peacekeepers are in that region? That is where we will not get 
the support of Canadians if things like that happen.
<P>
	If one of our soldiers has to come back you know how, I do not 
think we will get much support from Canadians in future 
peacekeeping. Yet our troops have the highest reputation in the 
world.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	I had the good fortune of being in Cyprus and was talking to 
our Canadians forces. I talked with the British commander who 
begged Canada to please not pull the Canadian forces out 
because they are such an excellent example for the other 
countries that have peacekeeping forces.
<P>
	We had an example in the Bosnia-Hercegovina area when it 
was time to remove the Canadian soldiers and replace them by 
soldiers from another country. The Serbs said no. They said they 
would accept the Canadians but not the troops of another 
country. The Canadian forces have this ability. They are 
respected by the Muslims, they are respected by the Croats and 
they are respected by the Serbs. That is why we can play such an 
important role. However, if we start dropping bombs on them, 
our taxpayers will give us the message to bring our troops home.
<P>
	First, before we make any such move I think we have to ensure 
the safety of our troops over there.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member was right 
when he said that our taxpayers are concerned. There is even 
mention, in the poll referred to, of a will to withdraw from 
peacekeeping operations in Bosnia. I wonder if this is not a 
golden opportunity to analyse our need for military equipment.
<P>
	As members of the Opposition, we supported the government 
when it decided to cancel the helicopter contract, but now we 
know that 800 extremely sophisticated tanks are presently being 
built in Ontario. We also have various military equipment, such 
as our F-18 airplanes, for which it costs $1 million just to train 
the pilot.
<P>
	Should we not rethink the role of our armed forces in order to 
reduce all this equipment, to specialize our troops further in 
those peacekeeping missions, and therefore to reduce 
expenditures and activities in other military sectors where this 
material is rarely used, or should we consider leaving some 
special role to other members of NATO, since Canada has 
already participated in all the peacekeeping missions since the 
Second World War? Is that not something to consider?
<P>
	The total budget could be reduced by eliminating some 
equipment which may not be necessary, but the money saved 
would enable us to carry on with our peacekeeping missions 
without overburdening our taxpayers once again. I would like to 
hear the hon. member's point of view.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> Mr. Speaker, when the cold war ended everyone was 
hoping that there would be peace dividends; money that would 
be saved on defence would be put toward economic renewal, 
stimulus, reducing poverty on this planet, et cetera. That is why 
this government is recommending a review of our foreign affairs 
and defence policy.
<P>
	As the Prime Minister mentioned and offered, both standing 
committees will be going to the people of Canada to review our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="286"> 286 </A></B>
<P>
existing policy. I hope the hon. member will make his 
interventions on behalf of his constituents again at that time.
<P>
	I would also recommend to the member that tomorrow there 
will be another debate. It will be on whether or not we should 
continue with the cruise missile testing. That would be another 
excellent forum for the hon. member to raise this.
<P>
	That is why I think we have come to the stage in the 
development of our country and the development of our foreign 
policy to take an in depth look and review by consulting 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
both an honour and a privilege to rise today and to acknowledge 
your election as Speaker of the House. I am sure that it will 
always be an encouragement to you to know that your peers gave 
you a mandate to provide both guidance and prudence to this 
House as we work through the days and decisions which lie 
ahead of us.
<P>
	I also salute each of my colleagues, the men and women 
elected to this 35th Parliament. I am like them. I have been 
elected to serve my constituents of Calgary Southeast in this 
House of the people and trust that our collective wisdom will 
serve them well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member for Québec-Est said that he was the last one 
from his caucus to rise and address this House. I feel the same 
way. This has enabled me to gain experience and I must say that 
today's debate is extremely important and requires that each of 
us gives it the necessary attention.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want that thought to be known to my constituents of Calgary 
Southeast. I am sure that everyone within my riding will have an 
opinion on the war in Bosnia. Their concern will come from a 
desire to see lasting peace and greater tolerance and charity for 
others. I believe they collectively reflect the views of most 
Canadians.
<P>
	We talk of Bosnia in an abstract sense but to bring it closer to 
my home, the fighting encompasses an area of 178,000 square 
kilometres. This area is like a block of land that extends from 
just north of Edmonton to just south of Calgary. There are more 
displaced people in this area of fighting than the entire 
populations of Edmonton and Calgary combined, more than 1.6 
million people. Such a staggering figure should make it 
abundantly clear that we cannot sit idly by in a state of 
indecision as the fighting continues, as more families are torn 
asunder, as more children are killed and orphaned, as more 
people come to believe and accept hatred and intolerance as a 
way of life.
<P>
	My own concern arises from an intensely personal 
perspective. That is what I am bringing here today, because I am 
of Croatian heritage. My mother was born in a small village just 
outside of Zagreb. I have several family members still living 
there. They are quite elderly and they have no desire to leave 
their homes. They are quite typical of those who remain there.
<P>
	Of the men and women there, the women and children have all 
been evacuated. The men, the husbands and fathers, are the ones 
who are caught up in the machinery of war. Life in that village is 
not like what you or I could ever imagine.
<P>
	It is difficult to believe that members of my family who live 
within hearing distance of those bombs dropping-and that is 
about 10 kilometres-can say: ``The war is not too near and life 
is managed as best we can''.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that we see ourselves as a nation seeking 
peaceful solutions and demonstrating tolerance and charity to 
others. I believe we are now struggling with how these inherent 
characteristics of our nationhood will help us to develop our 
response to a particularly brutal and unforgiving war. Having 
said that, as I thought about what I would say here as I stood 
before you today, there were three questions that kept coming to 
my mind which I believe have to be answered in any response 
that we offer.
<P>
	First of all, are the people in this war dedicated to destroying 
each other? Second, will an intervention bring any lasting 
peace? The third question I asked: are we prepared as a country 
to watch Canadian soldiers die in this war without apparent end?
<P>
	In response to the first question: are the people involved in 
this war dedicated to destroying each other? It appears that the 
answer is yes. While diplomatic efforts to end the war go on 
fruitlessly, the killing continues unabated. Life has been 
reduced to a primitive state with no electricity and no running 
water. People who were neighbours and friends became bitter 
enemies overnight. Serbs are killing Bosnian Muslims and 
Croats. Croats are killing Muslims and sometimes Serbs. 
Muslims are killing their attackers. I cannot imagine how 
anyone living in the midst of this carnage can remain objective.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	Second, will an intervention bring any lasting peace? There is 
a fundamental tension to the focus of our debate because of our 
legal and moral obligations toward intervention in the region. 
Are we going to intervene? Also, what costs are we willing to 
accept if we do intervene without making a simultaneous effort 
to bring the conflict to an end? Do we want to see Canadian 
soldiers die as they bring humanitarian aid to the region?
<P>
	Canada as a signatory of the United Nations universal 
declaration of human rights has always taken a leading role in 
international responsibilities. Canadians are deservedly very 
proud of this. We fulfil our international obligations in many 
important ways.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="287"> 287 </A></B>
<P>
	I will mention just a few. We dispatch experienced and highly 
competent troops to the theatres of combat. In these theatres we 
care for the sick, wounded and hungry. We also provide here in 
our Canadian communities a safe haven to many of these 
peoples displaced by the fighting.
<P>
	In answer to the question of intervention, I do not believe that 
anything we do as humanitarians will make the difference.
<P>
	This is the last question. Are we prepared as a country to 
watch Canadian soldiers die in this war without apparent end?
<P>
	Our troops have been called peacekeepers and peacemakers. 
What an irony when there is no peace to keep or make. I 
recognize that our soldiers are providing necessary aid to 
hundreds of thousands of civilians, but they are also giving that 
same aid to the warring factions. In doing so, they are indirectly 
feeding the war. Our humanitarian role has been reduced to a 
bottomless intravenous bag sustaining a killing machine. Are 
we doing more harm than if we were not there at all?
<P>
	It is absolutely unacceptable to me to see the loss of one 
Canadian soldier in this war. It is not that we are scared or 
uncommitted or that we do not care, but losing Canadian lives in 
a situation where no one can win is a position I cannot sanction.
<P>
	I believe that the actions our government now takes can 
provide Canada with a masterful role as a moral leader and a 
defender of world peace.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion, I sincerely believe that our initiative will 
enable the Government of Canada to play a leading role and also 
to be a leader in the protection of world peace.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This requires a plan for peace that demands an international 
political will to end the war. We expect a diplomatic 
intervention and nothing less than an ultimatum to all of the 
aggressors to negotiate peace.
<P>
	The events as they have unfolded in Bosnia focused our hearts 
and minds on one inescapable conclusion. I am of the opinion 
that we cannot stay there as conditions now exist. We have an 
opportunity to show leadership as we state our expectation for 
peace to be made. If it is not met then we must leave.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with interest and emotion that I listened to what the 
hon. member had to say. I say emotion because I myself 
participated in a UN operation during four years, in the Congo, 
from 1961 to 1965, and I was lucky enough to get out of there in 
one piece.
<P>
	I appreciate the concern shown by the hon. member who is 
wondering if our soldiers should risk their lives or not. From this 
issue arises another rather technical question for which I have no 
answer and on which I was hoping this debate might shed some 
light. Should we or should we not ask the UN to give our soldiers 
broader powers to defend themselves when they are attacked, 
should we or should we not give them the right to retaliate and 
even patrol certain areas, at the risk of alienating the people and 
leading them to misinterpret our role, since retaliation would of 
course be seen as an act of aggression?
<P>
	If we decide to give our soldiers broader powers to defend 
themselves, we are putting their lives in danger since retaliation 
does involve some risks. But then, if we decide not to give them 
more leeway, we are also putting them at risk, since they will be 
left defenceless during an attack.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the question that was asked. I would like to say just a couple of 
things. I am like him. I am not a technocrat. The question he 
asked was one he stated would be very difficult to answer.
<P>
	I have to say how difficult it was given my background to 
write this speech. I came to this issue with my heart and my 
mind. The questions as I framed them were the ones that I felt 
comfortable I could provide a response to. I do believe that it is 
up to our diplomatic community to make a decision regarding 
the nature of the questions as you asked them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a comment more than a question to make to the hon. 
member.
<P>
	She indicated we cannot stay there and that we must make 
peace and get out. In order for us to accomplish peace we have to 
invest more time in understanding the region and its peoples.
<P>
	I attended the briefing yesterday and heard from our military 
people that they too are sometimes very confused as to who is 
doing what. There are conflicting stories continuously coming 
from the media. I am not sure what station it was but I followed a 
program on TV last night emphasizing how these people are 
being persecuted and that cleansing is taking place. I am very 
confused about who to believe, what to believe, what paper to 
read and so on.
<P>
	There is no question that we all want peace, however, the 
member for Kamloops made a statement earlier that it is country 
against country and nation against nation and region against 
region and the Greeks against the Macedonians. I would like to 
make the point that when we get information it is a matter of 
presenting the facts as they are.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="288"> 288 </A></B>
<P>
	What if we keep on referring to certain resolutions the United 
Nations has made in the past? It recognizes FYROM or the 
former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia. We should keep on 
referring to it as such as the name was approved by the United 
Nations and agreed upon by both parties. All we are doing here 
is adding fuel to the fire.
<P>
	I read a sports column the other day about breaking down the 
groups in the various European soccer competitions that are to 
take place next year. The newspaper stated that Greece will be in 
this section and Macedonia will be in another section. I think we 
have to help ourselves by presenting the facts as they are unless 
they are consistently presented as FYROM or the former 
Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I feel honoured to rise and speak on this subject today 
for a number of reasons.
<P>
	First, I think the fact that the Prime Minister has seen fit to 
encourage a debate of this nature so early in the 35th Parliament 
is I believe a tribute to our peacekeepers and the kind of 
operations that Canada has become expert in over a number of 
years.
<P>
	Second, I would like to point out what a-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I regret the intervention 
to the parliamentary secretary. I would ask for his indulgence 
and possibly that of the House. It has been my error or omission 
following the request from the Reform Party which had 
indicated earlier in this debate that it was splitting its questions 
into 10 and 5.
<P>
	I hope that with your consent I might recognize the member 
for Nanaimo-Cowichan. I would ask the parliamentary 
secretary to please help me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Mr. Speaker, seeing as how I forgot to 
congratulate you on your appointment, I think I should pay you 
back by allowing the Reform Party to speak on this subject.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the parliamentary 
secretary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> Mr. Speaker, I did 
not jump up when you called the hon. member for 
Bonavista-Trinity-Conception out of turn because I have 
such esteem for the gentleman, having known him over so many 
years. I was quite attentive to what it was he was going to say 
and would have held my peace.
<P>
	I will be very brief about the customary niceties of this 
maiden speech in order to save time for debate material on this 
subject of peacekeeping.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	First of all, I would like to congratulate the hon. member for 
Welland-St. Catharines-Thorold for being elected Speaker of 
this House and yourself for your appointment as acting speaker. 
As far as I was concerned, it was a small victory for democracy 
which we try to improve little by little.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would also like to thank my wife, Paula, for 40 years of 
unflagging support for me and in particular for the last two years 
of support.
<P>
	It is customary here to describe one's constituency. Let us just 
say that if one was to embellish all of the descriptions of 
constituencies heard so far in the House then that would describe 
Nanaimo-Cowichan. It cuts a swath of beauty from the tranquil 
Gulf Islands right across Vancouver Island to the wild and 
rugged west coast.
<P>
	To my constituents in Nanaimo-Cowichan, I thank them for 
the honour of representing them in Ottawa. I will try to help you 
understand what is happening in Ottawa if I understand it 
myself. However, I will certainly represent your interests in 
Ottawa and not Ottawa's interests to you.
<P>
	This brings us to the issue of the day which is peacekeeping 
and more particularly the situation in the former Yugoslavia. 
What do my constituents think? I believe that the people of 
Nanaimo-Cowichan, in common with many other Canadians, 
think as follows. We are proud of the record of Canadian 
peacekeepers. We are very proud of the troops who are there 
doing that job at the moment, the Royal 22e Régiment de 
Valcartier.
<P>
	However, Canada seems to be stumbling at the moment 
because of a lack of international leadership and political will.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	We also appear to be short of armed forces personnel to 
properly meet all current obligations. Therefore, the 
government's proposed review of foreign affairs and defence 
policies is timely and welcomed. We must determine if our 
peacekeeping activities are in accordance with these policies or 
should these policies be changed.
<P>
	My constituents see in the Bosnian situation the enmity of 
hundreds of years of religious and ethnic differences. There 
appears to be no way to end this hatred. At the same time, 
Canadians recognize that enmity of this sort is not confined to 
the Balkans. It is a world-wide problem which leads to atrocities 
and wars. The world community therefore must find better ways 
of dealing with it. The United Nations, NATO and the European 
Community are not perceived as being effective in dealing with 
the problem.
<P>
	In response to the hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs' statement 
this morning that he had been talking to his  colleagues in France 
and Britain, it would be helpful to this House for us to know in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="289"> 289 </A></B>
<P>
what detail. I am really curious to know what France and Britain 
are doing and what are their thoughts. What are the thoughts of 
all of the European Community vis-a-vis this terrible situation 
in the old Yugoslavia?
<P>
	My constituents have images of Canadian soldiers trying hard 
to help and sometimes being humiliated in the process. This is 
very much resented, to the point where some say: ``Let us get our 
personnel out of there''. Balancing this is the view that our 
troops do prevent many atrocities in their own sector and enable 
humanitarian aid to be given. Some therefore say that we must 
stay for humanitarian reasons alone. These views of my 
constituents seem to be in consonance with the views of other 
Canadians.
<P>
	There are factors other than my constituents' views to be 
considered with regard to Bosnia. With regard to Bosnia, as 
opposed to Croatia where at least there is a peace accord to keep, 
take this into consideration. Without a change of attitude on the 
part of the combatants, there appears to be no solution. If the 
status quo is maintained peacekeepers could be there 
indefinitely.
<P>
	The next point is that the withdrawal of peacekeepers leads to 
the spectre of genocide and more atrocities. Complete 
withdrawal leads to the spectre of war as some of the 
surrounding countries such as Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, 
Romania, Greece, Turkey and the former Russian states move in 
to help their particular friends.
<P>
	Against this background we must identify our role as 
parliamentarians. First, we must listen to our constituents. 
Second, we must with haste, re-examine our foreign affairs and 
defence policies which the government has stated it will do. 
Third, we must keep the Canadian public informed. Fourth, as 
parliamentarians, we must show leadership in finding a 
solution.
<P>
	It seems to me that leadership is the key if there is any 
solution to be found. We in this Chamber must take the lead and 
we as a country must take the lead.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	Therefore if the status quo is unacceptable, we must change it. 
The protagonists in Bosnia must be forced to the negotiating 
table and kept there until they come up with a peace plan that 
others can supervise. Canada alone cannot make this happen, but 
surely the world community can.
<P>
	Therefore it seems to me that Canada must use its credibility 
and its stature as a peacekeeper to provide the necessary 
leadership. We must first talk with the United States, Britain and 
France and then with NATO, the NATO associates which are 
coming on line, and the United Nations. We must insist that 
collectively we come up with a plan that will force the creation 
of a peace plan by the combatants. If we cannot achieve this, 
Canada should then think of withdrawing.
<P>
	I will conclude by underlining the earlier words of my 
colleague, the hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands, that 
more peace talks are scheduled in Geneva on February 10.
<P>
	Canada must take the lead by hosting a conference here in 
Ottawa before that date. Participants should include all 
countries with forces now in the former Yugoslavia. This 
conference which we propose must of itself or through the 
United Nations issue a clear ultimatum to the belligerents that 
either they come up with an enforceable peace plan or they 
accept the withdrawal of UN forces. If the conference cannot 
agree to this and show concrete progress toward peace in 
Bosnia, Canada should announce its intention to withdraw at the 
end of its current commitment in April.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is the 
first time I have stood up since the election and I want to 
congratulate you on your appointment to the Chair. Having 
known you for a long time I know you will do your very best in 
looking after the interests of members of this place from all 
political persuasions, including the independents I might add.
<P>
	The member opposite just gave a very good overview of his 
views about Canada's role vis-à-vis peacekeeping and the 
former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia, the sovereign state of 
Bosnia.
<P>
	I too have many constituents who share a view on this, coming 
from the riding of Dartmouth which has a very large number of 
individuals who are employed by the Department of National 
Defence. We have Shearwater there. Many individuals who 
work in the Canadian navy reside in my area. I can certainly say 
that the issue of Canada's role as a peacekeeper is first and 
foremost in their minds.
<P>
	I have a brother who has just come back from perhaps a less 
strenuous tour of duty, but nevertheless one which was fraught 
with some danger. He was in Cambodia as a member of the UN 
force that was there during the Cambodian elections.
<P>
	In commenting on the remarks of my hon. colleague, it is 
fairly clear that the Canadian public is very supportive of 
Canada's historic and leading role as the world's peacekeeper. 
Even in times of great fiscal difficulty when we are trying to 
figure out how we are going to pay for the essential services 
Canadians have come to expect, the Canadian public generally 
is extremely supportive of the efforts the men and women in 
uniform from the Canadian Armed Forces have played abroad.
<P>
	However the Bosnian situation is quite different from what we 
have been used to in the past. Out of all of the peacekeeping 
missions we have been on, this is one where no one could 
question whether or not there was a peace to keep. Clearly there 
is no peace to keep. Of the warring factions, the most aggressive 
faction which did not accept the referendum on Bosnia, the 
Serbian faction, has clearly indicated through its actions over 
the last year that as much as it may like to pay lip service to  the 
fact that the United Nations may be trying to do something to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="290"> 290 </A></B>
<P>
bring about peace it has shown time and time again that it is not 
prepared to deal with the forces there in a fair manner.
<P>
	The people in my area have been seized with this issue just as 
they have in the hon. member's riding. The people in my area as 
much as they want to see Canada continue to play its role feel 
very strongly that the lack of substance and the lack of 
follow-up in many of the threats that were made in resolutions 
by the United Nations have clearly put our peacekeepers at a 
disadvantage. Every time that the United Nations gets up and 
tells one or all of the warring sides to: ``Do this or else'', the or 
else has never come.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	I would just conclude my very brief comments on the hon. 
member's remarks by indicating that the people in Dartmouth as 
well are very concerned. They support the proud tradition of 
Canadian peacekeeping but in this particular instance they are 
asking the Government of Canada to take a lead role to ensure 
that there is a peace made before our people are asked to keep a 
peace that simply does not exist.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, since the hon. member is 
obviously in accord with my remarks, as apparently are our 
constituents, there really is no reply to be made.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We have two minutes 
remaining on questions and comments. Hopefully we can share 
that two minutes evenly between the question and the answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will try to be brief.
<P>
	I want to express my concern about the position that has been 
taken by Reform Party members, including the member for 
Calgary Southeast, who said: ``I do not believe anything we do 
as Canadian soldiers will make a difference''. We are making a 
difference in a very important way in that area in getting 
humanitarian aid through and certainly in helping to save lives.
<P>
	My question is very straight forward. Instead of Canadian 
troops and the United Nations deciding to leave that troubled 
area of Bosnia and Croatia because of the failure to date of peace 
plans primarily because of Bosnian-Serb intransigence, would 
he and his colleagues be prepared to consider another 
alternative? That alternative is that the United Nations finally 
get serious and give the troops on the ground the power they 
need and have been asking for through their commanding 
officers to enforce a peace and to stop the cycle of bloodshed and 
destruction.
<P>
	Would he agree to a change in the rules of engagement of the 
United Nations and finally strengthening that position so that no 
longer will we have the cycle of bloodshed and destruction that 
we see at the very least in the six protected areas of Bosnia?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway.
<P>
	I would agree to a discussion at least in the United Nations 
with respect to our troops and a revision of the rules to ensure 
that they are properly protective of our troops.
<P>
	The thing that I believe the hon. member is missing is that for 
us to enforce a peace in Bosnia when there is no peace agreement 
there has the implication of bringing in tens of thousands of 
troops to have this happen. This is the point that I and some 
others have been making. We must first bring the warring 
factions in Bosnia-not in the other part of Croatia, but in 
Bosnia-to the table and insist that they come up with a plan. 
There has to be a plan before they can so-call, keep the peace.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my preliminary remarks stand.
<P>
	I want to congratulate you and say that I am delighted to stand 
and speak on this subject. It is a tribute to our men and women in 
uniform involved in peacekeeping operations, indeed to the 
Canadian military and to the institution of this House where 
members are allowed to speak without fear of being castigated 
by their whips and party officials.
<P>
	With this kind of debate and the number of speakers we have 
heard this morning I have found the level of the debate to be very 
enlightening, non-partisan and what the Canadian public is 
looking forward to seeing, not just in the early days of this 
Parliament but as the 35th Parliament of Canada continues to 
operate.
<P>
	I have had to change what initially was my approach because 
of the time. I will try to finish by two o'clock when Question 
Period starts although I may have to spill over.
<P>
	What I want to do very briefly is look at why Canada has 
become so expert in peacekeeping. Why has it become the 
acceptable operation? We can look at some of the things that 
have changed that. Perhaps we can look at the future of these 
kinds of peacekeeping operations and then suggest some ground 
rules that may need to be looked at because we are now involved 
in a different kind of operation.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	If we go back to the early beginnings of peacekeeping, I guess 
it really started during the cold war when most UN operations 
were paralysed except for peacekeeping in areas of the world 
that were either of little importance to the superpowers or the 
area of operation could be dangerous to the superpowers' 
interest.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="291"> 291 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe our first substantive peacekeeping operation took 
place in response to a United Nations request for officer 
observers in Kashmir that is strategically located between India 
and Pakistan. Canada agreed after some negotiation to send four 
officer observers from the army in 1949. The following year this 
was increased to eight officer observers and in fact was changed 
from the militia to the regular army. It is my understanding that 
this was the beginnings of peacekeeping.
<P>
	That was in the late 1940s and we are still involved. We are 
still engaged in that operation. Shortly after, our participation in 
the United Nations Truce Supervisory Organization, UNTSO, 
took place in the Middle East. We are still there.
<P>
	In 1954 Canada became involved in the International Control 
Commission in Indo-China. Although we were there for a 
different reason we are still there.
<P>
	In 1956 Canada's military peacekeeping operation increased 
tremendously and dramatically when the Suez crisis erupted. 
The involvement of a Canadian who was then the external affairs 
minister, the Right Hon. Lester B. Pearson, is well known. We 
stayed there until our peacekeepers were kicked out by Mr. 
Nasser in 1967.
<P>
	Our government contributed a battalion to Cyprus in 1964. It 
was supposed to last for six months. It has lasted for 30 years. As 
the hon. Minister of National Defence mentioned we still have 
peacekeepers in Cyprus. It is not the battalion that we had 
before, but we still have 10 members of the Canadian forces in 
Cyprus.
<P>
	What am I saying? I am saying that in our involvement in 
peacekeeping operations, 44 since the first one, we have 
regrettably lost, not including Korea, 98 young Canadians of the 
100,000 young men and women in uniform. That is our 
peacekeeping record. If we examine the operations we have to 
ask how Canada established this reputation. Was it because our 
population was benign? Was it because of the nature of our 
military forces? Was it because we had an extraordinary interest 
in world events? Was it because we were a middle power?
<P>
	I do not think there is a simple answer but we need to look at 
some of the operations individually. We were involved in 
Cyprus because we were a NATO power interposed between two 
NATO countries. We were involved, I would suggest, in the 
International Control Commission in the mid-1950s because we 
were a western democracy.
<P>
	We were involved in the Middle East operations, I suppose 
primarily because in both world wars we established a kind of 
professionalism and a general purpose force that was 
deployable, had good logistics, a good reputation and the ability 
to do it. As each of these 44 operations continued the success of 
one fuelled the other. Whenever a troubled part of the world lent 
itself to peacekeeping who was going to be called? Canada.
<P>
	While the operations that took place until a few years ago 
were not standard in the sense of being the same in each 
operation, they were more or less, with the possible exception of 
the Belgian Congo to which reference has already been made 
and Korea, peacekeeping operations in the sense that they were 
policing. They became acceptable to Canadians because we as a 
military force and as a country made a change. We made a 
difference. We helped to keep the world a better place in which 
to live. Our military people became expert in it and it became 
acceptable, with minor exception, to all political parties.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	A few years ago at the end of the cold war, the demise of the 
Berlin wall and the invasion of a foreign country attempting to 
take over the sovereignty of another country-and I refer now to 
the gulf war-the ground rules changed. After some discussion 
in the House and with some division of Canadian opinion we in 
Canada became involved in the gulf war.
<P>
	After the gulf war I would suggest the situation changed. To 
begin with, the definition of peacekeeping did not stop at 
policing. It involved-and I am using simple 
terms-peacemaking which involved enforcement. It involved 
humanitarian aid which called up support in the feeding of 
people and the protection of lives. It involved other kinds of 
operations like for example in Cambodia with helping to run the 
country until a government was put in place.
<P>
	Other things happened as well. The power of the United 
Nations changed in what was referred to as a new world order. It 
is what many of us in the House today have made oblique 
reference to as perhaps a world disorder.
<P>
	Has that made a difference to the intensity and the number of 
operations in which we are going to be involved? I suggest it 
has. It is my thesis that we will see more requirements for 
peacekeeping in its general sense. We will see more in the 
intensity and more in the requirements to get other countries 
including Canada involved in the sovereign affairs of other 
countries.
<P>
	I say that because in the 179 countries in the world today there 
are 4,000 languages. Some 60 of these countries have 
populations of one million or less and 40 of them have 
populations of less than 200,000. More important, and I think 
this is germane to the argument, less than 10 per cent of these 
countries have a homogeneous ethnic population and less than 5 
per cent have an ethnic group that accounts for more than 75 per 
cent of the population. What we are seeing is an explosion of 
nations downward, to the point where they are really comprising 
the smallest ethnic and religious groups.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="292"> 292 </A></B>
<P>
	If we add to that the low levels of tolerance that seem to be 
dominant in the world today, poorer tolerance for religious, 
social and ethnic differences, we are going to see more 
requirements for peacekeepers.
<P>
	What should our response be in Canada? Our response has to 
be relative to what it is we can do. What can we do? I want to 
suggest at the outset to the House and to anybody listening to 
this presentation that whether we stay, participate, do not 
participate or withdraw, it will never be related to the will of the 
Canadian forces in the sense that they will do the job they have 
been asked to do.
<P>
	Our history recalls Canadian participation in an operation that 
heretofore had been impossible to achieve. I refer members of 
the House to Vimy Ridge. As a Newfoundlander I recall the 
heroic action of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment in 1916 
when practically every member of that battalion was wiped out 
in a few hours. Let us make no mistake about it. It will not be a 
withdrawal because we do not want to stay.
<P>
	However we have to look at some of the ground rules. Has the 
United Nations changed in its ability to control what is 
happening in the leadership of these operations, in the command 
and control of these operations? Have the mandates been clear? I 
recall a speech many of us would recall made in the Congress by 
General MacArthur when he returned from Korea. I remember 
his last resounding message was: ``Of the corps, of the corps, of 
the corps''.
<P>
	I remember a presentation when I was a young officer being 
made by perhaps the father of peacekeeping, General E. L. M. 
Burns who commanded the Middle East involvement in our first 
real sizeable contribution to peacekeeping. If he had a refrain it 
was: where is the mandate, where is the mandate, where is the 
mandate? Without a mandate we can do nothing. Without an 
effective United Nations what we do may not be the right thing. 
It may not be done properly. It may not be timely. Where we go 
depends on the support we have, not just in Canada but in the 
world at large.
<P>
	In my concluding remarks I would say that before we become 
involved as a country in peacekeeping operations we must check 
to see what is our mandate. What is the ability of the United 
Nations to command and control these particular operations? 
We can look at our requirements because of the kind of country 
we are. Because of our makeup it is in our interests to be 
involved in any activity that makes the world a more stable place 
to live.
<P>
	It is also incumbent upon us to ensure that the things we do 
will not jeopardize the resources of our country, to say not the 
least of putting our young men and women in uniform in harm's 
way more so than we should be expected to do as a sovereign 
country.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being two o'clock p.m., pursuant to Standing 
Order 30(5) the House will now proceed to statements by 
members, pursuant to Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce):</B> Mr. Speaker, over the 
past few weeks I have received a number of calls and letters of 
support of the extension of the home buyers plan which is due to 
expire on March 2 of this year.
<P>
	In a recent letter on this subject a local real estate company 
referred to a survey by the Canadian Real Estate Association. 
This survey found that 86 per cent of first-time home buyers 
said the plan was instrumental in their decision to buy a home. 
Furthermore, 80 per cent of respondents said it was imperative 
to repay their first RSP loans and 41 per cent said they would 
repay it faster than the program required. According to the letter 
the CMHC found that a full 26 per cent of 1992 housing sales 
involved the use of this plan.
<P>
	I am in full support of the home buyers plan and urge the 
finance minister not only to extend the program but to make 
appropriate changes to the law so that this type of plan is a 
permanent option to home buyers.
<P>
	At this time of fiscal restraint we should be looking at exactly 
this sort of initiative, one that does not cost the government or 
the taxpayers any money.

Ontario government is denying them access to that training. 
Because of that, thousands of Franco-Ontarians are deprived of

<P>
<B>(1405) </B>
<P>
	When renegotiating the federal-provincial agreement on

account the serious deficiencies of the Ontario Training and

there are many economic benefits, particularly future benefits,

unfairness of regional rates of pays was the primary cause of the

doing the same jobs as their counterparts in central and western

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CIGARETTESMUGGLING">CIGARETTE SMUGGLING</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Yesterday in Saint-Eustache something very serious 
happened, something that should disturb any responsible 
government. More than 1,000 people deliberately and openly 
defied the law.
<P>
	The Prime Minister knows perfectly well why otherwise 
honest citizens went to this extreme. These people are angry 
about the continuing failure of the federal government and the 
RCMP to stop cigarette smuggling. And now, this movement 
may spread to the Sherbrooke area tomorrow. In other words, the 
government is facing an organized movement of civil 
disobedience.
<P>
	My question: Has the Prime Minister forgotten that his first 
duty is to enforce the rule of law?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have asked the RCMP to enforce the law and the necessary 
action will be taken. Charges will be laid against those who 
disobey the law.
<P>
	Meanwhile, I have had a chance to discuss with several 
provincial premiers, including the Premier of Quebec, the 
Premier of Ontario, and the Premiers of New Brunswick, Nova 
Scotia and Prince Edward Island, the possibility of taking a 
common stand and dealing with a situation that I deplore as 
much as the Leader of the Opposition does. We hope to have an 
agreement within the next few days. If not, we will act 
unilaterally, and I hope we can count on the support of the 
Opposition.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is an attempt to hide behind a smoke screen of 
possible discussions and hypothetical agreements with the 
provinces, but meanwhile, the government has the authority and 
the responsibility to take the necessary action.
<P>
	I will ask the Prime Minister a very simple question which 
everyone in this country would like to ask. Since the identity and 
actions of the smugglers have been public knowledge for a long 
time, why do the federal government and the RCMP not take 
immediate action to make them stop?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am informed that the police have made a number of arrests in the 
past few weeks. If any members of this House have the names of 
some of the smugglers, I hope they will act as responsible 
citizens and advise the police so that they can take the necessary 
action. If the hon. member knows any smugglers, it is his duty to 
give their names to the police.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I imagine the Prime Minister has a tv monitor in his 
office. If he looks at the monitor, he will see who is responsible. 
Earlier, he passed the buck to the provincial governments and 
now he is passing the buck to the members of the opposition. He 
is the leader of the government, he is Prime Minister and he 
should do something about this.
<P>
	I would like to ask how he can expect people to trust him to 
enforce the law, when an average citizen in Jonquière, after 
selling illegal cigarettes for an hour, is arrested while 
professional smugglers have been able to conduct their 
activities on a regular basis without any interference at all. The 
question is this; is there a double standard in the justice system 
in this country?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the answer is no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Solicitor General. The 
professional cigarette smugglers who have been active for many 
months are doing great harm to convenience store owners and to 
the public treasury. The government's inaction is only 
worsening the situation, and the demonstration in 
Saint-Eustache is damning proof.
<P>
	My question is as follows. The Solicitor General told us 
yesterday that he had not intervened directly before to collect 
sufficient evidence. Therefore I ask him today whether he has 
evidence not only for Saint-Eustache but also for Akwesasne, 
Kahnawake and Kanesatake?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
evidence is a matter for the RCMP to decide; it is not for the 
Solicitor General to make such operational decisions. But I wish 
to inform the House that over the past year, the RCMP arrested 
3,500 people and also seized tens of millions of dollars of 
contraband tobacco, and the RCMP will continue to enforce the 
law throughout our country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> All well and 
good, Mr. Speaker. I now ask the Solicitor General whether the 
RCMP has given him evidence that smugglers have been acting 
for months in full view and with the full knowledge of everyone 
in Akwesasne, Kahnawake and Kanesatake? If he has such 
evidence, why does he not act?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="297"> 297 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yes, so far the RCMP has given priority to fighting the big 
criminal rings that smuggle tobacco. As I just said, it is up to the 
RCMP to give the Crown prosecutor evidence and if the 
evidence is suitable, the people involved will be charged.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question today for the Minister of Natural Resources, 
whom I would like to congratulate on her appointment. And I do 
not have to raise my voice to make my point.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance and others have implied that the 
government has a revenue problem rather than a spending 
problem. These insinuations have led to concerns especially in 
Alberta that the government is considering the institution of a 
carbon tax to be paid by the producers and users of fossil fuels.
<P>
	As the Minister of Natural Resources and as the member for 
Edmonton Northwest, will the minister make strong 
representations to the finance minister pointing out the 
discriminatory aspects of such a tax and its potentially negative 
impacts on development and jobs in the petroleum sector?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me say first of all to the hon. member, I thank you 
for your kind words of congratulations.
<P>
	In relation to his specific question let me say that I believe it 
to be purely speculative. As the hon. member is aware the 
Minister of Finance has embarked on an unprecedented 
consultative process. He is in Toronto today. He will be in 
Calgary on the weekend. I know that you and members of your 
caucus have been invited to participate in that process.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	I look forward to having you and others make their views 
known in relation to the carbon tax on Saturday.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I know the minister meant to address herself to 
the Chair throughout.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
did the same thing with my first questions.
<P>
	I have a supplementary question for the Minister of Natural 
Resources. The same speculations about the government having 
a revenue problem rather than a spending problem have also led 
to another concern. That is that the government is considering 
repealing the Public Utilities Income Tax Transfer Act which 
permits income taxes paid by investor owned utilities to be 
rebated to their customers so that they are put on the same 
footing as the customers of government owned utilities that pay 
no such taxes.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Natural Resources, the hon. member for 
Edmonton Northwest, make strong representations to the 
finance minister concerning the discriminatory aspects of any 
such repeal and the negative consequences of such an action, 
particularly on energy users, in her home province?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me assure the hon. member from Calgary that I 
know this is a very important issue.
<P>
	I have received representations as recently as yesterday in 
relation to this particular tax measure. I have already raised it 
with my colleagues in the Department of Finance. I know my 
comments will be taken into account as part of the ongoing 
consultative process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have one further supplementary for the minister. This is a 
terrible question for a new minister.
<P>
	If the federal budget, notwithstanding the minister's strong 
representations, were to contain a carbon tax or the repeal of the 
Public Utilities Income Tax Transfer Act, would the minister be 
willing to resign?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.

the hon. Minister of Defense quickly rose to answer a question I 
had asked the Prime Minister.

	He said and I quote: ``I should say that la Sûreté du Québec is 
wondering why a national defence beacon went off in that area 
when it obviously appears there is no plane missing. That is a 
question that is under investigation by la Sûreté du Québec.''

for the Sûreté du Québec formally denied that such was the case?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs): </B>Mr. Speaker, to 
confirm the answer I gave yesterday, a search and rescue 
helicopter landed near Oka-Kanesatake in response to a distress 
call from an emergency beacon.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="298"> 298 </A></B>
<P>
	A small group assembled near the helicopter and one 
individual approached the crew to inform them that the 
helicopter was being shot at. Those comments were informative 
and not threatening.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	After that, our forces, having determined that there did not 
appear to be a plane downed in the area, decided to leave. They 
did not want to provoke any further incidents given the 
sensitivity of the region.
<P>
	With respect to la Sûreté du Québec the information I had 
when I came into the House yesterday was that la Sûreté du 
Québec as well as my own officials were investigating this 
matter. Since the hon. member has spoken, I certainly will go 
back and find out the state of the investigation if there is one 
being done by la Sûreté du Québec. Certainly my officials are 
looking into the matter.

him to tell us why his government, himself included, is trying to 
conceal the seriousness of what happened in Kanesatake.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> We are not 
trying to conceal anything, Mr. Speaker. A call was received 
and, as usual in such a situation, the Canadian forces sent a 
helicopter to see whether or not a plane had crashed in this part 
of the Canadian territory. They found no sign of an accident and 
returned to their base. They performed their duty and nothing 
more.
<P>
	It was their duty to be there. If some were unhappy about 
seeing a Canadian forces helicopter on the reserve, they must 
realize that the whole of the Canadian territory comes under the 
jurisdiction of the Canadian forces, whether it be Oka or 
somewhere else in Canada.

<P>
	There appears to be a major disagreement as to which set of 
trade rules, GATT or NAFTA, will take precedence. The 
minister has assured Canadians that his legal advisers are

to thank the minister for that co-operation.

will be resolved in court but rather through a political 
negotiation. Can the minister give his assurance that Canadian 
durum wheat producers will not be abandoned in these 
negotiations?

	On my recent trip to the Canadian north I witnessed the 
deplorable living conditions of the Inuit. In particular, the 
misery of the inhabitants of Davis Inlet in Labrador has been 
highlighted in recent months following the disclosure of the 
very high rate of suicide, drug and alcohol abuse among the 
young people in that community and the failure of the treatment 
administered.
<P>
	Does the government intend to put an end to the disgraceful 
and inhumane treatment meted out to the inhabitants of Davis 
Inlet by moving the village, for example, and are these priority 
concerns for the minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean for his question and his concern.
<P>
	It is a high priority. Two weeks ago we had officials with my

with an acceptable package in the early part of March which will 
probably involve health and justice.
<P>
	I assure you it is my priority to get this done this month. I

<P>

Davis Inlet and in particular to help the desperate young people 
in that community.

There is a misconception that Newfoundland does not want to

<P>
	During the election campaign in a letter to the Cheslatta Band

elected his government would participate in the ongoing B.C. 
Utilities Commission hearings. He would make available all 
information in federal possession relevant to the hearings, and 
furthermore the government would remove the gag order  on 
current and former employees with information pertinent to the 
proceedings. Alcan itself has requested federal participation in

Speaker, I thank the member for his question. I congratulate him 
on his new responsibilities as a member of the Reform Party

<P>
	The hon. member will note that a clear and consistent pattern 
has emerged and it is that this new government strives mightily 
always to ensure that the commitments and declarations of the 
Prime Minister of Canada are lived up to.
<P>
	This matter is being considered Thursday by cabinet. We hope 
to be able to apprise the House of the results of our deliberations 
shortly thereafter.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to

<P>
	In the same letter the Prime Minister also made a commitment 
``to undertake an immediate study of all available options to 
ensure the maintenance of sustainable fisheries and a 
sustainable regional economy in the Nechako region and the 
well being of aboriginal peoples who are affected by the 
completion of the Kemano project''.
<P>
	It is now three months since the election. When is the Prime 
Minister going to live up to his commitment for this immediate 
study?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member will know that the settlement 
agreement was signed in 1987 and that the current circumstance 
with respect to the terms and conditions attached to the Kemano 
completion project were negotiated by a previous 
administration.
<P>
	It is reasonable that a new government on assuming office 
would want to review fully this very complex matter involving 
hundreds of millions of dollars worth of expenditure-$600 
million on phase II, over $1 billion on phase I-and would want 
to fully undertake all of its responsibilities to explore this matter 
before proceeding.
<P>
	I have thrown as broad a hint as I can without risking cabinet 
solidarity. Members will find that the government always 
strives mightily and consistently to ensure that the 
commitments given are kept in as full and as complete a manner 
as possible. Cabinet is now seized with this question.

question is for the Minister of Human Resource Development.
<P>
	In the Auditor General's report released last week it was 
revealed that there were many problems with respect to the 
telephone service in the income security programs branch. The 
report criticized the service saying that more calls were 
abandoned than answered.
<P>
	People are having difficulty getting through on the telephone 
lines and are consistently getting a busy signal. This creates a 
real problem for seniors who are often in urgent need of 
information regarding their old age and Canada pension 
benefits.
<P>
	I would like to ask the minister how he plans to solve this 
problem in order that Canadians can receive the service they 
deserve.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member 
for Scarborough Centre for having become a persistent advocate 
on this very important issue.
<P>
	It is important to point out to members of the House, 
particularly those who are on the constant refrain of how to cut 
back government expenditures, but in this particular case the 
increase of calls on old age pension and security questions 
increased by 60 per cent over the last six or seven years. We now 
receive over 11 million calls a year.
<P>
	At the same time a restraint program cut back personnel by 20 
per cent. As a result many senior citizens have not been able to 
receive the service they require and deserve.
<P>
	Saying that, we have now taken steps to try to correct the 
situation. We will be taking on board a special program, a 
system of telephone banks with about 200 personnel that will 
have immediate access through a computer to all of the phone 
systems of our department throughout Canada. We will be 
spending about $3 million to upgrade that equipment. That will 
be the first phase in an attempt to modernize the system. We 
believe it will provide immediate, and we hope, efficient service 
within a matter of four or five weeks.
<P>

<P>

service to Canadians.

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert):</B> Mr. Speaker, a few 
days ago, a young girl, Sarah Dutil, was killed in Verdun. The 
suspected murderer is an individual who was released on 
November 15, 1993, after his trial for murder was cancelled. He 
was freed directly as a consequence of the appointment, on June 
23, 1993, of Henry Steinberg, the Superior Court judge in charge 
of the case, to the Quebec Appeal Court.
<P>
	The then Prime Minister acted without any regard for Judge 
Steinberg's previous commitments. Such action is totally 
unacceptable and is bound to discredit the administration of 
justice and the whole judicial process.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Justice. Does he agree with 
the recommendation made by the Quebec Bar Association 
suggesting that it become mandatory to consult with the chief 
justice of a court before appointing one of his judges to another 
position?

General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, may I first express the sense 
of horror and sadness that all members of this Chamber must 
feel at the tragic death of Sarah Dutil. Our hearts go out to 
members of her family.
<P>
	There are two aspects I would offer to the hon. member in 
response to the important question she has raised. First, my 
understanding of the traditional practice is that whenever a trial 
court judge is to be elevated to the appellate level, inquiries are 
made by the minister of the chief justice of the relevant court to 
be sure that the appointment will not interfere with the 
completion of any proceeding or trial that is under way. That is 
certainly the practice I intend to follow as long as I have any 
involvement with the appointment process. As to what happened 
in June of last year with respect to the appointment in question, I 
have no personal knowledge.
<P>
	There is a second aspect as well. The Department of Justice 
will soon be introducing an omnibus amendment to the Criminal 
Code and among other things it will propose a change to section 
669.2 of the code, the effect of which will be to ensure that a 
criminal jury trial can proceed notwithstanding the 
disqualification of the presiding trial judge for any reason and 
the substitution of another judge so that such a circumstance 
may never happen again.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>]

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert):</B> Mr. Speaker, in view 
of the fact that such transfers in the midst of proceedings are an 
untimely and unacceptable intervention on the part of the 
government in the administration of justice, is any action being 
considered right now? I listened carefully to the minister who 
said that he would eventually introduce a bill. But I want to 
know this very minute what he intends to do.

assurance to the hon. member that in any case from the present 
time forward which involves the appointment of a judge sitting

before any such appointment to ensure that it does not interfere

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="303"> 303 </A></B>
<P>
	The Minister of Foreign Affairs announced yesterday after 
meeting with the elected President of Haiti, Mr. Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide, that the federal government is committed to supporting 
a total embargo against Haiti and its military regime.
<P>
	The present military and oil embargo against Haiti which is 
viewed as inadequate by President Aristide will be extended to 
include all areas, with the exception of international aid, of 
course.
<P>
	My question is as follows: what concrete steps does the 
government intend to take in co-operation with Haiti's allies to 
ensure that the international community, including Haiti's 
neighbours, comply with the embargo, and to strengthen the 
commercial blockade, thus helping to bring about the return of 
the duly elected president, Mr. Aristide?
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member's question is very relevant. Clearly, 
given the present situation where Haiti basically has four friends 
working within the United Nations to advance the cause of 
democracy in this country, we lack support.
<P>
	One of our goals is to extend Haiti's circle of friends to 
include a certain number of countries, specifically neighbouring 
Caribbean nations which could, working together with Haiti's 
four traditional friends, help to enforce a comprehensive and 
truly effective blockade.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval-Est):</B> Does the Canadian 
government intend, as it has repeatedly said, to help train 
Haitian police forces whose mandate it would be to restore the 
country's democratic institutions? Did the minister make any 
formal commitments in this respect in the course of his talks 
with Mr. Aristide?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister discussed this matter when he met 
with the Secretary General of the United Nations in Paris. We 
feel it would be a good idea to organize under the auspices of the 
United Nations this kind of training program for police officers 
from countries under military dictatorship.
<P>
	This proposal which was put forward by Canada could apply 
first to Haiti, and could later be extended to several other 
countries under military rule where a counterbalance such as a 
police force could be useful in terms of instituting and 
maintaining democracy. Consequently, during the course of our 
discussions with President Aristide yesterday, we obtained his 
support for such an initiative.
<P>
	Obviously we cannot take this kind of initiative without the 
approval of the Haitian government. And we have obtained it. 
We will be appointing a representative who, along with 
President Aristide's representative, will review the terms and 
conditions of this kind of police officer training program.

firearms owners, RCMP and firearm safety instructors. As 
recently as last Thursday my assistant was getting two totally

department doing about it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

the safety courses for firearm owners is simply another 
important step that has been taken to ensure safety in the use of 
firearms in Canada, and we are happy that it is now in place in 
six provinces with the balance to follow on April 1.
<P>
	So far as the circumstances surrounding the courses at present 
are concerned I am reluctant to agree with the description given 
by the hon. member. I do agree that in some provinces efforts are 
still under way to design and deliver the training courses. In 
most provinces master teachers have already been trained and 
are preparing to deliver the courses.

which will naturally involve some element of adjustment, will 
be over, these courses will be in place and the safety of

<P>
	What measures will the Government of Canada take to ensure 
that Canadian banks reduce this spread and lower mortgage rates 
proportionately to the bank rate?
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

<P>
	As the member pointed out, the prime rate is at 5.5 per cent, 
which is the lowest rate since in 1956. Today the basic bank rate 
fell not five but six points. One year mortgage rates are at their 
lowest since their inception in 1980, but the five year rate still 
remains high. We in the government are watching this very

what we could do in this House to assist him in making sure that 
job creation becomes the number one priority of his

<P>

the infrastructure program which has been universally 
applauded across the country as a major job stimulant. We have 
frozen the UI premium rate for a period of two years to provide a 
real incentive to small business to create jobs.

	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke):</B> I am directing my 
question to the Prime Minister, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	The minister responsible for the infrastructure program 
recognized before this House last week that the program was 
vulnerable to political influences, with regard to the Congress 
Center program in particular.
<P>
	I have since come across a secret memo to the Prime Minister 
stating-and this is the clerk of the Privy Council writing to the 
Prime Minister-that his Minister of Human Resources 
Development and his Minister of Public Works have requested 
more direct control over the infrastructure program, and this, a 
mere ten days into this government's term of office.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The same secret memo written to the Prime Minister goes on 
to say-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. Could the member please put a very 
brief question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> My question for the Prime Minister, Mr. 
Speaker, in relation to this secret memo written to him, is 
whether or not he has clarified the mandates of the ministers of 
human resources and public works as they attempted a power 
grab in their own regions in relation to all federal undertakings 
as written in this secret memo?
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
every member of the cabinet can take part in this program and, 
of course, regional interests are discussed in cabinet, especially 
considering that both ministers referred to are in charge of 
government agencies through which money is distributed 
because this the only way the government can implement this 
program quickly and effectively. So, it is ACOA and-
<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
-the western diversification organization which are actually 
responsible for the delivery of the programs and both ministers 
are in charge, one on the Atlantic coast and the other one in 
western Canada.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
National Defence and Veterans Affairs has the floor for six 
minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I had finished my presentation. In the interests of 
brevity I did finish so we have about five minutes for questions 
and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence 
indicated that he foresees the role of our peacekeeping forces 
continuing and perhaps increasing in the future, and that it is 
most important a mandate or a mission statement be developed. 
In this way we can determine what is the role we are to play.
<P>
	Can the parliamentary secretary advise what the government 
is doing to develop the role and to ensure that the United Nations 
knows exactly what Canada thinks. What is his opinion 
concerning Canada's peacekeeping forces that are now around 
the world and does he think they will be in more demand over the 
next few years?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for that 
question.
<P>
	I want to correct the hon. member. I am sure it is a 
misunderstanding. He is not trying to put words in my mouth. 
My thesis was that peacekeeping operations generally would 
likely increase because of the trend in the other 180 countries of 
the world with the smaller populations and the 
non-homogeneous ethnic, religious and racial groups.
<P>
	My thesis was that the need for peacekeeping operations in 
general would likely intensify, would increase. I also pointed 
out in my thesis so would the intensity of peacekeeping 
operations, so would the nature of peacekeeping operations and 
so would the complexity of peacekeeping operations in the 
general sense of peacekeeping.
<P>
	What is the government doing to help the situation along? I 
would remind the hon. member that, for example, in Bosnia 
alone, I cannot recall the number of UN resolutions. I know 
there are 743, 770, 776 and 800 and something. They are the 
ones with which I am familiar. I am sure there are others. We 
would like to, as much as possible try to get our mandate in a 
shorter period of time and in a less complex manner. Second, we 
would strive to have, perhaps through debate in the House of 
Commons, which we all agree is a novel but very useful 
exercise, to make our wishes and desires of what it is we want 
our peacekeeper forces to do, to make our wishes known to the 
United Nations, perhaps more in advance than we have had in 
the past.
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	With respect to the United Nations, the government is 
working on areas through our staff at the United Nations, our 
ambassador, and through those who are on the international staff 
to try to improve that part of the United Nations which oversees 
peacekeeping operations.
<P>
	There are areas such as, for example, around the clock 
command and control capability; staffing with perhaps a more 
experienced and a larger number of military personnel. In this 
way the kind of command and control operation that takes place 
in NORAD or in NATO headquarters where instantaneous 
responses can be given and political input can be received, 
analyzed and weighed with respect to decisions, would take 
place in a much more clear-I hesitate to use the word 
efficient-and more effective manner than happens now.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member that those of us who are involved 
in these kinds of activities on this side of the House are imbued 
with their importance and wish to make our mandate more clear. 
It would make the selection of what we participate in more 
effective to have a better response to what it is we believe the 
Canadian people want and would support in the future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank and to congratulate my hon. colleague for his speech. I 
would like to ask him a question. For one thing, he made a 
number of very positive remarks in his speech on the value of 
Canadian intervention abroad, but could he tell us what his 
position is exactly with regard to a Canadian presence in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was being specific in what I was 
hoping would be accepted by the House and by those who were 
listening as I am sure the hon. member was as to the litmus test 
to apply to the operation and to what our future direction would 
be.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="306"> 306 </A></B>
<P>
	I would remind the hon. member that those of us in the House 
who are going to be involved in looking at this in future 
operations, particularly those members of the cabinet who sit 
here along with the Prime Minister, will be listening to the 
response of all hon. members to get their input before any final 
decision is made in the House.
<P>
	As a parliamentary secretary it is incumbent on me to pay 
attention to those presentations being made which allow the 
government to make a measured choice. Decisions are to be 
made on the facts and representations such as the one in which it 
was made clear by the hon. member from Esquimalt-Juan de 
Fuca that he was making a presentation representing the feelings 
of his constituents.
<P>
	As this debate is expected to continue certainly well into the 
hours of the evening, I can assure the hon. member that I and 
other members of the government will be paying very close 
attention to what it is the members have to say so that when 
decisions are made this will be taken into consideration.
<P>
	It is important for the hon. member to take into consideration 
what I as a member of the House of Commons and as a member 
of the governing party put forward with the experience, 
whatever it is, that I have had on a litmus test or an overlay that 
could be put on this operation and others to see what decisions 
would be made with respect to future operations.
<P>
	If I could be permitted, there is one area that I did not cover. 
Very briefly, I refer the hon. member to a presentation that was 
made in December 1992. In addition to all the other measures to 
which I made reference and it has been mentioned in the House 
today, I think it is important for hon. members to consider that a 
timeframe is very important as well.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	We look at all these considerations and I believe it is 
incumbent on any input to the United Nations to include a 
timeframe by which we will go back and review: (a) if the 
situation has changed; (b) if the measures that we have asked for 
have been met; and (c) if our mandate is as clear and indeed is as 
we believed it to be. I believe that is important in considering 
future directions that will be taken by Parliament, not 
necessarily just by the government but by Parliament, in 
responding to what I believe is going to be if not more Bosnias, 
certainly more Croatias and more of the kind of the 16 
peacekeeping operations in which we are now involved and will 
likely be asked to be involved in, in the future.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before I recognize the member for 
Bourassa I might indicate to members of the House that if they 
want to split their time they can get more speakers on instead of 
at three o'clock in the morning or whenever it is going to be. I 
believe one of the parties has already indicated it wants its 
speakers to speak for 10 minutes with a five minute question 
period. That is of course a matter for the parties to decide.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
congratulations on your appointment as Deputy Speaker of the 
House.
<P>
	It is with a certain emotion, some apprehension and a lot of 
hope that I rise in this debate. I represent the riding of Bourassa, 
which includes the municipality of Montreal North with a 
population of about 85,000, with 70 per cent francophones and 
30 per cent allophones from around the world, mainly Italians 
and Haitians, but also people from the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	It is a riding inhabited by people of modest means. My riding 
was badly hurt by the recession but contains very dynamic 
community organizations, popular groups and economic agents. 
These people are very interested in international problems, 
especially what is happening in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	People are asking my staff and myself to take action. We must 
stop the massacre of innocent people, including women, seniors, 
young people and children, as we saw last weekend when six 
children were killed by mortar shells in Sarajevo.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I come from Chile but I have been living in 
Montreal for 20 years. In Chile, Latin America and especially 
Central America we have experienced war and conflict. In 
Chile, we lived through a 17-year dictatorship that forced me to 
leave a country that I love dearly. There human rights violations 
were systematic and flagrant. I am also the first Quebecer of 
Chilean origin in the history of this country to be elected to the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	I am therefore very concerned by the conflict and the 
barbarous acts committed in the former Yougoslavia that we see 
every day in dramatic detail on television.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, even before immigrating to Canada with my 
family, I had heard about Canada's role in peacekeeping and its 
commitment to promote peace and security throughout the 
world. At that time, we wanted Canada to become a member of 
the Organization of American States, a decision that was 
unfortunately too long in coming.
<P>
	I listened with great interest this morning to the very relevant 
comments of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs about the role played by the Organization of 
American States and Canada's involvement in this regard. I 
encourage Canada to play a more active role within the OAS.
<P>
	As far as Latin America is concerned, I am happy to see that 
Canada has been participating in the United Nations observer 
mission in Salvador since September 1991. Two members of the 
Canadian forces are currently monitoring the implementation of 
the agreements reached between the Government of Salvador 
and the Farabundo Marti Front for national liberation on human 
rights, the cessation of hostilities and disarmament.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="307"> 307 </A></B>
<P>
	The mandate of this mission expires on May 31, 1994. I 
personally hope that Canada will extend its participation. It is 
because of the problems that persist in Salvador that I asked the 
Canadian government not to execute the expulsion order against 
some 30 Salvadorans living in Quebec who were denied refugee 
status. Unfortunately, the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration has not yet replied. Canada should also send 
observers to the election that will be held in Salvador on March 
20.
<P>
	In Haiti, 11 Canadian military officers were part of the United 
Nations observer group for the verification of elections in Haiti, 
which was established in November 1990 for a four-month 
mandate.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, yesterday we greeted in this House the 
democratically elected and legitimate president of Haiti, Father 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The UN and the OAS are currently 
trying to arrange for his return to Haiti. Resolution 875 of the 
United Nations Security Council calls for the application of 
appropriate sanctions against the military in power.
<P>
	I hope that Canada will continue to contribute to the 
international naval force patrolling the waters around Haiti and 
to the immediate restoration of democracy in that country. It is 
also the hope of the large Haitian community living in my riding 
of Bourassa in Montreal North.
<P>
	President Aristide was democratically elected on December 
16, 1990, with 67 per cent of the popular vote. He thus 
represents the will of the Haitian people.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	It is therefore time to step up and intensify the pressure on the 
military regime of General Raoul Cédras. The UN and the OAS 
must implement a full and complete economic boycott of Haiti, 
which must cover everything except humanitarian, medical and 
food aid, of course.
<P>
	I hope that the government will be consistent with its 
statements and act on this issue. Personally, I intend to watch it 
very closely.
<P>
	Canada's role in conflicts in the world brings us to basic 
issues involving the great values of solidarity and justice on 
which we have wanted to base our society. From these great 
values, our predecessors in this House developed a code of 
conduct written into laws defining our duties to assist people in 
danger and our moral obligations to those who are in extreme 
distress.
<P>
	We have wanted to extend these duties and moral obligations 
not only to our fellow citizens who are affected but also to the 
people of the rest of the world who are in conflicts which 
endanger their lives, by giving them significant aid which very 
often means the difference between life and death for them.
<P>
	These great values have guided our action abroad and earned 
Canada its international reputation and credibility as a defender 
of peace.
<P>
	However, on his latest trip to Europe, the Prime Minister 
seemed to want to call into question this great tradition and the 
underlying values along with it by saying that Canada was a 
little tired of playing the international boy scout.
<P>
	This is a strange position, claiming to be part of the great 
Liberal tradition which developed these policies of international 
aid and backing off when the going gets rough. However, you 
know your true friends in tough times and not when things are 
easy.
<P>
	Despite what the Prime Minister seems to be saying, I believe 
that Canada must maintain its presence in areas of conflict 
where this presence is deemed essential to the safety of the 
civilian population involved. If today we deny this duty to 
assist, we would not only break with some of our social values, 
but even worse, we would limit our aid to people who are in 
danger in Canada.
<P>
	Of course, there is no question here of putting our soldiers in 
dangerous situations. If their security must be strengthened by 
giving them the means to defend themselves and carry out their 
mission effectively, let us do it, but let us not withdraw them for 
all that.
<P>
	For the sake of human rights, the lives of thousands of 
innocent people and the traditional commitment to UN 
peacekeeping missions, from which Canada derives much of its 
international credibility, Canada must continue to shoulder its 
responsibilities. Canada must do so by promoting a negotiated 
solution to conflicts, by working with its UN partners to ensure a 
more effective role for peacekeepers, by maintaining and even 
increasing its humanitarian aid to the civilians concerned, and 
by providing adequate assistance to the thousands of refugees 
who flee this terrible fratricide.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the conflict in the former Yugoslavia and the 
ethnic clashes in Bosnia and in Croatia have led to the 
displacement of hundreds of thousands of people. Civilian and 
ethnic minorities have been the victims of mistreatment, rapes 
and murders.
<P>
	According to figures published in November 1993, more than 
4.2 million people from Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina have 
been forced to leave their homes or are caught in the battles. 
More than 800,000 people have taken refuge in other countries.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="308"> 308 </A></B>
<P>
	The UNHCR was given the mandate of helping the people 
displaced within the former Yugoslavia, as well as those 
so-called ``vulnerable'' persons who are mostly in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
<P>
	I want to pay tribute to the UNHCR, which does an excellent 
job in the distribution of humanitarian aid, in spite of the 
extremely difficult situation which prevails in that region.
<P>
	Besides distributing food, medication and clothes, in some 
regions the High Commissioner's office looks after restoring 
water and hydro supplies, building houses and granting 
monetary aid to families who accept refugees.
<P>
	It is sometimes very difficult if not impossible to provide 
humanitarian aid in some regions of Bosnia. Convoys are often 
delayed, stopped and even raided. The city of Sarajevo is 
supplied through land convoys and also through the most 
important airlift operation in history.
<P>
	The personnel working for humanitarian organizations is 
sometimes harassed or assaulted and often requires the 
protection provided by peacekeepers.
<P>
	The international community is making great efforts to absorb 
the more than 800,000 people affected by the conflict in the 
former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	Germany alone has accepted more than 340,000 refugees; 
Hungary, 128,000; Sweden, 92,000; Switzerland, 72,000; 
Austria, 90,000. As for Canada, it has only accepted some 
10,000 refugees.
<P>
	Nationals from the former Yugoslavia can enter Canada as 
refugees or through the family reunification program, following 
special measures implemented in 1992.
<P>
	I believe that the Canadian government should continue to 
implement its host program for refugees and immigrants from 
the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	The quota for 1994 should be increased considerably. 
Moreover, families and groups should get organized to accept 
these refugees and provide support for them.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	I have personally met several refugees from the former 
Yugoslavia. They are all very active and sometimes highly 
qualified people who make a great contribution to Quebec and to 
Canadian society.
<P>
	In fact, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome them 
to Quebec and to Canada and to express my sympathy and my 
solidarity to them all.
<P>
	Canada provides about $50 million in humanitarian 
assistance to the former Yugoslavia. Between April and 
December 1993, Canada gave out $1.5 million to UNICEF, 
which spent a quarter of that amount on rape victims. For which 
I want to say to them: Well done.
<P>
	But we have to do more. We have to support UNICEF 
initiatives to treat the traumatized children and women who are 
the real victims of this war. This should always be a priority for 
Canada.
<P>
	I listened very closely when the leader of the Official 
Opposition and member for Lac-Saint-Jean delivered an 
excellent speech this morning.
<P>
	I wholeheartedly agree with him on this issue. I want to 
describe the main points on which we should focus.
<P>
	First, I am strongly against the unilateral withdrawal of 
Canadian peacekeepers in Bosnia, as was recently suggested by 
the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Second, I believe that the presence of Canadian soldiers in 
Bosnia is needed to stop this conflict from further deteriorating 
and from extending to other regions of the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	Third, the presence of our soldiers is also needed to maintain 
military support for the people and humanitarian assistance for 
civilians.
<P>
	Fourth, we have to stop the fighting from escalating.
<P>
	Finally, the presence of peacekeepers in Bosnia could and 
should facilitate the diplomatic negotiation process. I hope that 
the warring factions will reach a negotiated agreement as soon 
as possible.
<P>
	Just like its Western allies, Canada made its first mistake in 
Bosnia when it did not intervene sooner and allowed the evil that 
has been gnawing at this poor country to develop just as it had 
before in Spain and in Germany. Let us not make a second 
mistake which could be fateful.
<P>
	Withdrawing our peacekeepers from Bosnia would in fact 
result in a massive slaughter for a population which is looking to 
us and to the international community for protection.
<P>
	Let us avoid irreparable damage. Let us renew the mandate of 
our Canadian peacekeepers in Bosnia.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would like to thank the hon. member 
for Bourassa. We now have a question and comment period. Of 
course, with hundreds of members wishing to speak in this 
debate, you do not need to feel compelled to ask questions or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="309"> 309 </A></B>
<P>
make comments. Is there anyone who wants to ask a question? 
As you can imagine, I try generally to recognize hon. members 
from other parties who want to ask questions, if there are any.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake):</B> I 
appreciate the opportunity to raise a question here. As this is the 
question and comment period I do have a couple of comments 
that are probably more relevant than my question. Given the fact 
that the minister is here I would very much like to direct a 
comment to him. I do not necessarily expect a reply at the 
moment from the hon. member who has spoken or the minister.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> If I could just interrupt the member. I 
think he knows that is out of order so he has to put his question or 
his comment. Why does he not just make a comment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I will make the comment and as I indicated I am 
very happy to be able to do so while the minister is present.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	Essentially the issue of peacekeeping is one that is important 
to all members of the House as we recognized in the debate 
today so far. I have heard in the debate a desire of members of 
this House to support the peacekeeping troops and the 
peacekeeping efforts for the most part, but mostly there is 
support for the young men and women who are skilled, talented, 
courageous and sometimes confused in their efforts. They are 
often asked to do jobs that are difficult and dangerous and we 
have seen that on television and we have heard about it in the 
debate today.
<P>
	As you know, Mr. Speaker, and for the benefit of the minister 
they are often called upon to react to situations they have never 
before encountered. They are often asked to react very quickly. 
The defence department, this government and members of this 
Parliament recognize that we have to stand behind these troops 
in the circumstances in which they find themselves.
<P>
	Today a young man lies confused, frustrated and angry in an 
Ottawa hospital. His parents, residents of the Flying Dust Band 
in my constituency in northwest Saskatchewan wonder what has 
happened to their son. He is a very decent young man and eager 
to serve his people. He is a role model for the youth in his 
community. Master Corporal Clayton Matchee went to Somalia 
with Canadians forces to serve a peacekeeping role. His physical 
and mental injuries are not the result of a military engagement, 
but rather the result of a hanging in a Canadian compound. 
Military officials say he hung himself in an effort to take his own 
life.
<P>
	Despite inconsistencies in the evidence, despite expressed 
concern with his commanding officer, despite his inability to 
speak on his own behalf, Master Corporal Clayton Matchee is 
facing charges of second degree murder and torture in the death 
of a Somali man.
<P>
	Canada's peacekeepers are asked to do many jobs on a daily 
basis and some of their work is simply expected to be done. 
When we as parliamentarians talk about our role in 
peacekeeping we have to realize that we ourselves are not out 
there on the front line. We can think we know what it is like out 
there but we really do not know. We have to, like a good hockey 
coach, encourage our team to go out there and do the best that 
they can.
<P>
	Therefore, in the course of the debate today I want to call on 
the Minister of National Defence to drop the charges against 
Master Corporal Clayton Matchee. The circumstances 
surrounding his case are confusing. It will take more than a 
military court to determine the events which led to the deaths in 
Somalia, the actions of some members of the Canadian airborne, 
the hanging of Master Corporal Matchee, the subsequent 
charges and the charges brought against his commanding 
officer.
<P>
	In conclusion let me say that the circumstances need to be 
examined and I have no doubt that eventually the truth will come 
out, but I would very much like the minister to take steps to drop 
those charges in the interests of the family of Master Corporal 
Matchee and in the interests of all peacekeepers. This will show 
that we will support our troops regardless of the circumstances 
into which they are put.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It seems to me that those comments are 
not addressed to the member for Bourassa, but if he wishes to 
respond-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> I would like to join the hon. member in thanking 
and congratulating Canadian soldiers, most of whom come from 
Quebec, who are serving their country in Bosnia and the other 
parts of the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> I have been listening to 
the debate since this morning and I want to congratulate my 
learned colleague for bringing up a different aspect of this issue. 
My colleague talked about humanitarian aid. He pointed out the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="310"> 310 </A></B>
<P>
relationship that exists between Canada's role as a peacekeeper 
throughout the world and the need to provide humanitarian 
support to certain areas. He also talked about participating in the 
organization or the supervision of elections throughout the 
world.
<P>
	I think he was the first one in the House today to underline the 
importance of these two aspects.
<P>
	I would like to ask my colleague to elaborate further since it is 
an issue of great concern to most Quebecers and Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Mr. Speaker, briefly, I think Canada's role at the 
international level is also to promote democracy and the 
democratic process all over the world. Recently, I was a member 
of Canada's official delegation that was sent to Russia to 
supervise the December 12 elections. Our role in these 
elections, which also included a referendum, was greatly 
appreciated by the people. I think we should accentuate 
Canada's role not only in the promotion of peace in the world, 
but also in the development of democracy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. William Rompkey (Labrador):</B> Mr. Speaker, may I 
first of all congratulate you on your appointment to the Chair 
and the Speaker on his election. Indeed, I congratulate all those 
who occupy the Chair.
<P>
	May I say at the beginning something about this particular 
debate. I have been here for 21 years and I believe that the debate 
today is the best debate I have heard in the Chamber. It is frank, 
well informed, useful, constructive and in advance of a decision. 
I congratulate the government for bringing forward the debate 
and I congratulate all members for the way they have 
participated in the debate.
<P>
	I would like to make the following points on this issue. First, 
it seems to me that peacekeeping is one of the primary matters 
that has defined us as Canadians. We look for definitions of 
ourselves and it seems to me that peacekeeping is one of those 
things that has defined us. It has told the world the kind of 
people we are, the kind of things we believe in and the kind of 
role we want to play as citizens in the world.
<P>
	I do not want to go over again the ground that has already been 
covered very adequately about Canada's role in peacekeeping 
over the years. We have acquitted ourselves well and suffice to 
say we do now have a reputation in the world, a reputation that is 
honourable, that is justified, that is very real and that I believe 
should be maintained.
<P>
	We now have peacekeeping operations all over the world. It is 
something that Canada has done well, continues to do and 
something I believe Canada should commit itself to in the future 
as one of the priorities of defence policy. There are many aims 
and objectives of defence policy but among those out of country 
objectives I believe that peacekeeping should be at the top of the 
list.
<P>
	However, we need to understand we can only do so much. Our 
resources are limited and we will have to justify according to set 
criteria our involvement in peacekeeping operations in the 
future. I believe it is understood that we are already stretched to 
the limit and that we cannot take up any more.
<P>
	The other point I want to make about peacekeeping is that it 
provides an opportunity for the Canadian forces. It may be one 
of those few out of country opportunities provided for the 
Canadian forces at the present time. It gives our soldiers, airmen 
and naval personnel an opportunity to practise the kind of 
training that they have had and the kind of professionalism that 
they exemplify so well.
<P>
	These peacekeeping opportunities provide us with an 
opportunity to show what we are trained for and to show 
leadership. We now have about 2,000 of our personnel in the 
former Yugoslavia. Our mission in Bosnia is not traditional 
peacekeeping. We are there not only to keep warring factions 
apart but to deliver humanitarian aid.
<P>
	Many people have been upset by the situations that Canadians 
have found themselves in recently, particularly where they have 
been harassed and even abused in the course of their duties. I 
was privileged to spend several days at Valcartier last spring 
with the Vandoos before they went to the former Yugoslavia. I 
can tell the House that our troops receive up to date, thorough 
and excellent training before they go abroad. They are very well 
equipped to make decisions. They found themselves in some 
very difficult situations and they have handled themselves with 
honour and distinction.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	We are doing an important job in Bosnia. It is true there is still 
a great deal of horror being experienced in that country but 
people are alive now because we are there. People are fed 
because we are in Bosnia. There is no holocaust, there is no 
genocide because we are in Bosnia. The point I am making is 
that things would be a great deal worse if we were not there.
<P>
	My position is that we should stay in Bosnia as long as we are 
providing a useful role. I believe we are at the present time. I 
would counsel against unilateral withdrawal. We are there as 
members of the United Nations. We must not forget we are there 
as members of NATO. NATO has a role in Bosnia. In addition to 
our role in UN peacekeeping operations over the years we have 
been a valued and esteemed member of NATO. It is important to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="311"> 311 </A></B>
<P>
send the right signals about the strength of the trans-Atlantic 
alliance as this stage of the game.
<P>
	There were arguments made this morning that perhaps a threat 
of withdrawal would be useful. It could also be argued that it 
would be counterproductive because it would send a signal to 
those factions in Bosnia that they did not have to negotiate, that 
they did not have to be serious at the negotiating table and that 
they could carry on as they have been doing. It seems to me that 
the threat of withdrawal sends the wrong signal.
<P>
	I believe Canada should stay with the mission at the present 
time and that we should withdraw only in consultation with our 
colleagues, the other members of the UN. What must be 
rectified is the gap that exists between UN decision making and 
implementation of those decisions. That gap has been identified 
not only by our own personnel such as General MacKenzie, but 
most recently by the Belgian general as well.
<P>
	We should put our efforts into rectifying the weaknesses that 
exist in UN decision-making and implementation. We have to 
strengthen the UN for Bosnia and all the other Bosnias that are 
going to happen. It is true-perhaps we have not made this point 
clearly enough today-that the cold war is over. However, many 
would argue there is not more but less stability as a result of that. 
There is still instability in the world. There is still a threat to 
world peace. As long as that exists the chances are that we are 
going to have to contribute more in time and effort to situations 
like Bosnia.
<P>
	It is important we strengthen institutions such as the UN in its 
decision making and implementation process. We should also 
ensure that the burden is shared fairly. We have every right to 
expect that. Canada has given perhaps more than its share, 
certainly more than other countries. We should expect the 
burden to be shared fairly.
<P>
	I would like to conclude by saying my last words to Canadian 
soldiers and to quote the Canadian soldier who appeared in one 
of the most recent television clips having come back after his 
convoy was harassed and shot at by those he was really put there 
to help. He said: ``This is what I have been trained for. This is 
what I have been trained to do. It is an opportunity for me. This 
is the job we are here to do and it is the job we want to do''. I 
think he speaks for Canadian personnel in their determination to 
do the best job they can. It is up to us as parliamentarians to give 
them the proper back-up to do the job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to what the hon. member had to say. I thought 
it was very well put. Today we are having this very special 
debate. It is focused on Bosnia and the problems associated with 
it.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	I would like to make a comment and ask the hon. member a 
question. It seems to me this lends urgency to the matter of a 
defence review. I know this is to be a public review but would it 
not be much better to move toward an armed force which is 
much more citizen based and in which there are many more 
opportunities not only for full-time very professional service 
but also for a variety of part-time service commitments and the 
strengthening of the cadet corps? I think that would focus on the 
various types of peacekeeping and peacemaking we have at the 
present time much better.
<P>
	I also hope that the public review recommends better use of 
our bases so they can be training bases for international 
missions and things of that type.
<P>
	The other review which is in the offing, I think next year or the 
year after, is a full-scale formal review of the United Nations. 
We heard a good deal from the hon. member just now about the 
way the United Nations has been operating in Bosnia.
<P>
	For myself, and I say this as a great supporter of the United 
Nations, it seems that in the area, for example, of science and 
education the United Nations has become unnecessarily 
cumbersome and fat. It is extremely important that Canada play 
a key role in the revitalization of the United Nations.
<P>
	Would the hon. member care to comment on those two 
reviews, the defence review and the review of the United 
Nations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rompkey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think I have already indicated 
my concurrence with the point he is putting forward about the 
UN. The problems we have in Bosnia are not with the troops or 
with the military personnel but are with the political will and the 
political structures that give form and structure to the way in 
which they are operating. That is where reform is needed. If we 
do not reform those institutions we are going to be worse off in 
future than we have been in the past.
<P>
	The UN is really the only institution that can adequately deal 
with this situation. Perhaps CSCE or NATO as supplementary 
agencies can have a role but unless the UN is strong and has the 
political will and the structures, I do not think we will be able to 
deal with these things adequately in future.
<P>
	On the reserves I support the total force concept. There are 
reserves overseas now in peacekeeping operations. We depend 
on them heavily. We will I believe and I hope depend on them 
even more heavily in future. It is clearly the way to go. I was in 
the forces myself in the reserves in an institution that no longer 
exists, the University Naval Training Division. It was an 
excellent way for young people to get a start in life, to earn some 
money, to get an education and for me to become a Canadian. It 
is something that we have to strengthen.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="312"> 312 </A></B>
<P>
	We have seen some creative thinking already on the future use 
of bases, for example, St. Margarets in New Brunswick where 
private enterprise has bought a whole base and is now using it as 
a housing unit. That is a very creative use of the former armed 
forces base. Also there are educational initiatives taking place 
particularly in the province of Nova Scotia which use existing 
facilities for the training of young people. There are creative 
ways that we can make use of armed forces bases as well. I 
totally support what he says.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for his intervention 
and for his support for a continuing role for Canadian forces in 
the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	I want to ask the member a specific question with respect to 
some of the concerns that have been raised about the nature of 
the mandate and the rules of engagement. The member is well 
aware as an experienced member in this area of the concerns 
raised by General Briquemont, General Cot, and others in this 
regard.
<P>
	Does the hon. member support a strengthening of the mandate 
to ensure that when we talk about safe havens and in particular 
the six safe havens that were identified by the United Nations in 
resolution 836 in June last year which are clearly not safe when 
innocent children are slaughtered in cold blood in the snow as 
they play on their sleds. Does the hon. member agree with the 
need for a strengthening of the ability of the forces on the ground 
to respond to that kind of very serious attack?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rompkey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would absolutely agree with 
that. That is part of the point I have been trying to make. The 
weakness is not on the ground but with the structures under 
which that personnel operates. We have to strengthen the 
mandate there. We also have to provide adequate personnel to 
carry out the mandate.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	At the present time it seems to me that we do not have enough 
resources in the former Yugoslavia to do the job. In addition to 
what is there now perhaps we need more forces to carry out the 
mandate, but obviously the mandate has to be strengthened.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I compliment those who have stood in their places 
today to express their views on this very important topic.
<P>
	Someone asked how we gained a reputation as peacekeepers. I 
would suggest it did not just start in recent times. I would go 
back to World War I where 66,000 young Canadians lost their 
lives. I would go back to the League of Nations where the first 
big challenge came to the league 12 years after it was founded in 
about 1931 when Japan entered Manchuria. There was no 
muscle in the league. No one wanted to take a stand. They had 
problems back home that were more pressing and Asia was too 
far away. The league failed in that one.
<P>
	In 1935 the league failed again when the Italians took over 
Abyssinia. There were too many problems. France did not want 
to disrupt its relationships with Germany. What happened was 
that we simply drifted into two world wars because there was no 
one who was ready to take a firm stand united together. If there 
is anything the United Nations stands for today it is the element 
of unity, of bringing countries of the world together to take an 
international stand against aggressors.
<P>
	My feeling is that in no way can we allow an aggressor to get 
away with anything. The War Crimes Commission is on the 
ground in Yugoslavia now. That should be followed up with 
charges against those who commit war crimes, those who have 
committed war crimes against children, women and the elderly, 
those who have destroyed property and everything under the sun 
in the horrible situation in the former Yugoslavia. The court 
system is not good enough for them. They must be brought to 
justice. If that is not done it is a weakness within the UN itself, 
but I would suggest the world community would demand that it 
be done.
<P>
	The Right Hon. Lester B. Pearson is another reason why 
Canada has peacekeeping in operation today in a very successful 
way. He started that in 1956 in Egypt and the Middle East. 
Canadians really made their mark there. We were active in many 
peacekeeping operations. Of course the first big test for the 
United Nations was the Korean war itself. Over 1,500 young 
Canadians gave up their lives on that occasion.
<P>
	The question today in my mind is not whether we can afford 
peacekeeping. The question is whether we can afford to be 
without it. My answer is no. We cannot afford to be without it. 
We cannot afford to sit back or to have other countries sit back. 
Other countries have a firm responsibility in this regard along 
with us. They must play a role. They must pull their weight.
<P>
	If we do not take a stand against all these little aggressors 
around the world then we are going to have a major conflict. We 
are going to have other young people from this nation, the cream 
of the crop, in another world war. Heaven knows what that will 
be like. We cannot have this situation coming about. We must 
handle bonfires wherever they occur in the world.
<P>
	I would like to say a word about what happens at home. 
Military people are looked upon as soldiers. What about their 
spouses back home? What about their families back home when 
the other spouse is sent off to peacekeeping duties for six 
months at a time as they are today? What help do they have? 
What about the mother with three or four small children? What 
help does she receive?
<P>
	There is help in the community. There is an organization 
called the rear party. It maintains communications with the 
families. There is always someone there to help them. They give 
them information about what is going on in the United Nations 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="313"> 313 </A></B>
<P>
site where their spouses are, where their fathers or mothers are 
or  whatever the case may be. Spousal groups are included in the 
rear party organization back home on the base. Spouses meet 
with the rear party. Spouses write messages and news items. 
They send tapes to their loved ones. No one is left alone.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	A resource centre was set up in Petawawa. I live three miles 
from the base gate at Petawawa, Ontario. I used to teach school 
there. I was there for five and one-half years before going into 
politics. I have learned the operations of the military 
community, how it operates first hand. I have the greatest 
admiration for those people.
<P>
	The family resource centre provides advice and assistance to 
the rear party group. They work with agencies in the community. 
I must say of my own area in Renfrew County, in the Petawawa 
area, we have three Petawawas: the village, the township and the 
base. Then Pembroke is 10 or 12 miles away. Deep River and 
Chalk River are to the north. There are other communities 
around Renfrew County. They too support the base in spirit on 
Remembrance Day and in many ways as family units. They mix 
together and the rapport is tremendous.
<P>
	Social workers are on the base to help these families when the 
soldiers are away on duty. There is a senior officer in each group 
who will have information on the families before they leave. 
They know the soldiers' spouses. They know about the soldiers' 
families. They mail videotapes back and forth. There are padres 
and doctors in the field and at home as well.
<P>
	There is an overall unity plan working in a major role for 
military families. A well organized system is in place. We ask 
what about the expenses? These expenses are paid for. I want the 
taxpayers of Canada to know they are paid for by non-public 
funds. They are paid for by raffles. They are paid for by profits 
from messes, canteens and so on. This says a lot for the 
dedication and the care of the Canadian soldier community.
<P>
	The work with agencies in the community is very important. 
At Christmastime they send letters back and forth. Before they 
leave they even make sure that their wills are intact so that if any 
accident does happen their families do not have to go through 
the whole legal rigmarole of putting things in place; they are 
already there.
<P>
	The dedication and the ability to cope on the part of our 
Canadian forces are real examples of citizenship. Canadian 
soldiers will do the job they are called upon to do, as the hon. 
parliamentary secretary said this afternoon. Soldiers are 
prepared to do the job. We have some soldiers in the House today 
who are members of Parliament. I am glad they are here to give 
their first-hand experiences.
<P>
	The mandate in the United Nations must be clear. There must 
be an element of co-operation among all parties. If not, our 
troops are indeed in danger. There must be a responsibility in the 
parties to respect international decisions. Should we arm the 
troops?  People say: ``Why not give them arms so they can go in 
and fight?'' If we do that we are taking sides in the conflict and 
destroying the very basis of the UN in the first place.
<P>
	I received a telephone call from one of my constituents today 
who wanted to see our soldiers armed. That is something which 
will have to be debated in the House and something the UN will 
have to take a closer look at in terms of how well they are armed 
to protect themselves. All parties must agree with the mandate 
and live up to it.
<P>
	I am glad the War Crimes Commission is on the scene in 
Yugoslavia today to pin down people who are disobeying 
international law, those people who are committing war crimes. 
After this is over they should be brought to the International 
Court, formally charged, tried, and sentenced accordingly. We 
cannot allow this to go on.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	Canadian soldiers, as I said, will do their job. Should they be 
in Yugoslavia? If we as one of the United Nations do not supply 
soldiers to look after the humanitarian side of operations in 
Yugoslavia to try to bring parties together and save the peace, we 
are not really living up to the international spirit that is the very 
basis of the United Nations itself.
<P>
	Again I ask the question: can we afford to be there? In today's 
world, with trouble spots all over the world, I do not think we as 
Canadians can back away from it. We were one of the founders 
of the United Nations, one of the key players at its founding. 
Yes, the United Nations needs upgrading. It needs improvement 
to meet the situations and the challenges of the future. They are 
going to be many.
<P>
	In order to do so we must work together with the international 
community. The UN must be strengthened and improved to 
enable it to meet those very situations. We cannot allow young 
children and women to suffer. If the United Nations were to pull 
out of Yugoslavia today there would be more rapes, more child 
abuse and more killings of children, women and elderly people. 
There would be no law at all.
<P>
	We as human beings living on the face of this earth together 
today could not allow that to go on. We would have it on our 
consciences. Just remember, it was a small skirmish in Europe 
that set off the trigger for World War I. It was the depression 
years of the thirties that continued to set the stage for World War 
II. Again nobody stood up. Nobody wanted to be counted. They 
had too many problems at home.
<P>
	Today we have a lot of problems at home. We have to look 
after them, try to solve them as well. We must also realize that 
the world today is like a little pea in a pod. It is small. 
Everything that happens around this world affects every other 
nation in the world. We cannot allow these bonfires to burn 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="314"> 314 </A></B>
<P>
without putting water on them, without cooling them and 
keeping peace in various parts  of the world. We can bet it will be 
an ongoing battle. We have trouble spots today all over the 
world. The United Nations will have to face up to that or we will 
face a worse war in the future that maybe mankind itself will 
never survive.
<P>
	Can we afford to be in the United Nations as peacekeepers? I 
do not think any sane nation on the face of the earth today has 
any other answer but yes, we have to be there. It is not a dollar 
value. It is a human value and it is the future of the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with a great deal of interest as I have for many years to my 
colleague from Renfrew. He has been an ardent and very 
convincing supporter of giving the Canadian military 
establishment the tools to do the job we have asked of it over the 
years. I cannot think of a more articulate proponent for the men 
and women who have chosen to serve our country through the 
Canadian Armed Forces than the member who just spoke.
<P>
	I want to ask him a very specific set of questions. Even after 
one term, compared to my hon. colleague I am still a rookie 
when it comes to matters such as this one. One thing that deeply 
concerns me with the situation in Bosnia is the impotence or the 
seeming impotence of the United Nations in using its collective 
voice to try to force the aggressors in Bosnia to stop, cease and 
desist and to find some diplomatic, non-military, 
non-aggressive means to try to bring the situation to a head, to 
find a resolution.
<P>
	It has been going on for far too long. We have had far too many 
children killed. We have had far too many people dislocated. We 
have heard of far too many rapes and acts of brutality, the likes 
of which we had not heard since the second world war. Time and 
time again the United Nations, that great and venerable 
institution, has passed resolutions but it seems to have forgotten 
to put some teeth into the resolutions. It seems not to have found 
the ways to enforce the resolutions so that the atrocities we have 
heard all too much about would have ceased. Indeed I want to 
quote what the outgoing UNPROFOR commander, Belgian 
Lieutenant General Francis Briquemont, said. This was in the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> of January 24: ``There is a fantastic crisis now 
because the politicians are writing and voting I do not know how 
many resolutions, but we have no means to execute them''.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	The question I ask of my colleague is: what is it that he 
believes Canada can do? What leading role can we take to ensure 
when the United Nations chooses to pass resolutions and actions 
in cases like this that in actual fact they are adhered to and there 
are teeth behind the resolutions? What role can Canada play to 
strengthen those resolutions?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hopkins:</B> Mr. Speaker, first, Canada is loved and 
respected around the world. There is a great difference between 
being loved and being respected. We happen to have both those 
good qualities in the eyes of other countries.
<P>
	The best work Canada can do today is to bring nations 
together in a diplomatic manner and have them sit down to 
decide on these measures, just as the Prime Minister did when he 
attended the NATO conference in Brussels recently.
<P>
	We have to protect our own soldiers. We are not going to have 
them in situations where they are fired upon or bombed. They 
must be looked after. We cannot have the people over there using 
them as targets either.
<P>
	Another thing I want to say to the hon. member, and I thank 
him for his kind comments at the beginning, is that it is very 
important that the United Nations itself be strengthened. If 
anything is going to come out of the situation in the former 
Yugoslavia it is going to be that the United Nations itself must 
be strengthened. It must be updated and brought into the 21st 
century. As I said in my speech, there will be many issues to face 
throughout the 21st century and we cannot do it with a 
century-old logic.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, since I 
share the views expressed by the hon. member for 
Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, I will not ask a question but I 
would like to make a comment. As I try to figure out why the 
people of Canada and Quebec have such mixed feelings about 
peacekeeping missions, I can see two ways to explain this. First, 
it seems to me that we still have a hard time seeing ourselves as 
citizens of the world. I think that when a larger and larger 
number of Canadians and Quebecers start to see themselves as 
such, they will see more clearly the need for our involvement.
<P>
	The second point is that, as I see it, the peace missions in 
which Canada has taken part may have been too heavily focused 
on peacekeeping or pacification, giving a somewhat lower 
profile to the humanitarian aspect. The hon. member for 
Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke mentioned it but I would like 
to emphasize this point by pointing out that there are over 250 
non-governmental organizations in Canada looking to provide 
humanitarian assistance around the world. I think that, when 
peacekeepers are sent on a mission, it is to keep the peace of 
course but also and perhaps more importantly to allow these 
organizations through which hundreds of Canadians want to 
provide humanitarian relief to reach the people who need it.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That on Tuesday, January 25 and Wednesday, January 26 the ordinary hour of 
daily adjournment be deferred until 10 p.m. and that during the time of such 
extended sitting, no dilatory motion or quorum call shall be accepted by the 
Chair.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Mr. Speaker, the motion put forward by the 
hon. member for Kingston and the Islands reflects accurately 
what has been agreed upon and it is with pleasure that the 
Official Opposition gives consent.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I simply want to verify 
something. Considering what the Prime Minister said, I presume 
that if there are still members willing to participate in the debate 
at 10 p.m., we will be able to continue the debate. On that basis I 
will support the proposal.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I ask myself the same question. Could 
the parliamentary secretary clarify the issue?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, we can certainly have discussions 
around 10 p.m. to continue the debate if this is necessary. But it 
is the intention of all the House leaders to end the debate at 10 
p.m. if that is possible. The House leaders hope that with two 
very long sittings today and tomorrow, and maybe next week, 
the debates should end at a reasonable time for all members, and 
this is what we are trying to do this afternoon.
<P>

your office. In the past you have had struggles with party 
discipline and it must give you some satisfaction to-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Excuse me, I have been reminded that I 
forgot to ask if there was unanimous consent to the motion that 
was put by the parliamentary secretary. I take it that that is not a 
problem and nobody is going to object. Then there is unanimous 
consent and everybody is happy.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did just want to congratulate 
you on your attainment of your position. As I said, you have had 
your own struggles with party discipline in the past and it must 
give you satisfaction to preside over not just a Parliament but a 
session where party discipline is more relaxed.
<P>
	I would also like to congratulate other members who have 
spoken today for the scope of their presentations and for the 
sincerity of their presentations. I personally found it both 
helpful and impressive.
<P>
	That said, like all other members I have a deep interest in this 
issue from the standpoint of international security as well as 
from a humanitarian standpoint.
<P>
	Members of Parliament from Calgary have a special interest 
in this issue because up to 1,600 personnel from the Currie base 
in Calgary are scheduled to go to Croatia and Bosnia in the next 
couple of months. I do think it is important that we are able to 
communicate to them and their families the reasons they are 
going, the job they are expected to do and the resources that will 
be made available to them.
<P>
	Reform members have not approached this debate with any 
preconceived notions or positions. We hope to make a 
contribution however by identifying key questions to be 
resolved, commenting on those questions from a variety of 
perspectives and then trying to synthesize the responses of 
various members to those questions into guidelines which may 
be useful to the government.
<P>
	What then are the main questions to which the government 
requires answers? We think there are three of them. The first is a 
broad question of foreign policy: Should Canada as a country 
continue to play a major role in international peacekeeping and 
enforcement? The second is a broad question of defence policy: 
What should be the role of Canada's armed forces as we 
approach the 21st century and how does that relate to 
international peacekeeping and enforcement? The third is a 
more particular question forced upon us by the urgency and the 
tragedy of events in the former Yugoslavia: Should Canada 
continue to play a role in the current United Nations 
peacekeeping operations in that part of the world? Obviously the 
third question would be easier to answer if there were clear 
answers to the first two.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Should Canada as a country continue to play a major role in 
international peacekeeping and enforcement? There are strong 
arguments in favour. Number one, we live in an unsafe world 
and there is an obvious need for international peacekeeping and 
humanitarian intervention. Number two, Canada has 
internationally recognized experience and expertise in this field 
of endeavour. The member for Red Deer has proposed that 
Canada should specialize in providing training in peacekeeping 
and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="316"> 316 </A></B>
<P>
perhaps even export that to the world.  Number three, Canada 
enjoys a greater degree of acceptance as a peacekeeper than 
many other nations, including the United States.
<P>
	Those are all strong arguments but there are cautionary notes 
to be sounded as well. Number one, not every conflict situation 
is amenable to resolution by international peacekeeping forces. 
We will need to learn to distinguish between those that are and 
those that are not. Number two, Canada has limited resources 
and we cannot take on any and every request for peacekeeping 
activity that comes along. Number three, we need to give more 
attention as a number of members have said to the adequacy of 
the organizational structure under which peacekeeping 
operations are undertaken.
<P>
	Obviously, the United Nations is needed to provide the legal 
and political framework for peacekeeping activities. But is the 
United Nations capable of providing the field command and 
logistic support required, or should that come from somewhere 
else, from a revamped NATO perhaps, or directly from a 
consortium of those countries that actually supply troops to 
these operations?
<P>
	So let us look at the question: Should Canada as a country 
continue to play a major role in international peacekeeping and 
enforcement? The answer I hear suggested by the comments that 
have been made thus far today is, yes, but a qualified yes with 
much more attention being given in advance to how the 
peacekeeping effort is to be organized, its potential costs and the 
prospects of making a meaningful contribution.
<P>
	Let me turn to the second question: What should be the role of 
Canada's armed forces as we approach the 21st century and how 
does that relate to international peacekeeping and enforcement? 
While this is not the subject of this debate as we were reminded 
by the minister of defence, it is the question which must be 
answered by the government's review of defence policy as 
promised in the speech from the throne.
<P>
	At present the Canadian military is being told in a very loose 
and undefined way that it has at least four tasks to perform with 
$12 billion. It is to protect Canadian sovereignty, including our 
long sea coast in the context of continental defence. It is to 
participate in European security through the NATO 
arrangements. It is to provide support to the civil authorities at 
home in special cases such as Oka and it is to participate in 
multiple international peacekeeping and humanitarian 
operations under the auspices of the United Nations.
<P>
	It is clear that this Parliament and this government must give 
the Canadian military a clearer statement of its mission for the 
1990s and the 21st century than it has had heretofore. These four 
functions in our judgment need to be ranked in some order of 
priority with resources to match the priority assigned. If that 
were done, as the hon. member for Charlesbourg said earlier 
today, we would then have a clearer idea of what kind of 
commitment Canada could then make at any given time  to an 
international peacekeeping possibility in different situations.
<P>
	The third question I have posed is: Should Canada continue to 
play a role in the current United Nations peacekeeping 
operations in the former Yugoslavia? This has probably been the 
focus of almost 50 to 60 per cent of what has been said here 
today.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	Those who advocate withdrawal seem to do so for several 
reasons. They argue that the political situation in the Balkans is 
insoluble other than by massive military intervention or 
dictatorial means which Canada cannot support. Others argue 
that the cumulative costs which have never been fully presented 
to the Canadian people are too high. They argue that if the 
Canadian people themselves were to be fully consulted on the 
question of making a commitment to stay versus preparing to 
withdraw, then a majority of their constituents might say 
prepare to withdraw.
<P>
	Those who advocate a continuing role do so on the following 
grounds.
<P>
	First, the conflict in the Balkans has erupted into broader 
international conflicts in the past and could do so again if not 
contained.
<P>
	Second, any weakening of Canada's resolve in Croatia or 
Bosnia will weaken the resolve of other peacekeeping partners 
and further encourage the belligerents. I think this was the 
argument made by the member for Labrador.
<P>
	Third, I think this is the most powerful argument that has been 
made for a continuing role. Humanitarian concern for the 
suffering of hundreds of thousands of people, many of them 
women and children, demands an international response and a 
Canadian response no matter how effective or ineffective that 
response may appear to be. This position was eloquently argued 
at the very beginning of this debate by the leader of the 
opposition.
<P>
	As I sat here listening to these various arguments I have tried 
to put ourselves a little bit in the government's shoes and tried to 
ascertain whether there is any reasonable middle ground 
between a commitment to stay and preparing to withdraw. If 
there is it would appear to me to be this.
<P>
	First, Canada should insist on a better command and support 
structure for the peacekeeping initiative in the former 
Yugoslavia as a condition for remaining. This is something to be 
negotiated with the United Nations and not with the belligerents.
<P>
	Second, Canada should define, perhaps at the conference that 
several members have mentioned, certain modest expectations 
for its continued participation in the former Yugoslavia such as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="317"> 317 </A></B>
<P>
the securing of some sort of enforceable agreement in Bosnia 
however frail by the end of the year.
<P>
	Third, Canada should consider withdrawal only as a measure 
of last resort if these first objectives could not be obtained. It is 
my hope that these modest observations may be of some help to 
the government in framing a general policy on Canada's future 
peacekeeping role and in arriving at a particular policy with 
respect to our continued involvement in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is twofold but I will be brief in order to enable the hon. 
member for Calgary Southwest and leader of the Reform Party 
to provide an answer.
<P>
	At the beginning of his speech, the hon. member said that we 
should establish criteria to decide when Canada should 
participate in international missions. Would the hon. member 
specify which criteria he would like to use in the present case? 
Also, at the end of his speech, the hon. member suggested-at 
least it is my understand, but I would like some 
clarification-that Canadian troops could stay there under 
certain conditions. If these conditions, and I believe there are 
three, are fulfilled, does the hon. member for Calgary Southwest 
suggest that Canadian troops should stay in the former 
Yugoslavia?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the answer to both of 
these questions is the same. I was attempting to suggest whether 
we could define certain criteria that would govern whether 
Canada participated or not in a peacekeeping operation and if it 
did decide to do that, whether to remain. In the minister's 
statement this morning one will notice that he listed the four or 
five guidelines that we have used in the past and I think a number 
of those are adequate.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	The one that I would suggest refining is perhaps Canada 
insisting more than we have in the past of an adequate command 
structure and logistical support structure for any peacekeeping 
operations that we get into. I do believe a number of our own 
military people have suggested that if there is a weak link then 
the UN is good at getting a legal mandate to get in there but it is 
not so good at managing the on the spot command of logistics. I 
think maybe strengthening that one criterion would be a step in 
the right direction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the thoughts of the leader of the Reform Party.
<P>
	I would like to ask him if he could elaborate on his statement 
that we ought to distinguish between a conflict that is resolvable 
as compared to one that is not.
<P>
	I think we have seen recently in our world some very ancient 
feuds such as the one between the Israelis and the PLO and 
indeed in northern Ireland which I remember hearing about from 
my grandmother. We have seen progress in some areas that 
perhaps people felt were unresolvable.
<P>
	I ask the leader of the Reform Party if he could elaborate as to 
how he would make that very complex determination. I wonder 
if he could also address this fact. In his speaking to the 
humanitarian role we are playing there, that itself would seem to 
suggest that it is very difficult to determine when a conflict is 
resolvable and that we may well have a role to play as Canadians 
with our expertise in what superficially could appear to be 
thoroughly hopeless.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question.
<P>
	I did not mean to imply that the criteria should be whether the 
conflict is resolvable or unresolvable. If I did this then I was not 
communicating. I think the dilemma was pointed out with just 
having that as the criterion.
<P>
	I was suggesting that perhaps we could set some modest 
expectations in situations that we get into. It is not that we are 
going to resolve some ancient conflict that has been going on for 
hundreds of years but even in the case of Bosnia would it be 
unrealistic to set the expectation? At least we would get some 
kind of shaky agreement like the one in Croatia which is hardly a 
peace agreement but it is better than what there is in Bosnia. If 
that was the expectation then at least a goal would be set. If one 
can get it then one can say that is grounds for continuing to 
proceed.
<P>
	I am talking about extremely modest expectations but 
something that one can work toward as a criterion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to follow up on the last question that was 
asked.
<P>
	We have heard a number of different perspectives from 
Reform Party members of Parliament who have spoken. I think 
that is a healthy thing.
<P>
	However, I must say it has left me a little confused as to what 
the position is of the Reform Party or indeed if there is a position 
of the party as such. I want to ask the leader of the Reform Party 
to clarify the position.
<P>
	We heard from the member for Calgary Southeast who said 
that in her opinion Canadian troops should pull out. The 
mandate expires on March 31 and Canadian troops should pull 
out because we are not able to fulfil a humanitarian role is what 
she said.
<P>
	I want to ask the leader of the Reform Party very specifically 
if he agrees with the position taken by his colleague from 
Calgary Southeast. This position was taken as well as I under-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="318"> 318 </A></B>
<P>
stand it with certain moderation  by his colleague from 
Saanich-Gulf Islands. Does he rather agree with the position 
taken by his colleague from Red Deer who suggested for the 
reasons that some of us have enunciated that there is a very 
important humanitarian role for the United Nations to play and 
that Canada should-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Very briefly, please. The leader of the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is a complex question.
<P>
	First, the Reform Party is not taking a position on this 
particular issue. We have encouraged our members to speak 
their own views and the views of their constituents.
<P>
	I would suggest to the hon. member though that the positions 
that have been expressed by these various members are 
reconcilable. I think there is a desire to participate in this 
peacekeeping role subject to certain conditions and I think the 
debate among us is on what those conditions should be.
<P>
	Some would say that those conditions cannot be made and 
therefore we should withdraw. Others would go along with 
imposing other conditions. I think the debate among us is not 
whether to withdraw or not to withdraw, but whether to stay or 
withdraw in accordance with certain conditions.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on this seventh day that the 35th Parliament has been 
sitting, I want to join my colleagues in congratulating you on 
your election. You and your colleagues have really helped me 
and others to become oriented with the procedures of this 
Chamber.
<P>
	I also want to thank many others who have made a tremendous 
contribution in allowing me to be here in this House. I could not 
be here without the unfailing support and love of my parents, my 
wife Melanie, our four children, Joshua, Tyrel, Stephanie and 
Danille, and many other dear friends who I want to salute here 
today.
<P>
	I want to thank the people of Moose Jaw-Lake Centre for the 
honour of representing them here in Ottawa. As many have 
mentioned before me, today's politicians are not always viewed 
with the greatest amount of respect. My goal here in this 35th 
Parliament is to do my part to put back the honour in the term 
honourable member.
<P>
	I represent the riding that has often been called the heartland 
of Saskatchewan. Moose Jaw-Lake Centre is surrounded by 
nine other federal ridings. It is truly prairie country with 
agriculture being the primary industry. The Trans-Canada and 
the Yellowhead highways run directly through our riding and 
carry thousands of tourists both east and west across this 
beautiful part of our country every year.
<P>
	The population is divided equally between the city of Moose 
Jaw and surrounding small towns of about 70 small towns and 
villages. It has been my privilege to visit every one of these 
towns over the last few months and to listen to the concerns and 
the ideas of rank and file Canadians of every political stripe.
<P>
	As mentioned by other hon. members before me, we also had 
some famous people who came to this place before me. The 
great John Diefenbaker represented part of my riding during his 
years as Prime Minister. We are also home to the world famous 
Snowbirds at the Canadian Forces Base 15 Wing in Moose Jaw. 
Yes, we are indeed proud Canadians in the heartland of 
Saskatchewan.
<P>
	I am here today also to speak on a subject that is of great 
concern to me. It is a subject that I feel very close to in many 
ways. Early this century my grandparents emigrated from 
Croatia to this great country of ours. They came here, like 
millions of others, to escape political persecution and 
oppression. They felt locked into a political system that gave 
them no alternative but to leave.
<P>
	I too have felt that same urgent desire for political change, but 
here in Canada, unlike my grandparents in Croatia, I do not need 
to run away. I am very thankful that I can stay here and become 
part of the vast political change that is sweeping this nation.
<P>
	As I mentioned before, I feel very close to the subject matter 
here today. Like my friend, the hon. member for Cambridge, my 
family's roots are deep in the war torn region that we know as the 
former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	The history of this area is long and troubled. If one looks back 
on the last 100 years one sees that each generation carries the 
same hatred and mistrust of the one before it. That in itself is 
reason enough to convince me that our involvement in the area 
represents an almost impossible challenge. There are no good 
guys or bad guys in this war. Each side is responsible to some 
degree for the problems that we see daily. That has always been 
the case.
<P>
	The small town where I live has, over the past 90 years, had 
the distinction of being the new home for a great many 
immigrants from the former Yugoslavia. In Canada, Kenaston 
has the highest number of former Yugoslavian residents per 
capita living outside of their homeland.
<P>
	In the last few months I have had the opportunity to be 
directly involved with three gentlemen and their families who 
have emigrated from the former Yugoslavia to Canada. I have 
come to know these men and their families personally. Their 
backgrounds as well as their ideas are varied. One gentleman is a 
Croat, one is a Muslim Croat and the other is a Serbian Croat.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="319"> 319 </A></B>
<P>
	I would now like to give a few short quotes from these three 
gentlemen who have witnessed first hand the torture and the 
horror of their homeland.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	One gentleman told me: ``You must run from building to 
building like a mouse. What is needed are peacemakers, not 
peacekeepers, but perhaps it is too late. From my Croatian 
viewpoint the United Nations was required more when the war 
was first started. They are now not needed. The war would not be 
any different with or without them''.
<P>
	I quote the second gentleman who said: ``Permanent 
humanitarian aid can only be achieved with the settlement of the 
war. A new approach must be found by the United Nations. The 
UN soldiers are put in a situation of humiliation. They are not 
serving in the capacity of peacekeeping. Bosnians have lost 
hope that the United Nations can help the problem. The United 
Nations should intervene in a new way''.
<P>
	The third gentleman told me: ``The United Nations 
humanitarian assistance provides some relief, when you can get 
it. For example, my parents from May 1992 to their escape in 
August 1993 received only one package of United Nations 
supplies containing one kilo of flour and one bar of soap. The 
battle line is within 5 kilometres of my home. I live through 
constant days of fighting and you can hear bombing and gunfire 
followed by a few days of limited gunfire. Families would move 
in fear of an imminent outbreak''.
<P>
	Even among these three people we see varied opinions as to 
the success of the humanitarian aid we are trying to place in 
Bosnia. What appears common to me in their comments 
however is that there will be no short-term fix to the problem. It 
is likely to be a situation where a United Nations peacekeeping 
operation will have to be considered for a very long time. Before 
that can happen, I believe, along with these people, that peace 
must be made.
<P>
	The United Nations forces are now between a rock and a hard 
place. There is no consensus among the warring parties 
themselves as to the United Nations involvement in Bosnia. The 
humanitarian aid I think is appreciated. The military element I 
think is despised. The warmongers would like them to leave; the 
victims need them to stay.
<P>
	I see the only option that is left to us as part of the United 
Nations force is to withdraw temporarily and re-evaluate the 
situation. Threats and ultimatums to stop the fighting have not 
worked to this point. I believe that we must take a firmer stand. I 
say this with mixed emotions. It is hard for me to stand here and 
propose withdrawal knowing full well that one of my relatives 
might die for lack of food or medical aid. Yet I know that in my 
heart we cannot continue for much longer under the present 
circumstances.
<P>
	Canadian lives have been and will continue to be lost for a 
mission that I now believe can achieve no satisfactory 
conclusion. We must be prepared to give our United Nations 
force a new mandate.
<P>
	In conclusion I urge the government to continue to study the 
history, the people and the present situation of this area and 
make its decision based on the best interests of Canadians and of 
all those involved.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific)):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to 
congratulate you on your appointment as Deputy Speaker of the 
House and I would also like to take this opportunity to thank you 
for your encouragement during my campaign. Without your 
encouragement I would not be here today, Sir.
<P>
	I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the people 
of Richmond, my riding, who have looked beyond my ethnicity 
and have elected me as their member of Parliament. In 
Richmond not only do we talk about multiculturalism, we also 
practise multiculturalism.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I hate to interrupt you, especially after 
what you have been saying, but I think yours is more a speech 
than a comment on the speech that was just made. Am I not 
correct?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chan:</B> Actually I will be following up with my questions, 
Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I can identify with the hon. member about his background. I 
too came to Canada in search of freedom and democracy.
<P>
	I feel that what is happening in the former Yugoslavia is not 
only a problem of military action.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	As the hon. member has said, it is because of the hatred 
between the different ethnic groups there. Even though they 
have been living together for hundreds of years the hatred still 
exists.
<P>
	It is important for us to preach to the people in that region 
about how Canadians can live together peacefully. It is because 
we have the idea of multiculturalism, that we respect each other 
regardless of our racial backgrounds.
<P>
	The question I would like to ask the hon. member is: While the 
Reform Party members are visiting that troubled region, would 
they please take the opportunity to preach to the people in that 
region about how beautiful and wonderful multiculturalism is 
and let them understand the very important parts our various 
cultures play in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned in my address, 
certainly that is one of the problems. This conflict is not 
something new. It has been going on for many years, in fact, for 
more than one century. That has always been the problem. From 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="320"> 320 </A></B>
<P>
time to time there will be an outbreak of violence such as we are 
seeing right now.
<P>
	The key situation here as I mentioned is that first we have to 
stop the fighting somehow, either through ultimatums or other 
means. Then once the fighting is stopped, we can go in and we 
can start to work on the real humanitarian aid and get all three 
sides talking to each other.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the remarks by the member for Moose 
Jaw-Lake Centre. I appreciate the fact that his ancestry is 
Croatian.
<P>
	Having been to Croatia and Bosnia several times and having 
helped organized the first group of members of Parliament who 
supervised the first free election both in Bosnia and in Croatia, 
what I am hearing from them is that even though the UN troops, 
both as peacekeepers in Croatia and as suppliers of humanitarian 
aid in Bosnia, even though the UN troops in many instances have 
been ``ineffectual'', they are a thin line which has prevented a 
total holocaust. To remove that thin line would mean the death 
of hundreds of thousands of men, women and children.
<P>
	Are we really prepared and is the hon. member suggesting we 
should remove that thin line? Are we prepared to live with the 
consequences and the thought that we might have been 
responsible for the deaths of so many innocent people?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member poses a very good 
question. It is a valid argument and certainly one we must not 
overlook, the humanitarian side of things.
<P>
	The people I talk to, those most directly involved, are telling 
me there is very little trust on either side. They are telling me 
that whether we were there as a peacekeeping force or a 
humanitarian force, it really would make very little difference 
whether we were there or not as far as what the consequences of 
the war would actually be.
<P>
	I have based my thinking on that type of common sense 
approach, common person approach to it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise today to participate in this important debate concerning 
Canada's role in peacekeeping with specific reference to our 
role in Bosnia-Hercegovina and Croatia.
<P>
	I have a personal interest in what has been taking place in 
Croatia and Bosnia because that is where I am from. I was born 
in Croatia. My roots are there. I have family and friends there. 
The situation in my old homeland has caused me great anxiety 
and it has been disheartening to say the least.
<P>
	In 1992 when the United Nations Security Council announced 
that it was sending peacekeepers to Croatia and later to Bosnia 
and Hercegovina, I was confident that a resolution to the 
conflict was within reach. I was optimistic that with 
peacekeepers, there would be peace. Unfortunately I was 
mistaken.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	On February 21, 1992 Canada announced that it would 
commit up to 1,200 personnel to serve with the United Nations 
protection force in Croatia. Two months later 30 RCMP officers 
made the trip to Croatia to assist as police monitors. Our 
contingent became part of a 13,000, 31-country mission, which 
was the largest UN peacekeeping operation since the Congo in 
1960.
<P>
	UNPROFOR's operational mandate currently extends to the 
five republics of the former Yugoslavia. Those include Croatia, 
Bosnia and Hercegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia. It 
also has a liaison presence in the sixth republic of Slovenia. In 
Croatia, UNPROFOR was deployed to areas where it was felt 
that its presence could help to ensure a lasting ceasefire.
<P>
	Those areas were designated as United Nations protected 
areas. In the UNPA zones in Croatia, Serbs constituted the 
majority or a substantial minority of the population and ethnic 
tensions had resulted in armed conflict.
<P>
	The UN's original mandate for Croatia was outlined in UN 
resolution 743 and had several objectives: to ensure the 
withdrawal of the Yugoslav National Army from all parts of 
Croatia; to ensure that all UN protected areas were demilitarized 
through the withdrawal or break up of all armed forces in them; 
to see that all persons residing in those areas were protected 
from fear and armed attack; to control access to those areas and 
to ensure that they remained demilitarized; to monitor the 
operations of local police and to help ensure non-discrimination 
and protection of human rights; to support the work of UN 
humanitarian agencies; and to facilitate the return, in conditions 
of safety and security, of civilian displaced persons to their 
homes in the UN protected areas.
<P>
	I can say with confidence that in Croatia the UN has been 
unable to fulfil much of the mandate which I have just described.
<P>
	While it is true that the Yugoslav National Army no longer has 
a visible presence in Croatia and that UN peacekeepers have 
been largely successful in their support of humanitarian 
assistance missions, both in Croatia and Bosnia, UNPROFOR 
has been unable to ensure the demilitarization of the protected 
areas and it has had little success in helping displaced civilians 
return to their homes.
<P>
	Some have been extremely critical of the UN's inability to 
fulfil its mandate, not just in Croatia and Bosnia and 
Hercegovina, but in other parts of the world. In a recent article 
by Robin Harris, political advisor to former British Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher, Mr. Harris accuses UNPROFOR of 
presiding over ``constant ethnic cleansing by Serbs who are 
driving 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="321"> 321 </A></B>
<P>
Croatian citizens from their homes in occupied Croatian 
territory''.
<P>
	He writes that during a recent trip to Croatia he also witnessed 
the daily shelling of the Croatian towns of Gospic, Karlovac, 
Zadar and Osijek by Serbs, all from within so-called United 
Nations protected areas.
<P>
	The criticism has also unexpectedly come from all sides in the 
conflict. Last January the entire mission was placed in jeopardy 
when Croatian President Franjo Tudjman stated that he did not 
want to grant UNPROFOR an extension of its mandate because 
it had failed to achieve its original objective. In particular 
President Tudjman was reacting to the failure of the UN to 
demilitarize those forces in UN protected areas.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	Even the United Nations itself has admitted that in Croatia 
UNPROFOR has been unable to establish conditions of peace 
and security that would have permitted the voluntary return of 
refugees and displaced persons to their homes in the protected 
areas. The UN has admitted that despite the best efforts of its 
civilian police they have been unable to prevent discrimination 
and abuse of human rights in the protected zones in the first year 
of their mandate. The UN has also expressed frustration over its 
inability to compel the warring parties into accepting negotiated 
agreements.
<P>
	The situation in Bosnia is somewhat different from that in 
Croatia. For starters, the mandate of peacekeepers in Bosnia was 
strictly to assist in the delivery of humanitarian aid to the 
victims of the war. That has not been an easy job. Quite often the 
delivery of aid has been dangerous and difficult. Aid convoys 
have been detained at various checkpoints for hours and days on 
end while the war victims wait.
<P>
	While aid is getting through to some of those in need, it is 
getting there with great risk to those who are delivering it. The 
war is fiercely continuing in Bosnia. Sniper fire and shelling 
continue to be daily occurrences. While the UN refers to safe 
areas in parts of Bosnia, fighting continues in and around those 
areas.
<P>
	In fact it is in one of those so-called safe areas that Canadian 
peacekeepers have been surrounded. They are unable to leave 
until replacement troops arrive. However replacement troops 
have not been permitted to enter the town of Srebrenica to 
relieve our troops. While an agreement to allow our 
peacekeepers to leave appeared to have been reached in 
principle several weeks ago, Canadians are still waiting for their 
replacements.
<P>
	In conclusion, this peacekeeping mission has had some 
unforgettable successes. In July 1992 Canadian soldiers 
liberated the Sarajevo airport and enabled airlifts of 
humanitarian assistance to commence in a region that had been 
without food and other necessities for far too long.
<P>
	On another occasion just before Christmas it was Canadian 
peacekeepers who came to the rescue of Bosnian psychiatric 
patients abandoned by hospital staff. We all remember the 
television images of those helpless people in a field outside the 
hospital, some without clothes, all unable to care for 
themselves. Had it not been for our peacekeepers those people 
may not be alive today.
<P>
	Those are but two of the highlights in a war that has been 
raging for over three years. However noble and brave those acts 
were, we must accept that tensions are rising. It appears as 
though all sides are getting frustrated with what they see as the 
status quo. They are beginning to take their frustrations out on 
our peacekeepers.
<P>
	This past weekend we learned of two incidents in which the 
lives of our Canadian soldiers were placed in jeopardy. One of 
those incidents took place in a so-called protected area in 
Croatia, and the other in a peacekeeper's camp in Visoko, 
outside Sarajevo. These events follow several others which have 
taken place over the past two months.
<P>
	I am sure that members of the House recall that Canadian 
peacekeepers were held at gun point and endured a mock 
execution in Bosnia at the hands of Serb soldiers not long ago. 
We also recall that they were detained by Croation soldiers in 
Gospic at approximately the same time. It has only been a few 
weeks since Canadian peacekeepers were caught in the middle 
of a shootout between Bosnian Muslim and Croat warriors.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	Canadians are extremely sensitive people. We are propelled 
by a desire to help people in need. That is why we cannot bear to 
witness the daily suffering and tragedy in Bosnia and Croatia. 
That is why we sent Canadian peacekeepers to those two 
countries. We felt that we could help put an end to the suffering 
of the innocent victims of war. However we must decide whether 
our desire to help the people of Bosnia and Croatia is more 
important to us than placing the lives of Canadian soldiers in 
jeopardy.
<P>
	The decision to remove Canadian peacekeepers from Bosnia 
and Croatia is a difficult one. The situation in Croatia while 
serious is not nearly as volatile as that in Bosnia and 
Hercegovina. There is a role for the UN to play there. Efforts 
demand to be redefined.
<P>
	While I am concerned that the departure of our peacekeepers 
from Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina may result in increased 
hostilities in the region and place the lives of my friends and 
relatives and jeopardy, I can no longer support any initiative in 
which Canadian soldiers are often used as human shields 
separating warring factions.
<P>
	There are also fiscal implications. As everyone is well aware 
our country's pockets are not overflowing with money. We have 
a serious debt and deficit problem that needs to be addressed. 
We must assess whether we can actually afford, not just the 
missions in Bosnia and  Croatia which last year alone cost us 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="322"> 322 </A></B>
<P>
approximately $120 million and where we have more than 2,000 
peacekeepers but other missions around the world where we 
have additional Canadian peacekeepers.
<P>
	I am of the opinion that we must review and redefine 
peacekeeping altogether before we agree to participate in future 
peacekeeping missions. This review of peacekeeping operations 
should take place at the international level within the context of 
the United Nations. Perhaps at the same time we could come up 
with some suggestions on how to make all UN operations more 
effective. However that is a debate that can be reserved for 
another day.
<P>
	I submit that we should no longer risk the safety of Canadian 
troops. Nor should we continue to place a financial burden on 
Canadian taxpayers by footing what is amounting to be a rather 
expensive venture.
<P>
	Members will by now know that this is not a decision I have 
reached lightly. I urge my colleagues to give this their utmost 
consideration so that we may find the best possible solution for 
Canadians first and foremost.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Particularly after a speech like that one 
members do not have to put questions to the member; they can 
just make comments during the remaining time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the hon. member. I understand he is the first person 
born in Croatia to be a member of the Canadian Parliament. I 
sincerely congratulate him on that.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Jong:</B> When we look at the history of the Croatian 
people I suspect we will find that the first ones were some of the 
earlier explorers of the St. Lawrence and other parts of this 
continent. The Croatian people have historically been known to 
be a great seafaring people. Descendants of the Croatian people 
can be found throughout the world. They have that in my 
common with my people from Holland. Holland was also a great 
seafaring nation and continues to be.
<P>
	I am somewhat dismayed, however, at the suggestion and the 
conclusion of the hon. member. Understanding the frustrations 
that we all feel and that Canadians feel when we read about 
Canadian troops being mishandled and their lives being 
threatened while attempting to deliver humanitarian aid, the 
initial reaction is to get the heck out of there. We are trying to do 
good yet our lives are being threatened and we are being 
humiliated. In the end sober second thought has to decide what 
course we are going to take.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	I hope before the government decides to act that it uses the 
intelligence network I am sure is operating in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina. As I understand it, it takes all the existing 
information and intelligence available to come to a basic 
conclusion or understanding.
<P>
	If we remove Canadian troops and UN troops what will the 
results be? Will the result be a further and greater holocaust? 
What if our intelligence indicates that it will be? Even though 
that thin and inadequate UN line keeps some semblance of order 
and in its own way prevents a total holocaust from occurring, 
surely we have no other choice but to stay in there.
<P>
	Can the hon. member tell us if he has any other information on 
which to base his opinion?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peric:</B> Mr. Speaker, as my hon. colleague knows at the 
present time our role is not acceptable over there. It is a very 
weak role. Only under different conditions would I support UN 
troops in the former Yugoslavia. Otherwise I am in full support 
of pulling them out and bringing our Canadian soldiers back 
home.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
opportunity to say a few words today on this very important and 
historic debate. I think we owe a great credit to our Prime 
Minister for showing leadership in reforming the House. Not 
only are we dealing with an historic tragedy in Europe. I think 
we are dealing with some history in this very Parliament. I 
appreciate the chance to participate in this new openness.
<P>
	As I prepared for this brief intervention I attempted to boil 
down the situation as much as I could. I doubt that very many of 
us are experts in international affairs, but nonetheless we have a 
responsibility to our fellow citizens to make intelligent and well 
considered decisions.
<P>
	It is a particular privilege for me to say a few words because 
the late Right Hon. Lester B. Pearson was the former member for 
Algoma. By the end of today all members will know that Mr. 
Pearson was instrumental in the very formation of peacekeeping 
missions by the UN. He won the Noble prize in 1957 for his 
leadership in the Suez Canal crisis. That kind of leadership 
exhibited by Canada and Mr. Pearson then requires that we show 
leadership at this time. Canada's stature in the world as a 
peacemaker goes unquestioned.
<P>
	This crisis I believe provides us with an opportunity. The 
tragedy that is occurring in the former Yugoslavia can at the 
same time, like Suez, be an opportunity for us to find new 
solutions. We certainly do not want to see this kind of thing 
happening over and over around the world. We cannot 
co-ordinate conflict but we can certainly co-ordinate and plan 
our response to conflict.
<P>
	The situation in the world is such that the nature of conflict is 
changing. Unfortunately we are seeing much more ethnic fight-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="323"> 323 </A></B>
<P>
ing and religious fighting. Because of the nature of the general 
change in conflict it requires we change our approach to solving 
these kinds of problems.  I would not dare presume to speak for 
Mr. Pearson, but I would suggest that if he were here he would 
say we have to reinvent our approach to peacekeeping given the 
situation we face.
<P>
	I would recommend to my colleagues a report published in 
February 1993 by the other place. It was a report of the standing 
Senate committee on foreign affairs entitled ``Meeting New 
Challenges: Canada's response to a new generation of 
peacekeeping''. It is excellent reading and contains some very 
forward thinking ideas. I make a suggestion to the House. We 
recognize that in April there is a decision point for our country 
in terms of whether we stay or not stay. The rotation involved in 
Srebenica is really not directly involved in our decision with 
respect to April.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	We also have a decision to make or delay until November. Our 
commitment in the former Yugoslavia is in six-month 
increments. This is the negotiated arrangement that all member 
nations have with the UN.
<P>
	I suggest that because the government has made a 
commitment to review our foreign affairs policies and our 
defence policies, which will likely come to a conclusion by this 
fall, and because we want to involve Canadians in those 
consultations, as we are doing with the budget and the efforts by 
the finance minister to involve Canadians, I believe we will see 
public consultations.
<P>
	We need to have a partial moratorium on Canada's 
involvement in the former Yugoslavia. I am not suggesting a 
withdrawal from the region. I am only suggesting that a decision 
be made by our minister to withdraw our troops from Bosnia to 
Croatia from this spring until this fall.
<P>
	Our commitment to the NATO forces there is in six-month 
increments. I believe we need to give Canadians a little bit of 
breathing room when it comes to our involvement not only in 
Bosnia but in peacekeeping in general.
<P>
	It is my recommendation to the House that even though there 
are four options, one being to withdraw entirely from the region, 
another to simply withdraw from Bosnia but stay in Croatia, we 
could keep the status quo stable at our base in Bosnia and in 
Croatia, or we could augment our forces.
<P>
	I believe that only the second and third are options for us right 
now and that the second is the one we should opt for which is to 
withdraw our troops into Croatia.
<P>
	The review we will be holding in Canada over this next six to 
eight months is very important for the long term. I would not 
want to see our troops in a situation that could blow up when we 
do not have a thoughtfully considered place in the peacekeeping 
or peacemaking efforts of the world. When you consider that we 
are the third largest contingent over there, I really have to 
question how much say we have in what is going on.
<P>
	I recognize that there is a serious humanitarian element to this 
if we remove troops from Bosnia. There is a lot of important 
work that needs to be done in Croatia in support of the 
humanitarian effort and there are other nations that need to take 
their turn at this very important task.
<P>
	By withdrawing our troops from Bosnia and moving them to 
Croatia we can send a subtle but important message to our allies 
and to the UN that our own role as a peacekeeping nation is 
under review. It recognizes there is very little effort being made 
by the protagonists to come to a peaceful compromise. Canada 
can show its leadership by sending a strong message that we are 
looking seriously at our role as peacemakers in this world.
<P>
	We want to give Canadians through this next six to eight 
months an honest opportunity to see how our troops are 
deployed, how we commit our Canadian tax dollars to 
peacemaking around the world because Canada has never 
shirked its responsibility. However, maybe it is time for others 
to come forward. We are all grateful to our troops for their 
efforts in all peacekeeping theatres, especially in the former 
Yugoslavia, but we do not want to see them in a situation that 
may blow up and soon be out of control.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	I remind the House that we had great leadership with Mr. 
Pearson back in the late fifties. If Canada wishes to maintain 
that role-and I am sure our new Minister of Foreign Affairs is 
up to the task as is our entire government-it does not mean that 
we have to endanger our troops in a very volatile situation while 
we review our place as peacekeepers in the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough):</B> Madam Speaker, I really 
enjoyed what the member had to say. I wonder if any member of 
the Reform Party has any comments on it.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Where are they? They are not here.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Was that a question or a comment?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It is a comment. Are 
there any further questions or comments? Resuming debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre):</B> Madam 
Speaker, since this is the first time I rise in the House as the 
member for Laval Centre, I would like to take this opportunity to 
congratulate you on your election to the Chair. I would also like 
to emphasize the efficiency, professionalism and exceptional 
work being done by the entire staff of the House of Commons.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="324"> 324 </A></B>
<P>
	I would also like to extend sincere greetings to my 
constituents in Laval Centre. On October 25 they proved that 
they understood the importance of respecting the individual by 
electing me as their representative.
<P>
	I will now focus on the subject of my speech. For several 
hours, members of this House have applied the profound values 
of our North American society to an issue that is both painful 
and necessary: should we review the usefulness of the presence 
of Canadian peacekeepers in the world's hot spots, in light of 
past experience and of the new geopolitical context that has 
arisen as a result of recent disruptions, especially in Eastern 
Europe?
<P>
	The answer, of course, is yes. From personal experience, we 
all learned long ago that situations and contexts constantly 
change and what yesterday seemed obvious is far less clear 
today. The Bosnian conflict is a case in point. We must not be 
afraid of analysing reality, even if we see some elements we did 
not even know existed. It is our duty as a responsible society.
<P>
	The reality we are analysing today has two sides. I call them 
the reality of the heart and the reality of the mind. I do not know 
which takes precedence over the other, but I hope that the 
decisions we will be asked to make are made in light of values 
that are fundamental to Canadian and Quebec society, in other 
words, our democratic values, our collective responsabilities 
and respect for the individual.
<P>
	Ever since the news brutally reminded us of the existence of 
the former Yugoslavia, there is a memory that often comes back 
to haunt me.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	It was in the early sixties, at the end of January, and yes, I was 
on a ski slope. It was snowing. A friend introduced the man she 
was going to marry. He was a Yugoslav, but over the past few 
years, Stéphane has become a Croat, first and foremost. He 
predicted what is happening now in that part of the world when 
he said thirty years ago: ``When Tito disappears, this artificial 
country will be a bloody battlefield.'' He was right, of course, 
and it did not take long for his apocalyptic vision to become a 
reality.
<P>
	Slovenia was able to resist the Yugoslav army and managed to 
assert its independence at the end of 1991. Croatia, however, 
quickly became the scene of a civil war that significantly altered 
its borders. Without the presence of the UN peacekeepers, the 
conflict would have been far worse. During the past year, 
Bosnia-Hercegovina has monopolized the headlines in the 
international media. An area where Croatians, Serbs and 
Muslims had managed to live together in harmony, it has now 
become a genuine powder keg. Powerless, we watch a tragedy 
that can only compare with the vast displacement of the millions 
of men, women and children who suffered as victims of the 
atrocities committed during the Second World War.
<P>
	When my friend Stéphane listens to the news and reads the 
papers, he thinks about the victims of this conflict which seems 
to go on and on. Who are they? Women and children, of course. 
In Sarajevo, 10,000 people have died in 21 months. More than 
1,500 were children. But the others, those who manage to 
survive, what kind of reality do they face from day to day? For 
them, life is synonymous with fear. Hunger, cold, sickness, 
violence and death are everywhere.
<P>
	In Bosnia-Hercegovina, as in any territory where armed 
conflict lashes out indiscriminately, the average citizen is 
separated from his environment. The population of this area is 
estimated at more than four million, two-thirds of whom have 
fled their homes or what is left of them in their search for elusive 
safety. This exodus is the most staggering facet of the entire 
conflict in the former Yugoslavia. Intimidation, torture, murder 
and rape perpetrated on minorities under military occupation 
have all contributed to the ``ethnic cleansing'' of zones 
controlled by the warring parties.
<P>
	Can we decently question the usefulness of UN contingents? 
If they were not there, would food, medicine, and blankets have 
any chance of reaching those protected areas that receive a 
stream of destitute refugees?
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the answer is no. In fact, inter-ethnic 
confrontations in the former Yugoslavia have caused the exodus 
of millions of people who are desperately seeking refuge. In 
Bosnia-Hercegovina, out of a total population of 4.5 million, 
the office of the High Commissioner for refugees calculates 
more than 2.7 million persons have been displaced.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	This is roughly the population of Greater Montreal. These 
people are out on the roads, sometimes in bitter cold.
<P>
	At the very beginning of this conflict, displaced families 
received help from relatives, friends, fellow countrymen. This 
is no longer the case. The situation has deteriorated 
considerably and it is hurting the majority of the people from the 
former Yugoslavia. The conflict is wreaking economic havoc 
throughout the area.
<P>
	If any one still wondered about the importance of the UN 
military presence in critical areas, let us just think back to last 
fall, when the flow of relief was interrupted for nearly three 
weeks following attacks on UN convoys. Barely 40 per cent of 
the required supplies reached the civilians. I am convinced that 
no one in this House will dare call into question the relevance of 
the assistance provided to the civilian population by these men 
and women who, in the name of fundamental rights and 
freedoms and at the peril of their own lives, try to minimize for 
these people the disastrous and inhuman effects of insane 
conflicts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="325"> 325 </A></B>
<P>
	The action of our peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia and 
in Bosnia-Hercegovina in particular is an integral part of the 
efforts by the High Commission for Refugees. They go hand in 
hand. Without the logistical support provided by the UN forces, 
especially the Canadian peacekeepers, there is no way 
humanitarian assistance could get where it is supposed to. These 
convoys bringing food, clothing and medical supplies to people 
who are increasingly dependent on them are often delayed, 
stopped or attacked. Nevertheless, the people of Canada and 
Quebec have every right to wonder what our peacekeepers are 
doing in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	It should be pointed out however that the primary role of the 
UN peacekeeping forces, of which Canada is a member, is to 
provide assistance to populations in need, to try to reduce 
tension between warring factions and provide organizations 
such as the High Commission for Refugees with all the technical 
assistance required. This peacekeeping force currently includes 
over 2,000 Canadian soldiers, more than half of whom are 
stationed in Bosnia-Hercegovina. About 80 per cent of the 
Canadian contingent is made up of young men and women from 
Quebec, which goes to show the generosity of our people.
<P>
	Canadian peacekeepers escort humanitarian relief convoys 
and secure areas under UN protection. Without their support, 
this goal would be difficult and perhaps even impossible to 
reach, in view of the fact that missions are often plagued with 
administrative obstacles laid by the military commands, 
whether Bosnian, Croat or Serb. It is obvious that without the 
help of the peacekeepers, the peace mission in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina would come to a standstill.
<P>
	What are the cost to the people of Canada and Quebec? There 
is no denying that there are economic costs associated with the 
presence of Canadian peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia. 
Let us not at this stage overestimate, worse, underestimate these 
costs.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	Economic costs are one thing, loss of life is quite another. 
Each life is important and invaluable. Two casualties among our 
peacekeepers are directly linked to these hostilities. This 
number is too high, but it is perhaps not too great a cost when we 
think of the countless lives that have been saved thanks to the 
presence of Canadian peacekeepers.
<P>
	If we have succeeded in saving a single life, a single child, 
then we have already accomplished a great deal. Our 
peacekeepers know this and do not hesitate to say so. Quebecers 
and Canadians know this as well. Can we, for economic 
considerations, dismiss lightly all of the work and all of the 
humanitarian relief provided by thousands of civilians and UN 
peacekeepers? We have a duty to be responsible and to fully 
assume our role as citizens of the world.
<P>
	The process of collective reflection that we have initiated in 
this House leads us to think that the debate must be 
comprehensive. The presence of the peacekeepers is a tangible 
symbol of the support Canada and Quebec have always extended 
to oppressed nations, because here in this country, we value 
people above all else.
<P>
	Consequently, Canada must continue to fulfil its current 
mandate. It must give its moral and political backing to the UN 
peacekeeping effort. It must continue to escort humanitarian 
relief convoys which serve as the daily lifeline for 
approximately two million people, mainly women and children. 
We must work together toward world peace through concerted 
efforts to prevent conflicts from spilling over borders.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> First of all, 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to offer my congratulations to my 
colleague, the member for Laval Centre, for her brilliant, clear 
presentation, full of the compassion for which she is known. I 
also want to congratulate you on the responsibilities entrusted to 
you and to participate, perhaps modestly, in the debate which 
has been going on since ten o'clock this morning by telling you 
that I represent a riding in eastern Montreal where the social and 
economic conditions are rather difficult.
<P>
	On several occasions, I was able to discuss with my 
constituents what Canada's presence abroad means. This brings 
me to say that the debate we are having today as 
parliamentarians should lead us to answer two main questions. 
The first is what exactly does it mean in terms of resource 
allocation to participate in a peacekeeping or a peacemaking 
force abroad? The second basic question is what are the 
underlying values? To understand the present debate, I think that 
we must go back to the past. I believe that our colleague from 
Laval Centre has clearly shown that we have a responsibility.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	I believe in something called international conscience. I 
believe that the reason we have to debate the conflict in the 
former Yugoslavia where three major communities have 
difficulty living together is that some decisions were made 
before. We as parliamentarians cannot ignore that the decisions 
were made, first, just after the First World War and, second, just 
after the Second World War.
<P>
	The reason I refer to these historical facts is that I think there 
is a lesson to be learned from this century: every time the 
international community was tempted to withdraw from a 
problem or to minimize its extent, this had the contrary effect of 
prolonging the problem.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="326"> 326 </A></B>
<P>
	Remember the first time an attempt was made to lay the basis 
for real international solidarity with the League of Nations. 
They let Ethiopia be invaded and look at what that led to!
<P>
	Remember the Munich Conference where the heads of state 
let Hitler invade Poland. Look at what that led to!
<P>
	My way of understanding today's debate is to say: what would 
it mean for the international community if Canada withdrew, if 
Canada took out its 2,000 soldiers, who represent about 8 per 
cent of the international force? I think that it would send a 
message of resignation, of cowardice and of lack of solidarity.
<P>
	Of course, I do not contend that Canada alone bears the whole 
responsibility for the forces to be used in those efforts, but I 
think that Canada must take pride in an activist tradition, a 
tradition of peacemaking which is very honourable. What we 
must ask the international community to do is to give the 
outlines for a political decision.
<P>
	With the Leader of the Opposition, I had the pleasure to meet 
two generals in the field who told us about the conclusions we 
should draw.
<P>
	We should be particularly proud of two things: first, that 
international action has managed to keep the conflict within 
limits, a conflict which could have been explosive and spread 
beyond the borders of the former Yugoslavia. Secondly, and I 
think that several members have referred to it, concerning the 
humanitarian shipments, we do not claim that there have been no 
mistakes, but we say that some pretty good work is going on and 
that the situation would be much worse if food supplies could 
not be sent through.
<P>
	So I think that these two reasons alone should convince us as 
parliamentarians that it is worthwhile for Canada to continue 
what it is doing.
<P>
	There is a third point, and I think that is where our actions will 
have the greatest effect. Some people in the international 
community have a great deal of experience which gives them a 
lot of credibility. I am thinking of former President Jimmy 
Carter and Richard Nixon and more could be named. I think that 
we must tell our fellow citizens that if we want Canada to keep 
up its effort and continue to allocate resources to it, we also want 
a decision made and some guidelines laid out. For this, I think 
that we should mandate people who know the international 
community well, who have credibility in trying to bring the 
parties together, because we must not be mistaken. Basically, 
ultimately, our guiding purpose must be to try to lead three 
communities to live together. For historical and immediate 
reasons, they have difficulty doing so.
<P>
	In that regard, if a vote were taken today, I would say that 
Canada should maintain its participation. Thank you.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> I wish to congratulate my 
colleague from Laval Centre for her excellent speech before 
making a short comment.
<P>
	She started out by telling us that we should look at the 
situation and at the matter we are dealing with today not only 
with our minds but also with our hearts. And I think that in her 
speech she emphasized the need to listen to our hearts.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	I often listen to the speeches of my colleagues. We hear a lot 
about strategy and international policy considerations but not 
much about what Pascal called ``the reason of the heart'', as my 
colleague was pointing out. She showed us that, in such a 
situation, our first duty as human beings is to be present. Under 
certain circumstances, on a personal level or even in 
international politics, we often feel powerless, we do not know 
how to react or what to do but we know instinctively that we 
have to be there. It is our duty as human beings.
<P>
	She also reminded us that we had an obligation to feed, clothe 
and heal others. Canada and Quebec should be proud that, 
throughout their history, they have been committed to these 
duties that are incumbent upon us all as human beings. When we 
see others suffer, our impulse is to go help them, to do our part.
<P>
	As my colleague showed us, I think that we have a duty to 
intervene. When we feel that we can do something, even if it is 
not much, to help someone, to save lives, to alleviate pain and 
suffering, I think that our duty is to intervene. I want to thank my 
colleague for pointing out this whole aspect in her speech. We 
can talk about strategy, statistics, costs and interventions in 
Bosnia or in other similar situations, but we must remember 
that, as human beings, we should also listen to our hearts.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough):</B> Madam Speaker, I want 
to join with the rest of my colleagues in congratulating you on 
your appointment to the role of assistant Speaker. I know that 
you look forward to this as do we in the House of a Parliament 
that is different, more progressive and more open than that 
which we have probably come to live with over the last number 
of years.
<P>
	I want to congratulate all of the people today involved in this 
very important and very timely debate about our role as 
peacekeepers throughout the world and what the future role of 
the Canadian military should and will be.
<P>
	As I rise to participate in this I say that I am a member of 
Parliament who has taken great interest in the last number of 
years in Canada's military and in our foreign policy. I had the 
opportunity on two occasions to travel with the defence 
committee. Once we went to eastern Europe as a part of our 
delegation. There was that trip along with the other times I spent 
as a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="327"> 327 </A></B>
<P>
member of the  Standing Committee on National Defence and 
Veterans Affairs.
<P>
	I believe this has given me somewhat of an insight into the 
problems and the questions which are facing our military and 
which we must address if we are to continue to build on a foreign 
policy which is coherent in the light of today's world situation.
<P>
	This is consistent with our historical record as one of the 
world's leading peacekeepers. As we all know, Canada has long 
been a world leader in the field of peacekeeping and our 
contribution has been appreciated around the world.
<P>
	After World War II Canada was a major military and 
industrial power and one of the leaders of the free world. We 
gave our unconditional support to the United Nations from the 
beginning and we were leaders in the movement to form the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the North American Air 
Defence Command.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	We were ready to participate as a full partner with the world 
community in collective action. While the United Nations 
involvement in Korea was not peacekeeping as such it was a 
collective action to deter aggression and was a prime example of 
the ability which that organization had to react around the world.
<P>
	The pre-eminent Canadian contribution to peacekeeping 
came at the time of the Suez crisis in 1956 when Canada, under 
the Right Hon. Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent and external 
affairs minister Lester B. Pearson, played a leading role in the 
world community. They were instrumental in the establishment 
of the UN peacekeeping force in the Middle East.
<P>
	The eminent historian J. L. Granatstein says that the high 
water mark of Canadian prestige in the world was reached 
during the Suez crisis of 1956. As most hon. members well know 
Mr. Pearson won the Nobel peace prize. At that time Canada 
stood at the forefront of world security and peace efforts and we 
were a very proud nation.
<P>
	Our commitment to international peacekeeping has continued 
and a roll call of the places Canada has served would take one 
around the world. Today there are over 2,300 Canadians on duty 
in places as diverse as Rwanda, Iraq and El Salvador and the 
others that we are talking about today. Our peacekeeping efforts 
have been a badge of honour worn proudly by the men and 
women of our forces who have served this world and this 
country with dignity and with purpose.
<P>
	We cannot however rest on the laurels of the past. The world 
today is a vastly different place than it was in the 1950s or in the 
subsequent decades. All the implications of our role must be 
examined. We as parliamentarians must lay out a clear and 
concise plan of action for our government and for our military 
which is consistent with the role as citizens in the world.
<P>
	It must be said that the last two major peacekeeping 
operations have been fraught with frustration. Every speech 
made in this Chamber today said that. The horrible savagery 
which has been talked about in Bosnia comes to us instantly 
every day on television. It was mentioned here earlier today that 
on the past weekend six young children out playing in the snow 
were killed by shells. The daily butchery based on longstanding 
ethnic hatred causes each of us to grieve when we see it in our 
homes on television.
<P>
	Our troops have also served in Somalia in a harsh and hostile 
climate and environment for which probably they may not have 
been fully prepared. The people we send on these missions of 
course are soldiers. They are not social workers. Their training, 
as good as it is, and it is the best there is around, does not always 
equip them for the degradation and inequities they see. They are 
placed in areas where the game is played by different rules 
which are not consistent with the values that they know and we 
know.
<P>
	We must always remember when we send our young men and 
women abroad that they are going in may cases into a no win 
situation. It is like the tale of the three young boy scouts who 
helped the lady across the street. It is an awful lot more difficult 
if she does not want to go.
<P>
	Sometimes our troops and others are in a situation where they 
are trying to make peace between groups and peoples who really 
want to continue their animosities which go back into the mists 
of time. When we put our people into these situations we must 
remember that frustration follows.
<P>
	The world has undergone dramatic and fundamental change 
over these past few years since Canada stood at the zenith of its 
international prestige as a world leader in the peacekeeping 
process.
<P>
	The fundamental cornerstones of Canada's foreign policy 
have not changed substantially over the years, however. We are 
still committed to defence and collective security with our 
allies. We remain committed to arms control and disarmament.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	We are committed to the peaceful resolution of disputes. We 
must ask ourselves whether we are now entering a phase where 
we become world police. Is this the role we are to play?
<P>
	Even over such a short time span as the last five years, the face 
of the world has changed dramatically. Maps five years old are 
out of date. Few could have seen following the dramatic days 
when the Berlin wall came down how fundamentally the world 
would change in such a short time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="328"> 328 </A></B>
<P>
	The collapse of the communist party and the dismemberment 
of the Soviet Union would have been unthinkable a decade ago. 
We would have thought then that if the old order in eastern 
Europe were to collapse then all would be well. Peace would 
break out all over the world.
<P>
	We smugly watched and claimed victory at the end of the cold 
war not realizing the pent up ethnic nationalistic tensions that 
were just below the surface. The thin veneer of civilized 
behaviour was quickly stripped away. Now we see a world 
situation more fraught with danger than at most times during the 
past 50 years. During the peaceful years that followed World 
War II we developed the attitude that reasoned and rational 
behaviour would rule the nations of the world.
<P>
	What we forgot is that only 80 years have passed since the 
beginning of World War I which was a horrible, wasteful war 
that was finally touched off by a spark in Sarajevo, the capital of 
Bosnia.
<P>
	Only 55 years have passed since the beginning of World War 
II which was the most destructive conflict in human history. We 
may feel we are past the stage of generalized conflict but I fear 
that that smugness may be false optimism. We pray that we will 
never be faced with the other way but we must realize that many 
of the tensions, conflicts and hatreds that led to war in the past 
are still with us today.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, almost daily on the TV and other news 
media we are reminded of the mindless, terrible slaughter that 
continues around the world. Our greatest challenge as people is 
to prevent further conflict, to show world leadership and to 
cause others to follow our example of nationhood based on 
reason. This is where disputes and conflicts are settled by 
dialogue and not by bullets.
<P>
	There is a great challenge facing this government as we 
approach the 21st century. We must assess the role of our armed 
forces and we must provide them with the direction that is 
necessary in a troubled world.
<P>
	It must be a multilevel approach. Our military role must be 
defined and priorities must be established. Canada must 
continue to be the honest broker who works tirelessly on 
diplomatic fronts to halt conflict around the world and to 
eliminate the root causes of these conflicts.
<P>
	We live in difficult times. The economy of Canada demands 
that we restrain our spending but a troubled world looks to us for 
leadership. As I said earlier, as the citizens of the world we must 
be involved in the affairs of the world partly out of self-interest 
and partly because morally we must be involved in trying to 
make the world a better place.
<P>
	We must however perform our duties only after the most 
careful examination of all the implications that our future 
involvement holds. This challenge faces us all. If we do not 
create a world free of conflict then the price we pay as Canadians 
may be too horrible to contemplate.
<P>
	We have been a world leader in peacekeeping over the years. 
That tradition is now more important than ever.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased with what I am hearing today. I think that what is being 
said in this debate could contribute to enhance the perception 
that the Canadian and the Quebec people have of the House of 
Commons and of Canadian parliamentarians.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	I believe that something else will be achieved tonight. This 
deeply thought out and dispassionate debate will reinforce for 
Canadians and Quebecers the values of generosity and 
compassion they hold most dear. What we are really talking 
about in this debate is respect for life. Canada cannot stand still 
when there is suffering, and I think that Canadians and 
Quebecers had to witness with their own ears and eyes this 
demonstration of human solidarity among Canadian 
parliamentarians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Proud:</B> Madam Speaker, I would just like to thank the 
hon. member for his comments. I totally believe in what he said 
regarding the debate that is taking place here today in this place.
<P>
	I know, as I travelled around my riding of Hillsborough, the 
same as every other member did in their ridings, that people in 
this country were telling us that we had better change the image 
of this place now.
<P>
	I just wanted to say that it is not always going to be this 
congenial in here. However, when it is this way we really can 
produce a good product. I am sure that out of this debate will 
come a policy based on other hearings that are held throughout 
the land and a military and foreign policy that once again we in 
this country can be very, very proud of.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean):</B> Madam Speaker, I noticed 
that everybody has been congratulating you that you are now in 
the chair. I would like to say that it is nice to see a woman in the 
chair and I say kudos to you.
<P>
	I have not been on House duty today but this is one debate I 
have been watching on my TV monitor in my office all day with 
a great deal of interest because the variety of the discussion and 
the difference in thoughts have been very interesting to me.
<P>
	All of us who have spoken on this issue today are 
representative of all Canadians. We have represented all 
different points of view which will certainly give our 
government at lot to think about, in particular the role of our 
peacekeepers in Bosnia-Hercegovina and the former 
Yugoslavia and should we bring our troops home.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="329"> 329 </A></B>
<P>
	However, I believe the issue is much broader than just simply 
bringing our troops home. I believe other issues are at play here. 
We need to look at redefining the role of the United Nations and 
we need to address Canada's foreign policy relative to our 
defence policy.
<P>
	Canada and its soldiers have participated in UN peacekeeping 
missions in many areas around the world since shortly after 
World War II. In fact, Canada was the founding member of both 
the United Nations and NATO and in both cases has worked to 
develop these institutions into effective bodies that could 
prevent and manage crises and provide a forum where countries 
could work together and collectively solve the crises.
<P>
	As I stated at the outset, the issue at hand is much greater than 
simply bringing our troops home. For example, what would be 
the cause in effect or the risk if Canada did that? Would we be 
sending the wrong message to the other world participants? 
Would it cause other nations to pull out thereby abandoning the 
UN role and our support of the Secretary General's agenda for 
peace developed in 1992? Would it cause a spillover of 
hostilities into other regions of the Balkans?
<P>
	I wish I had the time to request a broad range of opinions from 
my Nepean constituency. I have been fortunate because quite a 
few have phoned and quite a few have written me. I would like to 
quote from only four of them.
<P>
	One World War II veteran said: ``There is no peace to keep. 
There is no need for them to be there to defend Canada. Our 
forces should be withdrawn''.
<P>
	Another said: ``In the spirit of Lester Pearson's vision, the UN 
should get out and return only when the combatants arrive at a 
peaceful settlement amongst themselves.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	Of the opposite point of view was the comment from another 
Nepean constituent who said: ``As my MP, this message is to 
inform you that I strongly support Canada's contribution to the 
United Nations protection forces in Bosnia. We should continue 
our efforts in the international arena by trying to convince other 
nations to accept their responsibilities in resolving the 
unfortunate situation in Bosnia. A withdrawal at this time of our 
support to the UN sends a negative message to other nations 
when we should be demonstrating positive leadership at the 
international level''.
<P>
	A fourth is a retired colonel who wrote a paper entitled ``The 
Perils of Peacekeeping''. The article suggests that a reasonably 
sufficient defence establishment is an important block in 
Canada's national foundation. Moreover, peacekeeping is but 
one component of that block, which is what I said initially.
<P>
	The key point is that Canadians need to accept that a coherent 
defence policy and an effective armed forces to implement it are 
essential for advancing their national interest. Needless to say, 
sufficient resources have to be  made available for the policy to 
succeed and to protect the soldiers, sailors and aviators who 
carry it out.
<P>
	In a briefing available to us all yesterday by the Canadian 
military and external affairs, we were advised that Canada has 
2,400 troops in the former Yugoslavia. At one point during this 
mission Canada was contributing 10 per cent of the troops in the 
mission. He said that by April of this year it could be as low as 
2.4 per cent.
<P>
	The UN mission has two objectives. The first is to contain the 
conflict from spreading beyond its current borders. The second 
is the protection of people through humanitarian aid to the 
people of Bosnia-Hercegovina. This could be through food or 
through medical supplies. In this respect at least 2.5 million 
civilians have been assisted directly by UN intervention.
<P>
	The military advisers at yesterday's briefing believe the 
merits of the UN forces in the former Yugoslavia are:
<P>
	They have been able to contain the fighting. An agreement of 
sorts has been reached between the Serbs and the Croats over 
borders in Croatia and in Srebrenica, and the fighting has been 
contained.
<P>
	They also have been reasonably successful in delivering 
humanitarian aid which is their prime mandate, including 
medical evacuations and the protection of hospitals.
<P>
	I questioned the general. I asked him if in his opinion more 
civilian lives would have been lost had we not been there. He 
responded that many more surely would have died, especially 
the elderly and the children who cannot fend for themselves.
<P>
	The military advisers went on to say that the solution to the 
problem in the former Yugoslavia must come from within the 
country by the heads of the warring factions, probably brought 
on by international pressure. A UN military solution would 
simply be too costly, both in terms of equipment and manpower. 
It would require over 100,000 troops to enact a peace 
enforcement mandate. There are not enough countries willing to 
offer the number of troops required. While our Canadians are 
adequately equipped to carry out their role as peacekeepers, they 
do not have the offensive equipment necessary to carry out a 
peace enforcement mandate.
<P>
	In speaking with my constituency, I have not spoken to 
anyone who would want to send their son or daughter into a full 
conflict situation in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	As the former Minister of External Affairs said in a recent 
commentary: ``Canadians must search their hearts to see 
whether they will accept the wholly different risks of 
withdrawal. The cynics view is that the killing, the atrocities, 
the ethnic cleansing can get no worse, but that is not so. 
Vengeance killing and localized thuggery are just as likely to 
soar beyond contemplation as they are to end. Canadians would 
be here at home, safe, but at the cost of shattered lives, ideals 
and values  and bearing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="330"> 330 </A></B>
<P>
that uneasy burden of having abandoned a vulnerable civilian 
population.
<P>
	Considering the unsatisfactory alternatives, Canada's best 
bet,'' said the former external affairs minister, ``is the 
unsatisfactory status quo''. To further quote Ms. McDougall: 
``It was Canada, and we were the only country, that called for 
early UN intervention in 1991, when it could have limited the 
devastation that followed.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Today, western leaders have decided that the defence of our 
values is not worth the casualties that would result from the 
tougher actions. Canada initiated the process that led to the war 
crimes tribunal. We have a responsibility to ensure our presence, 
that war crimes are prevented and that criminals if necessary are 
punished''.
<P>
	This brings me to the issue of the United Nations reform. I 
managed to take a few weeks of holidays at the beginning of 
January and took along the book ``Peacekeeper: The Road to 
Sarajevo'' written by retired Major General Lewis MacKenzie. 
It was a pretty heavy book to read on the beach but I managed to 
get through it all.
<P>
	He states that ``the international community gets a good deal 
when it borrows a nation's soldiers. Peacekeepers carry out the 
job they are trained to do without questioning. UN soldiers risk 
their lives every day in an attempt to create conditions whereby 
political discussions can take place, leading to peace in areas of 
armed conflict or tension''. He was very critical of the UN's 
role.
<P>
	This is where I commented again at the outset. Reform of the 
UN must be one of the parameters. The UN is apparently 
incapable of providing adequate logistics to support the many 
missions around the world. No one is on duty 24 hours a day, 
seven days a week. Heaven help you if somebody in Sarajevo or 
in Somalia wanted some help from the United Nations on a 
weekend. There is no one there. They go home at five o'clock on 
a weekday and there is no one there on the weekend.
<P>
	The third point in my equation is Canada's defence policy and 
how it ties in with foreign affairs. The centre of Canada's 
foreign relations must be an effective United Nations. This is 
still the best way to protect our nation's ties in with defence. We 
spend $2.5 billion on foreign aid. Is it being well spent? Should 
we be concentrating on the basic needs of third world nations? 
Do we have a responsibility to spread prosperity and can this be 
done without pushing our country further into debt? I think we 
can with an equitable defence policy.
<P>
	In summary, I applaud our peacekeepers. Their dedication and 
commitment to their job is unsurpassed. To an extent, we have 
let them down. Our government must move quickly to work with 
the member nations of the UN to reform the institution.
<P>
	The Canadian government must define our foreign policy 
objectives in relation to a defence policy. Canada is in a position 
to lead if we knew where we were going. Our peacekeepers are 
the professionals, they deserve nothing less from us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to join in congratulating you on your 
appointment to the chair. I know that you will bring the dignity 
and wisdom to the chair that you have brought to the other 
deliberations of this House.
<P>
	I also want to thank the Prime Minister.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to thank the Prime Minister for giving all 
members of this House a chance to discuss this very important 
issue, and I hope this will create a precedent for future important 
decisions. I also hope the government will take members' 
recommendations seriously.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I believe the previous speaker suggested that the former 
Secretary of State for External Affairs in a recent article stated 
that we must accept the status quo in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	If there has been one cry, if there has been one consensus that I 
have been able to determine in the debate today it is surely that 
the status quo is not acceptable. Where we differ, as members of 
Parliament and even within parties, is how we respond to this 
tragedy and what the most appropriate response is as Canadians 
and as citizens of the world through the United Nations.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	I returned earlier this month from a visit to that troubled 
region of Croatia. While there I met with a number of people. I 
met with the foreign minister of Croatia, with senior members of 
parliament, including the chair of the foreign affairs committee 
and the human rights committee. I have met as well in my own 
community with representatives of the Serbian community.
<P>
	I also had the privilege of meeting with General John 
MacInnis, the deputy force commander of UN forces in the 
former Yugoslavia and the commander of Canadian forces. I met 
with General Jack Vance, the colonel commandant of the 
infantry, a very highly respected soldier who was there to 
provide support to the men and women on the ground in Croatia.
<P>
	I flew down to sector south on an UNPROFOR helicopter.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="331"> 331 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There I met Colonel Marc Lessard, commanding officer of 
our troops in the Royal 22nd Regiment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I received an excellent comprehensive briefing on the fine 
work that is being done by our Canadian men and women in 
sector south and indeed elsewhere.
<P>
	I was taken to a number of observation posts, met many of the 
soldiers that have been working on the ground and saw the 
tremendous work and dedication that they have brought to their 
commitment in that region.
<P>
	I am sure all members of the House would agree with me that 
we are tremendously proud of the men and women that are 
serving not just Canada but that are serving the United Nations 
in that troubled part of the world. These men and women often 
serve at great personal risk. While two Canadians have died in 
the field we know of many others who have been fired at, who 
have been harassed and intimidated. Certainly this is 
unacceptable and it is happening in both Croatia and Bosnia.
<P>
	We take this opportunity as well to recognize that our troops 
are also involved not only in Operation Harmony in Croatia but 
also in Operation Cavalier a second battle group that is assigned 
to UNPROFOR in Bosnia. At the present time it is the 12th 
regiment, le 12e Régiment blindé du Canada.
<P>
	We participated in the European Community monitor mission 
which is a non-UN mission in the region. We are participating in 
the naval force as well that is enforcing sanctions, Operation 
Short Guard. We are involved in the NATO airborne warning and 
control system.
<P>
	One of our most significant and important accomplishments 
is our involvement with the Hercules aircraft which are based in 
Ancona, Italy. They have transported over 1,000 mercy missions 
bringing in desperately needed food and medicines to the people 
of Bosnia.
<P>
	This is tremendously important work and I would be deeply 
troubled at any suggestion that we would abandon that important 
work. I would note as well that we were some of the first people 
in to Sarajevo. In fact in June 1992 we opened the airport at 
Sarajevo. We were involved in a preventive mission in 
Macedonia and elsewhere.
<P>
	In deciding on the fundamental question facing this House 
and facing the government as to whether or not to renew the 
United Nations mandate and to recommit our troops when that 
mandate expires on March 31, I think it is very important that we 
have a clear understanding of what exactly that mandate is.
<P>
	In Croatia the mandate is to restore civil authority, to assist in 
the return of displaced persons to their homes and to assist in the 
demilitarization of the UN protected areas, the so-called 
UNPAs.
<P>
	Our troops on the ground are doing that and are doing good 
work to the extent that they are allowed to do that. I know that 
many Croatians in Canada and indeed in Croatia feel a 
tremendous sense of frustration because they are living in 
occupied territory. One quarter of their country Croatia has been 
occupied. That is unacceptable and it is unacceptable that the 
people of Croatia who have been displaced, who have been 
cleansed from their homes, should not be in a position to return.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	What are some of the concrete actions that we are taking on 
the ground in sector south in Croatia? Just as one example are 
the humanitarian programs that we are involved in. We are 
providing security and infrastructure during body personnel or 
prisoner exchange at the Miranje Crossing. We are distributing 
winter clothing to children in sector south. We are assisting in 
the protection of the Croatian minority in the bi-ethnic villages 
of Rodalice and D. Bruska. We are assisting other UN 
organizations like the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in 
the form of providing fuel within programs in that area. This 
mandate is tremendously important.
<P>
	In Bosnia of course there is no peace to keep, but we have 
three fundamental objectives. We are providing military 
assistance to the UNHCR and to other accredited agencies 
responsible for providing humanitarian aid and restoring 
infrastructure in Bosnia-Hercegovina. We are assisting in the 
evacuation of the injured, the protection and security of the 
population and we are helping to maintain the status of some of 
the safe havens. In particular I would note Srebrenica. We are 
keeping the lifeline between Sarajevo and central Bosnia open.
<P>
	In fact just this past week as an example of what we have done 
in Bosnia, look at our accomplishment, at what Canadian troops 
did last week. They escorted six humanitarian convoys carrying 
540 tonnes of aid and 14,000 litres of fuel. They repaired an 
alternate route to move refugees to a Swedish shelter without 
exposing them to Bosnian-Serb fire. They acted and continue to 
act as human shields in Srebrenica where, if they were not there, 
45,000 Muslims risk slaughter. They have continued to protect 
psychiatric hospitals in Fojnica and Dakovica. These are all 
tremendously important humanitarian efforts which would be 
destroyed if we were to pull out. There are many similar 
examples.
<P>
	Our presence in Bosnia and Croatia has made a profound 
difference in humanitarian terms. The military people I spoke to 
on the ground there, whether they were our own Canadian troops 
or others, including the Belgians, were unanimous on the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="332"> 332 </A></B>
<P>
tremendous importance of maintaining that presence. They 
pointed out that it would be a disaster if we pulled out and that it 
would result in an appalling bloodshed.
<P>
	An example of the impact of our troops can, I think, be given 
by looking at an area in which Canadians and indeed the UN 
have been denied access. I am speaking of the area in the 
northwest part of Bosnia, known as Banja Luka.
<P>
	I would commend to all members of this House an incredibly 
eloquent and moving letter which was sent to the editor of the 
<I>New York Times</I> about a week ago by a Canadian diplomat, Louis 
Gentile, who is on leave to the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees. He is working at great personal 
risk in Banja Luka. I want to just quote briefly from his letter. He 
states: ``I wonder how many of your readers have seen Steven 
Speilberg's ``Schindler's List'' and how many have heard of 
Banja Luka-Bosnia in the heart of Europe''. I know there was a 
showing just last week for parliamentarians of ``Schindler's 
List''.
<P>
	Banja Luka is the second largest city in Bosnia. Canadian 
troops tried to get in there. They were at the border but the 
Bosnian-Serbs would not let them through. The mayor of Banja 
Luka took a bribe of about $49,000, but flatly refused to allow 
any UN troops in.
<P>
	Well what has happened in the absence of a United Nations 
presence there? Massacre, rape and concentration camps; 
Omarska, Manjaca, Turnpolje, tens of thousands of Muslims 
and Croats who could not escape the region. They have been 
stripped of all of their civil rights. They have been forced out of 
their homes and dismissed from work.
<P>
	The writer talks of the terror of attacks by armed men at night, 
rape and murder, children unable to sleep, huddling in fear 
behind boarded up doors and windows. Fifty per cent of all of 
the Roman Catholic churches and diocese have been destroyed. 
Two of the most magnificent mosques in all of Europe and 
elsewhere have been burned down or blown up, including the 
16th century Ferhad Pasha mosque.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	That is the reality in an area in which the United Nations has 
not been present. That is a reality elsewhere as well, but at least 
we have been able to save some lives and bring some peace, 
some food and some medication.
<P>
	That is genocide. Of course there is a convention that was 
signed after World War II, a convention on genocide whereby 
the nations of the world committed themselves to never again 
allow these atrocities that we have seen before in this century.
<P>
	We saw it in Armenia in 1915. We saw it in the holocaust in 
World War II and we said collectively: ``Never again''. Yet in 
the very heart of Europe it is recurring. We cannot say we do not 
know about it. We see the horrors every day on our television 
sets. We cannot deny the reality of mass rape, of torture, of 
execution, of concentration camps, of murder, of massive 
refugee movements, of ethnic cleansing.
<P>
	I met with a representative of UNICEF, a Canadian. 
Canadians are doing such fine work in that region. This 
representative had prepared two reports for UNICEF on children 
and women in Bosnia-Hercegovina and children and women in 
the republic of Croatia. What is happening there is a horror 
story, an absolute horror story.
<P>
	Other speakers have referred to the numbers from Sarajevo 
and we heard about the bombing of six Bosnian children by 
artillery shells. Such courage. Lobbing artillery from 30 
kilometres away in the hills outside Sarajevo takes great 
courage, does it not? Killing innocent children there, innocent 
Croatian children in Mostar. The siege goes on.
<P>
	I witnessed firsthand the horrors of this war in eastern 
Croatia. I travelled to Vukovar, a city which has been destroyed, 
a formerly beautiful city on the banks of the Danube reduced to 
rubble, almost everything destroyed, markets, homes. I visited a 
Catholic church and walked through the rubble. I saw the 
photographs of children. I saw the broken down statue of the 
Virgin Mary, the crosses, totally destroyed.
<P>
	From there I went to a mass grave site in a little village just 
outside Vukovar. In a garbage dump over 200 bodies were 
buried. The United Nations War Crimes Tribunal has been trying 
to investigate but the Bosnian Serbs have told them they cannot 
do that. It is appalling.
<P>
	The question we must address and that I will address in the 
few minutes remaining is in response to these horrors, to this 
human tragedy, what should Canada do and what should the 
United Nations do.
<P>
	Clearly the most desirable solution is a diplomatic solution. 
God knows we have tried that so many times. We have gotten so 
close, gotten to the point where Karadzic, on behalf of the 
Bosnian Serbs has said that yes, they would accept the solution, 
that it would be taken back to the Bosnian-Serb parliament. 
What do they do? They say to forget it. ``We have 70 per cent of 
the territory even though we are only about a third of the 
population and we want to keep that territory and we will use 
force if we have to''.
<P>
	I am not hopeful about the possibility of a diplomatic solution 
in the absence of stronger and more effective United Nations 
action. We have seen the ethnic cleansing. We have heard the 
many threats that have been made. There can be nothing worse 
than bluffing.
<P>
	In fact when Karadzic went back to his parliament in May 
1993 before they voted he said that either they accept this plan or 
they can expect fierce attacks by NATO forces. His information 
minister said no, that they were only bluffing and that they could 
continue. Too often that has been the history: to bluff.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="333"> 333 </A></B>
<P>
	Do we pull out our forces on March 31? I say no. I say that 
would not only be a profoundly tragic event because it would 
deny the humanitarian assistance that we are providing but as 
well I say that the status quo cannot continue. I say it is time that 
the United Nations listened to the voices of its commanders, 
whether it be General Cot, General Morillon and so many others 
who say that they have to be given the tools to do the job.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	The mandate is there on paper. The mandate and resolution 
836 of the United Nations is there on paper. They can take the 
action that is necessary but they do not have the resources. I 
suggest it is time that we clearly understood, that we have 
clearly sent a message to the Bosnian Serbs and to others 
engaged in atrocities that we are serious.
<P>
	I do not have the time to quote the many statements that have 
been made by a series of generals but it is time that we said that 
air strikes in combination with ground troops will be used if the 
bloodshed, the carnage and the violence does not stop.
<P>
	We cannot continue to be witnesses of this holocaust any 
longer. We cannot pull out. Air strikes alone, our military people 
tell us, will not achieve the objective we are seeking. If we are 
serious about safe havens in Tuzla, in Sarajevo and in the other 
four areas that were designated, we must get serious about 
giving the United Nations troops on the ground the opportunity 
and the ability to enforce those safe havens.
<P>
	We must do more to assist the refugees who are fleeing from 
that area. We must do more to ensure that the war criminals who 
are responsible for these atrocities are brought to justice and that 
the resources are made available to that tribunal.
<P>
	We must ensure that the United Nations' agenda for peace 
becomes a reality, preventive diplomacy, a United Nations 
standing army to help to prevent the recurrence of these 
atrocities in the future.
<P>
	Finally in closing, I want to return to the words of this 
courageous Canadian in Banja Luka who said: ``Our office has 
been evacuated three times for threats to our security. We can 
evacuate a few hundred members of minorities judged to be in 
the worst danger but cannot protect them all. Their families have 
lived here for centuries. The United Nations was unable to 
deploy troops here because Bosnian-Serb authorities refused to 
allow it. To those who said to themselves after seeing 
``Schindler's List'', `never again', it is happening again''.
<P>
	Finally he says this and I echoed his call: ``The so-called 
leaders of the western world have known what is happening here 
for the last year and a half. They received play by play reports. 
They talk of prosecuting war criminals but do nothing to stop the 
crimes. May God forgive them. May God forgive us all''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The genocide must stop. Canada must continue to play its 
role. The United Nations must be able to maintain their role. We 
must do everything we can to stop this genocide.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank and congratulate the hon. member for his personal and 
poignant intervention today.
<P>
	Having had that personal experience it adds clearly to the 
debate. I note he urges us to remain in Bosnia and in the war torn 
areas. I contrast that with other personal accounts made earlier 
today by members who may not have been there but who still 
have families there. Those members have indicated that their 
best view is that we should pull out. It is a very difficult decision 
we have before us.
<P>
	I would like to note that the hon. member has indicated his 
recognition for the lack of clarity and strength in our current 
mandate. I too am concerned about that. I am greatly concerned 
that without a clear mandate we may be allowing ourselves, 
whether we mean to or not, should we stay, to move from 
peacekeeping to peacemaking. I would find that an unacceptable 
transition.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member how long he would have 
us stay in these troubled areas without a clear mandate, with 
risking identifying ourselves as being the enemy and not the 
peacekeeper.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Madam Speaker, it is important that we 
recognize that pursuant to the existing mandate-God knows 
there have been many UN resolutions-in June of last year, UN 
resolution 836 mandated United Nations peacekeepers in that 
area to participate in the delivery of humanitarian relief. It 
authorized UNPROFOR in carrying out the mandate defined in 
this resolution to take the necessary measures, including the use 
of force, in reply to bombardments against the safe areas by any 
of the parties or to armed incursion into them or in the event of 
any deliberate obstruction in humanitarian aid to take all 
necessary steps including the use of air power.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	That is the mandate which now exists. I think what we are 
hearing from the generals on the ground is that the mandate has 
to be strengthened to clarify the ability of the United Nations to 
clearly respond. The shelling of safe havens means that, in fact, 
they are not safe. How can one talk of safe havens which are 
being shelled from the hills.
<P>
	As General Briquemont said, there is a fantastic gap between 
all of these Security Council resolutions, the will to execute 
those resolutions and the means available to commanders in the 
field.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="334"> 334 </A></B>
<P>
	What we have to do, in response to the hon. member's 
question, is to listen to that plea and to strengthen the resources 
which are available on the ground. Air power and air strikes 
alone are not the answer, as we have heard very clearly from all 
of those in the field.
<P>
	Certainly in the absence of a very clear ability to do that the 
humanitarian mission of the United Nations is jeopardized. In 
the longer term, particularly in Croatia, the United Nations must 
not be seen as a power which effectively freezes the status quo. 
We have to be very clear that internationally recognized borders 
of Croatia must be recognized and that Croatians who were 
ethnically cleansed from their homes must be permitted to 
return. The United Nations must be supportive of that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> The hon. member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway is to be commended for the quality of his 
report. The hon. member went over there and met the people in 
charge. I think it is very important that he should tell us what he 
saw. We often read about it in the newspapers, in accounts by 
officials and diplomats, but these do not have the same impact as 
a report by someone who shares our values, who went over there 
and observed and reflected on what he saw.
<P>
	I appreciate the fact that he did this for us as well. I am also 
pleased to see him expand the scope of this debate, because 
since I have been following this debate, I notice there is a 
possibility that we will maintain our forces in Bosnia. I think the 
hon. member went a little further when he asked us to consider 
the means we will give our troops and the means the United 
Nations will give troops on a peacekeeping mission to Bosnia. 
There is the whole dimension of reinforcing the mandate and 
peacekeeping operations of the people over there.
<P>
	I think that is an important dimension. It is not enough to stay. 
What we do over there has to be effective and in the interests of 
the people themselves, since it is for their sake that Canada and 
other western countries are making an effort to maintain peace 
in Bosnia.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
in the House of Commons today in thanksgiving to God for our 
great country Canada. Canada, the nation, welcomed 
approximately 70 years ago my Croatian grandfather Alex Skok 
and my Croatian grandmother Veronica Pushkar and their 
children who came to this country from Croatia in pursuit of a 
better life. They settled in Stellarton, Nova Scotia.
<P>
	Therefore, today I feel compelled, in memory of my Croatian 
grandparents and in defence of my family still living in Croatia 
and in defence of our Canadian soldiers, to enter into this 
debate.
<P>
	This is the most difficult foreign policy question of our time. 
Since the end of World War II Canada has proudly stood as a 
leader in world affairs, stepping forward whenever international 
peace and security were  threatened. However, the cold war has 
passed and the world we face today is much more complex.
<P>
<B>(1840 ) </B>
<P>
	The anticipated peace has given way to a resurgence of 
deep-rooted and often brutal ethnic conflict. The situation in the 
former Yugoslavia is the most striking example of this problem.
<P>
	Canada has a long and proud tradition of participating in 
United Nations peacekeeping operations. It was the Right Hon. 
Lester B. Pearson, truly the greatest Canadian diplomat and 
foreign policy thinker, who conceived and developed the very 
notion of peacekeeping. For this he was recognized with the 
Nobel peace prize.
<P>
	When the call came to serve in the former Yugoslavia, Canada 
was among the first to step forward. However, after many 
months of engagement in countless incidents and 
disappointments, it is time that our nation review its 
peacekeeping policy and take a leadership role.
<P>
	When undertaking this endeavour to review our policy, we 
must ask ourselves, what is the nature of peacekeeping when 
there is no peace to keep? This pertains especially to the conflict 
in Bosnia where the Muslim, Croat and Serb factions have been 
unable to sign a peace accord. The United Nations therefore is 
engaged in an attempt to deliver humanitarian aid when possible 
and under extremely dangerous conditions.
<P>
	The mission in Croatia is slightly different in so far as the 
peace accord between the Croat authorities in Zagreb and the 
Serbs in Belgrade has tenuously held since the early part of 
1992. However, the situation is no less hazardous there either 
where, for example, two Canadian peacekeepers almost lost 
their lives when they were shot at by members of the Serbia 
militia this past weekend.
<P>
	There are many proposed options for Canadian policy. The 
first is to maintain the status quo that exists today. Clearly this 
option is unacceptable from the Canadian perspective for the 
reasons aforementioned. Canada has done more than its fair 
share and, frankly, I feel that our allies have taken us for 
granted.
<P>
	Canada should be proud of its peacekeeping heritage but we 
cannot continue to support every mission for an indeterminate 
amount of time. Cyprus is the best example of a costly Canadian 
commitment that went on far too long.
<P>
	A second option available to Canada is to demand that 
fundamental changes occur in regard to how the United Nations 
handles its peace operations. For instance, if the conflict on the 
ground is such that peacekeepers are constantly attacked and 
prevented from fulfilling their mandate, then the rules of 
engagement need to be changed. United Nations troops need to 
be able to use adequate force to repel attacks by various factions. 
This is not a call for active peacemaking but it is a call for the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="335"> 335 </A></B>
<P>
right for Canadian troops to protect their own lives in a hostile 
environment.
<P>
	It is time to reform and strengthen the mandate of the United 
Nations and to reform the rules of engagement for our Canadian 
peacekeepers.
<P>
	The third option is that our future posture must be one of 
selective commitment rather than blanket support for United 
Nations operations. Canada has spent $490 million and 
sacrificed eight lives in this mission to date. While many 
countries have talked peace, few have actually stepped forward 
with real commitment. How much more must Canada be asked 
to do, and to what end?
<P>
	NATO talks and talks of air strikes, yet when the forces on the 
ground perceive the hour to be drawing near, it is our soldiers 
who are attacked. The time has come to bring our soldiers home.
<P>
	In Croatia our troops are merely a political trip-wire with no 
real ability to effect events on the ground, or even adequately 
defend themselves. It is wrong to deploy Canadian soldiers in a 
zone where they are at such unquestionable risk while 
possessing so little control.
<P>
	In Bosnia there is truly no peace to keep and Canada should 
not base its military engagements simply on moral grounds, but 
on real interests. Canadians are engaged in a sporadic and often 
dangerous humanitarian relief operation. Beyond this there is no 
clear mandate or time frame for their operations.
<P>
<B>(1845 ) </B>
<P>
	The position our Canadian government will take on this very 
important issue will undoubtedly have profound implications 
for the shape of Canada's armed forces, for the practice of future 
peacekeeping, and for the evolution of the United Nations and 
its future mandate.
<P>
	It is my position that Canada should withdraw all its military 
forces from both Croatia and Bosnia. I am asking that our 
Canadian military be withdrawn.
<P>
	Bring our soldiers home. Make way for the families living in 
the former Yugoslavia to come to Canada to seek refuge and to 
live in the land of peace and freedom that we all enjoy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am by no means an expert on international military 
operations or international air strikes. I listened closely to the 
last four or five members speak and I noted that some of them 
claim different origins. I also listened carefully to the statement 
by the hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway who went to 
Bosnia to meet with those on the front line. I know that many 
members such as the hon. member for Central Nova can trace 
their roots to this part of the world.
<P>
	Judging from what the last four or five speakers have said, I 
do believe that in this part of the world, the potential for global 
conflict genuinely exists. The current situation is explosive. 
And I believe that Canadian troops stationed in Bosnia are 
preventing the conflict from escalating further.
<P>
	I also believe that, regardless of the situation described to us 
today, the murders or other atrocities, the world is poised to 
become a global village. The possibility of this happening is 
very real. If we want to tip the scales in favour of the global 
village rather than global conflict, certain countries must 
assume some responsibility and get involved. Canada owes its 
very sound reputation to some degree to its level of 
involvement. That is why I would support a decision to have our 
troops remain in Bosnia.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Would the member for Central Nova 
like to make a reply to that or take it as a comment?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Skoke:</B> I will take it as a comment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member for Central 
Nova. I get the impression from her statement that she does not 
have a very high opinion of the reputation Canada has developed 
in the field of peacekeeping in the last forty years, since the end 
of World War II. What about the initiatives of Mr. Pearson and 
the Nobel Peace Prize he received? I am wondering if her 
suggestion that Canada withdraw its troops from Bosnia now-a 
suggestion which may seem totally justified given the 
prevailing climate of uncertainty about the mandate of our 
troops there-may be somewhat premature and whether it might 
lead to regrettable action which could tarnish Canada's image 
abroad. Did the hon. member for Central Nova take into account 
this aspect of the issue before calling for the withdrawal of 
Canadian troops?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Skoke:</B> Mr. Speaker, most certainly in preparing my 
speech I have taken into consideration the various options. I 
think I indicated three in my speech, one being to retain the 
status quo. In so doing obviously we have to consider our 
position internationally and our credibility as far as Canada is 
concerned. The second option I presented was that of 
modification of a commitment, and the third option would be 
that of total withdrawal.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	I repeat the same question I asked in my speech. We must ask 
ourselves what is the nature of peacekeeping when there is no 
peace to keep. I feel that is the issue here.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="336"> 336 </A></B>
<P>
	My final position or conclusion was that whatever position 
our Canadian government takes it will undoubtedly have 
profound implications because this very issue is begging us to 
answer many important questions. First, what will be the future 
shape and determination of Canada's armed forces in their 
mandate? Second, what is going to be the practice of future 
peacekeeping? Third, we will have to look at the evolution of the 
United Nations and its future mandate.
<P>
	I reassure the hon. member that I have most certainly taken 
into consideration the various options. It is a very difficult 
question. Obviously we have heard controversial responses 
from various members. I want to reassure that I am not taking 
my position lightly, but the issue is: What is the nature of 
peacekeeping when there is no peace to keep?
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened very 
carefully to the speech of the hon. member for Central Nova and 
previously to one of the member for Cambridge. I think they 
made some rather good points.
<P>
	Personally the three options presented seemed to be the three 
options that are available. I am sure Canada alone cannot decide 
on the second option. We can only decide on either the first or 
the third. Either we stay and be humanitarians or we get out and 
let the Serbs, the Croats and the Muslims decide what kind of a 
country they want to live in if they can do that.
<P>
	There is certainly no peace. To pretend that we are 
peacemaking is silly. To pretend that there is peacekeeping 
being done in Bosnia is likewise silly.
<P>
	I would like to ask a question of these people who know the 
area better than I do. I have done a little Balkan folk dancing but 
I have never been there. Are the historical enmities so deep that 
nothing short of separation or destruction is going to solve the 
problem?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Skoke:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think I will defer to the hon. 
member for Cambridge sitting next to me because of his origin.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> You cannot do that.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Skoke:</B> Oh, I cannot do that. He was born in Croatia. I 
think I am going to be dodging and not answering the question 
specifically. What we have here is a classic case of conflict 
among ethnic groups. To think that peacekeeping or intervention 
is going to terminate that conflict is unreasonable.
<P>
	We can look at our own country and its ethnic groups, and 
perhaps even at the House of Commons if I can use an example 
of where there may be some threat of the Bloc Quebecois 
wanting to separate from Canada. At what point in time can we 
solve all the world's problems with respect to these different 
factions and special interest groups? Because of that and 
because an ethnic war is going on there, it is my position that we 
should offer refuge to any of those who wish to leave the 
country, anyone who wants to seek the freedom we offer in our 
great country of Canada.
<P>
	I do not feel we have a responsibility or can effectively carry 
out a role to solve or resolve all the ethnic problems. We are 
going to do very well to handle the situation we have in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Comuzzi (Thunder Bay-Nipigon):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
let me congratulate you on your elevation to the position of 
Deputy Speaker. It is the first time you have recognized me since 
I have been in the House and you have been in the chair. We on 
this side of the House are very pleased the Prime Minister saw fit 
to make the appointment. We are very hopeful and wish you 
good fortune in your future role. I am also thankful for your 
allowing me the opportunity to make some comments with 
respect to the former country of Yugoslavia.
<P>
	Our involvement in Yugoslavia is on two fronts: a diplomatic 
front and a military front. The ongoing diplomatic initiatives 
undertaken by our minister and his parliamentary secretary who 
is with us this evening are commendable. I congratulate both of 
them on the very fine job they continue to do with respect to 
trying to solve this almost insurmountable and horrendous 
problem on the diplomatic level. The parliamentary secretary 
has visited with many of the people who originated from that 
country in my riding of Thunder Bay. I know their efforts both at 
the United Nations and at NATO were very well appreciated, not 
only by the people whom I represent but I am sure by all 
Canadians throughout the country.
<P>
	The second area in which we are involved in this dispute is the 
military area and the participation of our military personnel who 
have been sent there to try to bring some order to the chaos. It is 
obvious they are there on humanitarian grounds by exclusion. 
They are not there as peacemakers because there is just no peace 
to make and that is really the role of our diplomats. They are not 
there as peacekeepers because there is no peace to keep. 
Obviously they are there on the very valid grounds of 
humanitarian reasons.
<P>
	The main issues when one discusses the humanitarian aspects 
are those of providing the basic necessities of life such as food, 
medicine and some degree of shelter to the people who are 
always the innocent victims, those who are directly involved 
and those who are hurt in a conflict in which they have no part.
<P>
	You had an office down the hall from me, Mr. Speaker, and I 
would see your children going back and forth. I am particularly 
grieved when I look at the atrocities perpetrated on children in 
this area and the sadness. From my perspective, whenever I see a 
program in the newscast referring to this troubled area and I see 
the children, my mind goes to my grandchildren as I am sure it 
does for other Canadians. The situation is horrible. One wonders 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="337"> 337 </A></B>
<P>
why it cannot be resolved, but that is beyond what we can do in 
the House.
<P>
	When discussing why we are there, the military aspects of our 
involvement, naturally we on this side of the House rely very 
much on the competent minister we have in charge as Minister 
of National Defence. I am glad he is in the House this evening to 
listen to the debates on both sides in order to formulate some 
opinion on what we should do.
<P>
	I thank the minister for insisting that this is a free and open 
debate for every member of Parliament to voice their own 
individual concerns. I am also very pleased to compliment his 
parliamentary secretary to whom we look for guidance in 
military matters because of his many years in the military. In his 
second career he chose to join us in the House of Commons, 
bringing his wealth of military experience with him. There are 
some very good resource people on whom we base our 
information.
<P>
	The question really comes down to why we are there. Why are 
we in Somalia? Why are we in most other troubled areas in the 
world?
<P>
	Yesterday we welcomed in the House the President of Haiti. 
He was a democratically elected president of a democratic 
country. The military of that country chose that he should not be 
allowed to exercise the democratic principles his country 
wanted him to exercise. As a result he is a president without a 
country because the military will not let him perform his duties.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	When one thinks of that aspect one says how lucky we are in 
Canada. It could never happen in Canada. Because of the 
military in this country and because of the democratic process 
that we have, there are very distinct lines and the military 
always responds to the people of Canada through the Minister of 
National Defence and the cabinet.
<P>
	Logically when decisions are made at this level I suspect that 
with any proposed action to assist our allies or to make a 
contribution to the United Nations or NATO, the Minister of 
National Defence would first meet with the chief of staff to 
discuss the proposed role in which our military would become 
involved.
<P>
	The first issue to be ascertained naturally, as I spoke earlier, is 
whether it is for humanitarian grounds, peacekeeping or 
peacemaking.
<P>
	Once the minister sets out very clear terms on what our 
objectives should be, the chief of staff I assume would then 
confer with his assistants and colleagues in the department of 
defence and the military on how best they could fulfil the 
mandate on the order of the defence minister and the cabinet 
and, through them, the people of this country.
<P>
	I think the role of the military is to analyse the degree of 
success of their mandate and what commitments they will have 
to come back to before they accept that responsibility when they 
meet with the minister and talk about the necessities of fulfilling 
that mandate. What is the required manpower? What is the 
required equipment? How long will it take to fulfil the 
obligation and to bring whatever action there will be to a 
satisfactory conclusion?
<P>
	I think at that time if one could imagine what the decision 
making process would be, the political arm swings in and makes 
that fundamental commitment to the military personnel to say 
that it will provide the manpower, the equipment and the 
funding necessary to do the job.
<P>
	I think at that particular period of time the role of the political 
arm or the role of the politician and the cabinet and the minister, 
other than being reported to on a daily basis, really turns itself 
over and those in charge of the military operation take most of 
the responsibility once that fundamental decision, or what I call 
the first order of command, is made.
<P>
	That preamble of getting into that position leads me to reflect 
on why we have our military people in this troubled land today.
<P>
	Let us reflect on what has happened in this House over the past 
little while. In the last government we had a Minister of National 
Defence who was perhaps preoccupied with other things. We 
had another Minister of National Defence toward the end of the 
term. During that period of time we had the chief of staff 
appointed ambassador to Washington and another chief of staff 
was appointed. When we came to government what we saw there 
had been a little dysfunctioning or disorientation.
<P>
	What I am suggesting today is with that logical background of 
events that have taken place at this time I would respectfully 
request that our minister consider removing our forces from that 
troubled area and reassess our position with respect to our future 
role in providing military assistance to the troubled area about 
which we talked today and many of the troubled areas which I 
am sure will arise in the future.
<P>
	I suggest we should define our role as to whether we are 
peacekeepers and if we are peacekeepers let us train our military 
as best we can and equip them as best we can.
<P>
	I would like to close with a comment on how proud we are in 
this country that our military people in the former country of 
Yugoslavia are performing so admirably and that every 
Canadian is very proud of the role they are playing. I hope that 
our minister and our Prime Minister and all of us in this House 
say that it is time for us to get out and reassess our position.
<P>
<B>(1905 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as this is my first opportunity to  address the House 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="338"> 338 </A></B>
<P>
I would like to congratulate you on your appointment as Deputy 
Speaker and to all the members of this House on their election.
<P>
	As the member for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, I 
represent the constituency with the greatest number of voters in 
western Canada. Located on the west coast just southeast of the 
city of Vancouver, my constituency abuts the 
Canadian-American border. It contains the city of White Rock, 
the south portion of the city of Surrey and the southwest corner 
of the township of Langley. Although the riding is only 250,000 
square kilometres, it contains a wide diversity of communities.
<P>
	Part of my constituency is dedicated to agriculture. A number 
of large vegetable farms are located on some of the richest 
agricultural land in Canada. Dairy and poultry farms are located 
in the Cloverdale and South Langley areas. My constituency 
also has light industrial areas that provide a wide variety of 
commercial goods. These industries as well as other small 
businesses have raised a concern about Canada's national debt 
and the enormous federal deficit. These business people want 
their government to take control to reduce spending. They say 
that if the government wants to increase economic activity then 
it should work toward reducing taxes and the cost of doing 
business in Canada.
<P>
	However, the greatest land use in my constituency is 
residential. The community of White Rock is located on the 
shores of Semiahmoo Bay and is well known as a retirement 
centre because of its mild climate. The area has also attracted a 
large number of families and as a result there is a growing 
element of the constituents who commute outside of the riding's 
boundaries.
<P>
	My constituency is one of the fastest growing areas of this 
country, but unfortunately one of the aspects of rapid growth is 
an accompanying growth in criminal activity. During the 
election campaign my constituents considered this to be one of 
the major problems. My constituents have made it quite clear 
that they expect this government to bring greater protection to 
society.
<P>
	My constituents elected me on a platform of fiscal 
responsibility, parliamentary accountability and criminal 
justice reform. I would like to thank the voters of 
Surrey-White Rock- South Langley for their confidence in 
me and to assure them that I am their servant and I will do 
everything in my power to accomplish these goals.
<P>
	However, this evening I am here to speak on Canada's role in 
Bosnia and I do so as an ordinary Canadian. Like most 
Canadians, I have read, listened and watched countless stories 
about the tragedy of Bosnia and Hercegovina. These stories have 
evoked a wide range of emotion. I have been horrified by the 
indiscriminate attacks on civilians, especially the children. I 
have been disturbed by reports of the political strategy of ethnic 
cleaning. I have been very proud of the role that Canadian 
peacekeepers have had in Bosnia.
<P>
	I have also been very irritated at the unwillingness of the 
political and military leaders of the warring factions to reach a 
peaceful solution. I have expressed frustration with the UN's 
inability to take definitive action to resolve this issue and I was 
outraged when I heard reports of Canadian peacekeepers being 
subjected to mock executions.
<P>
	When our troops are subjected to such treatment it is difficult 
to disagree with those individuals who call for the withdrawal of 
Canadian troops. At some point we may have to do so, but I 
believe that despite all the adversity it is critical that Canadians 
remain in Bosnia. No matter how bad the situation is now, 
without Canadian peacekeepers the situation would be much 
worse. Canadians are going to have to decide if they are 
prepared to live with the consequences of a unilateral 
withdrawal, a withdrawal that could result in a full fledged war 
and the genocide of ethnic groups.
<P>
	If this were to occur, could Canadians sit back and wash their 
hands of the affair? Could we say that this is not our concern? 
Are we prepared to accept the fact that we might have been able 
to stop this, but that we got tired and frustrated?
<P>
<B>(1910 ) </B>
<P>
	I know that when we see television reports of children killed 
we wonder what good United Nations peacekeepers are doing. 
When we hear reports of entire families being wiped out we 
wonder what peace Canadian soldiers are supposed to keep. 
However, without the presence of Canadian and other United 
Nations personnel, Bosnia would probably be faced with the 
wholesale slaughter of children and civilians.
<P>
	This is the choice that Canadians are facing. Do we withdraw 
our troops and accept the prospect of full fledged war and 
potential genocide or do we indefinitely commit our troops to a 
peacekeeping mission where there is no peace to keep?
<P>
	I do not imagine that many Canadians are prepared to commit 
our troops indefinitely to an ill defined mission in a country 
where political and military leaders have shown little 
inclination to resolve the issue. Many of the difficulties appear 
to be caused more by the United Nations mandate than by the 
mission itself.
<P>
	As the outgoing commander of United Nations peacekeepers 
in Bosnia stated, it is fine for the politicians and diplomats to 
pass these wonderful resolutions but they do not mean very 
much unless they are accompanied by the willpower to carry 
them out.
<P>
	We have to give our peacekeepers the authority and resources 
to carry out their mandate and perhaps Canada and the United 
Nations need to redefine the rules of this mandate. However, is 
the mission itself worthwhile?
<P>
	For those who believe that Canada should withdraw its 
peacekeepers I ask them whether they are prepared to abandon 
the people of Bosnia to the mercies of the factional leaders. A 
glance at history has shown that over  the last 50 years we have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="339"> 339 </A></B>
<P>
had too many instances of people's lives being left to the mercy 
of dictators and despots.
<P>
	Today, people say that if we had intervened in many of these 
situations earlier, we might have saved millions of innocent 
victims. When one considers the events that have already 
occurred in Bosnia with the United Nations presence, imagine 
what a future without the United Nations intervention would 
mean for the people of Bosnia. One wonders if today's ethnic 
cleansing will become tomorrow's genocide.
<P>
	I do not believe that Canadians are prepared to condemn the 
people of Bosnia to such a fate. Our intervention, no matter how 
troublesome or frustrating, certainly is preferable to permitting 
the genocide of one or more of the ethnic groups in Bosnia.
<P>
	It is obvious that the only acceptable way to resolve this 
conflict is through negotiation. Unfortunately, it appears that 
the various factional leaders have little incentive to resolve the 
issue.
<P>
	Some would even suggest that the presence of the United 
Nations peacekeepers has provided the leaders of the various 
factions with an excuse not to come to a quick resolution. They 
would suggest that all sides should experience the effects of a 
full scale war so they can fully appreciate the horrors of such 
warfare. This they argue would give the negotiators the 
incentive to reach a peace agreement. Perhaps it would, but what 
would be the cost in human lives?
<P>
	Tens of thousands of Bosnians have already lost their lives in 
this conflict and thousands more will likely die. However, the 
toll would likely have been in the hundreds of thousands without 
our involvement. Unfortunately we must wait for the various 
leaders to reach a settlement on their own.
<P>
	Canada and the rest of the international community must 
continue to pressure the warring factions to reach an acceptable 
peace. We have to impress upon these leaders that military 
victories resulting in territorial gains will not be internationally 
recognized. We have to impress upon them that the prize for 
their aggression will be a total isolation from the world 
community.
<P>
	I think that Canadians recognize the fact that Canada cannot 
afford to be the peacekeeper to the world. It is a credit to our 
military that we are in such popular demand for the role. Our 
reputation as peacekeepers is unparalleled and it is a good 
reputation to have. Nevertheless Canada does not have the 
money to send its troops into every dispute.
<P>
	Reality dictates that we have to pick and choose our 
assignments. The planned review of the Canadian Armed Forces 
is a good step in determining the extent to which Canada should 
be involved in these missions.
<P>
	Canadians are going to have to decide just what resources we 
are prepared to commit to these endeavours. It is a noble role but 
such nobility does not come cheap. It is the Canadian taxpayer 
who will have to decide the extent to which they are prepared to 
underwrite these missions. However, this is for future roles.
<P>
<B>(1915) </B>
<P>
	The reality of today is that rightly or wrongly Canadian troops 
are in Bosnia. It is also reality that this is not a great situation to 
be in. We have asked our peacekeepers to attempt to keep a 
peace that does not exist. As our troops attempt to keep three 
warring ethnic groups from killing each other, we have found 
that we are ending up being hated by all three sides. We really 
have entered into a classic no win situation.
<P>
	Critics of Canada's presence in Bosnia can probably list 
dozens of valid reasons why we should not be there. In return, I 
can offer only one good reason why we have to remain. It is for 
the simple reason that without us the situation would be a lot 
worse. These people are dependent upon the UN force to keep 
them alive.
<P>
	It is an unfortunate reality but Canadians are showing a 
greater concern for the fate of the Bosnian people than their own 
leaders. This concern or compassion may force us to make an 
occasional impractical decision, but it is also a virtue that makes 
this country such a wonderful place to live.
<P>
	Canadians have been fortunate to face precious little political 
violence in their history. We do not have to worry that when our 
children are outside playing in the snow some artillery shell is 
going to land in their midst and kill them. Perhaps it is for this 
reason that Canadians should be in Bosnia.
<P>
	We need to do whatever we can to help the rest of the world 
achieve peace. We must keep a window open for negotiations to 
take place in the hope of a peaceful resolution. We have to show 
them that we care.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I commend 
the member for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley on her 
intervention in this debate.
<P>
	This is an important debate in the House of Commons. I am 
pleased that we are starting off in such a fashion. It allows 
members to rise without fear of retribution by party whips when 
they take the personal positions they feel on this very important 
issue. I commend her on her remarks. They were delivered very 
well and there was a lot of substance to them.
<P>
	I have a concern that I want to share with my colleague who 
just made her remarks. As I said earlier, I support the 
peacekeeping mandate of the Canadian forces over and over 
again. Indeed I commend the men and women of the Canadian 
Armed Forces for the excellent job they have done over the last 
number of decades. However the reality is that in this current 
situation the United Nations has found itself to be desperately 
wanting in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="340"> 340 </A></B>
<P>
being able to  use resolutions from the collective body of the 
United Nations in order to stop this aggression. There has been 
over a dozen resolutions by the United Nations.
<P>
	The member just referred to some of the atrocities that are 
occurring. At the same point in time the shelling continues in 
Sarajevo, no matter how many times the United Nations has 
stood, spoken as a world body and said if they do not stop the 
aggression, if they do not allow the humanitarian aid through, if 
they continue in their aggression in the city of Sarajevo, they 
will do <I>x</I>, <I>y</I> and <I>z</I>. They have never done anything.
<P>
	It is rather telling that in the latest attack we saw in the last 
few days young school children were murdered as they played 
outside. It was only 200 metres from the main Sarajevo 
headquarters of the United Nations military force. It is fairly 
clear the individuals who shelled the area where those children 
were simply did not believe the United Nations had any teeth or 
desire to escalate the situation by the use of armed intervention.
<P>
	Does the member believe the United Nations has in effect let 
down Canadian peacekeepers and the peacekeepers from other 
nations who are there by issuing these hollow threats and the 
sabre rattling they have undertaken through these resolutions?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to comment that I 
feel perhaps the United Nations got into the Bosnia situation 
prematurely. However I maintain that decision was made by the 
previous government of our country and by the United Nations. 
Now is not the time to resolve that issue.
<P>
<B>(1920) </B>
<P>
	The time is now to develop a foreign policy and a defence 
policy that will clearly address the role of the peacekeepers and 
our position as Canadian peacekeepers within that collective 
community.
<P>
	The world community must take note of what is happening 
and send a clear message that this kind of aggression is not 
acceptable in the world and that it will not be rewarded by giving 
more land and more power to them. They have to be condemned 
for this kind of aggressive behaviour.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Mr. Speaker, I echo the comments the 
member has just made. I want her to clarify whether or not she 
believes-and I am not saying whether we should have been in 
there when we were through the UN-that the UN, once we were 
there, acted in a responsible fashion by the passage of 
resolutions on which it obviously had no intention. It obviously 
had no gumption or stomach to follow through on the sanctions 
or the threat of air strikes if indeed the aggressors in this 
particular circumstance did not cease and desist with the type of 
genocide which had been undertaken.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond by 
indicating that I feel the United Nations representing the world 
community must take a stronger stand in denouncing this type of 
aggressive behaviour.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to speak 
today and to congratulate you on your ascension to the position 
of Deputy Speaker. I look forward to working with you. I also 
thank members of the government who have given all of us the 
opportunity to address this very important issue.
<P>
	As this is my maiden speech I would certainly like to take the 
opportunity to thank the people of Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, my 
riding, for giving me their confidence on October 25. I commit 
to them that I will again do my very best to represent them here 
in Ottawa. This subject is of great importance to the people of 
my riding because of its long history in defence and 
peacekeeping with Canadian Forces Base Esquimalt being there 
and the Princess Patricia Rifles.
<P>
	I would however like to say that because of the seriousness 
and gravity of the situation we are speaking about today, I will 
keep my introduction to the most beautiful riding in Canada to a 
minimum and rather invite everybody to come there to see it for 
themselves.
<P>
	The issue at hand today is Bosnia, a very serious one, and what 
should be Canada's role in this bloody civil war. I will preface 
what I am about to say by mentioning that there are no white 
knights and no black knights in this situation. Rather there are 
many gray zones. Atrocities have been committed by all sides. 
However certainly there has been a preponderance on the side of 
Serbian aggression.
<P>
	It is important to note that the people of the former Yugoslavia 
did in fact live together quite nicely up until the beginning of 
this century. After World War I and with the collapse of the 
Ottoman and Hapsburg empires the Serbians, Croats and 
Muslims were fused together to form what we have come to 
know as Yugoslavia. There was little rancour beforehand. 
However ethnic tensions mounted because one group, the 
Serbians, were given preferential treatment to the expense of the 
other ethnic groups there. I hope this subject I have just 
mentioned is not lost on the Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition.
<P>
	This culminated in World War II as ethnic tensions mounted 
with the slaughter of over two million Croats and Serbians at 
each other's hands, a number I might add that far exceeds the 
number of people who were killed at the hands of the Nazis. This 
deepened the hatred between the two groups, widened the rift 
between them, and set the stage for the carnage we see today in 
all its horror via CNN. As time goes on and the atrocities pile up 
on both sides, the rift between the peoples widens and the 
misunderstanding and hatred deepen. That is a profound 
tragedy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="341"> 341 </A></B>
<P>
	Now that I have presented my preface what will our role be in 
this conflict? Since there is no peace in existence today, as has 
been said before, there is no peace to keep in the seething 
caldron of racial hatred. Is there peace to make? I think so but it 
will only come through diplomatic channels and not with force. 
To commit our troops with force today would in my estimation 
banish them to be just another fourth force in this encounter.
<P>
<B>(1925 ) </B>
<P>
	Along this line of questioning are air strikes. Should we or 
should we not employ them? If we use air strikes the impartiality 
of the peacekeepers would be forever forsaken. This would set 
us up for two things. First, it would set us up for full-scale 
reprisals by all sides that would produce a large loss of life both 
among the United Nations troops and therefore among our own.
<P>
	It is interesting to note in these conflicts-and I speak from 
some personal experience-that one group can go ahead and kill 
its own people to make it look like another group is doing the 
killing. It is the easiest way to go against the group that is 
disliked intensely and against which the other is fighting.
<P>
	Second, what would happen if we engaged in this 
conflict-and this is very important to understand-is that it 
would completely neutralized the humanitarian role the United 
Nations has engaged in so far. While this role has been imperfect 
it has indeed saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of people 
from death, rape and torture. Thus I do not think that air strikes 
are an option.
<P>
	Now we are left with the last option, the humanitarian effort 
for which we have been given a mandate under the United 
Nations. At this time I would publicly like to state that it is a role 
our Canadian men and women have been doing admirably. Often 
overworked, underarmed and outgunned they have carried out 
their UN humanitarian role with profound bravery. I would like 
to extend to them publicly my heartfelt thanks and admiration.
<P>
	Should we engage in this endeavour? If we pull out it can be 
fairly certain that other member states will pull out too. 
Therefore no humanitarian aid effort would go through in this 
conflict whatsoever. It would set the stage for mass genocide. 
Hundreds of thousands of people would be killed and there 
would be an escalating conflict.
<P>
	It is very important to understand that this whole area is a 
tinderbox. The escalating conflict would involve other countries 
such as Russia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Albania, Italy and Germany. I 
do not think Canadian people would tolerate it.
<P>
	At this time I would like to hearken back to the holocaust 
memorials we see every year and our response to them. As we 
view the horrible footage of Nazi atrocities the world commits 
naively to say never again. Tragically we may say this and 
believe it but clearly our heads are stuck in the sand for we have 
allowed the situation to continue in other countries over the 
years such as Cambodia, Iraq, Burundi, Sudan and Ethiopia, to  
name just a few. Bosnia represents an opportunity to say never 
again and to do something about it.
<P>
	The soldiers are fighting these dirty little civil wars, but the 
greatest penalty to pay are the penalties that are paid by the 
civilians. I can say from personal experience that the penalties 
are paid by the children, the infirm and the aged. Those are the 
people who are subjected to the brunt of it.
<P>
	As a physician and surgeon I worked in Africa and treated 
people who had suffered under a bloody civil war. I can say I 
have seen the effects of gunshot wounds, people who were 
chopped up with machetes, victims of torture and gang rape, 
children and teenagers with their arms and legs blown off, and 
the death, social destruction and dislocation that tear apart the 
very fabric of a country often forever. Once we have seen it we 
are compelled to do something about it. We cannot turn our 
backs on it.
<P>
	What I have heard is that our soldiers feel the same way. It was 
perhaps best put most eloquently by a commander of our United 
Nations forces who said that there was a tremendous feeling of 
satisfaction when a young man or young woman came home and 
was able to say: ``I helped keep this peace. I helped save lives. I 
helped people in distress. I helped people who are much worse 
off than I am''. It raises the morale of individuals and 
collectively contributes to the well being of Canadian forces at 
large.
<P>
	Apart from the purely altruistic reasons of continuing these 
humanitarian efforts there are some very concrete reasons why 
we should get involved in this venture. By having a leadership 
role in these multinational peacekeeping efforts, Canada raises 
its profile, strengthens its positions and gives us leverage across 
a broad range of diplomatic endeavours.
<P>
<B>(1930 ) </B>
<P>
	My philosophy is that we should get involved in these efforts 
earlier. In that way we can often obviate these situations, not 
always but sometimes. Bosnia is a case in point. The writing was 
on the wall in 1987.
<P>
	I would summarize by suggesting the following. First, we 
should continue to provide humanitarian aid and not pull out of 
this endeavour. Remember we are there for the innocent 
civilians and not the combatants. This is another important point 
to remember. Many of the fighters and their leaders would like 
us to be out of this conflict so they can continue to increase the 
pace of the battle, increase the brutality and the killings. If we 
ask the civilians whether they want us there, they will tell us yes 
they do because we are often the difference between life and 
death for them.
<P>
	Second, do not use air strikes unless we need to protect our 
own troops.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="342"> 342 </A></B>
<P>
	Third, we need to strengthen the sanctions against the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia, including the freezing of state assets 
and additional trade restrictions. I would go so far as to say 
complete isolation of the republic, but I would also engage in 
trade embargoes and sanctions against any other state that 
refuses to enter into these peace talks in a legitimate and 
determined fashion. Bring them to the table.
<P>
	Fourth, penalize countries which break the embargo that 
exists with economic and financial penalties. They are being 
broken now. I suggest we get on them collectively and do 
something about it.
<P>
	Fifth, continue with diplomatic efforts and let us play 
diplomatic hardball with these people with the aforementioned 
sanctions. I would go so far as threatening them with freezing 
their assets long after this resolution comes about, if they do not 
come to the table now.
<P>
	Sixth, I would demand immediate guarantees for the safe 
movement of humanitarian aid by UN forces throughout Bosnia.
<P>
	Seventh, create more safe zones where appropriate.
<P>
	Eighth, continue with the war crimes tribunal under UN 
auspices which would hold accountable those individuals 
responsible for the atrocities that we have seen. I feel that the 
credibility of international humanitarian law demands a 
successful conclusion to this endeavour, for if we do not do it the 
failure of this process will exist. If we do continue, it will act as 
a deterrent in the future.
<P>
	Finally, I would strongly suggest to the government and in 
fact plead with it to continue our humanitarian involvement 
under the UN auspices for the reasons that I have mentioned 
before. In fact I can probably summarize by saying if you do not 
do it now, you pay me now or you pay me later. That is what is 
going to happen.
<P>
	I would like to make a personal plea for two brief things in 
which I think Canada should take a leadership role. First, 
Canada should act in a leadership role in banning the 
manufacture and distribution of anti-personnel devices. These 
devices from Hades have but one function and that is to maim 
and not kill civilians. We have seen them used with horrific 
results in Cambodia and other countries. Even when these 
conflicts are resolved the country is hamstrung. The people 
cannot move anywhere. They cannot move any goods and 
services because of these anti-personnel devices. They are truly 
horrific.
<P>
	My second point ties into what I said before. We need to look 
in the future for potential conflicts. One I would bring to the 
attention of everyone is the Republic of South Africa. It is a 
tinder box and going into its elections in April is a very sensitive 
time. I would suggest that the United Nations consider bringing 
in an interim observation force to ensure that the elections go 
ahead in a fair and unbiased fashion. If these elections are  
perceived as being unfair and rigged, then it could lead to a 
bloody civil war.
<P>
	I believe my time is up and I thank you for you attention, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is what 
happens when I get down on the list and it is a shorter debate 
than it really should be.
<P>
	I want to comment on an excellent speech by the member for 
Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca. I think the personal experience that 
he has brought to the debate says a lot. A lot of us can get up and 
make comments about what we think is happening and how we 
see resolutions. Obviously from his experience in Africa he has 
seen it firsthand and knows the devastation that is certainly 
being wrought as we speak in places like Bosnia.
<P>
<B>(1935 ) </B>
<P>
	He mentioned a number of very interesting alternatives. I am 
one of those people who believes that Canada, wherever 
possible-I underline wherever possible-should continue its 
humanitarian relief efforts such as peacekeeping in Bosnia. I 
also believe that there may be a problem in that the United 
Nations unwittingly may have put our troops at greater risk by 
having so many resolutions on which they obviously are not 
going to follow through.
<P>
	Since the member has come up with some very good 
recommendations, does he believe that things like greater and 
enforced sanctions against Serbia and some of the other 
nation-states to try to bring them to the table should be a 
prerequisite that is put forward by Canada? This would have to 
be met by the world body before we would give them basically 
carte blanche that our peacekeeping troops would continue 
under their current mandate.
<P>
	In short, does he think Canada can play a greater role given 
that we are renowned world peacekeepers? People do want us 
there. We are serving a very good humanitarian purpose. Should 
we be able to lever that at the United Nations to try to force it to 
take some of the actions that the hon. member has just 
mentioned?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, if we 
are going to make conditions upon our humanitarian aid efforts 
then we had better be ready to back them up with some action.
<P>
	As I said before in my speech, my personal feeling on the 
matter is that if the stick we are going to use is the withdrawal of 
our humanitarian aid efforts, I disagree with that. We are 
obligated to continue with humanitarian aid efforts and not to do 
that would only involve an ever expanding war in the area with 
the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives. I do not think we 
should use that suggestion as a stick. Rather we should use what 
leverage we have gained over the years to convince the other 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="343"> 343 </A></B>
<P>
countries involved in this endeavour to side with us in 
strengthening the sanctions.
<P>
	For those countries that are not involved in the endeavour, we 
have trade and other agreements with them that we can use as a 
stick to make them do what we say in terms of stopping illegal 
export of arms, fuel and weapons to the warring side. There are 
alternatives that we need to use but I do not think we should use 
it as a stick in the UN.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I compliment the hon. member 
for an excellent speech.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I am 
surprised to see two Liberal members in a row speak in response 
to the speech of the member from the Reform Party, when two 
members from the Bloc Quebecois had risen.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member is absolutely right. 
The Chair failed to recognize the member from the Bloc 
Quebecois before the member from the Liberal Party. I 
understand the situation clearly. So, I will give the floor very 
briefly to the parliamentary secretary and then recognize the 
member from the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Flis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief. I draw the attention 
of everyone in this House to the fact that I have asked the 
parliamentary Library to do research into this whole topic.
<P>
	Mr. Vincent Rigby, Political and Social Affairs Division, did 
put out a paper called ``Bosnia-Hercegovina: The International 
Response''. It is available in our parliamentary Library if 
anyone is interested.
<P>
	Mr. Rigby mentions that Bosnia has demonstrated that the 
world's structures are not prepared to deal with the type of 
violent, ethnic nationalism that is rapidly becoming endemic in 
the post cold world war. The nation-state may no longer be the 
basic unit of international politics. Conflict within states rather 
than between them has become the new threat to international 
security.
<P>
	Because of his knowledge, I wonder if the hon. member would 
comment on that. Is it a new fact that we are dealing with now? 
Can we look forward to such threats in the future, internal 
conflicts rather than state-to-state conflicts?
<P>
<B>(1940 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I remind the member, please try to 
brief as you have someone else waiting to ask you a question as 
well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> I understand, Mr. 
Speaker. I thank the member for a very intelligent question. It is 
a very far-reaching one.
<P>
	The world, in my estimation, is breaking up into tinier and 
tinier nation-states. Areas within countries are now defining 
themselves within the context of a certain ethnic group. That is 
tragic because they are not practising big <I>T</I> tolerance. That is 
what is occurring in the world today. We see it in many areas. We 
see it in Afghanistan, Cambodia. We see it in Bosnia and in fact 
in South Africa. It is going to happen time and time again.
<P>
	One of the lessons we have to learn through this is that we are 
going to be faced with these situations in the future time and 
time again as areas in countries start breaking down to the 
smallest sub-groups. We had better have a plan to deal with 
them.
<P>
	As I brought up in my speech, we have to get into these 
situations early and prophylactically. The United Nations did a 
very good job in Macedonia and has done a very good job in 
preventing the war from escalating there.
<P>
	I hope we can collectively address the particular issue that the 
member mentioned because we are going to have to make a plan. 
We are going to be faced with it more and more in the future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you. I 
hope that you will give me enough time to ask my question.
<P>
	I listened with great interest to the hon. member's comments 
concerning Canada's participation in UN peacekeeping 
missions. Even though I do not have his experience, I share a lot 
of his concerns regarding the safety of Canadian peacekeepers.
<P>
	Canadian troops are, of course, going through a difficult time. 
But their well-known professionalism enables them to 
overcome these difficulties and accomplish their mission in a 
very satisfactory fashion. Finally, the very positive results of 
their humanitarian aid efforts and of their strategic operations to 
contain the conflict within the current borders have been pointed 
out on several occasions today.
<P>
	I would like to remind you that 80 per cent of the members of 
the 12th Armoured Regiment of Canada and the Mechanized 
Batallion of the Royal 22e Régiment from Valcartier come from 
Quebec, including many young people named Bergeron, Bigras, 
Simard, Gagnon, Dugas and so on from the 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region. We can all be proud of the 
excellent job done by our soldiers. In this regard, I would ask the 
hon. member who spoke before me if he thinks that the 
withdrawal of troops by Canada, especially if it were done 
unilaterally, would bring our allies to question the firmness and 
durability of our commitments?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is beautiful.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="344"> 344 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think it would tell the rest of the world that our involvement in 
these conflicts, to some extent, would not be as much as we 
could have done.
<P>
	As I said before, if we remove ourselves from this conflict 
then the other member states that are engaging in the UN 
protective forces UNPROFOR are also going to move away 
from it and leave the people tragically to their own devices.
<P>
	The important point I would like to make, as I said before, is 
that the people we are talking to tend to be the leaders of the 
fighting groups and they do not necessarily represent the people 
on the ground. That is a very important point to remember. The 
people who are paying the price are the people on the ground, the 
innocent civilians. We are not talking to them. We are talking to 
the wrong people, in a sense.
<P>
<B>(1945 ) </B>
<P>
	Although the Canadian people and our armed forces have 
done an admirable job, and nobody can criticize them for the 
work that they did, even if they do pull out for whatever reason, I 
think it will be a personal tragedy. The other nation states that do 
follow us in this endeavour will also tragically pull out too.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I think this is the longest record we 
will see in this Parliament for questions during a five minute 
period. I hate to think of how much time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate you first all on your appointment as Deputy 
Speaker. You are somebody who knows Parliament and its 
history and who loves the institution. You will bring integrity, 
good judgment and compassion to your office. I congratulate 
you.
<P>
	It is a matter of some sadness to me to speak on this debate. I 
have had the privilege of lecturing to the University of Belgrade, 
the Serbian Academy and to the University of Zagreb in earlier 
happy years when that was one country. It is one ethnic 
community but the cultures are widely different. Three hundred 
years under the Austro-Hungarian Empire make the lovely city 
of Zagreb as it was into an Austrian city with the architecture, 
the gardens, the parks, whereas Belgrade looks another 
direction.
<P>
	The original era perhaps, the political era, was joining these 
disparate communities together in 1919. It was done by 
consensus. The Croat and Slovanian leaders of the period feared 
rightly that without a solution of that sort they would be given 
over to Italy. The whole Illyrian coast had been promised to Italy 
under the secret treaties of 1915 if it deserted the German 
alliance and joined the western powers as it did. So you had a 
basis for a union that was consummated in one of the 
Versailles-dependent treaties, the treaty of St. 
Germain-en-Laye which I will have occasion to refer to in a 
moment.
<P>
	I do raise the issue though that here I think we have a political 
problem that, reversing Clausewitz, cannot be resolved by 
military means.
<P>
	One of the problems here is that Bosnia-Hercegovina was not 
a situation ripe for solution by classic peacekeeping methods as 
devised by Lester Pearson. Peacekeeping is not mentioned as 
such in the charter. It is a gloss on it. When Mr. Pearson devised 
the concept it was based firmly on chapter 6 of the charter and 
not on chapter 7. What has happened basically in the 
Bosnia-Hercegovina situation is that we have escalated into a 
peacemaking situation which invokes another section of the 
charter, chapter 7, which does authorize the recourse to armed 
force but which the precedents indicate clearly that unless there 
is a consensus as to the political goals to be achieved by the 
military intervention then the situation is doomed to failure.
<P>
	I think the problem for Canada, in some respects a tragedy for 
our military forces who are not responsible for that-they carry 
out the orders-is that personnel developed and trained for 
peacekeeping have been used for peacemaking. They neither 
have the military equipment available nor the sensitive type of 
political training that is required to carry out even peacemaking 
missions today.
<P>
	In a pathological sense I suppose Somalia is the perfect 
example of how peacekeeping transforms surreptitiously into 
peacemaking and fails. I echo the sentiments of the member on 
the other side who raised the issue of the soldiers on court 
martial for the carrying out of orders as they saw it in Somalia 
when clearly the political intelligence was lacking.
<P>
	We have to consider in terms of peacemaking and 
peacekeeping, the two which are now joined together, the roles 
and missions Canada is capable of performing. One thing that is 
very clear is that it is quite impossible to be represented in too 
many places at one time.
<P>
<B>(1950 ) </B>
<P>
	If we are going to be in Somalia and in Cyprus, we cannot be 
in Bosnia-Hercegovina and do the job rightly. So one of the 
things our committee on military affairs will have to consider is 
a more prudent economy in disposition of our forces and 
deciding the priority areas. This is something that in a period of 
budgetary restraint has to be considered very seriously.
<P>
	My main thesis though is that Bosnia-Hercegovina represents 
an attempt to resolve by military means something that should 
have been resolved by political means. There was a time when 
Yugoslavia was breaking up. The problem of state succession in 
eastern Europe should have been foreseen and provided for in 
advance but was not any more than one had provided for the 
succession with the collapse of the Soviet empire and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="345"> 345 </A></B>
<P>
movement to a more liberal Russia. It was not foreseen. It was 
not provided for.
<P>
	What one has had, and this explains the muddiness of the 
decisions from the United Nations as carried out by the main 
powers that must assume the responsibility for them, is a 
division of attitude among western foreign ministries. In fact, 
looking back one is reminded of divisions between western 
foreign ministries at the time of the Russo-Turkish war in 
1877-78, at the time of the two Balkan wars, at the time indeed 
of World War I. You see the divisions between the Quai d'Orsay 
and the Wilhelmstrasse of those periods replicated in a milder 
form perhaps but still in the consequence it is the same in 
divisions as to the policy to be applied in Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
We are in the middle of that and that is a problem.
<P>
	There have been criticisms made of one of the European 
foreign ministries that it precipitated the problem by premature 
recognition of post-succession Yugoslav states Slovenia and 
Croatia. I do not accept that criticism in relation to Slovenia and 
Croatia. They did have a separate historical existence as units of 
the Austro-Hungarian empire. Their frontiers are reasonably 
clearly defined under the doctrine of uti possidetis which is 
recognized in international law.
<P>
	One has many more concerns about Bosnia-Hercegovina 
which did not really exist until 1878 and which always has had a 
high element of artificiality about it. I think it was an error to 
recognize Bosnia-Hercegovina and to admit it to the United 
Nations above all without taking the trouble to define what 
status it should have, what its frontiers would be, what its 
relations with its neighbours should be. I think this does come 
within the category of premature recognition and the political 
consequences with this.
<P>
	The United Nations efforts through the Vance-Owen plan, 
noble but politically and may one say constitutionally and 
legally very naive predictably would end in failure.
<P>
	I would wonder why our government committing forces to 
Bosnia-Hercegovina did not perhaps raise these issues of the 
necessity of a political settlement. Is the time for diplomacy 
past? Not in the least. It has not really been tried. Yugoslavia 
was put together in 1919 as a consensual union of the kingdom 
as it was called of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes by an 
international conference of which Canada was a part. We signed 
the treaty of St. Germain. It was our second international act and 
we are legal party to it.
<P>
	I suggested in an earlier pre-parliamentary capacity as a 
private citizen, as an expert witness deposing before the United 
States Congress committee on foreign affairs, the House of 
Representatives, that the machinery of the treaty of St. 
Germain-en-Laye be revived. It is a still extant treaty. One 
needed a global view of the Balkans. One cannot isolate 
Bosnia-Hercegovina from the fate of other areas, including the 
former Yugoslav republic that calls itself Macedonia but 
perhaps should be called the republic of Skopje.
<P>
	Peace in the Balkans as a whole is dependent on rational 
solutions in this area as in any other area. The failure was to 
recognize that post-succession Yugoslavia required a larger 
political consensus than Bosnia alone before you could safely 
and decently send military forces into it.
<P>
	Therefore, I would have some criticism for our own 
governments in going in too enthusiastically and not asking the 
questions that European foreign ministries should have asked: 
Where they wanted to go and what their purpose was and which 
are present certainly in other fora such as the CSCE, NATO and 
the European community.
<P>
<B>(1955 ) </B>
<P>
	It is not too late for a Canadian initiative maintaining our 
forces in Yugoslavia and Bosnia until the limit but saying: 
``Look, a political settlement should come''. Is it ripe? There is 
a time when parties to a conflict wear themselves out. 
Exhaustion takes over and that is when diplomacy takes over. 
There are some indications that that could be near.
<P>
	In any case simply to maintain forces without pushing for a 
larger political solution, without telling the European 
Community countries: ``Look, you have to get your act together. 
You have to give some signals of what you want to do''. We 
cannot solve the Bosnia problem without solving the problem in 
Skopje, without guaranteeing the security of territorial frontiers 
without the Balkans. If we do not do this, we are back to 1878 
and 1913-14. Santayana said that if you do not study history, 
then you make all the errors again. What is emerging is a sorry 
exercise in international diplomacy.
<P>
	I think the big Canadian exercise is steering back to the 
United Nations the necessity for a larger political consensus, a 
larger conference of which if we follow the treaty of St. Germain 
route, we will be a part and we can speak out on this.
<P>
	I do not think we can solve Bosnia without solving the other 
problems. Is it to be partitioned? If it is to be partitioned the 
frontiers will have to be defined. The treaty of St. Germain 
provides for the compulsory jurisdiction of the international 
court in these matters. It has the advantage in frontier definition 
of making an ally of time.
<P>
	Peace is necessary. We have a basis for a settlement that will 
be viable and it is better then than casting blame on military 
forces. I think the military forces are not to blame and we have 
performed well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate the hon. member for 
Vancouver Quadra on his excellent presentation. If we had heard 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="346"> 346 </A></B>
<P>
such an analysis before intervening in the former Yugoslavia, 
our approach might have been better planned.
<P>
	However, the same cannot be said of our Prime Minister who, 
during his trip to Europe, made public comments about the 
advisability of withdrawing our troops from Europe. At the local 
level, in ridings like mine where some 15 young servicemen and 
women are participating in the peacekeeping effort in Bosnia, 
his statement made people hope for a swifter return of their sons 
and daughters but fear for their safety. On the national and 
international level, it prompted everyone to question the 
firmness of the Canadian position.
<P>
	In my opinion, that move marked a departure from the 
Canadian diplomatic tradition, which helped create Canada's 
image as a peacekeeping nation. That kind of gesture would also 
prevent us from learning lessons from the Yugoslavian crisis in 
order to better react to such conflicts in the future.
<P>
	I think we should search for comprehensive solutions like 
those put forward by the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra. I 
may even suggest a few myself, such as the creation of a 
multinational force that could deal with that kind of situation in 
a permanent fashion with a crisis centre, thus avoiding a 
piecemeal approach.
<P>
	Many of the soldiers deployed overseas in these situations are 
members of the reserves. The Senate committee on foreign 
affairs studying the issue was wondering whether the training 
given to reservists, which tends to focus on offensive actions, 
qualifies them to intervene in such operations.
<P>
<B>(2000) </B>
<P>
	It is important, perhaps strategically, for Canada to establish a 
mission specialized in logistics, dealing especially with 
transportation, equipment, everything that facilitates the 
military operation itself. It is in fact an area where we have 
acquired considerable expertise.
<P>
	I also learned in today's debate that the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs regularly tables clear and detailed reports on our 
involvement in international missions. That seems very 
appropriate to me.
<P>
	Finally, as the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra showed us 
in his presentation, we must educate our soldiers about the 
history, culture and traditions of the countries where they must 
intervene. The peacekeepers deployed in Somalia, not 
necessarily the Canadians, were clearly in need of such training. 
It is important for our peacekeepers to know what they are 
getting into.
<P>
	Those were the comments I wished to make on the speech 
delivered by the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra. I would 
have liked him to elaborate a bit further on the kind of solution 
that could be applied in the former Yugoslavia with its complex 
ethnic mix. If possible, I would like him to tell us the kind of 
solution he envisions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, those are excellent 
suggestions.
<P>
	The multinational force is closer to the letter of the charter, 
section 43, chapter 7. Unfortunately, this excellent suggestion is 
not often followed by the United Nations.
<P>
	Clearly, political training for our soldiers should be 
recommended to the Minister of National Defence. It is the lack 
of political sophistication that really hampered their 
effectiveness. It would be an excellent suggestion to make to our 
defence minister.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport):</B> Mr. Speaker, as you will 
probably know, Bosnia was a beautiful part of the world, rich 
with culture, endowed with natural resources, producer of 
excellent wines, abundant with historical sights, the meeting 
place of Christian and Muslim architecture where minarets and 
church towers punctuated the skyline of cities, towns and 
villages.
<P>
	Today that Bosnia no longer exists. Its civilian population 
lives in terror, famine and mourning.
<P>
	Today in this Chamber we have been asked by the government 
to think about Canada's role as a peacekeeper and in particular 
about Canada's role in Bosnia. Here are my thoughts on our role 
in Bosnia.
<P>
	It seems to me that the Government of Canada should 
continue the role of our armed forces in Bosnia while continuing 
to press for a political solution in Geneva.
<P>
	Why do I say that? I say it for a number of reasons. Canadian 
troops in Bosnia these days are providing humanitarian relief. 
They are offering the most civilized role any military force can 
provide. They are ensuring survival and life protection, quite in 
contrast with the conventional role played by the military 
throughout centuries.
<P>
	The withdrawal of our Canadian troops from Bosnia would 
mean in essence abandoning the civilian population to its fate of 
starvation and possibly death. Our withdrawal would mean that 
other nations whose troops are part of the United Nations effort 
in the former Yugoslavia may follow our example if we were to 
withdraw. Women, children and the elderly would run the risk of 
being wiped out or becoming another wave of refugees seeking a 
homeland elsewhere. Withdrawal would mean creating a crisis 
in adjacent regions. International security could be put in 
serious danger in the Balkans.
<P>
<B>(2005 ) </B>
<P>
	From the relatively contained problem in Bosnia, the danger 
of spreading is high with very serious security implications and 
even the possibility of laying the foundations for another world 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="347"> 347 </A></B>
<P>
war conflict. The withdrawal would mean a victory for the 
bullies who are pursuing the policy of ethnic cleansing, an 
abhorrent, barbaric, repulsive, blood-chilling concept which 
the  world community must continue to reject and deplore 
vigorously.
<P>
	All Canadians abhor the notion of ethnic cleansing. We are 
strong believers in human rights. We promote human rights at 
home and abroad at every international forum. In Bosnia the 
human rights of people who have lived there for centuries have 
been trampled upon. The Government of Canada should not lead 
Canada into a retreat but rather continue to protect innocent 
people in Bosnia through the United Nations and with the help of 
like-minded nations also involved there.
<P>
	These are the reasons why I would sincerely hope that the 
Government of Canada will continue maintaining its present 
role, the fine and unique role that our troops are performing 
these days in certain parts of Bosnia.
<P>
	During this debate a number of arguments have been 
advanced in favour of withdrawal. I will mention a few but they 
are not very compelling. Some have said: ``Oh well, this is a 
civil war. There is no reason for any of us to be there''. This is an 
ethnic war. Bosnia as a state, as a cohesive society, hardly exists 
any more.
<P>
	Then there are those who have said that the situation has 
reached a point where air attacks are the only answer. However, 
what happens after the air strike? What does the world 
community do after it has bombed? Has that been thought 
through as to the consequences of such a measure which 
basically would affect the civilian population? We are not 
talking here of large armies concentrated in visible and easily 
targeted points. We are talking about very interspersed forces 
that are very difficult to focus on and reach.
<P>
	There are also those who have said that this is too large a 
financial burden. Well, can you imagine Canada saying to the 
world community, to France, the United Kingdom, the 
Scandinavians, the Netherlands and others, that we find this role 
too expensive for Canada, a nation with the reputation that we 
have of wealth, abundance and the capacity to be generously 
available to the world community? What a sham that would be.
<P>
	There are those who have said that we should withdraw our 
troops from Croatia for six months. What would happen to the 
Bosnian population during those six months? Has that question 
been explored?
<P>
	Then there are those who have said there is no peace to keep.
<P>
<B>(2010 ) </B>
<P>
	Evidently that is a point that one has to take into account 
because we are not at that point yet. Therefore the answer is true. 
There is no peace to keep at the present time, but there are tens of 
thousands of lives that can be saved. I rest my case on those 
considerations.

	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to commend the hon. member who just spoke for his clear and 
precise position on maintaining the troops now in Bosnia. I 
share his concerns when he asks if we can simply abandon a 
civilian population to people who want to carry out ethnic 
cleansing, as he said.
<P>
	He talked about civil defence, but I would like to come back to 
the last part of his speech when he spoke of the financial burden. 
Yes, some people do wonder if we can still afford such a peace 
force. There is that strain of opinion, that questioning. In his 
argument, he did not point out that we could perhaps completely 
reorganize our armed forces so that a section of them, as the 
speaker before him said, would be specifically trained to keep 
peace and also restore peace. For this, perhaps an exhaustive 
study should be done on all the equipment we are using. Maybe 
the equipment we use on such missions could be more narrowly 
focused and specialized since the missions are increasingly 
difficult. For example, my colleague spoke just now about 
logistics; maybe we could become logistics specialists and let 
other countries provide other kinds of support, such as medical 
support.
<P>
	For that, perhaps our government and all political parties 
should sit down around a table and define the positions or needs 
or specializations for these peace missions. The money saved by 
specializing could enable us to continue our peace missions 
without taking more from our fellow citizens. On this point, I 
would like the hon. member to tell me if he could agree with that 
line of thinking, and I know that he has followed peace missions 
for a long time. He is not afraid to say the exact opposite of the 
Prime Minister about maintaining peace missions. He definitely 
thinks that cannot be questioned. But perhaps to reassure our 
fellow citizens, could we consider together the possibility of 
reducing some of our military expenditures through 
specialization, as a way to keep our peace missions without 
raising taxes? I ask his opinion on this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not an expert in military 
logistics and expenditures. I am only a politician. I thank the 
hon. member for Richelieu for his question, but I am not in a 
position to add anything to what I said before.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, since I am 
addressing this House for the first time outside question period, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="348"> 348 </A></B>
<P>
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the voters of my 
riding of Témiscamingue for have trusted me enough to send to 
Ottawa the member who will come to be known as the youngest 
one elected to serve in this Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> Like several of my colleagues, I too have 
members of the Canadian forces living in my riding, including 
some of those presently taking in part in peacekeeping 
operations in Bosnia. I have listened carefully to the hon. 
member for Davenport and the hon. member for Vancouver 
Quadra who spoke before him. Does the member for Davenport 
agree that we should be more actively involved in conflict 
resolution at the political level, as his colleague from Vancouver 
Quadra seemed to indicate, or does he think it would be better 
for Canada not get involved at that level, but simply to maintain 
peacekeeping forces in Bosnia?
<P>
<B>(2015) </B>
<P>
	Basically, what I want to know is should we play a major role 
in terms of resolving the conflict, beyond military action?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the hon. 
member for Témiscamingue for his question. My impression is 
that Canada already plays a good role, a major role as a nation 27 
million strong which is highly respected around the world. I 
think that the Liberal government will do a good job 
representing the aspirations and hopes for peace that all 
Canadians share from coast to coast.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, the House 
has been debating Canada's role in UN peacekeeping operations 
for a number of hours now. Obviously, it is an important 
question and there are many aspects to consider.
<P>
	Of course I want to focus on the role and mission of our 
peacekeeping forces, but I would also like to take a closer look 
at their presence in Bosnia.
<P>
	Since the mid-1950s, our peacekeepers have earned a 
reputation for Canada as a very humanitarian nation. You will 
recall that it was on the initiative of the former prime minister, 
the Right Hon. Lester B. Pearson, that Canadian peacekeepers, 
working under the auspices of the United Nations, undertook 
their very first peacekeeping mission.
<P>
	Peacekeeping has since become the cornerstone of Canadian 
diplomacy. Many other countries have also patterned 
themselves on us when sending peacekeepers on missions 
throughout the world.
<P>
	Canada's decision to make a name for itself on the world 
scene as a peaceful, humanitarian country has earned it a 
reputation which generally means that we are greeted as friends 
when we travel abroad.
<P>
	Over the years, Canada has therefore maintained a tradition 
wherein it holds an altruistic view, namely a view of 
peacekeepers as carriers of the humanitarian torch and 
missionaries of peace. Quebecers and indeed all Canadians are 
proud, and justifiably so, of having made a major contribution to 
peacekeeping in the world.
<P>
	I would mention that the tradition of the peacekeepers reflects 
a fundamental value held by the people of Quebec and of 
Canada. We are a peace-loving people, imbued with a keen 
sense of tolerance and democracy. We value human life a great 
deal and we are sensitive to human suffering. It is very natural 
for us to want to help those in need.
<P>
	I know this House would agree that the role of our 
peacekeepers in maintaining peace and alleviating human 
suffering has reflected the very profound, historic values of 
Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	The war in Bosnia has blurred the traditional role of our 
peacekeepers. They cannot keep the peace when there is no 
peace to keep. Whereas in the past our peacekeepers were called 
upon to maintain a brokered peace, this time, they find 
themselves in the midst of a conflict between factions which 
seem to see no advantage in settling their dispute. So, what are 
our peacekeepers doing in such a nightmare?
<P>
<B>(2020) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This question interests me for more than one reason. Indeed, 
approximately 80 per cent of all Canadian and Quebec soldiers 
actually deployed in Bosnia do come from the Valcartier CFB 
which is home base of the French speaking 22nd Royal 
Regiment part of which is in my riding of Portneuf just west of 
Quebec City.
<P>
	Those almost 2,000 soldiers lived either on the base or in one 
of the surrounding areas. I personally know families that have a 
parent actually in Bosnia. I am therefore even more sensitive to 
their anguish.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As I was saying, I take a particularly interest in this issue, 
especially since many of these soldiers are from my riding. I 
personally know families who have a relative in Bosnia, and I 
truly share their fear. I also know that these families, because 
they correspond with their relative, are aware of the importance 
of the humanitarian aid provided by our peacekeepers in Bosnia.
<P>
	It is therefore important that this House correctly define the 
rationale for our involvement in Bosnia and in other 
international peacekeeping operations. We must ask ourselves 
the true question about our peacekeepers in Bosnia, namely: 
what is their mandate? It is certainly not the traditional one of 
helping to maintain peace, because the factions there are still 
engaged in all-out war.
<P>
	So then what is their mission? Do we expect our peacekeepers 
to bring peace to the area? Mr. Speaker, even if this were what is 
asked of them, how could they possibly bring a peace which the 
warring factions have currently no use for?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="349"> 349 </A></B>
<P>
	Should we consider letting our troops use force to take control 
of the country and to subjugate the belligerents? Should our 
troops use violence for humanitarian reasons? Should they 
occupy the area to impose our peace? No, because to do so would 
be to forget the important lessons of history, namely that no 
occupation force can be a substitute for an agreement truly 
recognized by the parties involved.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Furthermore, if this government would authorize our troops 
to make use of force to impose reason onto the fighting factions, 
we would depart dramatically with our pacifist traditions that 
honour Canada and that are so dear to the people from Quebec as 
to those from all provinces I am sure.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	What is the mandate of our troops in Bosnia? Unfortunately, 
this House does not have a magic solution to solve the problem 
in Bosnia and to improve the prospects of the people there. 
However, this House can and must define the mandate of our 
peacekeepers in Bosnia. We owe it to our troops stationed over 
there, to their families waiting here, to Quebecers and 
Canadians, and to the international community.
<P>
	So what is the mandate of our troops in Bosnia? Mr. Speaker, 
while reflecting on this issue, I came across a dilemma, like 
many other members who have thought about this issue and have 
expressed their views here today. Today, by acting as a buffer 
between the warring factions, are the United Nations not 
protecting the belligerents from the consequences of their acts? 
In other words, does the peacekeepers' presence unduly and 
unnecessarily prolong the agony of those people? Would it not 
be better to have the peacekeepers withdraw from the area, 
leaving the belligerents alone to face the atrocities and the 
consequences of their acts? Would our absence perhaps more 
conducive to a resolution of this conflict?
<P>
<B>(2025) </B>
<P>
	One thing is certain: far from being observers without 
influence in this military and political game of chess, UN troops 
have an impact on the situation through the direct and important 
role they play.
<P>
	What we must do is consider whether the process of resolving 
the conflict is helped by the presence of our peacekeepers. Is 
their presence an asset or a liability?
<P>
	I think the debate should focus on a third dimension which I 
will discuss now. Consider the results obtained so far. Without 
peacekeepers the conflict would very likely have spread to the 
entire region of Eastern Europe, like a replay of World War I. 
However, this conflict has not only been contained but has 
gradually been confined to a very limited area. The presence of 
the peacekeepers has given diplomacy and peace a chance to 
make some progress, bit by bit.
<P>
	But there is more. The presence of the peacekeepers has 
afforded civilian populations real protection in a terrible war 
and alleviated their suffering significantly. This was not done 
without serious difficulty. Convoys of food and medicine were 
held up, supplies diverted to the black market, soldiers 
threatened by belligerents and some soldiers, unfortunately, 
were killed. On the other hand, hundreds of thousands of people 
received food and medical care and managed to survive.
<P>
	At this point I would like to share with you and with the 
members of this House what I was told recently by the wife of 
one of our soldiers who is now in Bosnia. This lady told me that 
her husband had been very moved by the terrible living 
conditions of the people over there. She told me how her 
husband took off his socks and gave them to a child who was 
walking barefoot in the snow. This was only a few days before 
Christmas. The public in Quebec and Canada is also worried 
about the cost of our operations in Bosnia.
<P>
	I did some research. I did some simple arithmetic, and I can 
assure you that the costs directly related to the presence of our 
soldiers in Bosnia represent only about 25 cents per month per 
person in Quebec and Canada, 25 cents, for an annual total of 
$120 million. Twenty-five cents per person per month. I think 
our fellow citizens can afford to contribute a quarter to help 
people in need.
<P>
	What is the role of our peacekeepers in a new world order? 
First of all, their role will certainly not be that of a global cop. 
That is out of the question, because it would be entirely 
counterproductive. Obviously, their role is no longer limited to 
peacekeeping in areas where the parties have decided to resolve 
their differences.
<P>
	We must consider a new role, a role for the twenty-first 
century. As nations struggle towards democracy, this new role 
would be to prevent conflicts from escalating and spreading, to 
protect and help civilian populations and to provide diplomatic 
efforts with a climate conducive to conflict resolution and 
durable peace.
<P>
<B>(2030) </B>
<P>
	The new role of Canada in this regard will be not only to 
participate in peacekeeping, something we are already doing, 
but to guarantee in the field, proactively and peacefully, 
protection and assistance to civilian populations in distress, 
while diplomats try to come up with a formula establishing 
peaceful relations between populations at war. The new role of 
Canada should not be limited to peacekeeping, it should also 
focus on peacebuilding and peacemaking.
<P>
	To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Canada should not withdraw from 
peacekeeping operations. Quebecers and Canadians of all 
provinces have a long tradition of peace, and our peacekeepers 
will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="350"> 350 </A></B>
<P>
not only be perfectly able to fulfil their redefined mission for the 
21st century, they will also do so knowing full well what is 
expected of them.
<P>
	Withdrawing from peacekeeping, withdrawing from Bosnia, 
would be repudiating one of our greatest traditions. It would 
also, given our reputation as a world leader in peacekeeping, set 
up a chain reaction among countries participating in 
peacekeeping operations with the United Nations. It would also 
mean condemning tens of thousands of men, women and 
children to suffering, torture, rape and death. This might also 
cause the conflict to escalate and spread to neighbouring areas.
<P>
	Canada has undertaken in Bosnia a difficult, but useful, 
humanitarian action. People in Quebec and Canada are not the 
type to quit a job they took on. On the contrary, we all strive to 
finish what we start, especially when the going gets tough. 
Quebecers and Canadians are not quitters.
<P>
	I would like to conclude by thanking personally, and on behalf 
of all my colleagues in this house I am sure, all our troops from 
Quebec and Canada who, day after day, put their life on the line 
while serving their fellow man, not only because this is the job 
we asked them to do, but also because they are noble-hearted 
men and women.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Berger (Saint-Henri-Westmount):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, I would like to congratulate the hon. 
member for Portneuf on his speech. It was all the more 
appreciated because the Valcartier base is in his riding. The 
personal testimony of soldiers and their families contributed 
very much to this debate.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member a question on his notion of 
what he called a new peacekeeping role for Canada. He talked 
about the need to protect people in distress. If I got it right, it all 
boils down to intervention on humanitarian grounds.
<P>
	Is that the new role he contemplates? Does he advocate 
intervention on humanitarian grounds only or does he want to 
take that further and include some diplomatic or negotiating 
role?
<P>
<B>(2035) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not in a position to define 
this new role for the House. However, I see humanitarian 
missions covering a number of aspects. One is protecting 
populations in distress. Gaining time is another consideration, 
by giving the factions a number of rules to observe, which will 
give diplomacy enough room, both literally and figuratively, to 
proceed with negotiations that one hopes will bear fruit, and 
they will, if the timing is right. So our objective should not be 
only to feed, care and protect. It should also include, and we see 
that today with our own peacekeepers, talking to the factions 
and creating a number of mini-agreements which over time will 
give our diplomats a chance to build on what has been achieved. 
I hope that answers the hon. member's question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, I much 
appreciated the excellent speech made by the hon. member for 
Portneuf. I had the privilege of being born in his riding, and in 
fact, I was born in Valcartier, so his riding is twice-blessed.
<P>
	The hon. member for Rivière-du-Loup mentioned a 
multilateral force formed by the UN that would ensure our 
troops would be better prepared for such operations.
<P>
	He also mentioned courses in history or even humanitarian 
aid for our soldiers, to prepare them for missions as complex as 
those in Bosnia, for instance. What are his thoughts on this 
suggestion which is also supported by the hon. member for 
Vancouver Quadra? Is this more or less in line with what he was 
trying to say?
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> I want to thank the hon. member who was 
born in Portneuf for his question.
<P>
	In fact, Canada is in an excellent position to play a leading 
role at the United Nations in organizing a multilateral force. We 
have the expertise, and we also have the recognition of the 
international community. It would be not merely sensible but 
also interesting and productive to go this route. I think the 
twenty-first century will give us a chance to make the words 
violence and war obsolete.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> I want to thank the hon. 
member for Portneuf for his remarks. I would like to say a few 
words about how our people would feel if Canada were to play a 
greater role in peacekeeping missions and in the training of 
soldiers for such missions.
<P>
	For the past few years, a rather lively debate has been taking 
place in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region on the 
possibility of locating a firing range in the area for the training 
of F-18 pilots. As you know, the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean 
region is home to CFB Bagotville, one of the three or four major 
strategic bases in Canada. By the way, this military base 
operates completely in French. One of the principal arguments 
advanced by those who oppose the plans for the firing range is 
that we can no longer afford to have the armed forces play a 
traditional role in Canada today. These people want to transform 
CFB Bagotville into a training base for UN peacekeeping 
missions. While their intentions may be good, there are many 
problems underlying this proposal. The fact remains, however, 
that the people in my region would be prepared to see Canadian 
and Quebec soldiers go out on peacekeeping missions and 
maybe even do a little more than that.
<P>
<B>(2040) </B>
<P>
	People do not like to see television images of civilians 
suffering, of bombings, deaths and other atrocities. When we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="351"> 351 </A></B>
<P>
look at the situation in some parts of the world where suffering is 
widespread, not just Bosnia but Somalia and elsewhere, I think 
it would not take much for our people to support a more active 
role by the UN in peacekeeping operations than has traditionally 
been the case.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first of all I wish to congratulate you and all the others in the 
House. That way I can simplify it. It has been mentioned many 
times over and over.
<P>
	I wish to take this opportunity as well to thank the voters of 
my riding of Saskatoon-Dundurn for electing me to this House 
of Commons. Saskatoon-Dundurn comprises a large part of the 
city of Saskatoon, a city that we affectionately call the pearl of 
the prairies. The electorate represents all strata of society and 
are a true mosaic of cultures, creeds, nationalities and religions. 
I am proud to represent them as their member of Parliament.
<P>
	The question that is before us today is obviously a very 
serious one. Canadian soldiers in Bosnia are in more than just a 
peacekeeping role. It has been mentioned many times over that 
they are in a war zone where they are neither aggressors nor 
combatants. This is a very difficult and extremely dangerous 
role.
<P>
	A country has crumbled because of religious and ethnic 
problems. The citizens of Bosnia have rejected the peaceful 
methods that Canadians have embraced for years of 
parliamentary debate. Instead they have embraced the gun and 
the bomb as their means of communication. As well, as the 
nation has crumbled the peace process sponsored by the 
European communities and the United Nations seems to have 
crumbled. It appears that the different leaders have lost control 
over their military leaders. This is shown by the fact that every 
time a truce has been drafted it is broken before the ink has dried 
on the document. The leaders who appear to be intoxicated with 
power show the problems of a quest for political power over the 
value of human life.
<P>
	However, it is not our job here today to name aggressors or to 
point fingers. Our primary question is the safety of Canadian 
military personnel stationed in the former Yugoslav republic 
and that is the only reason that we are here. It has become clear 
to many that a military solution to the situation in Bosnia is no 
longer feasible. What is needed now is a political solution. 
However, the quest for power and nation building seems to 
destroy all hope of achieving a political settlement without the 
intervention of the world community.
<P>
	We have seen the world community intervene at a number of 
different times. The European community peace negotiators, the 
Vance-Owen peace negotiations and the current negotiations in 
Geneva have all proved fruitless. Ceasefires are signed, 
ceasefires are broken. Peace plans show hope only to have one 
party walk away at the last moment. The situation seems bleak at 
present, bleak of ever reaching a political settlement.
<P>
<B>(2045 ) </B>
<P>
	We must be careful to balance this against the needs of the 
2.75 million people that the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees says depend on the humanitarian aid as their sole 
source of food. This is a weighty question.
<P>
	We must sit here to balance the lives of 1,800 Canadian 
personnel versus an estimated three million innocent citizens. 
However the problem does not stop there. It is estimated that 
once a peace agreement is signed, if one is ever signed, they will 
need two times the number of troops they have now in the former 
Yugoslav republic to monitor the peace accord and to disarm the 
belligerents.
<P>
	Therefore by staying, are we just getting ourselves into a 
project that will turn into another Cyprus where we were for 25 
to 30 years? I think the chances of a peace agreement at this time 
are slim.
<P>
	I wonder if it would make any difference if today we were 
speaking in the House had the situation a few weeks ago been 
one of guns being shot not over our soldiers' heads but at a lower 
position. If we had dead personnel would we be speaking any 
different today? I suggest we would be.
<P>
	I must join with the member for Moose Jaw-Lake Centre and 
say that we should withdraw for now and reassess our position.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been 
listening to the debate on Bosnia since 10 o'clock this morning. 
I have heard words like democracy, solidarity and peace. I think 
the fact that we welcomed Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide in our 
gallery yesterday heightened the awareness of every member of 
this House because, since this morning, the words democracy, 
solidarity and peace have popped up in practically every speech.
<P>
	After meeting with President Aristide, the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs talked about a ``man democratically elected by 
the population of Haiti''. Mr. Ouellet reiterated Canada's wish 
to see democracy restored in Haiti and President Aristide 
rapidly reinstated in his post. He said: ``Together we will go to 
the Security Council; it is a concrete step we must take to restore 
democracy.''
<P>
	Democracy, solidarity and peace-words that have been 
heard all day and in practically every speech made by members 
of this House-must be preserved in Yugoslavia, Haiti, Bosnia 
and Canada. These great democratic principles must guide 
today's statements and tomorrow's actions.
<P>
<B>(2050) </B>
<P>
	In closing, we, as members of this House, will have to take a 
position as soon as possible because the people in Bosnia and 
our fellow citizens in Quebec and Canada are awaiting our 
decision. I am convinced that our decision will reassure Cana-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="352"> 352 </A></B>
<P>
dians, who expect this House to make a decision based on 
democracy and solidarity.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does the hon. member for 
Saskatoon-Dundurn wish to respond?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Mr. Speaker, because that was not a question but 
primarily a comment by the hon. member I have nothing further 
to add.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
comment and a question.
<P>
	I am somewhat surprised by the remarks the hon. member has 
made, especially when he talked about withdrawing from 
Bosnia, while several of his colleagues have told us that 
withdrawing would mean abandoning the people, who would 
then starve. It would also cause a crisis in neighbouring regions, 
with everything that entails. The aggressors would have won and 
it would mean rape and famine for an entire population.
<P>
	Am I to understand that the member who just spoke will not 
support in his caucus a government position which should be 
first to ensure that Canadian troops are safe and second to help 
Canada live up to its reputation as a champion of peace on the 
international scene?
<P>
	So, the member will be against giving this House the 
assurance that the Canadian peacekeepers will not be 
unilaterally pulled out of the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> Mr. Speaker, we have debated the question, 
exchanged ideas and listened to all other hon. members who 
have given their views with respect to these matters.
<P>
	The purpose of the debate is to exchange and to formulate 
ideas. Hopefully if the hon. member has further comments with 
which he can convince other members on the other side of the 
House as to why his position is more favourable perhaps he can 
be convincing. That is the reason we are here today.
<P>
	I can indicate that some of the comments, such as those made 
earlier today by the hon. member for Moose Jaw-Lake Centre 
were convincing. If the the hon. member who has just posed his 
comment has further comments that may be convincing I ask 
him for them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the situation of our Canadian UN troops in the former 
Yugoslavia is worrisome. Mr. Boutros-Ghali said last weekend 
that he was thinking of using air strikes to free a Canadian 
contingent stationed in Srebrenica. Obviously, the UN troops' 
mission is in jeopardy.
<P>
<B>(2055) </B>
<P>
	Since 1947, Canada is the only country to have participated in 
all UN peacekeeping missions. This participation has made 
Canada's presence felt throughout the world. Our peace 
missions are recognized. They contribute to Canada's 
international prestige. We have become leaders in the art of 
keeping peace in the world.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For that matter if we go back a few years ago, members will 
recall that Mr. Lester B. Pearson was the recipient of the 1957 
Nobel prize for the promotion of peace.
<P>
	The first Canadian involvement in a peacekeeping contingent 
goes back to 1947 in the Kashmir but it was not until 1956 at the 
time of the Suez Canal crisis, at the initiative of the Canadian 
government, that the peacekeeping operations began as we know 
them today.
<P>
	On that occasion the then minister of external affairs, Lester 
B. Pearson, proposed sending troops under the United Nations 
flag in order to permit the orderly retreat of belligerents from 
the canal zone. Since then Canadians have never missed a single 
peace mission.
<P>
	In 1988, a second peace Nobel prize was awarded to the 
United Nations international force. At home we pay tribute to 
our troops. In the fall of 1992 during a monument unveiling 
ceremony by the Governor General, Mr. Ray Hnatyshyn, the 
monument was named the Reconciliation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Until this latest mission in Bosnia, we had lost 80 lives. Our 
soldiers have often had to live in frightful conditions, but they 
have managed to carry out their mission. This time, the former 
Yugoslavia is at war. Will we suffer more loss of life in a single 
mission than in all the previous ones? Our men and women now 
have to undergo armed attack without the ability to react. Their 
families and their children are worried about them. A climate of 
fear and uncertainty is setting in. They are witnesses to a war, 
they are not allowed to use their weapons and they stand by 
powerless as people are massacred. Can we call this a peace 
mission?
<P>
	Nevertheless, the UN troops' intervention in Bosnia is 
important. Canada faces a dilemma. We cannot accept depriving 
these people of our humanitarian aid and we cannot send our 
troops on a peace mission in a country at war. We cannot keep 
peace if there is no peace. We cannot restore peace against the 
will of the Serbs, the Croats and the Muslims. In this context, 
Canada is in the best position to help set new rules for 
peacekeeping. Our action to date has been preventive and it must 
remain so. We are there to maintain the peace; we represent the 
peacekeeping forces.
<P>
	In some incidents during this war in Bosnia, tension was so 
high between these peoples and the line between legitimate 
defence and provocation was so thin that action taken by our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="353"> 353 </A></B>
<P>
men and women could be interpreted  as aggression by the 
belligerents. It would be a pity if Canada's peacekeeping 
reputation were tarnished because of a situation where the 
violence and horror of war cancel out our efforts for peace. Can 
we prevent the recurrence of such dramatic events? Can we 
afford to continue our peace mission in the world?
<P>
	All these questions remain unanswered, but we cannot 
overlook the fact that peace missions cost Canadians dearly. 
Nevertheless, we think they are essential. When we aim for the 
essential, we eliminate the superfluous and we avoid waste. If 
we want to maintain these missions, I am afraid that we will 
have no choice but to exercise tight control over the expenses 
incurred and future spending. That is the price we will have to 
pay if we want to continue to ensure peace.
<P>
	Peace missions are essential for their humanitarian work, for 
the relief they provide to the most disadvantaged countries, but 
also to the men and women who could not have survived the 
misery created by the famine, drought, floods and devastation of 
war.
<P>
<B>(2100) </B>
<P>
	They are also essential for Canada. We have built an excellent 
reputation, we are present on the international scene, we are the 
number one peacekeepers in the world. This is an essential role 
for Canada. Is our presence in Bosnia too costly, will it force us 
to forgo other missions which could bring peace? Should we 
withdraw from Bosnia?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	British troops are now threatening to withdraw from the 
United Nations contingent in Bosnia. Let us recall that the 
United Nations has chosen to name the peacekeeping troops the 
blue helmets so that the Canadians will be differentiated from 
the British because of their almost identical uniforms. It is my 
opinion that threats will not do anything and that we would 
rather concentrate our efforts to assure that the peacekeeping 
forces in Bosnia will fulfil the mandate which justifies their 
very existence and that serious proposals be put forward to end 
this conflict.
<P>
	So far, all efforts by the west to end this conflict have failed. 
The whole situation is very disturbing. What should be the role 
of Canada in order for it to be the instigator of solutions for this 
conflict and to prevent the resurgence of similar conflicts 
elsewhere? Shall we have the means to maintain peace in 
Yugoslavia after this war has ended or will our position be so 
weak that for all practical purposes it will be the end of our 
peace missions?
<P>
	These are all questions that deserve serious thinking and 
proper answers if we want to assure the success of our future 
interventions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canadian experts are already present in several developing 
countries as well as in Russia and Ukraine to initiate these 
countries to peacekeeping operations. Following the appeal 
made by Boutros Boutros-Ghali to preserve peace in a more 
energetic way, it has been suggested that an international 
training centre for peacekeeping be set up in Lahr, Germany. We 
all know that Canada will close its base there in 1994. Would 
this training centre enable us to maintain our role as 
peacekeepers as well as to make good use of existing facilities? 
Canada could thus continue to be a leader at the international 
level. This suggestion certainly has some merit and deserves 
careful consideration to determine the likely benefits of such a 
centre, whose objective could be the prevention of other 
conflicts.
<P>
	The war in Bosnia is serious and tragic. Not only because of 
the hardships and the violence which prevail in that country, but 
also for the families of our soldiers who live in fear while 
waiting for the return of their loved ones. Those families hope 
that Canada will continue to fulfil its peacekeeping role in a 
climate of peace.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One cannot maintain peace if there is no peace. Canada is a 
peaceful country. This was implied and demonstrated and our 
reputation is solid on that matter. We have an important role to 
play on the international scene as a peacekeeping country. The 
members of our peace missions know that their involvement is 
crucial and very often is the last hope of populations that are 
continuously living in a state of disturbance and dissension.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada can fulfil its peacekeeping obligations. Peacekeeping 
means that we can act before a situation degenerates into a 
conflict and that we can maintain peace after a conflict has 
ended. We have a role to play both before and after a war. If we 
intervene before a conflict occurs, we may be able to avoid wars 
and preserve peace.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for Pierrefonds for 
illustrating how complex the situation is and how difficult it is 
to make a decision. In one hour, we will come to the end of a 
debate during which members of Parliament will have provided 
the government with useful information. We will have the 
choice between a withdrawal of our troops, the status quo, or a 
solution which seems more appropriate to me, namely to restore 
the conditions for success. It is very encouraging to know that 
according to the Stoltenberg-Owen plan, thus named since Mr. 
Stoltenberg took over from Mr. Cyrus Vance, we could be very 
close to a solution. Indeed, we could be extremely close to an 
agreement and negotiations will resume on February 10. Conse-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="354"> 354 </A></B>
<P>
quently, any decision made  by the Government of Canada will 
have an influence on those negotiations.
<P>
<B>(2105) </B>
<P>
	I want to ask the hon. member for Pierrefonds if he thinks that 
the Canadian government should take a stand in the next few 
days, or if it would be preferable to wait until shortly before 
April 1st, when our commitment will end, to announce, based on 
the status of the negotiations, if it is appropriate to maintain our 
presence in Bosnia, given the very significant impact of that role 
for Canada's reputation as a peacekeeper, a reputation which it 
has developed over the last few decades?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patry:</B> Mr. Speaker, to answer that question I would say 
that this is a very personal issue. The Government of Canada 
should immediately engage in negotiations with the concerned 
parties, especially with the UN, to somehow renegotiate the 
agreements ensuring its presence in the former Yugoslavia 
because, for all practical purposes, Canada must remain there to 
maintain peace in that area. We must not in any way avoid our 
obligations at the international level. And Canada's role on the 
international scene is a humanitarian role. Therefore, in my 
opinion, Canada's peacekeeping role must be maintained in the 
former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to see that the hon. member is clearly in favour of 
maintaining peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia, so as to 
avoid a slaughter of the population, especially the Bosnian 
people.
<P>
	However, many Canadians and Quebecers are concerned 
about the cost of maintaining those peacekeepers. Earlier I 
referred to a reform of our military budget.
<P>
	Would the hon. member tell us which solution he advocates to 
maintain our peacekeepers over there while keeping tax 
increases at a minimum?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I learned something earlier from the 
member for Portneuf, who represents the same political party as 
the member for Richelieu, to the effect that it would cost each 
Canadian taxpayer 25 cents a day to maintain Canada's 
peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	I think this is a very small price to pay to maintain our 
humanitarian aid over there, and I would be prepared to fight in 
the Liberal caucus for the monies and credits required to ensure 
that peace.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to make note of the fact that the Minister of National Defence is 
in the House and the fact that he has spent an inordinate amount 
of time considering his responsibilities in being in the House 
and listening personally to this debate. I think that it says 
something very positive about the direction in which the 
government is going in taking the views of the members  of this 
House seriously when attempting to come to a broader 
consideration and determination of where it wants to be going. I 
thank him for being here.
<P>
	I would like in my intervention to broaden the discussion just 
somewhat on the basis of the order of the government's business 
when it speaks of the possible future direction of Canadian 
peacekeeping policy and operations. In taking a look at a future 
approach, I would suggest that we have to be businesslike.
<P>
	As I come from a business background that is an easy thing to 
say, but there are many things to be taken positively in the 
business environment. When we take a look at business and 
managing affairs we take a look at the fact for example that there 
must be measurements, yardsticks and goal posts that we can 
measure things by. We must have a plan. We must have 
objectives and goals.
<P>
<B>(2110 ) </B>
<P>
	We think often of the number of times when we have heard 
jokes made and sometimes we forget about the original purpose 
of when. Often we get drawn into these things as a nation when 
we forget what our original purpose is. Therefore, it is important 
that we take a look at the definition of what we are doing in 
terms of peacekeeping.
<P>
	Yesterday I had the opportunity to attend a briefing by the 
national defence department. I apologize to the House that I did 
not make accurate notes and so I do not know the time frame. 
However, my understanding is that the peacekeeping forces 
world-wide-not Canadian, but all of the peacekeeping 
forces-in a very short period of time have expanded from 
10,000 to 80,000. This is rather a boy scout, altruistic approach 
on the part of the of the world community where the world 
community sees a problem and jumps into it. We have in the 
world a situation of increasing complexity and danger not only 
for our soldiers but indeed for the soldiers of all the world.
<P>
	As has been noted in many interventions, Canadians have a 
very proud peacekeeping history. We have spoken about 
ourselves and I believe our interventions have been accurate that 
we have that history of being the originators of the idea and the 
actions of peacekeeping.
<P>
	In this same briefing it was noted that two very valid reasons 
were because of our emphasis on multinational diplomacy and 
also in support of the United Nations. I believe as members of 
this House representing Canadians that Canadians too want 
Canada to support the United Nations.
<P>
	However, going further with the criterion as to how decisions 
are made concerning whether we should be involved in a 
peacekeeping effort, we take a look at the three.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="355"> 355 </A></B>
<P>
	First, there is agreement by parties to a peaceful settlement. 
Coming from a constituency that happens to include the 
majority of the Canadian Rockies, I come from a very beautiful 
but remote area. We have all sorts of very large wildlife there 
and it makes me think of walking down a path with a 22 calibre 
rifle and coming across a grizzly bear in rutting season. I would 
really have to think twice about what I was going to do simply 
because I would be wondering what the bear was going to to.
<P>
	Truly if we as a nation are going to become involved in these 
situations where we have 500, 1,000 or 1,500 people and we are 
up against an array of tens of thousands of combatants, is it not 
somewhat like walking down a trail and coming across a grizzly 
bear when I only have a 22 calibre rife in my hand?
<P>
	Second, we must also know what clear mandate we have to be 
there.
<P>
	Third, we must have a sound financial and logical basis for 
being there.
<P>
	Narrowing the focus for just a second to specifically the 
situation in Bosnia, I must profess that I do not necessarily 
understand, and perhaps many Canadians do not understand, if 
we do in fact have a sound financial and logistical basis for 
being there.
<P>
	If I may I would like to share a brief story about what 
happened on my first day in Parliament. The member for Fraser 
Valley East and I were on a tour with our wives and the four of us 
ended up in the Remembrance Chapel at the base of the Peace 
Tower. I recommend it to all members. It was a riveting 
experience. We were there at 11 o'clock. If one has the good 
fortune of being there at 11 o'clock one will be there when they 
turn the pages of the books of those who paid the ultimate 
sacrifice in the war. It was a very moving experience because it 
gave me a real feeling of what it is to be a Canadian and what 
price has been paid so that we have the freedom of speech we 
have here tonight in this House of Commons.
<P>
	I thank those dead people, but what about the ones who are 
living? What about the ones who are currently facing danger and 
threat every single second that they are in these theatres of war? 
I personally cannot possibly imagine the fear that must grip an 
individual in those situations. They come back but they have 
emotional scars. This is a price they and their families pay when 
they come back. When these brave men and women of our 
Canadian forces come back their families have to deal with their 
mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters or children who have been 
there and have been changed because of the experience. There is 
a tremendous price. There is a real cost to being involved in a 
war as we are.
<P>
<B>(2115) </B>
<P>
	Reflecting again on my experience in the Remembrance 
Chapel I wondered to myself how many of these brave men and 
women died as a result of quick decisions, forced decisions. As 
we are going forward and want to broaden the approach by 
taking a look at the future direction of peacekeeping in Canada I 
ask: Can we take the time? Can we take deliberate action? Can 
we set the goals for measurement? Can we plan? Can we gain an 
original purpose for why we are there?
<P>
	My own feeling is that we must continue in peacekeeping. Our 
world needs our interventions in peacekeeping. In his 
intervention the member for Red Deer, my colleague in the 
Reform Party, suggested using some of the bases and some of 
our expertise to export peacekeeping understanding and 
peacekeeping lessons. It was an excellent suggestion but we 
must measure the cost.
<P>
	The Reform Party probably for the last three or four days in 
the House has spoken only in terms of cost. Whenever we talk 
about that we talk about dollars and cents. I would like to reflect 
for a second on the emotional cost, the cost of those who will pay 
the ultimate sacrifice.
<P>
	With respect to Bosnia in the short term I would agree with the 
other members who suggest that if we do something precipitous, 
if we do something quickly, we will create danger for the people 
in that theatre of war. Furthermore if we telegraph what we are 
going to be doing, in other words if we are too obvious with 
where we are coming from, we create self-fulfilling prophesy. 
Truly we are caught in a bind.
<P>
	I believe we must not do something precipitous. We must be 
prepared to cut our loss but to do it intelligently and with 
planning. We must resist at all cost instant solutions. Far too 
often in our community we see instant solutions, the desire for 
instant solutions. We must take deliberate action.
<P>
	As a very proud Canadian I sometimes feel that as a nation we 
end up with boy scout or altruistic actions, taking a reaction to 
world events. Rather than being pulled along by the world 
community into these peacekeeping situations I believe we must 
become more businesslike in our decision making so that we 
may manage our future direction.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> I wish 
to thank the member who spoke before me; his presentation was 
very clear and to the point. But I would like to add a comment. 
Last November 27, in my riding, I met thirty young soldiers 
returning from Bosnia who were celebrating with the families of 
thirty other soldiers who had just left for Bosnia.
<P>
	While talking with them, I realized something that several of 
my colleagues mentioned today. It seemed like they were not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="356"> 356 </A></B>
<P>
fully aware of the experience they had just  been through. 
Granted they had not been back long, but it seems to me they had 
not received as thorough a training as they should have had, 
given the type of work they were expected to do.
<P>
	Going back to what my colleague just said, that we needed to 
establish criteria, to give very clear mandates, to have a sound 
financial basis and so on, I would like to know if he thought 
about the training of the troops, if he thought about that aspect of 
the issue?
<P>
<B>(2120) </B>
<P>
	On that point, does he agree with the hon. member for 
Vancouver Quadra who talked about the need, for example, to 
explain to young militiamen what is at stake politically so that 
they would not only understand the tactics and get the 
sophisticated training they need to face whatever danger they 
will encounter, but also learn the social and political dimensions 
of the type of intervention they will be asked to perform in those 
countries.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does the member for Kootenay East 
want to treat that as a question or as a representation? Does he 
wish to reply?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to reply by saying that 
I do believe our soldiers must receive all the training required 
without any question and at whatever cost. However I do not 
know there is any possible way that people can be trained for the 
emotional scars that occur in a theatre of war.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
found the remarks of the hon. member to be very informative. I 
was very struck by his suggestion that we bring sound 
businesses practices to what is essentially war.
<P>
	Would the hon. member mind elaborating on how we put 
humanitarian aid on a sound financial footing?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member has suggested 
humanitarian problems. Obviously these things happen very 
quickly.
<P>
	In terms of humanitarian activity, the situation in the former 
Yugoslavia is such that there are combatants creating serious 
difficulties for the humanitarian aid to come through. May I 
suggest there has to be a logical businesslike approach to see if 
we or any other peacekeeping nation or force is actually going to 
be able to accomplish the purpose.
<P>
	There must be intervention in terms of the supplies and those 
kinds of things but the question always must be: Can we get it 
there? I believe that is measurable.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the 
question and comment period is almost over, I will be brief.
<P>
	I may not have understood exactly what the hon. member said 
about the cost of humanitarian interventions. I would like him to 
explain again what he thinks about the money being spent on 
peacekeeping operations. Does he think that we should maintain 
or even increase the amount spent in this area, even if it means 
reducing other expenditures in the military? Does he consider 
the money spent on humanitarian intervention a priority?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, the point the member raises is a 
valid one. I hold in my hand some photocopies of an article in 
the <I>Globe and Mail</I> on the weekend in which our Minister of 
National Defence was quoted as saying that there was going to 
be some pretty stiff medicine. The headline was: ``Cuts are 
going to be deep''.
<P>
	This is part of the measurement. This is part of the 
decision-making process the Canadian people must make. Is 
this something they are prepared to commit to? If so, in terms of 
dollars and cents they will have to commit those dollars and 
cents.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate you on your appointment to your new office and 
wish you the best in your responsibilities in the chair. I would 
like to express my thanks to the government for putting this 
matter on the agenda so we as representatives of the Canadian 
people are able to express a view prior to the decision being 
made. I think that is very commendable in a new government 
expressing and acting as an open government. I want to say 
thanks for that in my remarks tonight as I stand before the House 
of Commons.
<P>
<B>(2125) </B>
<P>
	A variety of aspects have been enunciated and clearly defined 
before this assembly. What I wanted to do tonight was to express 
encouragement to those who have served in Bosnia and to 
express encouragement to those who have to make the decision 
on what we do as a country in the weeks and the months ahead.
<P>
	Tonight we address a very special problem and have a very 
special responsibility in defining our peacekeeping role in the 
future and especially what our role will be in Bosnia. Our 
recommendations and our subsequent actions will have a 
significant impact on the former Yugoslavia and on the lives of 
those who are coping in what I would call the bloodiest 
European battlefield since the second world war.
<P>
	Canadians from coast to coast have been made witnesses to 
the tragic events that have taken place in the Balkans. Every 
night on television we see the effects of the day's mortar blasts. 
Every day we read articles detailing the plight of those 
unfortunate enough to be caught in the crossfire.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="357"> 357 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to say to this assembly that the tragedy of life in Bosnia 
underscores how fortunate we are as Canadians to live in this 
great country of Canada. Many of us practise different religions. 
We speak different languages. Close to 400,000 Canadians 
speak neither French nor English, yet we live in harmony, with 
tolerance and in understanding of one another.
<P>
	Previous legislators have taken steps to ensure that all 
Canadians enjoy the freedoms of conscience, religion, thought, 
belief, opinion and expression. Our Canadian charter and our 
Constitution provide a guarantee of freedom and a right to life, 
liberty and the security of person for all of us in the nation.
<P>
	People in the former Yugoslavia also have a just claim to these 
inalienable rights. Because Canadians are a part of a peace 
loving nation we have an obligation to aid or to ensure those 
rights may be made possible for those people. From what I have 
heard in the briefings previous to today and from what I have 
heard in this assembly I believe we can do this best by keeping 
our peacekeepers in the Balkans. While we cannot solve the 
conflict, we can continue to deliver United Nations 
humanitarian aid which to date has helped, as I have heard, 
almost three million people.
<P>
	By remaining in Bosnia we are acting as a conscience to those 
who are committing the many atrocities. In addition to our 2,000 
soldiers, seven Canadian forces members are working as war 
crimes investigators. According to military officials with whom 
I have talked on this matter, this unit in some cases has actually 
prevented some war crimes from taking place and that is 
certainly a very commendable role. These same officials also 
tell me that our presence in the former Yugoslavia is preventing 
the war from spreading into a wider international conflict.
<P>
	Canada's role in Bosnia is essential. Our troops provide food 
and medicine to hundreds of thousands of people who would 
otherwise starve or die of other consequences. Canadian 
peacekeepers are fulfilling what has become our country's 
historic international mission for which we are well known. 
They are promoting peace and security. At the same time they 
are acting as an international conscience in an area of the world I 
believe desperately needs that conscience.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member's remarks have made me wonder 
about the reasons why this question of whether or not to 
withdraw from Bosnia is creating so much tension in Canada.
<P>
<B>(2130) </B>
<P>
	I wonder if we should not also reflect on the value of 
providing the people of Canada with complete and factual 
information on the situation in Bosnia.
<P>
	In our day-to-day dealings with people, when they talk about 
the Bosnian conflict or any other international situation, they 
often mention the atrocities broadcasted on the news, the 
casualties, the costs involved, the money spent on that aspect of 
our international involvement. They are far from having have a 
comprehensive view of the impact of such activities or their 
importance.
<P>
	I wonder if the member who spoke before me could tell us 
how he would feel about asking our soldiers and higher-ranking 
officers presently serving in Bosnia to take part in some of the 
public debates in Canada and tell us what they actually saw and 
experienced, without any partisan bias. They could share their 
thoughts on the action they saw over there and perhaps even 
suggest ideas without having their loyalty questioned or risking 
disciplinary action. I would like the hon. member to tell us what 
he thinks of that idea.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> The hon. member has made a 
very good suggestion in terms of consulting and listening to 
those people who actually have been there on the scene. I have 
talked to some volunteers who have been there from a variety of 
groups providing humanitarian aid outside the military. They 
have seen atrocities. They have seen starvation. They have seen 
the difficulties in families and the conflict within families. They 
feel very sick about it but they do have a story to tell. If they 
were not there many others would lose their lives because of 
lack of food and medical care. Their presence even though they 
are in danger is essential in that sense.
<P>
	I would think that the government through the senior officers 
or the leaders should bring forward those people, the common 
soldiers at the ground level and certainly consult with them and 
get their opinions. First, from what I have heard to this point that 
would be substantial information and second, it would 
encourage us in Canada to continue our presence in Bosnia.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel):</B> Mr. Speaker, to rise in a 
maiden speech on an issue as important as this must be 
something rather providential, to participate in a debate in 
which the members have been so constructive. Our colleagues in 
the Liberal Party, my new friends from the Reform Party, and 
my new friends from the Bloc have all contributed today not 
only to a tribute to the expertise, the training of our troops in the 
very special role we play on the world scene but have also 
offered a series of constructive suggestions which I hope will be 
duly noted and dealt with.
<P>
	I was particularly impressed with my friend from the Reform 
Party this morning who suggested that because of the expertise 
we have developed in this country in peacekeeping that we 
might be in a position to provide that training on an international 
basis.
<P>
	We have done that before. In the Second World War we had 
the Commonwealth air training plan. We provided opportunities 
for people who were close to the  scene in combat to get out of 
the combat zone and properly train for their role in war. I hear 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="358"> 358 </A></B>
<P>
my friend from the Bloc endorsing that tonight and it is very 
refreshing. I also say that because as a former member of the 
Ontario legislature for 10 years I do not think I ever had the 
privilege of participating in a debate that was this constructive 
and lacked the interjections which I have become used to over 
the years.
<P>
<B>(2135 ) </B>
<P>
	Being a soldier, a service person, always has been dangerous. 
Being in combat is highly dangerous. I wonder whether playing 
this humanitarian role, which is neither peacemaking nor 
peacekeeping is even more dangerous. It is more dangerous 
because of the continuing barrage, the continuing intimidation, 
the continuing challenge to the psyche of our service people 
over there on a daily basis. It never stops. It goes on and on.
<P>
	Yet with the training that these people receive and the level of 
professionalism they take such pride in and we are so proud of, 
they carry on through it all. Very often it is through the worst of 
conditions, conditions that you and I, Mr. Speaker, could not 
possibly imagine.
<P>
	Reference was made to the boy scouts and the way Canada 
very often participates in that altruistic mode. Having been a 
boy scout for 30 years I must say that I am kind of proud that we 
do that in Canada, in spite of the fact that sometimes we tend to 
walk where angels fear to tread.
<P>
	I join this debate in expressing great pride in those service 
people and recognizing the unique role Canada plays in the 
world. We are indeed the best at what we do. We should always 
recognize that very special responsibility.
<P>
	Canada has continually been an ardent supporter of the United 
Nations. Indeed Canada pays its dues. We are there when we are 
called upon. We wish that every member country would accept 
that same responsibility. Perhaps as time goes on we are going to 
have to face that question with the United Nations as to whether 
it becomes what the late Mr. Pearson believed it could become at 
its very best or leave us hanging with some other member 
countries rather high and dry because others will not shoulder 
their share of the responsibility.
<P>
	Part of our reason for needing to stay as an agent of 
humanitarian aid in Bosnia is part of our recognition of the 
importance of the United Nations and our desire to keep it not 
just alive, but well, thriving and growing.
<P>
	This debate was precipitated by the news report of the 
apprehension and detaining of 11 of our service people by what 
it turns out to be a group of people who might have been less 
than compos mentis at the time, to be generous. That was the bad 
news that was reported to this country which really was the 
trigger that got this debate going.
<P>
	We should point out in fairness and in perspective that all of 
the functions that go on in Bosnia are not those kinds of critical 
situations. It is not news to report that there are hundreds of 
tonnes of food being shipped every day into these various hot 
spots. It is not news when nothing happens. It would be like 
reporting that there were 5,000 safe take-offs and landings in 
Canada last week. That is never reported but when there is one 
aircraft accident or a nose wheel collapses, it makes the front 
page. I would suggest to all of us that we have to put what we 
read in the newspapers and what we see on television into that 
proper perspective.
<P>
<B>(2140) </B>
<P>
	I would like to make a personal comment on air strikes. It 
seems to me that air strikes under these conditions would be a 
gross admission of failure, of our inability to handle the 
situation in any other way, the very last resort.
<P>
	As has been pointed out there are about three million souls in 
Bosnia who depend on the countries under the United Nations 
that are delivering humanitarian aid daily. They have no other 
means of continuing their physical existence, so we have that 
responsibility.
<P>
	Finally I would like to make a suggestion to the Minister of 
National Defence who is here with us tonight listening to this 
debate. I am not sure whether our soldiers would really 
appreciate it that much but perhaps we could send them some 
copies of the <I>Hansard</I> which contains this debate to let them 
know what we think of them and how proud we are of the work 
they are doing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. Looking at the 
time, we had agreed to go until 10 o'clock. My assessment is 
that we are progressing very well. Certainly the level of debate 
is excellent even at this time of the evening. Quite a few other 
speakers would like to go on the record on this important 
subject.
<P>
	I wonder if I could beg the indulgence of the House to sit until 
midnight on the condition that there be 10-minute speeches and 
no questions and comments? Could I seek unanimous agreement 
from the House on that please?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Could we agree that the pages could go 
home?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no objection from the 
government side and I strongly recommend it.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Can we start right now or do we need to 
have further questions?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mifflin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would recommend because of the 
number of speakers that if the House agrees, we should start now 
with 10-minute speeches.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="359"> 359 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
also join colleagues who a few minutes ago remarked on the 
very high level of debate in this place with regard to this motion.
<P>
	Yes, I have been here for some time and I want to corroborate 
that and say I am equally very impressed by the quality and the 
contribution of members on all sides of this House. In fact, it is 
very impressive to hear some of the new members of this place 
who are making very thoughtful contributions to an issue that is 
not an easy one.
<P>
	I do not want to dwell on the history of all of this. Today, the 
Minister of National Defence and the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs and other members of this place have talked about how 
important peacekeeping and now what we call peacemaking has 
been for Canada.
<P>
	It is truly a hallmark of our country. It is related directly to the 
contribution of a great Canadian who was our Minister of 
Foreign Affairs and went on to become a Prime Minister of this 
country. It is something that to members and citizens of this 
country is a matter of pride that we all share in that 
accomplishment and to the fact that this role that Canada has 
played has enabled our country to take an important place in 
international affairs.
<P>
<B>(2145 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, Canada plays a very important role in several 
international forums. It is something that defines us as a nation. 
Canada is a member of the Commonwealth, the Francophonie, 
the Organization of American States. Our membership in the 
OAS is quite significant in terms of our participation in efforts 
to resolve the Haitian conflict. Our involvement in all these 
forums reflects our view of the world and the role we hope to 
play in it.
<P>
	Today's resolution is about Bosnia. I would like to briefly 
state our party's position on the main issues we are facing at this 
time, not only because we will have to make a decision 
regarding our participation as early as March 31, but also within 
the wider context proposed by the government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Generally, there have been three issues raised with regard to 
our participation in peacekeeping, now peacemaking, efforts not 
only in Bosnia but around the world. The first one is the risk 
factor which has become greater than we have previously known 
it to be.
<P>
	The second issue is whether or not we are doing our fair share. 
That has been raised many times today in this House. The third 
one is whether we can afford to continue to do it.
<P>
	On the risk question, let me offer a quote by a prominent 
Canadian, General MacKenzie, who was the first person to go 
into this theatre for Canada leading our efforts there. He was 
asked, before a committee, whether  Canada should restrict 
itself to chapter 6 traditional peacekeeping only. His answer was 
quite elegant. He said: ``You could do that, sir, but as a 
professional soldier I would be mightily embarrassed if you 
did''.
<P>
	The context of that reply is a view that I share. When we 
started with peacekeeping we experienced great birth pains 
through that period. We tend to forget them, but it was also a 
very high risk proposal back then. However, we persisted and 
Canada led the way. We forged a place for ourselves and we 
developed a concept that went on to serve the world. I say that 
because my sense is that today peacemaking is also 
experiencing its birth pains.
<P>
	Yes, the risk may be different and greater, but, as General 
MacKenzie has said, if it is our commitment and our destiny to 
take this on and to forge that concept, then we must accept the 
fact that the risk is there and we as a country are willing to meet 
it.
<P>
	In fact, when we look at Bosnia it is important to appreciate 
that we have accomplished a lot. Yes, I join with other members 
in this place in speaking about the contribution of all the men 
and women who have been active in that theatre. Some of them 
have been from my home riding.
<P>
	Our previous Secretary of State for External Affairs, Barbara 
McDougall, wrote an article recently for the <I>Globe and Mail</I> on 
what this contribution has been about. I take from her comments 
some of the things that we should recognize and some of the 
successes we have had that have been quite significant. ``The 
strategic objective of preventing the spillover of hostilities into 
other regions, such as Kosovo, has so far been achieved''.
<P>
	Second, ``UN peacekeepers, including Canadians, have 
helped hold together an uneasy truce between Serbs and Croats 
in the disputed areas of Croatia''. I do not want to seem to 
diminish the risk in what is happening there, but we have been 
fairly successful.
<P>
	Third and most important, ``lives are being saved in the 
humanitarian effort''.
<P>
	Here are three areas of real successes for us in this effort. I 
think we need to keep a perspective these.
<P>
	As we move on to this risk that is truly greater, I think we will 
want to work toward continuing the efforts that others have 
started.
<P>
<B>(2150 ) </B>
<P>
	There are very few countries in the world that can take credit 
for developing the command, control and supply solutions to 
inherent problems of operating a multinational mission in the 
field such as multiple languages, cultural differences and 
different command structures.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="360"> 360 </A></B>
<P>
	If there are very few countries in the world Canada is among 
those few. For that reason I would like to think that we will 
continue in that area.
<P>
	In a document, ``Agenda for Peace'', the Secretary General 
laid out the issues and proposed possible solutions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Secretary General's ``Agenda for Peace'' draws a picture 
and proposes ways to intervene: preventive diplomacy, 
peacemaking, peacekeeping, the establishment of conditions 
favourable to a durable peace.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the document, ``Agenda for Peace'', put forward by the 
Secretary General of the United Nations, there was also some 
discussion about a standby force that the United Nations could 
put together. In this same document, it is not held as being one of 
the solutions that they would like to contemplate.
<P>
	After the experience in Bosnia, I would think that maybe we 
would want to revise that position. My party believes that, if 
anything, we would want to think very carefully about our 
experience there and whether or not the United Nations, as it 
contemplates its 50th anniversary, would want to revisit this 
matter and consider it very seriously.
<P>
	We also know from our experiences that what we will need is a 
very strong commitment to multilateralism. The experience of 
other countries in Somalia, for example, seems to indicate that 
there is some way to go. I am thinking in particular of our 
American friends who have had some difficulty in making and 
adapting to this new context of multilateralism-and we know 
that from our experiences in the gulf war-that is a reflection of 
what has happened over the last few years with the decline of the 
superpowers and the change in the structure around the world. 
That challenge is also very relevant to peacekeeping.
<P>
	We believe the United Nations should contemplate the 
reforms that are going to be important in this area. In fact there 
are about eight reforms. Let me first stress that these reforms 
happen around the UN as a cardinal instrument in this new world 
order that we hear so much about.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must rationalize UN operations and rethink its role in 
promoting peace and security.
<P>
	Our party thinks that the United Nations must implement a 
number of changes. First, create a permanent strategic 
headquarters to enhance the management, planning and 
operational capacity of the UN. Second, improve its preventive 
diplomacy capacity and undertake an independent policy 
analysis of volatile situations. Third, obtain from the member 
states formal commitments to put at the disposal of the UN 
troops ready to intervene if necessary, just like Canada does.  
Fourth, set up a training program aimed at high-level officers 
who will be commanding the troops in complex, difficult and 
dangerous situations. Fifth, introduce a code of conduct and 
common method of operation for all soldiers serving under the 
UN flag. Sixth, rationalize UN institutions wherever possible to 
streamline them and make them more efficient, more 
concentrated, more responsible and more attuned to needs. 
Seventh, secure a commitment from member states to pay the 
full amount owing to the UN on time. And eighth, enforce more 
stringently the provisions of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty and impose harsher sanctions on violators.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I see you signalling to me that my 10 minutes are 
up. Very quickly, in conclusion there was a second point I 
wanted to comment on, namely whether Canada was paying its 
share. Very briefly, I would just like to make the following 
comment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On the old issue of fair share, it is worth reflecting just a 
second in relation to our contribution to NATO where 
traditionally we have not been the highest contributor. However, 
if we weigh that against our contribution to peacekeeping, 
Canadians may find a perspective, as is the case on the world 
scene with other countries, a pretty fair contribution by Canada 
to this effort.
<P>
	On the issue of affording it, we have to be very creative in how 
we deal with this and be mindful of it. The 10 per cent share may 
be something we would want to reflect on, but I would certainly 
encourage the government, the minister and this Parliament to 
support our efforts there.
<P>
	I have no simple answers on whether we should continue or 
not, but our party is inclined to continue our support as long as 
the international community is also living up to its commitment. 
We could then set reasonable objectives to be met in regard to 
what our contribution is, when and how we should be there and 
when we should be pulling out.
<P>
<B>(2155) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton-Lawrence):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
know that it is very difficult to see members in this corner. There 
is not much light here.
<P>
	I would like to congratulate you on your new position. I know 
that you have served this House and the Canadian people well, 
both on this side and on the other side. I am sure that under the 
present circumstances, you will continue doing the work for 
which you have already shown a great ability. An ability that 
also includes the value of peacekeeping.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="361"> 361 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Many of my colleagues today, including the latest one who 
spoke about the value of peacekeeping, have begun to reflect on 
just what we should be doing in this instance and as well with 
respect to peacekeeping.
<P>
	I was impressed, as I am sure are many of my constituents and 
constituents throughout Canada, by the recitation of the reasons 
why we find ourselves today in Bosnia-Hercegovina. One of 
those reasons of course is that we have established a tradition in 
this country that accepts a responsibility to contribute to world 
order, to the establishment of a civilized fashion of government, 
of the maintenance of peace and the propagation of the concept 
of law as that which should govern all countries.
<P>
	One of the colleagues from the Bloc went so far as to say-I 
do not quote but paraphrase because I was taken by some of the 
phrases-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians are proud of that work because, in playing that 
role, Canada has been working towards freedom, towards the 
achievement of democracy and towards the extending of human 
rights.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	These are no mean ambitions, no mean objectives and no 
mean goals for the purposes of our troops both in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina and elsewhere. In fact those types of goals 
have made us, in many respects, a leader in establishing not only 
a philosophy but a mechanism and a role for our armed forces 
for the world throughout to follow.
<P>
	For us it has been a pragmatic approach to the limited type of 
military resources we could bring to any theatre world-wide. It 
is fair to say that we are not, by any stretch of the imagination, a 
threat militarily to any country in the world given the number of 
troops we currently have in our defence structure. However, we 
have used them intelligently. We have used them for the 
maintenance of peace. We have used them to teach others how to 
establish order and how to establish and maintain an approach to 
conflict resolution that could lead to eventual long-term peace.
<P>
	Many of my colleagues in this House today and Canadians 
everywhere seem to be ambivalent simply because none of those 
ideals, none of those values appear to be as clear as they have 
been in the past.
<P>
	My hon. colleague from Sherbrooke talked a few moments 
ago about all of the valued initiatives of the last decade or so. 
But they are no longer very clear in the public's mind. Why not? 
Many of us have witnessed on a daily basis the kinds of 
repugnant pictures that would suggest we are no longer as 
successful as we have been in the past. Perhaps that is what hurts 
us most.
<P>
<B>(2200 ) </B>
<P>
	One of our colleagues earlier indicated that we are revolted by 
the barbarities, the atrocities, the outright horror, the 
destruction of all belligerents. No one mentioned the aggressor 
because one of the weaknesses in discussing peacekeeping in the 
context of what used to be called Yugoslavia is that there are 
many belligerents but we have named no aggressor. 
Consequently when we make comparisons between the set of 
circumstances in which we have engaged our military forces and 
those which were engaged in the Gulf war, there is that basic 
difference, that we have named no aggressor and therefore we 
have let others dictate our actions on the basis of that vacuum.
<P>
	Almost on a daily basis we have been reminded that all of our 
good intentions, all of our resources, the risks that we ask our 
young men and women to take in a theatre of war or conflict, are 
producing no results. We are so stunned by that that some 
members represent the public view that perhaps this is not cost 
efficient.
<P>
	My colleague from Hamilton-Wentworth asked a very 
pertinent question and that is how to measure the cost efficiency 
of a moral value, of a value that has international application 
and a value which has a long-term benefit for social order.
<P>
	Others have indicated that we are absorbing, as we have been 
in all of our engagements, virtually all of the material costs. 
Others, our allies, our friends in the UN and NATO have not 
been so conscientious in following that model.
<P>
	We seem to be at a loss at what to do because our troops, like 
some members here-and I do not mean to make light-are 
cornered, out manoeuvred, by belligerents who have no regard 
for their goals and their altruistic reason for being in such a 
locus. Worse, we seem to be manipulated by our own allies who 
are engaged in an evolution of military tactics just as we are 
witnessing an evolution of peacemaking and peacekeeping.
<P>
	While it might appear that I have made a Freudian slip when I 
say there is an evolution of peacekeeping and peacemaking, in 
the last House we went into the discussion of peacekeeping in 
the Gulf war to peacemaking. Our obligations had shifted. The 
moment we make a definition that is different from the one that 
had guided until that day virtually all of our interventions in the 
world theatre, we assumed an entirely different set of 
obligations, both material, personnel and in outcome.
<P>
	We have not made a definitive explanation yet of what we 
mean by peacemaking. If I listen to my constituents, I 
understand that it is what most of us as Canadians would want 
most desperately for the people of the Balkans today, that 
someone would impose peace, would make peace, and then we 
would voluntarily go in and keep it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="362"> 362 </A></B>
<P>
	We are not a part of that evolution, not at the decision table. 
Our Minister of Foreign Affairs gave a very detailed explanation 
of what is going on, blow by blow, chronologically, at the 
political table, with respect how our allies are dealing with the 
circumstances in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
<P>
	Should we then be considering just simply this question of 
peacekeeping, or should we be addressing peacekeeping per se?
<P>
	I know you want to give me just another moment to close off, 
Mr. Speaker. That is the unfortunate part of having only 10 
minutes to speak. I will use the next 55 seconds to close off.
<P>
<B>(2205 ) </B>
<P>
	What we should do as a House is draw our attention to some of 
the good initiatives that have been proposed by both sides of this 
House. For example, I am pleased to have presented a proposal 
in 1989 to convert one of our military bases into an international 
peacekeeping training centre. For my colleagues on the Reform 
side this would have generated some $80 million a year and 
provided nations throughout the world with an opportunity to 
avail themselves of the expertise, both military and 
paramilitary, for application in peacetime and in conflict 
resolution throughout the world.
<P>
	That idea did not receive all the attention it deserved but 
Canadian Forces Base Cornwallis is still being considered. Mr. 
Speaker, I know that you will allow me to encourage my 
colleagues on the government side to reconsider and to focus on 
a re-evaluation of where we should be. We should be where our 
obligations have taken us. Let us discharge those and then focus 
again on how to best to utilize the materiel and expertise we 
have built up.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
being my first speech in the House, I would like to start by 
congratulating you on your appointment to the chair. I would 
also like to thank my constituents of Saint-Denis for giving me 
their support. I am very proud as a Canadian and Quebecer of 
Greek origin-the first woman of Greek origin to be elected to 
this House-to be representing them here, today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The riding of Saint-Denis is in many ways a microcosm of 
what Canada is today. With cultural communities representing 
every corner of the globe, the issue of peacemaking or 
peacekeeping is of great concern to my constituents and the 
reason that I rise before you today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am convinced that the Canadian peacekeepers presently in 
the former Republic of Yugoslavia, and especially in Bosnia, 
should not be withdrawn.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canada has a very important role to play in resolving this 
conflict. To pull out now would be abandoning our 
responsibility to the international community and moreover 
abandoning our ideals as a nation which pioneered the concept 
of peacekeeping. We have come a long way from the failure of 
the League of Nations in preventing global conflict to the far 
more successful formula for peacekeeping established in the 
United Nations. Crises will exist but we must never give up 
searching for solutions to prevent conflict.
<P>
	With its long and distinguished tradition of peacekeeping, 
Canada has a moral responsibility to help bring about a solution 
by easing the level of tension and mistrust that has plagued the 
former Yugoslavia. No enemies are irreconcilable if they can 
learn to know and respect each other.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is a well known fact that the United Nations peacekeeping 
operations are in serious trouble in some places, the former 
Yugoslavia and Somalia in particular. However, we can say that, 
on the whole, peacekeeping operations have had a positive 
effect. For example, while Mogadishu remains tense and 
unstable, the rest of Somalia is demonstrating a tremendous 
recovery capacity. Is it not marvellous to realize that, thanks to 
the United Nations peacekeeping operation, Somalis are no 
longer dying of starvation? And what about the remarkable 
success in Cambodia? That country went through a long and 
traumatic period, but can now look forward to a better future.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As I mentioned, there are several difficulties that UN 
peacekeepers and especially our own troops are encountering in 
the former Yugoslavia. Perseverance, not withdrawal will lead 
to a positive outcome, the outcome that we have been working 
toward for nearly two years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our peacekeepers are now playing an essential role, 
preventing bloodbaths. There would no doubt have been many 
more civilian casualties had it not been for them. To pull them 
out at this time would trigger an escalation of violence.
<P>
<B>(2210) </B>
<P>
	Besides, in assessing the value of our peacekeeping action, we 
will have to be careful not to trigger hostilities which would 
only get our troops bogged down in that conflict.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The action in December of the four European union states 
which established diplomatic relations with the former 
Yugoslav republic of Macedonia have increased the possibility 
of yet another outbreak of violence in the Balkans. It is the same 
premature recognition of Bosnia-Hercegovina that contributed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="363"> 363 </A></B>
<P>
to its political  disintegration and to the armed conflict that 
continues to this day.
<P>
	Let us be cautious in extending diplomatic relations so 
quickly lest we find ourselves once again in the same difficult 
position. We must avoid having to stretch our forces any further 
in the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	The European union continues to lack a coherent and unified 
approach to solving the conflict in the Balkans. Canada must 
rise above this and it will not be done by pulling out our troops at 
this very crucial time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada is renewing its support for the UN and the CSCE. Our 
country is committed to strengthening the North Atlantic 
Alliance, which plays such an important part in peacekeeping 
operations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	NATO was created in order to counter the very real threats 
which the Soviet Union under Stalin was making against 
western Europe. Since those who ignore the lessons of history 
are doomed to repeat them, let us not abandon too quickly this 
excellent instrument which has served us so well over more than 
four decades. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, NATO must 
assume a new role in the international forum and Canada has an 
integral part in helping to define what that role is.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	NATO's primary role must remain deterrence; not aggression, 
but deterrence. NATO is also indispensable in terms of 
providing logistic support for peacekeeping and humanitarian 
actions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Last but not least, NATO is the only existing institution which 
is capable of receiving most east European states with proper 
status and a tested framework for regional collective security.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The real issue as far as NATO is concerned is not to decide 
whether or not it is not relevant any more, a thing of the past, but 
rather what shape to give it now. That is what we must examine 
in the general context of peacekeeping operations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Several important lessons can be learned from the recent past 
and applied to our peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia. First, 
distinguish where one can be useful and where one cannot. It is 
sometimes better to limit one's intervention to the strict 
minimum humanitarian intervention when one knows that the 
adversaries are not amenable to any form of wisdom. In the case 
of Bosnia it is our duty to protect and help the innocent victims 
and minimize the bloodshed as much as possible.
<P>
	Second, we must be patient. Some conflicts cannot be solved 
in weeks or even years. They take decades of patient effort to 
bring the opponents closer and for them to learn to respect each 
other.
<P>
	Third, minimize effectiveness under a clear leadership and 
with precise objectives in mind. Compare the effectiveness of 
the coalition forces in the Gulf war with the irresolution and 
inefficiencies of the situation in Bosnia.
<P>
	Fourth, play by the rules of collective security. National pride 
or prejudice cannot be allowed to have priority over the 
necessities of an efficient security system. The French, Germans 
and British are now bitterly regretting their haste and their 
differences and their botched attempts to keep peace in the 
former Yugoslavia.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Fifth, better safe than sorry. The proliferation of nuclear 
technologies and know-how must be a constant reminder of the 
troubling fact that someday prevention may be the only thing 
keeping us from a nuclear apocalypse happening in our own 
backyard.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The world today is a very different place from five years ago. 
Who would have believed in January 1989 that the Berlin wall 
would come tumbling down and soon after that the Soviet 
empire. Likewise that Israel would be talking peace with the 
PLO or that there would be multiracial elections in South Africa.
<P>
<B>(2215 ) </B>
<P>
	As the Governor General said in the throne speech last week 
our hopes for global peace have been raised and, in many places, 
shattered. In some countries today democracy is under stress, its 
future uncertain.
<P>
	I was born in Greece, the cradle of democracy. My parents 
emigrated to Canada because of its reputation as a country 
where democracy is very highly respected. It is in this tradition 
that Canadians today continue their unwavering commitment to 
peacekeeping.
<P>
	It is up to Canada to play a responsible role in seeing the 
resolution of this conflict. Pulling out our Canadian troops will 
not solve this conflict, but greater concessions among the 
international community and organizations like the UN and 
NATO will.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We will have to keep doing our share to ensure that, once the 
conflicts have been resolved, our peacekeepers can get their due 
share of the credit for restoring peace in this troubled area.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
thank you for the opportunity of joining the debate on this very 
important question. I appreciate the opportunity of being 
involved in this debate because my involvement as a person with 
both Croatia and Bosnia stretches back a few years now.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier in the House I helped to initiate the 
organization of a group of members of Parliament. We acted as 
observers in the first free election in Croatia. As well I helped do 
the same thing when the elections in Bosnia-Hercegovina 
occurred.
<P>
	I remember spending election night with the Muslim party 
and celebrating with them their victory and the success of the 
first free election. At that time I had the hope that in Bosnia we 
would find a bridge between the middle eastern and western or 
European cultures. I was quite impressed by the people. I had 
met the Muslim people in Bosnia and I had high hopes that such 
a bridge would be built between the two different cultures and 
religions.
<P>
	I experienced hope as well in Croatia as they started up their 
new government and in many ways I helped them. They wanted 
to know how to organize a public service commission, set up a 
department and what the environmental regulations were. It was 
the basic things in starting a government from scratch. There 
was the excitement as well of re-establishing their nation and 
their nationhood.
<P>
	It was a period of a lot of hope and optimism. I made some 
basic understandings that even though one had many years of a 
totalitarian government that tried to suppress both religion and 
nationalism, I understood that one cannot suppress it. I am an 
internationalist, but one cannot suppress nationalism.
<P>
	The only way to do it is as we have seen in western Europe and 
on the North American continent. It is the evolution of different 
nations coming together and beginning to realize that they have 
more in common with each other and a whole new attitude and a 
whole new approach starts to develop.
<P>
	However, what I saw in both Bosnia and Croatia is that all the 
suppression did was to drive it underground and the moment the 
suppression was released it came back up to the surface right 
from where it left off. In the evolution of cultures, peoples and 
religions you cannot suppress. Suppression does not work.
<P>
	I was concerned at that time that with the fall of the Berlin 
wall and the removal of the suppression that all sorts of groups 
of people who had been suppressed were going to demand their 
nationhood. I suggested at that time in a letter to the external 
affairs minister in a speech I made in the House that three 
principles should be observed.
<P>
	First, it is the right to self-determination. The people in 
Croatia through a democratic process decided to become 
independent. They had that right.
<P>
<B>(2220 ) </B>
<P>
	Second, there is the principle that boundaries should exist the 
way they are and that that armed force would not be tolerated by 
the international community to change boundaries. The only 
way boundaries could change is through negotiation and in some 
instances perhaps through arbitration but only through a process 
such as this should boundaries change.
<P>
	Third, there is the principle of the right of minority groups. 
Minority groups and people of different ethnic groups have been 
shifted around in the former Yugoslavia and the former Soviet 
Union.
<P>
	How can one deal with this? One has to respect minority 
groups not just by putting it in high flowing terms in the 
Constitution but in having the mechanism as we have here with 
the human rights commission. We need some tribunal that could 
hear complaints, lay charges and levy fines and penalties if need 
be. It would be able to enforce the rights of minorities in order to 
ensure whether they are the minority Serbs in Croatia, the 
minority Muslims in Serbia or whatever that their rights would 
be respected and they would be respected as human beings. 
Unfortunately this did not happen and the whole former 
Yugoslavia has descended into hell.
<P>
	I remember being back there in January 1992 and standing in a 
little village called Vocin. They had a 16th century church that 
was totally blown up. As I entered the village I thought it had 
hailed all these little pebbles all over the place. Then it was 
explained to me that several thousand tonnes of explosives had 
been used to totally destroy this church. It was explained to me 
that there were some 45 elderly people whose average age was 
65 had been murdered in that village. They happened to be 
Croats. One or two were older Serbians who must have tried to 
protect the older Croatians.
<P>
	I stood at a spot and the manacles were still there where an old 
man had been shot in the back of the head. His hands had been 
manacled. His body had been sawn in half and they had tried to 
burn his feet. His feet had just been stubbles.
<P>
	There was madness, insanity and craziness. It is as though the 
hounds of hell had been let loose. It is as though we had serial 
killers on the loose enjoying the killing in their torture.
<P>
	That madness now goes on and on. One hears stories of 
fundamentalist Islamics fighting-the Mujahedin-for the 
Bosnian cause. One hears stories where some of the worst of the 
secret police of Albania, Russia and the former East Germany 
are fighting on the Serb side.
<P>
	Last week I had the opportunity of having lunch with quite a 
high official of the Croatian government. She was informing me 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="365"> 365 </A></B>
<P>
of a case of where a young Croat had come in and had seen the 
head of his best friend impaled on a  post. He went out and 
committed all sorts of atrocities to this Muslim village.
<P>
	The madness goes on and on. The way she described it was 
that it was the devil's banquet. What can we do? Why should our 
young Canadian men and women be out there at risk? There is no 
economic or strategic importance to us but there is a human 
moral interest to us.
<P>
	At the end of the last war the world said that we would never 
again tolerate this type of holocaust. This type of holocaust is 
occurring today.
<P>
	What I would propose is that the Canadian Armed Forces 
along with that of the UN and forces from other countries would 
militarily enforce a safe haven so that every man, woman and 
child in the affected areas who want to escape from the madness 
can go to the safe havens. We also propose to both the Croatians 
and the Serbians-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry but there are so many people 
who want to speak and the time is up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Jong:</B> Mr. Speaker, I ask for unanimous consent of the 
House for one minute to finish my remarks.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Jong:</B> Mr. Speaker, consider the role of the Canadian 
forces in Croatia where one-third of Croatia is still occupied by 
Serbian forces. We must surely keep our forces there. To take 
our forces out of Croatia and Bosnia would invite a much greater 
holocaust. There is absolutely no doubt about that.
<P>
<B>(2225 ) </B>
<P>
	Even though the situation in Croatia has not been resolved, at 
least the fighting and the massacre has stopped. The Croats and 
the Serbs are talking. They have made an agreement. They are 
going to open up embassies in each other's country and 
eventually through negotiation that dispute can be settled 
without the slaughter of men, women and children.
<P>
	Canadian men and women have saved hundreds of thousands 
of lives. Surely now is not the time to stop in our worthwhile 
effort.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to rise in the House tonight and to have you in the chair. 
In spite of late hours we have certain colleagues still here with 
us.
<P>
	May I say that I believe it is truly appropriate that the first 
special debate of this Parliament is on peacekeeping. I think it 
appropriate for several reasons.
<P>
	First, this Parliament with 200 new members represents 
Canadians' desire for new direction at the same time that they 
desire Parliament to get back to basics. Surely the search for 
peace and justice is the basic role for government. Peace is a 
challenging goal. Great thinkers of the past have pondered its 
elusive nature. Is it the inability of individuals to resolve their 
differences  without violence that spills over from the home to 
the streets to civil war and to international conflicts, or is the 
large conflicts between nations which leave in their wake a 
pattern of violence that works its way from the battlefront to the 
cities and the neighbourhoods and indeed into family homes?
<P>
	Second, the topic is appropriate because our Fathers of 
Confederation recognized this issue when they listed peace first, 
followed by order and good government, as their three main 
goals for this country.
<P>
	Third, the appalling situation which goes on in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina causes anguish for all Canadians who 
watch the human suffering on their television screens each 
night.
<P>
	Therefore I wish to thank the Prime Minister for announcing 
reviews of foreign policy and defence and the Minister of 
National Defence for giving us the opportunity to put forward 
our opinions.
<P>
	I have no personal connection with the military and no 
personal connection with the area under debate but I do know 
that currently Canadians are interested in the expenditures of 
their government and are even questioning the long term value 
of military expenditures. They no longer believe the Russians 
are coming and if they consider the concept of being defended 
they wish to be defended against threats to their security in 
terms of job loss, poverty, hunger, illness and the escalation of 
violence in their society.
<P>
	They understand that the military and its acquisition of ever 
more sophisticated equipment eats up precious resources that 
could be used for building the country. For example it has been 
said that health care workers and community volunteers 
working to raise money for local hospitals wonder why they are 
having bake sales while governments contemplate huge military 
expenditures.
<P>
	At the same time, Canadians recognize that the military 
represents jobs to some workers, careers to some scientists, 
profits to some business persons and local support to some 
politicians.
<P>
	In spite of the current question about the cost of our defence 
establishment, I do believe that most Canadians are truly proud 
of the peacekeeping function and the reputation we have for 
responding to trouble spots around the world. Very few realize 
that the cost of peacekeeping amounts to only about 2 per cent of 
that military budget they are concerned about.
<P>
	Canadians know that the end of the cold war and the 
emergence of tribalism have changed the nature of conflicts that 
have erupted since.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="366"> 366 </A></B>
<P>
	The realities that UN peacekeepers face today are different. 
Does that mean we should abandon our traditional honourable 
role? I think not. Rather I see a need to redefine and work 
through the most effective way to aid the innocent victims of 
violence.
<P>
<B>(2230) </B>
<P>
	We do not have to reinvent the wheel. Work has been ongoing 
by subcommittees of the House in the last Parliament and indeed 
by the Canadian Senate which published a report last year 
called: ``Canada's response to a new generation of 
peacekeeping''. I believe this work can serve as a common sense 
guide to future decisions.
<P>
	It is tempting to say: ``It is hopeless. Let's pull out'' or, on the 
other hand, to respond to the violence we see and say: ``Let's get 
tough. Let's increase our intervention through more troops and 
perhaps air strikes''. These are tempting suggestions.
<P>
	If we are truly peacekeepers we will recognize that violence 
begets more violence. If we are truly a peacekeeping nation we 
will follow the moderate course set out by the Senate with its 
step-by-step recommendations that indeed respond to most of 
the concerns raised in the Chamber today.
<P>
	Let us not back away from our tradition of moderation. It has 
served us well. Let us not be forced to an extreme position by a 
deadline. That happened much too often in the last Parliament in 
my view. Let us be the leaders in this field of international 
decision making.
<P>
	All members of the United Nations are fumbling in their 
attempts to respond to these ethnic wars. We can best serve our 
brothers and sisters in this global village by having a well 
thought out foreign policy which then guides our military 
activity.
<P>
	We are a new Parliament. Let us take the time required to 
develop a cohesive plan. Let us not abandon the vulnerable in 
Bosnia and let us not abandon our tradition of moderation in 
international relations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I enter this debate as the member for a riding and a 
region represented by people named Côté, D'Amour, Babin, 
Dumas, Gagnon, Grand'maison, Laliberté, Landry, Morel, 
Pelletier and Paré in the UN peacekeeping mission in Bosnia.
<P>
	Soldiers from the riding of Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup 
and Rimouski-Témiscouata are in Bosnia on a voluntary basis, 
with the Fusiliers du Saint-Laurent, of the Rivière-du-Loup 
and Rimouski garrison.
<P>
	The questions people ask themselves, especially the relatives 
and friends of the soldiers who represent Canada in this very 
complex international operation are: is the safety of our troops 
ensured? Is their role well-defined? When will they come back? 
In short, is it worth it?
<P>
	The question regarding the safety of our troops is an obvious 
one, especially since the operation in the former Yugoslavia is 
totally different from the previous ones in which the Canadian 
Armed Forces were involved.
<P>
	Indeed, maintaining peace like we did in Cyprus and like we 
are now doing in Croatia is very different from escorting 
humanitarian aid convoys and protecting Muslim areas, as is the 
case in Bosnia. Those are totally different operations.
<P>
	Moreover, the voluntary participation of militia members 
raises the issue of the role of the regular force and the militia in 
the context of international operations.
<P>
	In that regard, the government should take a close look at the 
recommendations made in 1993 by the Standing Senate 
Committee on Foreign Affairs.
<P>
<B>(2235) </B>
<P>
	This committee recommended providing our military with the 
kind of training that would prepare them for their role in 
international missions, by creating reserve units for logistics, 
transport and communications, that would be used for 
peacekeeping operations rather than strictly war-time 
operations.
<P>
	The issue of the security of our troops cannot be dissociated 
from the transparency and relevance of the mission with which 
they are entrusted. I believe that we have here the reason for the 
uncertainty among Quebecers and Canadians about the 
effectiveness of our operations in Bosnia. Canadian diplomacy 
which, in the past, has been instrumental in developing the 
image of Canada as a peacekeeper in the international 
community, would do well to learn from the past and return to a 
genuine defence of the cause of peace.
<P>
	I believe the mission in Bosnia should continue until 
negotiations are able to reach a settlement. However, it is 
important for our operations to contribute directly to resolving 
the crisis and above all to avoid perpetuating the current 
imbroglio.
<P>
	I wish to point out that the people in my riding support the 
Canadian government's involvement in international missions 
if there is evidence such operations are necessary, our troops are 
adequately prepared and our diplomatic efforts are effective, 
because the diplomatic front is also very important.
<P>
	The people in my riding, and especially the families of the 
soldiers involved, hope there will be no more of the uncertainty 
that arose as a result of the Prime Minister's comments that it 
might be appropriate to withdraw Canadian troops, comments 
he made in public on his last trip to Europe. Any statements on 
the subject should not be the kind of improvised remarks that 
raise doubts about the relevance of operations and their 
duration.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="367"> 367 </A></B>
<P>
	In the broader perspective of the current debate on our policy 
on peacekeeping operations, I would favour setting up a 
multinational force, with Canada contributing more specifically 
to the mission logistics, an area in which we have developed 
expertise and which would give us a defensive rather than an 
offensive mandate.
<P>
	I believe it would also be appropriate to table regularly a clear 
and detailed report on our participation in international 
missions.
<P>
	Finally, by giving our troops better instruction in the history, 
culture and traditions of the countries where they will be sent on 
peacekeeping operations, we can avoid situations of the kind we 
experienced in Somalia and also in the former Yugoslavia, 
where not knowing the customs of the country is a major source 
of friction and undermines the effectiveness of the operations of 
our troops.
<P>
	I want to thank you for your attention, and I would like to take 
this opportunity to commend those members of my riding who 
have volunteered to help resolve a crisis situation that requires 
patience, tact, a profound sense of history and, we might as well 
admit it, a little luck.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
extend my very best wishes as you confront the many challenges 
ahead in this 35th Parliament of Canada. I offer my personal 
congratulations on your election and appointment as Deputy 
Speaker.
<P>
<B>(2240 ) </B>
<P>
	I also extend my warmest appreciation to the many helpful 
members and staff of the House who provided assistance to me 
and my staff as we prepared to represent the constituents of my 
riding of Carleton-Charlotte. I am very proud to stand here 
today as their elected representative. I am humbled to have been 
honoured with their trust. It is with great enthusiasm that I look 
forward to working together with my colleagues in the House of 
Commons as we attempt to build a better tomorrow for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	On behalf of the constituents of Carleton-Charlotte I wish to 
recognize the many Canadian veterans for their distinguished 
service. There are many veterans and active duty servicemen 
and women from the Carleton-Charlotte riding who have 
served our nation with pride. These men and women have been 
instrumental in establishing our leadership role in United 
Nations peacekeeping efforts. It would be negligent and 
irresponsible for us to turn our backs quickly on these 
achievements and the fact that our servicemen and women 
continue to work to maintain this leadership role made possible 
by our distinguished veterans.
<P>
	After careful consideration of the many occasions where 
Canadian servicemen and women have fulfilled their 
peacekeeping obligations, I encourage my colleagues to 
recognize the many international successes they have achieved. 
They have successfully promoted international democracy 
while being recognized around the world as partners in peace.
<P>
	Canada is a peaceful nation which commonly provides 
humanitarian aid. Let us not lose sight of this priority. We may 
have to review our role with the United Nations. We may have to 
review concerns with our Canadian defence and foreign 
policies, but I hope we will continue to respond to the needs of 
troubled nations for many years to come.
<P>
	I respectfully request that my hon. colleagues give due 
priority to the most important concern of the day, and that is the 
safety and security of Canadian peacekeepers. When we are 
confronted with a threat to their security we must immediately 
protect Canadian servicemen and women and we must assure 
their families of their safe return.
<P>
	This is certainly not the first time, and I sincerely doubt it will 
be the last time, there has been a threat to the security of 
Canadian peacekeepers abroad. Although I would like to 
encourage the House to give due consideration to the defence 
and peacekeeping policies, I believe we must first protect those 
who made sacrifices for us all.
<P>
	Recent events in the former Yugoslavia have clearly 
demonstrated the importance of ensuring the protection and 
security of Canadian peacekeepers when considering future 
commitments. As many nations forge ahead in search of peace 
and democracy economic repression often causes hardships 
which require humanitarian aid. We must address these needs of 
our global neighbours with a sense of steward-like 
responsibility.
<P>
	As a partner in the effort to bring peace and democracy to the 
citizens of Bosnia-Hercegovina we must give consideration to 
this tragedy by continuing to provide humanitarian aid to those 
in need, not by professing to be an expert on this international 
crisis but by assuming a responsibility for our servicemen and 
women and for our role on the international stage as partners in 
peace.
<P>
<B>(2245) </B>
<P>
	While protecting Canadian interests we must also consider 
the interests of the citizens of the former Yugoslavia who are 
without security, electricity, food and water. If there remains a 
possibility of being a partner in this effort under more secure 
conditions, then we must continue on.
<P>
	We have the good fortune of being protected by the Canadian 
Armed Forces, one of the most respected and well-known 
peacekeeping forces in the world. We should recognize this 
good fortune by giving proper consideration to the advice of our 
military leaders. Perhaps it is time we stood behind those who 
stand  behind us. We should work with our military leaders to 
facilitate the protection of the Canadian peacekeepers so that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="368"> 368 </A></B>
<P>
they maintain our international responsibility and may complete 
their duties as assigned to them by the United Nations.
<P>
	The United Nations is an organization which contributes 
greatly to the development of the global community. We must 
continue to be a full partner within the organization and 
continue to maintain a positive relationship with our 
international neighbours.
<P>
	We must also continue to fulfil our leadership role in 
promoting the importance of the United Nations to the global 
community. We must encourage the United Nations to fulfil its 
responsibility to the international community and continue to 
promote peace and democracy while delivering aid to those in 
need.
<P>
	We can be proud of our historic relationship with our United 
Nations partners. If we intend to maintain our leadership role 
with the United Nations we must continue to uphold our 
peacekeeping and humanitarian responsibilities. We cannot 
expect the United Nations to do its part unless we are prepared to 
do ours.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, may I take this opportunity to congratulate you in 
your appointment to such a prestigious position. At your 
convenience would you please pass on my congratulations to the 
Speaker on his election to his position.
<P>
	It is a pleasure for me to speak to the debate on our 
participation in the Bosnia-Croatia situation and pay tribute to 
our fine soldiers who are serving in the UN and the role they 
play.
<P>
	Since 1949 our Canadian soldiers have acquitted themselves 
well at each and every opportunity where they have been asked 
to serve their country through the United Nations. It is my 
pleasure to hear so many members speak so highly of the quality 
of the Canadian soldiers who serve with valour and honour.
<P>
	Tonight we discuss and give legitimacy to our soldiers being 
in Bosnia-Hercegovina as part of the UN operations. Canadians 
did not have the opportunity to debate their soldiers being sent 
abroad potentially into harms way. For that I am pleased tonight 
to see that some legitimacy is now being given to them through 
the Government of Canada in this open debate.
<P>
	Two or three things have been brought forward in the debate. 
Most Canadians have taken great pride vicariously in the 
activities of our UN operations since their inception. The 
Canadians have been received warmly and fairly because of 
their even-handed approach to their duties in the UN.
<P>
	I have some concerns about Canadians serving in the UN and 
each operation and each after action report highlights the 
shortcomings of the United Nations.
<P>
<B>(2250 ) </B>
<P>
	The Security Council is quick to identify the need and 
requests volunteers. The operator is the Secretary-General for 
all operations of this type. When on UN operations or when 
decisions have to be made backtracking through the network to 
get to the Secretary-General is often necessary. It is often 
arduous and tedious to get a decision on what should take place, 
whether it is in the Golan Heights, the Sinai, in Katanga or 
whether it is now in Yugoslavia. We have seen two generals 
resign over the very same thing: the command and control of the 
operation.
<P>
	I would like to take a moment this evening to recommend that 
our government look to this as a future opportunity for our 
defence forces, whether they are sailors, soldiers or airmen that 
they will know they are going in on an operation that has a task 
force established at UN headquarters to plan the operation and 
the logistics on a permanent basis. That type of planning would 
put our soldiers at risk but would ensure that there is a chain of 
command, a logistic channel and that it is in place before the 
operation takes place. The present system of an ad hoc chain of 
command and logistic organization is not good enough.
<P>
	We have heard time and time again in the debate today 
whether we should be involved in the UN operations. We can 
participate fairly if the United Nations at the insistence of 
Canada establishes a permanent planning or task force 
headquarters as part of the Secretary-General's office.
<P>
	Presently we have Major General Maurice Baril as an advisor. 
That is certainly not enough liaison. Other countries have 
advisors. However, if we are going to be there, there must be a 
method of setting up standard operating procedures, methods of 
logistic support and command and control. I think our soldiers 
would feel much more comfortable. Canadians would feel much 
more comfortable that we were sending our troops into an 
organization that is established to handle them in an operational 
theatre and could give direct and quick response to a situation in 
that theatre.
<P>
	We know the UN lacks the human and technical resources at 
the moment. I hope our government will see fit in its future 
planning to recommend the establishment of such a task force 
and an operational headquarters to oversee such tasks as we have 
undertaken in Bosnia, certainly the humanitarian effort and the 
peacekeeping operation in Croatia.
<P>
	This task force would have a permanent operational staff to 
establish some form of standing operational procedures, both in 
the area of communications and operating techniques or tactics.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="369"> 369 </A></B>
<P>
	Such an international agency designed by the UN and under 
the control of the UN would go far to improve the facilitation 
and execution of the task of our soldiers and our country in 
undertaking the assignment by the UN.
<P>
	I will sum up by stating how proud I am of our Canadian 
troops. I am pleased to see how well they participated in the Gulf 
War, our sailors, soldiers and airmen.
<P>
	In the future I can see that as a major task for the Canadian 
forces as we extricate ourselves from the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization and possibly NORAD and focus our resources on

<P>
	<B>Mr. David Berger (Saint-Henri-Westmount):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before getting into the subject of the debate, I would 
like, in this first speech in this Parliament, to thank the voters of 
Saint-Henri-Westmount for their confidence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	With the enormous challenges facing Canada and the world, I 
am very privileged once again to represent 
Saint-Henri-Westmount in this House of Commons.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The question we ask ourselves today is whether Canadian 
soldiers should remain in Bosnia. Ultimately, this decision must 
be made by the government, after consulting our allies.
<P>
	To begin, I would like to mention that many reservists from 
several regiments in my riding have served in Bosnia and many 
are still there. These soldiers belong to the Royal Montreal 
Regiment and the Maisonneuve Regiment, among others. I wish 
to point out their courage and their desire to serve the cause of 
peace and I hope that they return safe and sound from their 
mission.
<P>
	Earlier today, the Minister of Foreign Affairs told us about 
some of the factors that the government will consider in making 
its decision.
<P>
	I believe that in the final analysis, there are good reasons for 
continuing our humanitarian mission. The United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees and the Red Cross have both 
confirmed that aid is arriving in spite of the difficulties. People 
who would have died without protection and international aid 
are still alive today.
<P>
	The international effort has also successfully prevented the 
conflict from spilling over into the neighbouring republics of 
Macedonia and Kosovo. Canada also has a long-term 
commitment to peacekeeping and international institutions like 
the United Nations.
<P>
	We contributed, we tried to contribute to European security 
when we took part in two world wars, in NATO and in the 
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.
<P>
	Since Canada's decision will probably influence other 
countries, we must ask ourselves if the international community 
has a role to play in Bosnia. I believe so, Mr. Speaker, for the 
reasons I just mentioned.
<P>
	Future peacekeeping missions will probably experience 
problems similar to those in Bosnia. Since Canadians have 
played a leading role in developing peacekeeping, we surely 
have a role in finding solutions for these problems.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Minister of Foreign Affairs said that one of the questions 
we must address is whether the danger to our troops outweighs 
the benefits of the mission. Like all Canadians and all members 
of this House, I would not want our troops to be exposed to 
needless risks and certainly they need to be able to defend 
themselves.
<P>
	There is uncertainty about the rules of engagement and 
command and control. But I would like to suggest that these are 
questions that should be debated in perhaps a more expert forum 
than on the floor of the House, in committee. The ultimate 
decision as to when the risks or the dangers outweigh the 
benefits must be left to the government and the military.
<P>
	Another important question we must address is whether there 
is a reasonable prospect for progress in the peace process as the 
minister mentioned. As I have said, one of the reasons for 
remaining in Bosnia is our desire to contribute to European 
security. I think Canadians would insist that there be a clear link 
between our role as peacekeepers and a place at the table. In fact 
Canada has had problems in getting the Europeans to the table. I 
understand it has been difficult even getting information about 
what is discussed at Geneva, let alone getting some input.
<P>
<B>(2300 ) </B>
<P>
	The House of Commons and the government should insist that 
our military role be accompanied by a diplomatic one. The 
international community has made serious mistakes in dealing 
with the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. One such mistake was 
the recognition of Croatia without considering the position of its 
Serbian minority which made up anywhere from 12 to 20 per 
cent of the population. While a ceasefire has been established in 
Croatia the threat of renewed war looms large.
<P>
	Bosnia also was an ethnically heterogeneous republic. 
Although some Bosnians lived in ethnically distinct areas, most 
did not. History and intermarriage had created an ethnic jigsaw 
puzzle. The Europeans, followed by the international 
community at large, also recognized Bosnian independence 
without considering the objections of its Serbian minority. 
Similarly, various attempts to  broker peace between the parties 
have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="370"> 370 </A></B>
<P>
revealed serious shortcomings. The Vance-Owen plan was 
criticized for rewarding Serbian aggression.
<P>
	The Washington agreement of May of last year which 
provided for so-called safe areas or enclaves was widely 
criticized in the western press for accepting ethnic cleansing and 
herding Muslims into small areas in which living conditions are 
horrible. The Owen-Stoltenberg plan to divide Bosnia into three 
ethnically pure states has also been widely criticized.
<P>
	I spoke yesterday with the former Yugoslav ambassador to 
Canada, Goran Kapetanovic. He is a Bosnian Muslim and today 
a refugee in Canada, a fellow with the Canadian Centre for 
Global Security here in Ottawa. He believes that international 
forces will not accomplish much in the absence of a viable plan 
or framework for peace. He believes the major drawbacks to 
solutions being negotiated at Geneva are that they accept the 
idea of ethnic purity and are partial solutions which do not 
address the problem that I referred to earlier of Croatia. All of 
the former Yugoslavia has to be dealt with in a settlement.
<P>
	The former ambassador asks how at the beginning of the 21st 
century the international community can accept introducing 
apartheid to Europe. What precedents would we be setting for 
future conflicts and for existing conflicts in eastern Europe? He 
believes that as a prerequisite to peace the UN Security Council 
must decide the pre-conditions of a viable peace. By way of 
example he suggests the following principles: that nothing can 
be achieved by violence; that refugees should be able to return to 
their homes; that people should be able to move freely and meet 
their family on one side or the other of borders, in essence that 
minority rights should be secured.
<P>
	These are principles which are upheld or which are spoken 
about pretty well every day of the week in the United Nations. It 
seems to make good sense to me that they form the basis of any 
peace proposal.
<P>
	I remarked earlier that Canadians see a clear link between 
their role as peacekeepers and a place at the diplomatic table. I 
urge the government to take up the challenge of assuming a 
greater role in seeking a negotiated solution to the conflict. As a 
successful multicultural country with a constitution that 
contains elaborate guarantees for minority rights, we Canadians 
have much to contribute.
<P>
	The government is launching a foreign policy review. In the 
context of that review I believe that the government should 
convene a meeting bringing together the best minds in the 
country to develop proposals to end the conflict.
<P>
	The world community needs leadership. Indeed it is crying for 
leadership. Let Canada provide that leadership.
<P>
<B>(2305 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I represent the 
constituency of Kitchener, an urban southwestern Ontario riding 
that possesses, like Canada itself, a diversity of industry and 
people.
<P>
	Like so many constituencies in this country it has been 
profoundly affected by events in Bosnia, the former Yugoslavia, 
today and was affected also in the past. In the summer of 1914 a 
shot was fired in Sarajevo and World War I began. Two years 
later in 1916 Berlin, Ontario, which was called Canada's 
German capital became Kitchener and Kitchener changed 
profoundly after that date. After 1945 Kitchener riding received 
thousands of immigrants and refugees from what was 
Yugoslavia.
<P>
	I take these examples to illustrate that nearly all Canadians 
were affected by those two terrible wars and those two terrible 
wars were concentrated in the area where we are looking at such 
carnage today.
<P>
	I think everyone in Canada took the same lesson from World 
War I or World War II and that was the notion that Canada's 
foreign and defence policy should have as its fundamental 
principle the notion that its national interest was best served by 
the construction of an international order based on law and 
strong multilateral institutions.
<P>
	From that commitment came Canada's major contribution to 
the world after 1945. This period which is known as Canada's 
golden age of diplomacy was marked by a strong Canadian 
commitment to the United Nations, and a belief that the cold war 
had created a special middle power role for Canada. Of course 
the best example of this was the role of Lester Pearson in the 
Suez crisis of 1956.
<P>
	It is often said that Pearson invented peacekeeping in 1956 but 
I think it is more properly said that he codified the procedures of 
peacemaking. The concept was simple and has been 
extraordinarily useful not simply for Canada and the United 
Nations but for the interests of world security.
<P>
	It was held by Pearson at that point that the UN should use the 
armed forces of nations that were not major powers and those 
nations should supervise peace settlements. Furthermore such 
supervision should be carried out with the consent of and 
through continuous negotiations with the parties in the dispute. 
This was a central character of peacemaking as it was defined in 
1956-1957.
<P>
	In fact Pearson was disappointed with the outcome of the 
negotiations in 1956 because there were limits on what Israel 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="371"> 371 </A></B>
<P>
and Egypt would accept. He had wanted more carefully defined 
terms and conditions but he was unable  to convince others, 
including the Secretary General at the time, that these 
arguments had validity.
<P>
	Ten years later, however, in 1967 we saw the validity of his 
arguments when the United Nations emergency force was forced 
to withdraw when the agreement made among Egypt, Israel and 
the United Nations did not hold.
<P>
	Canadians at the time who would express great pride in our 
peacemaking participation and tradition were bitterly 
disappointed and many then began to speak about Canada no 
longer being the helpful fixer, no longer going out and serving in 
peacekeeping missions.
<P>
	After the early successes, as in the Middle East, there had 
been a series of failures. It was not simply the United Nations 
emergency force in 1967 but also failures in Congo and to some 
extent a failure in Cyprus. We hear such sentiments today in 
similar circumstances and we need to remind ourselves that we 
faced such challenges to our peacekeeping commitment before.
<P>
	In the Saturday edition of the Kitchener-Waterloo <I>Record</I> 
Pam Goebel, a Kitchener native and a reserve army captain who 
had recently returned from Bosnia, described our work in these 
terms: ``It is a waste of soldiers' lives, a waste of taxpayers' 
money. Basically the soldiers feel they are keeping someone 
alive today so they can be killed tomorrow''.
<P>
	Captain Goebel's reaction is understandable and seems to be 
shared by many other Canadians. Bosnia has been an enormous 
tragedy not only for its own people but also for the United 
Nations, for NATO, and for us.
<P>
<B>(2310 ) </B>
<P>
	What happened with the end of the cold war is that the original 
concept of peacekeeping has been stretched far beyond its 
original concept and limits. First, the number of operations is so 
much larger than it was before. In fact, there has been, as we 
heard earlier today, as many UN peacekeeping operations after 
1989 than in the previous 43 years of the United Nations. Most 
of these have been successful, a few have not.
<P>
	Second, it has become clearer, as preceding members have 
suggested, that the United Nations is unable to meet the 
demands either physically, conceptually or financially.
<P>
	Third, and I think this is Canada's major difficulty with the 
new kind of peacekeeping, peacekeeping is no longer a middle 
power phenomenon. It is forgotten that in 1956 the peacekeepers 
who wanted to be there were the British and the French, who 
after all were the invading armies. It was Pearson's job to tell the 
British and the French that peacekeeping was not a job for great 
powers or for super powers, it had to be a job for middle powers. 
That definition held for many years. But after 1989 and the end 
of the tensions of the cold war, suddenly the question has to be 
asked: why are the great powers not there? Britain and France 
are, but of course Russia and the United States remain outside.
<P>
	All of these factors deeply influence our position in 
peacekeeping operations, but I do not think they change the 
basic precepts. We have participated in every peacekeeping 
operation but I do not think we can do so in the future. Our 
resources are limited, the missions are too many.
<P>
	As we have heard earlier from several speakers, the weakness 
of the existing UN structure suggests that it would be better for 
Canada to concentrate on efforts at preventive diplomacy rather 
than on peacekeeping itself. In the last few years I think it is fair 
to say that peacekeeping has dominated too much of our foreign 
policy agenda.
<P>
	Our skills and knowledge in this country are not simply 
military. Lester Pearson, after all, the father of peacekeeping, 
was a poor soldier but an outstanding diplomat.
<P>
	We should keep in mind that in Bosnia the mistakes that have 
been made were not made in Sarajevo but rather in New York 
and Washington and other European capitals.
<P>
	Canada at one time last year accounted for approximately 10 
per cent of the world's peacekeepers, even though our UN 
assessment was roughly 3 per cent. The United States, whose 
assessment is 25 per cent, arguably too high, had no soldiers 
participating under UN command in peacekeeping operations.
<P>
	We should impress upon the Americans the importance of 
accepting their responsibilities. It is not enough to issue idle 
threats of air strikes and pull back from the kinds of 
commitments to multilateralism that we heard the United States 
talking about two or three years ago. Indeed there are troubling 
signs in the United States that recent international events are 
leading to a resurgence of unilateralism and even isolationalism. 
That would be a tragedy for the world and especially, I think, for 
Canada.
<P>
	What then should we consider doing about Bosnia? We should 
recognize, above all, that we must do everything possible, 
politically and diplomatically, to bring an end to this terrible 
war. However we should not become embittered with the United 
Nations or relax our involvement with it.
<P>
	I would argue, as several other speakers have, that we should 
in fact devote more effort to strengthening that institution. It is 
not so much the United Nations that has failed but rather the 
European nations who failed to take responsibility as a regional 
entity with an event that has such terrible consequences in their 
own back yard.
<P>
	I also think that we should, as much as possible, try to make 
peacekeeping less of a national affair where individual military 
officers, whether Italian, Canadian or French, are identified as 
national officers rather than officers serving under the UN 
command. I think the previous government responded too 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="372"> 372 </A></B>
<P>
quickly to the glamour of peacekeeping and did not recognize 
the dangers that are so clear today.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the 
parliamentary secretary but his time is up.
<P>
<B>(2315) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to participate in this discussion. I 
only regret that it did not take place in the last Parliament prior 
to the sending of troops to the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	The Prime Minister ought to be commended for giving 
members of the House the opportunity to express their opinion 
individually as to Canada's role in the former Yugoslavia and in 
peacekeeping missions around the world.
<P>
	Parliament has been called upon today to consider the 
following statement:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note of the political, humanitarian and military 
dimensions of Canada's peacekeeping role, including in the former Yugoslavia, 
and of possible future direction in Canadian peacekeeping policy and operations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I have to say how impressed I have been listening to the 
debate take place today, especially with the quality of speeches 
from the new members of Parliament. It bodes well for the 
future direction of the House and the importance of individual 
members of Parliament.
<P>
	I had the opportunity to visit the former Yugoslavia before the 
conflict began. I cannot say how distressed I have been over the 
last several years to watch the constant bombardment of 
Dubrovnik and Croatia and the bombardment and the loss of life 
in Sarajevo. I cannot say how distressed I am as well to read 
about our Canadian troops being shot at and humiliated in 
Bosnia. Parliament has to come to grips with this issue and 
determine whether the risk involved and the cost of this mission 
warrant our continued participation.
<P>
	Canada has made a commitment to be there until April. We 
ought to discharge that commitment to April and not renew our 
commitment given the danger faced by our troops presently in 
that region. As has been pointed out by a number of speakers, 
there is no ceasefire in Bosnia. There is no peace and there is no 
desire for peace. There is no peace to keep. Therefore Canada is 
not discharging its traditional role of peacekeeper. It is clear that 
we are discharging a humanitarian responsibility there to ensure 
that much needed aid reaches distressed regions.
<P>
	In Croatia, Canada is playing its traditional role in keeping 
the peace in that region. I should note with interest that all 
members of Parliament of Croatian origin who have spoken in 
this discussion called for the withdrawal of troops from the 
former Yugoslavia. I found that rather interesting. I did not 
expect those individual members to be taking that position.
<P>
	In any event it is clear our troops in Croatia are serving an 
important function. There is no doubt our troops in Bosnia are 
serving an important function, but it is also true that the nature 
of the mandate is unclear. There has been a series of incidents 
that would suggest our troops are not safe.
<P>
	It is also clear that the cost of the mission is rather significant. 
There have been estimates of upward to a billion dollars having 
been spent in the last several years on this mission. The 
incremental cost is close to half a billion dollars.
<P>
	We have to be cognizant of the expense given the open-ended 
nature of the commitment some hon. members are suggesting. 
There is a clear consensus that the role of peacekeeping has 
changed and there is confusion of the exact role of Canadian 
troops in Bosnia.
<P>
	Canadians are justifiably proud of and committed to our 
tradition of peacekeeping. They are less sure about the current 
efforts of our troops in Bosnia because it is not a peacekeeping 
exercise. We ought to take note that a significant majority of 
Canadians in a poll that was released today expressed some very 
serious reservations about our continued involvement in Bosnia.
<P>
<B>(2320) </B>
<P>
	Canada has done its part over the years as has been pointed 
out. Canada has participated in every peacekeeping mission in 
the last 30 years. We have certainly done our part. We have 
contributed to the humanitarian cause in Bosnia and in other 
parts of the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	It is clear that a diplomatic resolution to the problem is not 
imminent. I do have concerns about the length of time that 
Canadian troops will be called upon to ``keep the peace'' in that 
particular region. It seems to me that the diplomats have failed 
at the UN in trying to achieve a peace there. It was clear three 
years ago there would be significant conflict.
<P>
	For those reasons I believe at the conclusion of our 
commitment in April we ought to bring our men and women 
back home. It is not to suggest that all peacekeepers, the British, 
the French and others, will withdraw. There is the assumption 
that if Canadians withdraw then other peacekeepers or UN 
forces will withdraw. That is certainly not clear.
<P>
	We have an obligation. We have discharged that obligation 
but we must recognize as well that there will continue to be 
conflicts all over the world. Are we suggesting that we ought to 
continue to participate in every conflict? There is so much we 
can do as a nation both fiscally and in terms of other 
commitments. I would call upon the government to continue our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="373"> 373 </A></B>
<P>
obligation until April and thereafter bring our men and women 
home.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a privilege to represent the people of Hamilton-Wentworth 
both in the House and in this debate. I must say too, as this is my 
maiden speech, that it is somewhat daunting to follow such 
eloquence as we have heard here for most of the day.
<P>
	I would like to convey to you, Mr. Speaker, and hon. members 
an anecdote that pertains to the debate we have heard in the 
House. I come from the village of Lynden, a rural community of 
some 500 in southern Ontario, which has always managed to 
send some of its sons and daughters to the great wars of this 
century.
<P>
	On the wall as one enters the village church there is a roll of 
honour commemorating those who died in the service of their 
country. The village also has a branch of the Royal Canadian 
Legion which over the years has served, especially on 
November 11, to keep alive the memory of those who were 
willing to defend their lives, not just for Canada but for what 
Canada stands for.
<P>
	Shortly before Christmas I attended a social at the legion 
centred on the giving out of service pins. The event was well 
attended for the branch is well supported in the community. 
What was unusual however was to see someone there who was 
actually on active service, to see the green uniform of today's 
Canadian forces. It was a young man in his early twenties named 
Chris Kivell. I talked to Chris whom I have known since he was a 
little boy. He had just been accepted into the Canadian forces, 
into the artillery. He was following in the footsteps of his 
grandfather, Owen Kivell, who had served in the navy during the 
second world war. Owen had survived the torpedoing of a ship in 
the north Atlantic. Young Chris looked very fine in his new 
uniform which he wore with pride.
<P>
	Nevertheless I asked if he was not scared about the prospect of 
being sent to a hot spot like Bosnia and he said that he was. He 
had talked to other young men who had been there and who had 
recited the frustrations and dangers. Then he said to me 
suddenly, perhaps remembering that I was an MP: ``But, Mr. 
Bryden, don't let them pull the Canadian troops out of Bosnia. 
We want to be there''. I have since had time to reflect on his 
comment. A whole generation separates us so I cannot be sure 
that I am reading his feelings accurately. However I know my 
village. I know the people in it. I know the values he grew up 
with.
<P>
<B>(2325 ) </B>
<P>
	My conclusion is that Canada has a fine military tradition 
both francophone and anglophone going right back to the French 
and British struggles of the 18th century. In the 20th century in 
the Boer War, the Great War and World War II, Canadian 
soldiers both French and English speaking incurred the 
admiration even of their enemies for their bravery and devotion 
at Dieppe, at Normandy and during the liberation of Europe.
<P>
	In the post-war years the Canadian forces became specialists 
at peacekeeping. Again our Canadian soldiers garnered the 
admiration of the world for their firmness, their bravery and 
their non-partisan ability to keep warring parties apart. The 
book perhaps has yet to be written that fully describes their 
accomplishments but the world knows. Canada and 
peacekeeping: that is the legacy that has been created by 
Canada's soldiers over the past 40 years.
<P>
	Now the world is a darker and more threatening place. The 
breakup of federated nations like the former Soviet Union and 
former Yugoslavia has unleashed hatreds that go back centuries. 
Peacekeeping as we used to know it is all but impossible in these 
terrible tribal conflicts. The hate runs deep and it has no respect 
for women and children.
<P>
	Our soldiers in Bosnia are there for humanitarian reasons 
only. At the risk of their lives they are there to guarantee that 
people be fed. The UN intervention has saved hundreds of 
thousands from starvation. Canada is an essential part of that 
intervention. Canadian soldiers have died in Bosnia. Others 
have been injured but thousands of people, mainly women, 
children and the elderly, have been saved.
<P>
	I submit that the international role of Canada's military has 
advanced rather than regressed, advanced at least in spirit. 
Instead of fighting to win wars and instead of fighting to prevent 
wars now in Bosnia we are simply fighting to save lives. Is there 
a nobler purpose for a soldier? I think not.
<P>
	I look across the floor in the direction of members of Bloc and 
Reform. I was most impressed by the compassionate content of 
their remarks during the debate. Their comments reveal that no 
matter what separates us in ideology, no matter what separates 
us in history going back to Lord Durham's report or to the Plains 
of Abraham, we are united in our desire as Canadians. Call us 
what us what you will, Saskatchewaners, BCers, Acadians or 
Quebecers, we are united in our desire to rescue those in the 
world who are defenceless, those who are hurt and hungry.
<P>
	Let us not be deflected from doing what is right because of 
opinion polls. The trouble with always doing what a majority 
seems to want is that majorities can sometimes be poorly 
informed. There is no regular news coverage of the Canadian 
forces in Bosnia. Their story is not being told by the Canadian 
media. We cannot judge the Canadian situation in Bosnia by 
watching CNN or reading a newspaper. We must therefore take 
guidance from the only people who really know, who are right 
on the spot: our own soldiers, the Vandoos and the Princess Pats 
for instance. They believe in what they are doing. We on all sides 
of the House should be very proud of them.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a great honour for me to rise in the House to 
represent the citizens of Fredericton-York-Sunbury. It 
humbles me when I consider just how many people will be 
affected by the outcome of the government's decision around 
this debate.
<P>
<B>(2330 ) </B>
<P>
	As this is my first opportunity, Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate you on your appointment. I also wish to pay tribute 
to the Hon. Milton Gregg, the last member of both my riding and 
my party to be in this House. He was a representative of the 
government of the day and won the Victoria Cross in the Second 
World War.
<P>
	I would also like to pay tribute to my immediate predecessor, 
Mr. Bud Bird. Mr. Bird has long served our region with dignity 
and diligence.
<P>
	Finally I would like to note the recent passing of my Reform 
Party opponent. Jack Lamey was a worthy representative of his 
party. On behalf of all the residents of the riding I express 
sympathy to his wife Addie and the family.
<P>
	CFB Gagetown, the largest military training base in Canada 
and by land mass the largest base in the Commonwealth, lies 
within my riding. I am sure members of this House can 
appreciate the significance of this debate for the people of 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury in general and for the people of 
CFB Gagetown in particular.
<P>
	It is one thing to be concerned for family and friends serving 
in dangerous circumstances halfway round the world. It is 
appreciably worse when that risk is not accompanied by a clear 
sense of purpose or measure of effectiveness.
<P>
	Hopefully this debate will serve to clarify Canada's position 
on the role of our country and others within the UN 
peacekeeping forces generally and in Bosnia-Hercegovina in 
particular.
<P>
	I should say that we in Fredericton-York-Sunbury are 
pleased with the government's decision to have this debate. I 
would also like to commend the other parties and their leaders 
for both their co-operation and their participation. Their early 
intervention did much to establish the tone for this debate and I 
am certain Canadians will find it refreshing to know that we 
want to get things accomplished.
<P>
	As I acknowledged earlier, constituents within my riding are 
particularly interested in this debate because so many of CFB 
Gagetown have, are, or probably will participate in 
peacekeeping engagements.
<P>
	In light of this level of concern I wanted to ensure that I did 
not deal with the situation superficially. Sunday night I met with 
a number of interested parties wanting to advise me of their 
concerns. Participants ranged from former peacekeepers, one of 
whom was stationed in Sarajevo, students from the region 
attending the  University of New Brunswick, and others of the 
public who had called or written to express concerns.
<P>
	Of particular note, we received a detailed presentation on a 
situation in Bosnia from a member of the military recently 
stationed in that region. I would like to thank Lieutenant 
Colonel Yann Hidiroglou, the deputy commander of the United 
Nations military observers, for his thoughtful and 
comprehensive briefing.
<P>
	It was repeated throughout the meeting that the debate 
surrounding the situation in Bosnia has become too polarized. 
Arguments are generally aligned at one of two ends. Canada 
must be in Bosnia under any or all circumstances, or we must 
remove our troops because the situation is either too dangerous, 
too costly, or ineffective.
<P>
	We must work together to find a more moderate middle 
ground solution. There are no easy answers but in identifying 
the balance we need to consider what the consequences could be 
if we decided to remove our troops entirely. We are after all 
citizens of the world.
<P>
	We must recognize the possibility that a withdrawal might 
only be temporary. Troops might have to intervene again under 
conditions far worse than those that currently exist. As well, it is 
clear that our troops are able to get humanitarian aid through to 
those in need. The UN Commission for Refugees and the Red 
Cross are both on record as having stated that the food is getting 
through.
<P>
	What about our international reputation? If the UN withdraws 
what impact will this have on future peacekeeping operations? 
Would this make it politically impossible for governments to 
keep forces in foreign regions? In the same vein how do we want 
to be remembered by history? We must consider what the 
scenario might be if we were not involved in Bosnia.
<P>
	I believe a balance must be struck in order to achieve our 
desired middle ground. That balance begins with the 
recommitting of our troops. We must however recommit as a 
government that is willing to improve conditions for the men 
and the women on the ground.
<P>
	I see a number of ways we can accomplish this goal. First, 
Canada as a country has great credibility as a nation of peace and 
peacekeeping. I believe we should rely on our knowledge and 
reputation in these areas and call upon other countries, many of 
which have closer ties than we with the belligerents to launch an 
appeal to warring factions and seek diplomatic solutions.
<P>
<B>(2335 ) </B>
<P>
	We must also review the criteria under which we have 
committed our troops and make amendments where possible to 
improve conditions, again calling upon our historical reputation 
and record. People are uncertain about our role in Bosnia, our 
purpose for participating and the value of the exercise. We need 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="375"> 375 </A></B>
<P>
to bring clarity to the situation and let people know everything 
which can be done is actually being done.
<P>
	I conclude by stating that we need to recommit our troops to 
their involvement in Bosnia but not necessarily under present 
conditions. We must also commit to ensuring members of the 
military are properly and adequately trained, that UN field 
operations are politically supported by member nations. We 
must commit to provide the support needed to reduce risk.
<P>
	As well both the government and the military need to 
communicate their purpose and decisions clearly so that 
everyone is aware of the objectives for both our troops in Bosnia 
specifically and UN forces generally. We will be holding future 
debates about Canada's military and peacekeeping roles. It is 
my hope that the precedent has been established for these 
debates.
<P>
	I salute forces both now and in the past which served Canada 
for what will soon be 50 years in the area of peacekeeping. I also 
salute the families and friends of those involved in 
peacekeeping missions. I am sure they join me in 
acknowledging the excellence of our Canadian troops. Their 
excellence is why Canada's role in Bosnia is so critical.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am indeed honoured to address the 
House today on behalf of the riding of Etobicoke-Lakeshore. I 
think the people of Etobicoke-Lakeshore will join me in this 
debate and in the expression of congratulations to you, Mr. 
Speaker, as well as to the Prime Minister for providing the 
opportunity for debate.
<P>
	Peacekeeping is an activity Canada does as a country. It is an 
activity which gives us world-wide respect and makes us all 
proud to be Canadians.
<P>
	Canadian soldiers have been involved in every United Nations 
peacekeeping operation since 1947. We have sent 
approximately 90,000 men and women to war-torn countries 
around the world. Peacekeeping and peacekeepers have 
represented us in areas like Korea in the 1950s; Egypt, 1954; the 
Congo, 1960-64; Nigeria, 1968-70; Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia 
in the early 1970s; Iran in the late 1980s; and in many Latin 
American countries between 1989 and 1992.
<P>
	Canadian peacekeepers are currently in El Salvador, Cyprus, 
the western Sahara, Angola, Iraq, Kuwait, Afghanistan, 
Pakistan, India, Korea and Cambodia. Of course they are 
currently involved in the former Yugoslavia. There are some 
4,700 Canadian men and women with United Nations 
peacekeeping operations around the world. They comprise 
approximately 10 per cent of all peacekeepers on duty.
<P>
	We greatly value our peacekeepers and take pride in our 
peacekeeping activities. We treat that very seriously. Obviously 
we have very practical reasons for being involved. Canada can 
prosper only if we are living in a stable and reliable world 
environment. I think most Canadians believe that peacekeeping 
is a valued activity. We had two Nobel peace prizes awarded, 
one to the late  Lester B. Pearson and the other to the 
peacekeepers in 1988.
<P>
	Given the international importance of Canada's peacekeeping 
efforts I would like to briefly discuss my two main concerns: 
first, the priorities in terms of financing; and second, 
peacekeeping in this international context.
<P>
	One of the concerns many have with peacekeeping is that 
Canadian peacekeepers be properly outfitted for the dangerous 
situations they often encounter.
<P>
<B>(2340 ) </B>
<P>
	This means that the equipment should be fully functional. 
They should have access to proper facilities and have adequate 
protection. All of this, of course, requires financial support.
<P>
	The second concern I have is international commitment. If we 
as Canadians decide it is a priority for us to remain involved in 
peacekeeping, we must encourage collective, responsible action 
through the United Nations. I hope we would encourage other 
United Nations members to pay up their UN dues, to commit 
troops, to provide logistical and technical support and to honour 
UN resolutions.
<P>
	Canadians cannot do it alone as we have seen in Bosnia where 
replacement troops for Canadians are not allowed to relieve our 
peacekeepers. We need a strong United Nations to which 
countries pledge, not only in word but in financial support, 
troops and technical terms.
<P>
	Peacekeeping is one area in which we service the world. I 
sincerely hope we continue to do so. However, I only want us to 
continue to do so if we provide our peacekeepers with the 
necessary equipment to protect themselves while performing 
their duties as well as securing that stronger international 
commitment.
<P>
	We live in a global village. We have our responsibilities in 
that global village.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
please allow me, on behalf of Winnipeg North, to echo the 
sentiments of those who have risen in this House and 
congratulated you on your appointment as Deputy Speaker, and 
also to the Prime Minister, the Right Hon. Jean Chrétien, and our 
fellow members.
<P>
	I would also like to seize this opportunity to thank the 
constituents of Winnipeg North for their renewal of confidence 
in last fall's election. It is a testament to this new Liberal 
government's commitment to seek the input of its citizens on 
matters of foreign policy that we begin in the early life of this 
Parliament with a very public debate on peacekeeping.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="376"> 376 </A></B>
<P>
	At a time when citizens are increasingly concerned about 
domestic issues, it is pertinent to ask a fundamental question 
about our involvement in expensive and potentially dangerous 
peacekeeping missions abroad. Why are we there? Why indeed 
are we taking an interventionist approach to problems and 
conflicts which ostensibly lie thousands of miles away in places 
most Canadians have never even seen?
<P>
	Why, with the magnitude of economic and social problems 
facing all Canadians, are we giving the issue of international 
peacekeeping even a cursory glance? Why, of course, is a valid 
question.
<P>
	I propose to offer some very compelling answers. I would 
encourage fellow members on all sides of the House to share 
these answers with their constituents.
<P>
	First, to those who would question what benefits our 
peacekeeping missions abroad hold for Canada, we must 
reinforce the idea that Canada is not an island. Rather, we hold a 
privileged position as a world leader in international diplomacy. 
We carry the torch of Lester B. Pearson's legacy, a legacy which 
poses no ultimatum but patience in the search for peace.
<P>
	If we fail to settle conflicts and unrest abroad, those problems 
by extension become our own. Conflicts overseas could, if left 
unchecked over time, expand to engulf our own nation. Indeed, 
it is in our national interest to be involved in peacekeeping 
missions abroad. However, national self-interest alone 
represents only one aspect of the need for our continued 
involvement in peacekeeping.
<P>
<B>(2345 ) </B>
<P>
	I submit to my fellow members that there is a noble interest at 
stake here. Our humanitarian mission in the former Yugoslavia 
alone directly benefits 2,750,000 residents of that war torn 
nation who would have no other means of survival in the face of 
such appalling conditions. These invaluable relief efforts are 
best pursued by a team of nations, which is why a renewal of our 
participation in the United Nations forces in that part of the 
world and elsewhere is essential, to my mind.
<P>
	Other nations may waver, but I believe Canada should 
continue to reassert its commitment to independent foreign 
policy. I am confident that this government will not waver.
<P>
	Allow me to call to the attention of fellow members what I 
feel may be a vital omission in our peacekeeping policy. It is the 
failure to communicate to citizens the many benefits of these 
operations particularly at a time when domestic issues threaten 
to consume us. Successful efforts seldom make headlines the 
way disasters do. Perhaps that is why an Angus Reid poll 
released this week indicates that six in ten Canadians support a 
withdrawal of Canadian troops from Bosnia. I cannot help but 
wonder whether the figure would be different if citizens were 
given a different look at the humanitarian function our overseas 
troops are performing.
<P>
	Recently we saw on TV and in the print media the photo of an 
empty wooden sled on a patch of blood-covered snow in 
Sarajevo, a symbol of the horror and futility of war. We witness 
by way of the media the slaughter of civilians in their homes, the 
massacre of women, the senseless killing of children in the 
playgrounds, the bombing of hospitals and photos of entire 
village populations deprived of food and clothing. When we 
witness these human indignities we agonize and our hearts are 
torn. When this happens these horrors of war assume immediate 
proximity.
<P>
	In conclusion, peacekeeping missions are the ultimate 
challenge to our nation's soul and how we respond to this 
challenge will reflect our national conscience. The lives of these 
people in that part of the world are in our hands.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There are three speakers left. They are 
the members for Waterloo, Scarborough West and 
Victoria-Haliburton. I wonder if they would agree to divide 
their time since it is so late. Would five minutes each be all 
right? You can blame the whip if you do not like the order you 
have on the list. The member for Victoria-Haliburton is first.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton):</B> Thank you, Mr. 
Speaker, I will keep my comments as brief as I can.
<P>
	It is with great pleasure that I rise tonight and for the first time 
speak in the greatest forum of our country. I further wish to 
express my thanks to the people of Victoria-Haliburton who 
sent me here and instilled confidence in me to do my best.
<P>
	The matter we are discussing today is one that is of concern to 
all Canadians. This discussion is long overdue and I thank the 
Prime Minister for this opportunity.
<P>
	Peacekeeping has long been viewed as a made in Canada 
concept, which is understandable since former Prime Minister 
Lester Pearson developed the program and subsequently was 
awarded the Nobel peace prize for his efforts. Canada has long 
been a vocal and active supporter of organizations for 
international stability and order and now has in the area of 2,300 
troops stationed around the world in various peacekeeping 
operations.
<P>
	For the most part, these operations have been peaceful. 
However, more and more often violent encounters are occurring 
in day to day peacekeeping. The role of peacekeeping is 
changing.
<P>
<B>(2350) </B>
<P>
	In today's debate we must be careful about what is being 
discussed. We can easily dismiss peacekeeping by saying that 
we must get our troops out of dangerous peacekeeping areas. 
However this sort of thinking is short-sighted.
<P>
	We must expand our discussions and ask what we want our 
peacekeepers to do. We must develop a clear and concise 
mandate for our peacekeepers. Are we committing troops to a 
<P>

<B><A NAME="377"> 377 </A></B>
<P>
peacekeeping operation because Canada has never refused to 
commit troops to a UN operation, or do we commit because it is 
in the best  interests of Canada to have a presence in a particular 
operation?
<P>
	We must think of our financial situation and come to terms 
with the implications of a shrinking defence budget and how it 
might affect our participation in future peacekeeping 
operations. Furthermore, when we do commit our troops to an 
operation we must ensure they have the proper equipment and 
training to address whatever situation may arise in that 
operation.
<P>
	Although we are somewhat isolated here from the realities of 
peacekeeping, we owe it to those who are risking their lives in 
frightening situations that they have the best equipment and 
training available to adequately protect themselves and to 
ensure the operation is carried out with success for Canada.
<P>
	I did have 21 pages, but I have condensed it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West):</B> Mr. Speaker, there 
are five very brief points I want to make. The motion we are 
debating today asks us to take into account the political, 
humanitarian and military dimensions of the possible future 
direction in Canadian peacekeeping policy and operations.
<P>
	The five points I wish to commend to our government and to 
the minister are as follows:
<P>
	First, Canada is a small country comparatively speaking, with 
limited resources. As such we cannot act alone. We do know 
however that there is strength in unity. We can support each 
other. Therefore, we must in my view maintain our membership 
in international organizations, including the United Nations and 
NATO.
<P>
	Second, we must work to cleanse the hypocrisy of these 
organizations. What do I mean by that? Contrast the swift action 
of the coalition forces in the gulf and the billions upon billions 
of dollars spent in the gulf in a very short period of time with the 
inaction in Yugoslavia where children are being killed daily, 
with the inaction in East Timor where Roman Catholics are 
being slaughtered by Muslim extremists, and the inaction in 
Tibet where China is committing cultural genocide against the 
people of Tibet. What about the countries in Africa where tribes 
are slaughtering each other by the tens of thousands? These 
organizations are doing nothing in these tragic places.
<P>
	Third, we must continue to speak out forthrightly and 
forcefully on behalf of human rights, dignity and the inherent 
worth of all human life.
<P>
	Fourth, we must lend our military expertise and reputation 
where warranted. We cannot be in all places at all times.
<P>
	Fifth, our military are in the business of warfare. They know 
the risks. They have chosen their profession. But we cannot ask 
our military to put their lives on the line unless we are prepared 
to ensure they are adequately equipped, supplied and supported. 
As we would not send our children into a full contact hockey 
game dressed only in pyjamas, we cannot send our sons and 
daughters into the world's most dangerous and volatile areas 
without proper protection, training and equipment. Anything 
less is irresponsible. Anything less is indefensible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo):</B> Mr. Speaker, I really 
appreciate this day of having gone through the whole Chamber 
and come down to the last speaker, being me. We are going to be 
out of here before midnight.
<P>
	I represent the federal riding of Waterloo made up of the 
township of Woolwich, Waterloo and a part of Kitchener. We are 
the home of Project Ploughshares at Conrad Grebel College, as 
well as a Centre for Conflict Resolution. Of course we have a 
very strong Mennonite base. The Mennonite community is 
strongly involved in assisting people in other countries in time 
of crisis.
<P>
<B>(2355 ) </B>
<P>
	When we look at our country, when we listen to speakers and 
when we see the background we have in the Chamber, we are like 
a little United Nations. I cannot help but reflect that we 
represent very much a beacon of hope to a troubled world.
<P>
	One person in my riding, a Dr. Elmasry, is a professor at the 
University of Waterloo. He is an active member of a number of 
human rights organizations. He wrote in his presentation, an 
article that he sent to me, that the overwhelming fact that 
confronts the moral fabric of the post cold war era was that the 
world aggression in Bosnia-Hercegovina was a war of 
genocide. The second important fact was that there was no 
decisive international will to stop the genocide. The holocaust 
prescription never again became meaningless. In this pathetic 
moral desert the European Community and its security and 
human rights concerns have become severely tarnished.
<P>
	I received some quite important communications from some 
grades six, seven and eight students. It is important to me in my 
personal circumstances. In 1956 when Canada embarked on its 
peacekeeping mission at Suez I was a nine-year old boy in 
Hungary and the Hungarian revolution was going on. I do so 
very well recall Hungarians felt so abandoned when the Suez 
crisis took over. Somehow we felt that a right to 
self-determination of the Hungarians was sacrificed on the altar 
expediency on the Suez campaign.
<P>
	The students who wrote to me were in a group called the 
Urgent Action Team at St. Agnes Elementary School in 
Waterloo. JoAnne Thorpe is their parent volunteer who works 
with them. One letter was written by a student, Cheryl Feeney:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><A NAME="378"> 378 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In Bosnia they are crushing the skulls of children and slitting the throats of the 
women and shooting the men as they try to defend their family.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Celene Krieger states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am sure that you heard about what is happening in Bosnia, like wars, death 
and many innocent people dying, being raped just because of their religion. The 
most horrifying thing is that many of these people are children.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Beckey Curran states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I believe that Canada should help in peacemaking. I know that some people say 
we should take care of our own problems before we take care of others. That may 
be true but we take our freedom for granted and we should realize how it would be 
if our own country was not free and we were at war.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The letters go on. I guess I am touched by the serious tone of 
the letters and the fact that our young people have so ingrained 
in themselves that one of the great roles of Canada in this world 
is peacekeeping and peacemaking.
<P>
	I was speaking to Ernie Regehr about Project Ploughshares 
and I asked him: ``What is your prescription to the problem?'' 
One of the points he made was that unless there were people in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina, unless there are witnesses to human 
suffering, unless there are people who are ready to assist with 
the human suffering, we will never know what has gone on there. 
We will never know what will continue to go on there. In some 
ways the actions of the Europeans and the United Nations in 
putting the arms embargo in place have left the Muslims of the 
region defenceless.
<P>
	As Canadians, one of the stronger proponents of the United 
Nations, we must try to establish international law and to fight 
against lawlessness. It is generally accepted that if there is 
anything that unites us as a country this is one of the issues. We 
cannot do it all. We have to work through strengthening the role 
of the United Nations. We have to make the commitment that we 
will stand together with the democracies of this world to make 
sure that law, order and self-determination will prevail.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Hon. members will be interested to 
know that the hon. member for Waterloo was the 50th speaker 
we have had today in a debate that the member for Labrador said 
earlier was the best debate we have heard here in 24 years.
<P>
	It is my duty to say that it being almost midnight. Pursuant to 
the order made earlier this day the House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at two o'clock p.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 11.59 p.m.)
